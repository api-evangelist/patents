In particular, this invention describes damage-resistant personal transport vehicles.","Currently deployed armored personnel carriers are designed to ferry members of the armed services from a staging area to an engagement zone at which hostile enemy action can be encountered. Such troops may disembark from their carrier to conduct their mission. Under select circumstances, a small unit of uniformed personnel may be assigned to investigate a cluttered (e.g., urban) setting in which enemy combatants may be concealed. Such personnel may be dangerously exposed thereby to hostile crossfire.","Conventional personnel carriers yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Such carriers provide minimal protection from hostile attack after egress therefrom, beyond fire support. A self-propelled delivery mechanism that provides armor and weapons for infantry can aid in close-quarter combat. In particular, a spherical armored mobile platform (SAMP) is provided herein as a transport for a person into a militarily hostile environment.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a spherical armored mobile platform (SAMP) for at least one operator to enable protected entry and egress from a militarily hostile environment. The SAMP includes a spherical shell, an armored cockpit and a set of wheels. The spherical shell has inner and outer surfaces and features a plurality of cavities that extend therethrough. The cockpit houses a seat, a guidance controller, a display console, and an electric motor connected to a power supply. The cockpit is contained within said shell. The seat is designed to receive the operator.","In various exemplary embodiments, the wheels are driven by the motor and structurally supported by the cockpit. The wheels engage the inner surface and turn in response to the motor. The cavities are disposed within three-sided boundaries of a geodesic dome. The SAMP can further include a plurality of optical sensors disposed on the cockpit, and a signal integrator to present temporally concatenated visual signals into a mosaic at the display console. The SAMP includes a steering mechanism that turns orientation direction of the fore lower and aft upper wheels.","In various exemplary embodiments, the SAMP can also include a projectile-firing gun mounted to the cockpit, and a trigger control to enable actuation of the gun in response to the projectile exiting the sphere at an instance that coincides with a cavity of the plurality of cavities. The SAMP includes a door on the cockpit that slides between first open and closed positions, and a hatch on the sphere that hinges between second open and closed positions.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments of the spherical armored mobile platform (SAMP) are described with reference to the drawings. The SAMP provides concentric shells, the inner to provide protective armor for an occupant, and the outer to enable self-propelled locomotion along a terrain. The spherical armored mobile platform for single operator navigation (SAMPSON) represents a preferred embodiment of the SAMP. The SAMPSON provides room for a single occupant as driver, navigator, and weapons operator from inside the inner shell or cockpit.","The SAMP includes an outer spherical shell (or roller ball) that includes through-cavities and an inner shell (or cockpit) that provides armor protection. The roller ball forms a hollow sphere. The cockpit forms a hollow oblate spheroid. Between the shells are upper and lower wheel chasses. The cockpit has an aft hatch that slides forward. The roller ball has at least two hatches that open outward. The cockpit includes a reclined seat, an instrument display and a control unit. The SAMP can incorporate firing weapons, such as the M2 Browning Machine Gun (BMG) that fires 50 caliber rounds, and the M240 (or earlier M60) machine gun that fires 7.62\u00d751 mm NATO cartridges.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 through 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","110","120","130","140","150","160","170","110","200","210","220","230","240","250","300","310","230","330","400","410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["500","510","530","600","700","710","170","720","240","730","330","700","740","745","750","760","770","780","790"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B","FIGS. 9C through 9F","FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"b":["800","810","820","900","910","920","930","940","950"]},"In , the starboard view  shows a SAMPSON (or mobile platform)  containing a cockpit  that defines an interior . A reclined seat or couch is disposed within the cockpit interior  along the longitudinal direction parallel to the axial centerline . The couch includes a back brace , a seat  and a leg rest  with which to support an operator . The interior  further includes a display console  that provides an instrument monitor  (in ), a guidance unit  with joystick , oxygen supply tanks , electric motor , and package  that contains batteries and motor controller.","The console  provides storage space is disposed forward of the operator  and provides storage volume for electronics. The instrument monitor  can provide visual information for navigation and weapons targeting, as well as indicators for hatch orientation, battery status, vehicle speed, navigational position, motor torque, etc. The console  provides the control system from which the operator  provides instructions through the joystick  (and\/or additional or alternate input devices, such as foot pedals, steering yoke, etc.) for locomotion and weapons discharge. The breathing tanks  (e.g., scuba) support an optional breathing apparatus for the operator  for circumstances in which the interior  is sealed from outside to protect against chemical-biological warfare (CBW) agents. Alternatively, ventilation ports can be incorporated through the cockpit .","The motor  can be a direct current (DC) motor, for example, such as used for electric automobiles that run at 96 volts or 192 volts. Alternatively, the motor  can be an alternating current (AC) motor, for example, a three-phase motor operating at 240 volts. The motor  may optionally be connected to radiation fins to improve heat dissipation.","The package  can include a controller to provide proper voltage to the motor  from a battery supply. Electrical storage can be obtained, for example, from linked 2200-series Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) cells provided by SR Batteries Inc. at Box 287, Bellport N.Y. 11713. Each cell has a 0.9 inch (23 mm) diameter and 1.69 inch (43 mm) length weighing 2.1 oz (60 g) producing 1.25 volts at 2.2 amp-hours and with 5\u03a9 impedance. These NiCad cells can be concatenated in series as provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/447,514 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,767,335 in assembly units of 350 volts or 700 volts. Power storage may be augmented transferring braking force to an optional flywheel to recharge the battery.","The 350-volt unit has dimensions of 15.3 inches\u00d713.3 inches\u00d78 inches (389 mm\u00d7338 mm\u00d7203 mm) and weighs 65 lb (30 kg) composed of eight trays linked in series, with each tray containing thirty-five cells. This can produce electrical energy of 350 (volts)\u00d72.2 (amp-hrs)=770 Watt-hrs=2.77 megaJoules (MJ) or 1.03 horsepower-hour (hp-hr). The 700-volt assembly may combine two 350-volt units with the third dimension being doubled. Assuming peak current of \u221230 amps from each 350-volt unit, available power is estimated at \u221221 kW (or \u221228 hp). Alternate battery configurations can also be contemplated for power supply purposes. For example, the Chevrolet\u00ae Volt (with release expected in year 2010) incorporates lithium-ion batteries from LG Chem Ltd. that hold 12 kWh (43.2 MJ or 16.1 hp-hr) of charge and weigh 375 lb (170 kg), which enables travel of up to forty miles without recharge for a vehicle weighing a projected 3140 lb (1430 kg).","The SAMPSON's center of gravity can be adjusted by translatable trim ballast  that controllably slides along at least one interior rail . (Alternatively, such ballast can be contained within the console .) Preferably, the trim ballast  either travels parallel to the axial centerline  or comprises a complimentary and independently controllable pair of masses and slider mechanisms disposed along the port and starboard sides of the cockpit . The trim ballast  can be moved and set manually for park positioning or automatically by a drive mechanism to facilitate acceleration of the mobile platform . By shifting the trim ballast  forward, torque demand from the motor  may be reduced, enabling the mobile platform  to move forward and\/or to clear a ground obstacle.","The cockpit  is contained by an oblate spheroid shell  that includes an access door  equipped with a handle  that extends both into the interior  and external to the spheroid . As depicted herein, the door  is disposed towards the aft starboard side and opens by sliding forward along racers . Similarly, the trim ballast  may traverse along external rails , such as along the top of the spheroid , either in substitution of or in addition to the interior rails . Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that alternate arrangements and bilateral geometries that fit into the outer shell may be contemplated without departing from the invention's scope.","Bars  extend from beyond continuous travelling positions of the door  to support a medium machine gun  (e.g., M60) that fires 7.62 mm rounds. The gun  includes an annular optical view-sight  for sighting from within the ball. Optical sensors  may be disposed along the exterior of the spheroid  for viewing external environmental conditions from within the ball. The sensors  can be miniature digital video cameras. Such a camera can detect photons with a charge-coupled device (CCD) array, for example.  shows brackets  that mount an M2 BMG  with an annular optical view-sight .","As presented for the one-person mobile platform , the cockpit  has approximate exterior dimensions of 84 inches (2.13 m) in length, 38 inches (0.97 m) in width and 56 inches (1.42 m) in height, as observable from the scale-rules , , . For a thickness of 1-inch (25 mm) and composed of stainless-steel (e.g., 304 L with density of 0.29 lb\/inor 8.03 g\/cm), the cockpit  has an empty (or tear) mass of 2200 lb (1000 kg) based on construction volume of \u22127600 in.","The motor  may be about 150 lb (\u221270 kg) with batteries being about 130 lb (\u221260 kg). The M60 gun  is about 42 inches (1.08 m) long and weighs about 23 lb or 11 kg). (By comparison, the M240 gun is about 49 inches or 1.24 m long and weighs about 28 lb or 13 kg.) The M2 BMG (gun)  is 65 inches (1.65 m) long and weighs 84 lb (38 kg). Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that alternate weapons can be selected for the mobile platform  without departing from the scope of the invention. Additional equipment and auxiliary armor (e.g., under the cockpit  for mine deflection) can also be installed to satisfy specific purposes.","The operator , console , guidance unit , motor , power supply and controller , guns  and , ammunition and auxiliary equipment can be estimated as 1100 lb (\u2212500 kg) yielding 3300 lb (1500 kg) for the gross cockpit mass. For neutral stability, the center of mass of the cockpit  can be optimized as along the lateral centerline , below the axial centerline  and slightly forward of the vertical centerline  by disposition of the package , ballast , ammunition and auxiliary equipment. Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that these dimensions are merely exemplary and that further engineering may yield more optimal specifications. In addition, a SAMP designed for two or more operators can entail further design changes over the SAMPSON example described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1400","1100","1410","1420","1430","1440","1450","1460","1470","1480","1400"]},"Each wheel supports support about 1320 lb (600 kg) with contact patch, each wheel has an estimated contact patch with the spheroid of 42 in(271 cm), yielding contact pressure of 31 lb\/in(2.2 kg\/cm). Propulsion torque to the aft lower wheels  and  is provided by the motor . Steerage of the fore lower wheels  and  and the aft upper wheels  and  is provided by steering mechanisms controlled by the joystick , which may also optionally control the guns  and  with supplemental press-keys.","As shown in , the cockpit  and the wheels  are contained within a spherical shell  that constitutes the roller ball. Frictional contact between the wheels  and the sphere  causes the latter to rotate in the same direction as the former. The wheels  are shieldable by a protective skirt  and supported by struts  that preferably incorporate shock absorbers and springs. As shown in , the wheels  are disposed in compression against the sphere's interior (conjunctively both upper and lower) perpendicular to the local surface tangent, to maintain the cockpit  upright without tumbling. The interior surface of the sphere  can be coated with an anti-slip material in conformance with MIL-PRF-24667B for aircraft carrier decks in order to facilitate traction with the wheels .","As shown in , the sphere  includes at least one hatch  pivotably attached thereto by an external pair of hinges . The hatch  can be secured by internal latches  in the closed position as shown. The sphere  forms a geometry of boundary lines  (that need not be physically denoted) to form a triangular (actually three-side curvilinear) geodesic dome configuration based on a truncated isosahedron.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["1560","1565","1560","1565","1570","1580","1565","1590","1580"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1500","1530","1310","1200","1570","1370","1365","1395","1500","1590","1580","1570","1560"]},"The hatch  can be formed based on a pair of hexagonal patterns  that joins the hinges  and a pentagonal pattern  that engages the latches , which can be recessed to reduce interference from, the wheels . Such a configuration provides opportunity for three such hatches  distributed around the sphere , although alternate configurations can be employed to enable more or fewer such hatches  for entry and egress to the cockpit interior  through the door . Knobs can be disposed at the intersection of the lines , as indicated by positions of the hinges  embedded within, to improve traction along uneven terrain.","For assembly, the sphere  may be constructed from hemispherical sections welded together subsequent to the cockpit  and wheels  being installed therein. Alternatively, the hatch  may be replaced with or augmented by latches for connecting and detaching the hemispherical sections. The sphere  can be estimated as about 44 inches (1.12 m) in radius, or 88 inches or 7\u2153 feet (2.24 m) in diameter, with an exemplary thickness of about \u215c inch (10 mm). The sphere  has an outer area of about 169 ft(15.7 m). For windows  exposing about one-third (\u2153) of this area, each window corresponds to a circle having a diameter 8.3 inches (210.7 mm).","Assuming construction of stainless-steel, with one-third of the area open, the sphere  has an estimated mass of 1320 lb (600 kg). The chassis for the steering, propulsion, struts, and wheels, can be estimated as about 660 lb (300 kg). Mass of the platform  can thus be estimated as cockpit \u02dc3300 lb, locomotion \u02dc660 lb, spherical shell \u22121320 lb and ballast \u2212660 lb for a total 5940 lb (2700 kg) or 2.97 tons.

Universal joints  transfer rotational torque from the axle  to angled wheel shafts  so that the outer rim of the wheel can efficiently engage the inner surface of the sphere . A brake  enables stoppage of the wheel . For improved traction, the diameter of the windows  can be reduced and\/or the width of the wheels  can be increased.","The detail view  illustrates the components  for torque transfer to the aft lower axle , as well as for rack-and-pinion steering for lower fore wheels , .

Pitching and\/or yawing the gun  enables the image  to be shifted to alternate positions  within an actuator-limited region . The pitch and yaw motions as controlled by the operator  are denoted within the region  by the elevation and azimuth arrows .","Because the sphere  obscures the exterior environment from the view-sights  and , their respective guns  and  are subject to fire into the sphere  unless the projectile passes through a window . Thus, the guidance unit  or related equipment constrains firing commands to instances in which the projectile reaches the boundary of the sphere  only when a window  occurs. This may necessitate inhibition or delay of trigger actuation based on roll speed, turn rate and other factors that determine temporally-dependent positions of the windows  in relation to the view-sights  and .","For example,  show a series of time-lapse frames . The sphere  rotates along direction arrow ; during this process the circumferential optical gunsight  sends annular pattern of light beams  (shown as an axisymmetric pair of arrows) that either reflect back to the sensor in the gunsight  (double-direction-arrow) or not (single-direction-arrow). Presence of the return signal depends on whether the beam reflects off the interior of the sphere  or passes through the window .","In , the gunsight  remains completely blocked by the sphere , as the window  does not align to any line-of-sight. When a sufficient portion of the gunsight  detects the line-of-sight through the window  from the direction of rotation  as in , then the trigger can be alerted to fire the gun . In , the gun  fires a bullet  through the muzzle in a forward direction  (for example) through an aperture introduced by passage of the window . Then in , the bullet  passes through the window  before rotation  of the sphere  blocks the gun's aperture again.","The respective radii of the wheels  and the sphere  are 7.5 inches (190 mm) and 44 inches (1118 mm). (Their corresponding circumferences are 15\u03c0=47 inches and 88\u03c0=276 inches.) Thus, the rotation turning ratio between wheels  and the sphere  is 5.9:1 based on the reciprocal of their respective radii (assuming adequate friction to avoid slip). To drive the mobile platform  at 30 miles-per-hour that corresponds to 528 inches-persecond (13.2 m\/sec), the sphere  rolls at 115 revolutions-per-minute (rpm). Consequently, the wheels  roll at 115 rpm\u00d75.9=672 rpm.
