The third party may be a separate or an auxiliary organization. The third party may be located in an another country or a location near the client organization. One example of outsourcing is a third party providing information technology services for an automobile and\/or a machine tools manufacturer. These information technology services might range from supply chain management to the control of manufacturing processes. Some of these information technology services might be performed in one country whereas other information technology services may be performed in a different country.","An outsourcing environment may be understood to include objects, processes, and circumstances defining how the third party performs tasks for the client organization. The elaboration of the outsourcing environment may include information system configuration requirements, access control requirements or restriction enclosed for the sake of security. The objects in the outsourcing environment may include equipment, such as computers configured according to the configuration requirements. It may be desirable for the client organization to define a part of an outsourcing environment for the third party in order to mitigate risk and maintain accountability within the client organization. Thus, the third party may be required to operate under restrictions outside its control.","One or more technical restrictions may be imposed on the users, user computers, and\/or server computers in an outsourcing environment. It may be desirable to constrain the communication of computers in an outsourcing environment to one local area network LAN, or to limit the communications of computers in an outsourcing environment to an explicitly defined set of computers. Network connectivity in an outsourcing environment may be limited to users and computers directed to perform specific tasks. It may also be desirable to restrict user access to computers and\/or to restrict the interactions between computers.","The outsourcing environment may limit communications and\/or the exchange of data between computers. In particular, the outsourcing environment may limit the open TCP\/IP ports and\/or the services which may be enabled or run on user computers. In addition, it may not be possible to operate a web server or configure a computer system to accept connections conforming to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), in the outsourcing environment. Also, it may not be possible to operate a database server in the outsourcing environment; in particular, it may not be possible to configure a computer to accept connections conforming to database protocols such as Transparent Network Substrate (Oracle), SQL*Net (Oracle), Tabular Data Stream (Microsoft), or similar protocols (Microsoft is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation; Oracle is a trademark of Oracle Corporation). Furthermore, it may not be possible to make changes to the system registry on a user computer in the outsourcing environment. Moreover, direct access to the Internet may not be allowed in the outsourcing environment.","One or more of the terms in this application may be a trademark of a corresponding owner.","Thus, it is a problem to obtain and store user data in an outsourcing environment. This problem is solved according to the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.","According to an aspect of this application, a data processing method for obtaining and storing user data in an outsourcing environment is provided. The method includes providing a user interface on a user computer. The method further includes determining an indicator which indicates whether there is synchronization data in the user database, wherein the synchronization data is for synchronization with a remote database which is located on a remote computer. The method also includes obtaining user data with the user interface. In addition, the method includes storing the user data in the user database if the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database.","Thus, the method may decrease the mental and physical effort required from a user in order to perform a task (e.g. storing data), since the user does not need to worry about where data is stored. In addition, the indicator may enable an improved, continued man-machine interaction, by facilitating the storage and synchronization of data.","It may be that, if the indicator indicates that there is no synchronization data in the user database, the method further includes verifying whether the remote database is available. In the negative, the method may further include storing the user data in the user database attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote database after storing the user data in the user database. Otherwise, in the affirmative, the method may include storing the user data in the remote database.","Furthermore, it may be that, if the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database, the method further includes verifying whether the remote database in available. In the affirmative, the method may also include synchronizing the user database with the remote database, and recording a timestamp of the user database.","Determining the indicator may comprise obtaining a current timestamp of the user database and comparing the current timestamp with the recorded timestamp. Alternatively, determining the indicator may comprise examining an indicator value. If the indicator value indicates that there is no synchronization data in the user database, the method may further comprise verifying whether the remote database is available. In the affirmative, the method may comprise copying the data in the user database to the remote database, and setting the stored value to indicate that there is no synchronization data in the user database.","The user computer and the remote computer may be connected by a network. In this case, the remote computer may be accessed by the user computer using a virtual private network (VPN), and\/or a remote graphical user interface.","Providing the user interface on the user computer may comprise executing a computer program on the remote computer from the user computer. The computer program is preferably configured so that input of the user data is prohibited or blocked if the computer program is executed directly on the user computer. In other words, if the computer program is copied from the remote computer to the user computer, the computer program cannot be executed on the user computer.","It may be that the method further includes receiving user input selecting the user database as a default database. In this case, an attempt to synchronize the user database with the remote database is only made after receiving a signal to synchronize the user database with the remote database. The signal may comprise user input.","It may be that the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database. If the indicator so indicates, the method may further include verifying whether the remote database is available. In the affirmative, the method may include opening a connection from the user computer to the remote computer, and synchronizing the user database with the remote database. In addition, the method may include copying stored user data, including the synchronized data, from the remote database to the user computer before closing the connection to the remote database. Stored user data may be understood as user data obtained with the user interface, and stored in the remote database. In the negative, i.e. if the remote database is unavailable, the method may include storing user data in the user database, and attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote computer. Attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote computer may be understood as attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote database.","It may be that if user input to shut down the user interface is received, an attempt is made to synchronize the user database with the remote database if there is synchronization data in the user database. This may include providing a notification on the user interface if the attempt to synchronize was unsuccessful.","According to another aspect, a computer program product including computer readable instructions is provided. Computer readable instructions may be stored on a computer readable medium and\/or provided as a data stream. The computer program product, when loaded and executed on a computer system, may cause the computer system to perform operations according to the method steps described above.","According to yet another aspect, a data processing system for obtaining and storing user data in an outsourcing environment is provided. The system includes a user computer, and the user computer includes a user database and a user interface, wherein the user interface is operable to obtain user data. Furthermore, the system includes an indicator which indicates whether there is synchronization data in the user database. Accordingly, the user computer is operable to determine the indicator. In addition, the synchronization data is for synchronization with a remote database which is located on a remote computer. Moreover, the user computer is operable to store the user data in the user database if the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database. In addition, the system is preferably operable to perform operations according to any of the method steps described above.","The subject matter described in the specification can be implemented as a method or as a system, possibly in the form of one or more computer program products. The subject matter described in the specification can be implemented in a data signal or on a machine readable medium, where the medium is embodied in one or more information carriers, such as a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a semiconductor memory, or a hard disk. Such computer program products may cause a data processing apparatus to perform one or more operations described in the specification.","In addition, subject matter described in the specification can also be implemented as a system including a processor, and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory may encode one or more programs to cause the processor to perform one or more of the methods described in the specification. Further subject matter described in the specification can be implemented using various machines.","Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying exemplary drawings and description below. Other features will be apparent from the description, the drawings, and from the claims.","The following technical terms are used throughout the description. The terms may refer, but are not limited to the following explanations.","The user data may be understood as data input by a user or data input by means of a batch process. When stored in a database, user data may be understood to form all or part of the contents of the database. User data may be distinguished from metadata, which describes the structure of, and constraints on the database. User data may also be distinguished from indexes, which may be understood as data structures that support efficient access to user data.","A user computer may be understood as any computer which is accessible by a user. The user computer may be a client, a server, a personal computer, a mainframe or a mobile computing device.","An admin computer may be understood as a computer from which administrative tasks can be performed. The admin computer may be the same as the user computer or the admin computer may be separate from the user computer. The admin computer may be a client, a server, a personal computer, a mainframe or a mobile computing device.","A remote computer may be understood as a computer which is separate from the user computer. The remote computer may be connected to the user computer via a network. The remote computer may be spatially distant from the user computer and\/or the admin computer. The remote computer may be a client, a server, a personal computer, a mainframe or a mobile computing device.","A client computer may be understood as a computer which is separate from the user computer. The client computer may also be separate from the remote computer and the admin computer. The client computer may be administered by the client organization and may be spatially distant from the user computer and\/or the admin computer. The client computer may be a client, a server, a personal computer, a mainframe or a mobile computing device.","A user interface may be understood to allow a user to interact with a computer. In other words, a user interface acts as a bridge between applications and users.","A Virtual Private Network (VPN) may be understood as a network where packets that are internal to a private network pass across a public network (e.g. the Internet), without this being apparent to hosts on the private network. A VPN may encrypt packets which pass across the public network. It may be a characteristic of a VPN that when a computer, such as the user computer, can only connect to one","VPN at a time. In other words, given a first VPN and a second VPN, when the user computer connects to the second VPN, the user computer can no longer connect to the first VPN.","A remote graphical user interface or remote graphic interface may allow a user to use a remote system as if he were sitting directly in front of it. Examples of programs providing a remote graphical user interface include Microsoft Terminal Services, Microsoft Remote Desktop, and Citrix Independent Computer Architecture (ICA) (Citrix and ICA are trademarks of Citrix Systems Inc.).","A database may be understood as a managed collection of data. A database may be relational, object oriented, object relational, or the database may be structured according to another model.","A spreadsheet, worksheet or sheet may be understood as an electronic representation of multiple cells or fields that together make up a grid consisting of rows and columns. A spreadsheet may be displayed inside an application program, such as Microsoft Excel (Excel is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation).","Synchronization may involve copying data from one database to another. In particular, synchronization may involve copying data from a user database to a remote database when the data to be copied from the user database is not present on the remote database.","The availability of a computer or database may be understood to refer to the ability of a user to access the computer or the database respectively. Thus, if a user computer can access a database, the database is available; if a user computer cannot access the database, the database is unavailable.","Detailed Description","In the following text, a detailed description of examples will be given with reference to the drawings. It should be understood that various modifications to the examples may be made. In particular, elements of one example may be combined and used in other examples to form new examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","104","102","100","100","102","102","100","101"]},"According to the specific example depicted in , the remote computer  contains a TrackIT folder  and a remote DB folder . A folder may be understood as synonymous with a directory, i.e. a means of grouping files. The folder TrackIT  may comprise a computer program which can be executed from the user computer in order to provide the user interface on the user computer.","The computer program in the TrackIT folder  may be referred to as TrackIT or TrackIT.xls. Accordingly, the computer program may be an Excel spreadsheet comprising macros. A macro may be understood to refer to a unit of code written using Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications programming language (Visual Basic is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation). The remote DB folder  may include the remote database. TrackIT  and remote DB  may be folders accessible using Microsoft Windows file sharing protocols. The remote computer  may be accessible from the user computer  and\/or the admin computer  using a virtual private network (VPN) and\/or a remote graphical user interface. The client computer  may be accessible from the user computer  and\/or the admin computer  using a virtual private network and\/or a remote graphical user interface. The VPN used to access the remote computer  may be different from the VPN used to access the client computer .","It should be noted that while only one user computer , one remote computer , one admin computer , and one client computer  are depicted, multiple user computers, remote computers, admin computers and\/or client computers are possible.","The remote computer  and the admin computer  may be understood to be part of a tracking computer network. When connected to the remote computer , the user computer  may also be understood to be part of the tracking computer network. Due constraints imposed by a specific environment, e.g. the outsourcing environment, when connected to the client computer , the user computer  may be understood to be outside the tracking computer network.","A user database  may also be referred to as user DB . The user database  may be located on or at the user computer . The user DB  may also be referred to as the backup database. The remote database may be located on the remote computer . The remote database may also be referred to as the server database.","Alternatively, the user DB  may be located on another computer connected to the user computer  via a network. In particular, the network connecting the user computer  to the one or more computers upon which the user DB  is stored may be faster and\/or more reliable than a network connecting the user computer  to the remote computer .","According to one example, the TrackIT program may be executed in order to design fields\/parameters and configure settings for the TrackIT program. In addition, a database may be created in the remote DB folder  and reports may be generated using the database. TrackIT may be run from the user computer , and the parameters for tracking may be loaded in the user computer  from the remote computer . In particular, the TrackIT program may be understood to provide instructions, i.e. source code in the form of macros, which define how an application, e.g. Microsoft Excel, is executed. Moreover, tasks may be stored in a database located in the remote DB folder  and task reports may be generated from the database. In some cases, the TrackIT program stores user data in the user database  when access to the remote database on the remote computer  is lost.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 20"],"b":["1","111","112","101","2","111","101","3","111","100","3","4","5","6","7","8","12"],"i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 to 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 24"],"b":["20","21","22","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 25"],"b":["42","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["53","56"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 25"],"b":["100","73"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"The steps shown in to may be used to display reports for user data stored by all users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 20","FIG. 26"],"i":["a ","a ","b"],"b":["92","20","93"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 10","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 10","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 11","i":"a "},"The first mode, automatic synchronization, may be desirable when communications between the user computer  and the remote computer  are intermittent. Intermittent communications may result in the remote computer  being unavailable to the user computer  or inaccessible from the user computer , for a period of time. In particular, intermittent communications between the user computer  and the remote computer  may occur when the network connection between the user computer  and the remote computer  is lost, or goes out of service at varying intervals.","The second mode, manual synchronization, may be desirable if communications between the user computer  and the remote computer  are extremely slow or temporarily disabled. Intermittent or extremely slow communications between the user computer  and the remote computer  may occur due to the use of a virtual private network and\/or a remote graphical user interface and\/or because of the spatial distance separating the user computer  from the remote computer . Automatic or manual synchronization mode may be selected in the setup sheet, for example, the setup sheet depicted in .","In step S, user data is saved or stored in response to a mouse click on either a pause task button  or a start task\/submit task button , as depicted on the tracker sheet. In step S, the TrackIT program verifies the availability of the remote database. User data is saved on the remote database if the remote database is available, otherwise the user data is saved on the user database . In step S, an attempt is made to synchronize the user database  with the remote database.
