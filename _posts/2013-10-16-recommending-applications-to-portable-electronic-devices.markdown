{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The number of portable electronic devices, for example smartphones, have grown exponentially in recent years. Additionally and in parallel, the number of applications, for example mobile applications, supported by these portable electronic devices have also been rapidly growing since the inception of portable electronic device. These applications, once installed on a portable electronic device, may provide several functionalities to a user of the portable electronic device.","To address to the growing demand of applications, application providers develop hundreds of thousands of applications that may be downloaded at the portable electronic devices. However, due to the large number of available applications the users of the portable electronic devices may be overwhelmed when searching for relevant applications for their devices. Determining relevant applications for installing at a portable electronic device may therefore be confusing and time consuming.","Embodiments of techniques for recommending applications to portable electronic devices are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"For recommending applications to a portable electronic device, initially at , context change of application identification parameters is detected. An application identification parameter may be any observable occurrence or phenomenon. For example, hour of the day, current date, month, weather condition, physical location of a user, proximity of a user to a Wi-Fi network, etc. may be application identification parameters. A context may represent a value for a particular application identification parameter. For example, the context of a \u201clocation\u201d application identification parameter may be home, office, or any other location of the user. A context change may represent a change in value for the application identification parameter. For example, a context change of the \u201clocation\u201d application identification parameter may be when user moves from a \u201chome\u201d (location) to \u201coffice\u201d (location). The context of the different application identification parameters may be monitored to detect context change of a particular application identification parameter.","Next at , a target application is identified based on the detected context change at . In one embodiment, a target application is an application associated with a particular context of an application identification parameter. For example, a financial or banking application that helps users perform tax calculation and other financial calculations may be associated with the \u201cfinancial year end\u201d context of the \u201ctime of year\u201d application identification parameter. Identifying the target application may include identifying the application associated with the changed context, detected at , of the application identification parameter. In the example discussed in the previous paragraph, a \u201cfinance assistant\u201d application associated with the changed context \u201coffice\u201d of the \u201clocation\u201d application identification parameter may be identified.","Next at , a similarity value is computed between the identified target application and other applications. Other applications may be applications other than the target application, identified at . A similarity value is a measure of similarity between the identified application and other applications. In one embodiment, the similarity value may be computed based on comparing several attributes, for example, application tags, application category, etc., of the identified target application and the other application. In the example described in the previous paragraph, the identified \u201cfinance assistant\u201d application may include application tags \u201cfinance\u201d, \u201ccalculator\u201d, \u201ccurrency converter\u201d, \u201cloan comparator\u201d, and \u201cprofit\u201d. A similarity value may be determined between the \u201cfinance assistant\u201d target application and two other applications: a \u201cbanking\u201d application that includes application tags \u201cfinance\u201d, \u201cbanking\u201d, \u201cprofit\u201d, \u201cbalance amount\u201d, and \u201cfund transfer\u201d; and a \u201cmarket live\u201d application that includes application tags \u201cfinance\u201d, \u201cmarket\u201d, \u201cstocks\u201d, \u201cprofit\u201d, and \u201cportfolio\u201d. Based on comparing the application tags, the similarity value between the \u201cfinance assistant\u201d application and the \u201cbanking\u201d application may be determined as 0.9, and between the \u201cfinance assistant\u201d application and \u201cmarket live\u201d application may be determined as 0.6. The similarity value may be determined using different similarity value determination process, for example, Pearson-r correlation method.","Finally at , the to-be-recommended applications are determined, based on the computed similarity value and rate value of other applications. The to-be-recommended applications may be applications that are recommended to the portable electronic device. In one embodiment, a rate value may indicate a positive or negative recommendation for the application by the target user. The rate value and the similarity value of other applications are used to determine the to-be-recommended applications for the portable electronic device.","In the example described with respect to , assume that the rate values for the \u201cbanking\u201d application and the \u201cmarket live\u201d application are 4 and 3, respectively. In this case, based on the product of rate value and the computed similarity value, the \u201cbanking\u201d application is determined as to-be-recommended application for the portable electronic device. The to-be-recommended application may be forwarded to the portable electronic device. A user of the portable electronic device may then discard the recommended application or install the received recommended application.","Determining to-be-recommended application based on context change of application identification parameters and rate values of application, ensures that user's environment and user's preference, respectively, are considered to determine the application recommendations for the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2C","b":["200","202"]},"Next at , based on the monitoring, at , context change of an application identification parameter is detected. A context change may represent a change in value of the application identification parameter. In one embodiment, the context change may be detected for several application identification parameters, based on the monitoring at . In the example described in the previous paragraph, the user may travel to other city ABC, due to which the context of the \u201clocation\u201d application identification parameter changes from \u201chome\u201d to \u201ccity ABC\u201d.","Next at , based on the context change detected at , a target application may be identified. A target application is an application corresponding to the changed context, detected at , of the application identification parameter. In the example described in the previous paragraph, a \u201ccity ABC map\u201d application may be identified. In one embodiment, several target applications may be identified corresponding to the context change detected at . In the example described in the previous paragraph, several target applications may be identified corresponding to the changed context \u201ccity ABC\u201d of the \u201clocation\u201d application identification parameter.","In another example, a context of a \u201cweather\u201d application identification parameter may change from \u201csummer\u201d (context) to \u201cwinter\u201d (context). In this case, a \u201cski resorts\u201d application, \u201cwinter garments outlet\u201d application, and \u201cwinter driving\u201d application may be identified as target applications corresponding to the changed context \u201cwinter\u201d of the \u201cweather\u201d application identification parameter. In one embodiment, a target application may be detected corresponding to context change of several application identification parameters. For example, based on the context change of a \u201clocation\u201d application identification parameter from \u201chome\u201d to \u201ccity ABC\u201d and a \u201ctime\u201d application identification parameter, which detects the time elapsed since the user is away from their \u201chome\u201d location, from \u201czero\u201d hours to \u201ctwenty four\u201d hours, a \u201chotels in city ABC\u201d target application may be identified.","In one embodiment, the relationship between context of an application identification parameter and corresponding target application may be pre-determined. For example, a pre-determined relationship between application identification parameter and application may be that when the context of \u201cweather\u201d application identification parameter is \u201csummer\u201d then the corresponding application is \u201cbeach resorts\u201d application. The pre-determined relationship between the context of the application and the corresponding target application is used for identifying the target application.","Next at , an un-rated and to be installed target application from the target application, identified at , is detected. The un-rated and to-be-installed application may be detected from the several target applications identified at . In one embodiment, an un-rated target application is an application that has not been rated by a target user. The target user may be a user of the portable electronic device. A rate value may indicate a positive or negative recommendation for the application by the target user. A rate value is an evaluation or assessment of a particular item, in terms of quantity or quality or any other parameter. In one embodiment, the rate value may be provided, for example, on a scale of \u22121 to 5. A rate value of 5 may represent that a user has positively rated the application. The user may rate the application positively in terms of several parameters, for example, \u201crelevance\u201d, \u201cease of use\u201d, \u201capplication size\u201d, etc. Rate values of 1-4 represent explicit rate values provided by the user for the application, where a higher rate value represents a more positive feedback by the user. In one embodiment, a rate value of 2 is automatically assigned to the application, when the application is installed to the portable electronic device. A rate value of 0 implies that an application is an un-rated application. A rate value of \u22121 represents a negative recommendation by the user for the application.","In one embodiment, a to-be-installed target application is a target application that has not been installed at the portable electronic device. An unrated, i.e., application with rate value 0, that has not been installed at the portable device is determined from the target application identified at . Next at , the rate value of the un-rated and to-be-installed target application, determined at , is incremented. In one embodiment, the rate value of the un-rated and to-be-installed target application is incremented by 1. In the example described with respect to , assume that the \u201cwinter driving\u201d application is the un-rated and to-be-installed application from among the three target applications corresponding to the \u201cwinter\u201d context of the \u201cweather\u201d application identification parameter. In this case, the rate value of the \u201cwinter driving application\u201d is incremented by 1.","Next at , a check is performed to determine whether there are other applications rated by the target user. Other applications may include applications different from the target application identified at . In one embodiment, other application may be a co-rated application with respect to the target application. Two applications are co-rated when both the applications are rated by same user. The same user may be the target user or any other user. The other application co-rated with respect to the target application may also be rated by the same user. In case other application rated by the target user exist (condition in  is true), a similarity value may be computed, at , between the target application and the other applications, determined at . A similarity value is a measure of similarity between a target application and the other application. In one embodiment, the similarity value may be individually computed between target application and the determined other applications. For example, consider that there are two target applications (a, a) and two other applications (o, o) rated by the target user. In this case, four similarity values (S, S, S, and S) may be computed between the target applications (a, a) and the other applications (o, o). Computing similarity values between target application and other co-rated applications reduces the number of other applications for which the similarity values are computed. This reduces the time for computing the similarity value between the target applications and other applications. In the example described with respect to , assume that there are two other applications, \u201cice museum\u201d application and \u201cwinter park\u201d applications, and three target applications, \u201cski resorts\u201d application, \u201cwinter garments outlet\u201d application, and \u201cwinter driving\u201d application, rated by the same user. In this case, six similarity values may be computed between the three target applications and the two other applications.","In one embodiment, the similarity value may be computed based on the similarity between attributes of identified application and other application. The attributes of an application may include, for example, target Operating System on which the application is supported (for example: iOS\u00ae, Android\u00ae, etc.), an application kind (for example: whether application is a free application or a paid application), category to which the application belongs (for example: banking, games, news, educational, etc.), application type (native or container based), application tag, etc. Applications of native application type are executed using Operating System of the portable electronic device whereas applications of container application type may use custom containers for execution. Application tag provides the information about an application. The similarity value may be computed, for example, based on the similarity between the target Operating Systems, kind, category, application type, and\/or tags of the target application and the other application.","In one embodiment, the similarity value between target application and other application may be computed using any similarity computation method, for example, cosine based similarity method, adjusted cosine similarity method, or correlation based similarity method. For cosine based similarity, the identified application and other application are considered as two vectors. A cosine based similarity method measures similarity between the target application vector and the other application vector by computing the cosine of the angle between the target application and other application. Two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity value of 1, two vectors at 90\u00b0 have a similarity value of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposite to each other have a similarity value of \u22121. Based on the cosine based similarity method, the similarity value between the target application and other application may be 1, 0, or \u22121.","The correlation based similarity Sbetween two applications i and j, respectively, rated by the target user, may be computed by determining the Pearson-r correlation between the target application and other application. Pearson-r correlation is a measure of the linear correlation (dependence) between the target application i and other application j, giving a value between +1 and \u22121 inclusive, where 1 is total positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and \u22121 is negative correlation. The Pearson-r correlation may be computed using the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"Si","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["u","U"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"R","mrow":{"mi":["u","i"],"mo":","}},{"mover":{"mi":["R","_"]},"mi":"l"}],"mo":"-"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"R","mrow":{"mi":["u","j"],"mo":","}},{"mover":{"mi":["R","_"]},"mi":"J"}],"mo":"-"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"msqrt":[{"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["u","U"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"R","mrow":{"mi":["u","i"],"mo":","}},{"mover":{"mi":["R","_"]},"mi":"l"}],"mo":"-"}},"mn":"2"}}},{"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["u","U"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"R","mrow":{"mi":["u","j"],"mo":","}},{"mover":{"mi":["R","_"]},"mi":"J"}],"mo":"-"}},"mn":"2"}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}]}}}}},"br":{},"sub":["u,i ","i ","u,j ","j "],"o":["R","R","R"]},"In case, other application rated by the target user is not identified (condition in  is false) then the similarity value is computed between the target application and other application included in an application cluster at . An application cluster may be a group of applications grouped based on a particular attribute. For example, applications may be grouped in two application clusters based on two application categories \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cgames\u201d, respectively. In this case, the two application clusters include applications with application category \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cgames\u201d, respectively.","In one embodiment, the similarity value is computed between the target application and other applications of an application cluster that includes the target application. The similarity value may be computed between the target application and other co-rated applications in the application cluster. In this case, the target application and the other co-rated application have been rated by another user different from the target user. The application cluster may be checked to identify other co-rated application. The similarity value may then be computed individually between the target application and the other co-rated application included in the application cluster. The similarity value may be computed using the different similarity computation methods discussed above with respect to . In the example described above with respect to , assume that there are two application clusters grouped according to the application categories \u201csports\u201d and \u201cbusiness\u201d. In this case, the \u201cski resorts\u201d application and \u201cwinter driving\u201d application may be included in the application cluster corresponding to the \u201csports\u201d category. Similarly, the \u201cwinter garments outlet\u201d application may be included in the application cluster corresponding to the \u201ccommerce\u201d category. A similarity value may be computed between the target \u201cski resorts\u201d, \u201cwinter driving\u201d application and other co-rated application included in the application cluster corresponding to the \u201csports\u201d category. Similarly a similarity value may be computed between the \u201cwinter garment\u201d application and the other co-rated application included in the application cluster corresponding to the \u201ccommerce\u201d category.","Next at  (), based on the computed similarity value, a pre-determined number of other applications corresponding to the target application may be identified. The pre-determined number of other applications may be selected from the other applications, the similarity value of which are computed at  and , with respect to the target application. In one embodiment, other applications may be arranged in descending order based on the computed similarity values between the target application and other applications. The pre-determined number of other application may then be selected from the beginning of the obtained list of other application. In one embodiment, the pre-determined number of other applications may represent a minimum number of other applications similar to the target application. Next at , the pre-determined number of other applications, selected at , may be stored. The target application and the corresponding pre-determined number of other applications may be stored together in a database. In one embodiment, the target application, the corresponding other applications, and the similarity value of other applications with respect to the target application may be stored together.","In one embodiment the similarity value may be pre-computed, before monitoring context of the application identification parameters at . During the pre-computation process: similarity values may be computed between the applications, corresponding to different application identification parameters, and the other application, a pre-determined number of the other applications may then be selected based on the determined similarity value, and the selected pre-determined number of other applications, corresponding to an application, may be stored along with their similarity values. In this case the other applications corresponding to the target application, identified at , may be retrieved, and then used for determining the application recommendation. Pre-computing other application corresponding to a target application reduces computation time for determining the similarity value, after a context change of application identification parameter is detected, and therefore reduces the time for determining applications recommendation.","Next at , a number of to-be installed target applications are determined. The number of to-be-installed applications may be a count of the number of target applications that are not installed at the portable electronic device. Next at , the determined number of to-be-installed applications is compared with a pre-determined number of to-be-recommended applications. In one embodiment, the pre-determined number of to-be-recommended applications is the maximum number of application recommendations that may be sent to the portable electronic device. The comparison is performed to determine whether the number of to-be-installed applications is equal to the pre-determined number of to-be-recommended applications.","In case the number of to-be-installed target applications is not equal to the pre-determined number of to-be-recommended applications (condition in  is false) then a pre-determined number of other applications corresponding to the to-be-installed target application may be retrieved. In one embodiment, the other applications, stored at , corresponding to the to-be-installed target application may be retrieved. For example, consider that six target applications are identified and one of these target application is installed at the portable electronic device. Assume that the five to-be-installed target applications have six other applications stored corresponding to these applications. Further, assume that the pre-determined number of application recommendations that may be sent to the portable electronic device is 2. In this case, as the number of to-be-installed target applications (5) is not equal to the pre-determined number (2) of target applications therefore, the six other applications corresponding to the five to-be-installed target applications may be retrieved.","Next at , predicted value is computed for the retrieved other applications and the to-be-installed target applications. A predicted value represents a likelihood of the application to be relevant for recommendation to the portable electronic device. The predicted value for the other application is computed based on the similarity value of the other application with respected to the target application, and the rate value of the other application. In one embodiment, rated other application, from among other applications retrieved at , are identified. A rated other application may be one or more of other applications, retrieved at , that has a rate value. The predicted value may be computed for the rated other application and the to-be-installed target application. In the example described in the previous paragraph, the predicted value may be computed for the six other applications and the five to-be-installed target applications.","The predicted value for the to-be-installed identified application is determined based on the rate value of the to-be-installed identified application. In this case, the similarity value of the to-be-installed application is considered as 100% or 1. In one embodiment, the predicted value may be determined based on any prediction computation method, for example, weighted sum method or the regression method. In the weighted sum method, the rate value Rof other application j is weighted by the corresponding similarity value sbetween other application j and the target application i. The obtained value is then divided by the sum of the similarities sbetween the other applications j and the target application i, to obtain the predicted value Pfor an application \u201ci\u201d rated by a target user u. The predicted value Pmay be computed using the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":["u","i"],"mo":","}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2192","mi":"n"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"s","mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}},{"mi":"R","mrow":{"mi":["u","j"],"mo":","}}],"mo":"\u00d7"}}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2192","mi":"n"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":"s","mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}}}}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"where \u201cn\u201d in the number of applications similar to i."}}}},"Similarly in the regression method approximation of rate value, instead of the actual rate value provided to the rated other applications, are used for determining the predicted value.

In one embodiment, the rated other applications and the to-be-installed target applications are arranged in descending order of the corresponding predicted value. A pre-determined number of applications from the beginning of the arranged applications are then determined as the to-be-recommended application. The pre-determined number, used for determining the to-be-recommended application, may be the pre-determined maximum number of to-be-recommended applications. In the example described with respect to , the six other applications and the five to-be-installed target applications may be arranged according to the corresponding predicted value of these applications.

The social network activities may include installing applications, providing recommendations for a particular application, etc. Comparing the social network activities may include comparing applications downloaded by the target user and any other member on the social network, comparing applications rated by the target user and members of the social network, etc. In one embodiment, comparing the social network activities may include comparing whether similar applications have been downloaded by the target user and any other member on the social network, etc. Similar applications may include applications having some attributes same as the attributes of the applications installed by the target user. Based on the comparison at , a member of the social network that has performed similar network activities as the target user is identified at . The identified member of the social network may have installed same applications as the target user or may have provided feedback for the same applications as the user. For example, a target user may have downloaded a \u201ccar racing\u201d game or may have rated a Formula 1\u00ae race. In this case, any other member that has downloaded the \u201ccar racing\u201d game or have rated the Formula 1\u00ae race may be identified.","Finally at , the applications installed by the identified member are determined as to-be-recommended applications.

In one embodiment, the uploaded application may be stored in a database  included in the application discovery server . The publisher interface  may also receive a link to an application store that may be used for installing the application. An application store, for example, Google Play\u2122 store or Apple\u00ae App Store\u2122 is a digital distribution platform for application software. The application store link, for a recommended application, may be forwarded to the portable electronic device along with the recommended application. A user of the portable electronic device may download the application, from the application store, using the received application store link.","The publisher interface  allows a user to select application discovery parameters for an application. The application discovery parameters are parameters based on which an application may be discovered at a portable electronic device. In one embodiment, the application discovery parameters are application identification parameters that may be used for identifying an application. For example, a \u201clocation\u201d application discovery parameter selected by the user may be an application identification parameter. When the location parameter is selected then the user may be requested to provide an application coordinates, at which the application is discoverable. When the target user reaches the application coordinates (context), defined for the \u201clocation\u201d application identification parameters, then the corresponding application is identified as a target application. In one embodiment, the selected application discovery parameters may be used for determining the similarity value of the target application with respect to the other applications. For example, when an application tag parameter is selected as the application discovery parameter then application tag is one of the parameters used for determining similarity values between the application and other application. Similarly, when the user's usage history options is selected then user's past actions like frequently visited locations by the user, notification received by the user, actions taken per notification, applications installed by user, frequency of application installation by user, etc., may be considered for determining the to-be-recommended applications.","In one embodiment, the application discovery parameter may allow a user to select an application recommendation triggering mode for triggering the application recommendation determination process. The application recommendation triggering mode may include a system triggered mode and a user triggered mode. In case the system triggered mode is selected by the user, the application may be discovered based on an identified context change for an application identification parameter, or based on the identified other applications similar to installed applications at pre-determined times. In case, the user triggered option is selected then the user may trigger the application recommendation generation process by selecting a recommendation search\/recommendation refresh option at the portable electronic device.","The application discovery server  includes an application recommendation module  that determines the to-be-recommended applications for the portable electronic device. The application recommendation module  includes a context aware pre-processor  that detects context change of different application identification parameters. The context aware pre-processor  then provides the changed context of the application identification parameter to an application identifier . An application identifier , included in the application recommendation module , then identifies the application corresponding to the received context of application identification parameters. An application recommendation determiner , included in the application recommendation module, then computes the similarity value between the identified application and other applications, and the predicted value of other applications as discussed with respect to . The application recommendation determiner  may then determine the to-be-recommended applications based on the computed predicted value as discussed with respect to .","The application recommendation module  also includes a social network based filter  that identifies other members of a social network that have similar social network activities as the target user. The social network based filter  then provides the list of applications installed by the other member to the application recommendation determiner  that determines the received list of applications as the to-be-installed application.","In one embodiment the application discovery server  includes a scheduler  that sends an application recommendation generation request to the application recommendation determiner  at pre-determined intervals or when a user of the portable electronic device sends a \u201crefresh application recommendation\u201d request. The application recommendation determiner  then generates the to-be-recommended applications based on the applications installed at the portable electronic device and the user preference tags selected by the user. The application discovery server  may also include a user's usage history management module  that stores user related information, for example, frequently visited location by user, notifications received by user, actions taken by user per notification, etc. The stored user related information is provided to the application recommendation module  for determining the to-be-recommended applications.","The application recommendation management system  also includes an application discovery agent. In one embodiment, the application discovery agent  may be included in the portable electronic device . The application discovery agent  may forward a received rate value of application from the portable electronic device  to the application discovery server  for determining the to-be-recommended applications. The application discovery agent  also receives the to-be-recommended applications forwarded to the portable electronic device . The application discovery agent  also monitors context of the different application identification parameters and provides this information to the context aware pre-processor . The received to-be-recommended applications may then be displayed at a user interface of the portable electronic device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","600","606","600","608"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","702","704","702","706","704","708","710","702","704"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802","804","806","800","808","808","808","812"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","902","904","902","900","906","906","908","900"]},"Some embodiments may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components.
