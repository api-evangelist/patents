Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a configuration of a nonvolatile semiconductor memory which is capable of retaining stored data without a power supply voltage applied thereto.","2. Description of the Related Art","Nonvolatile memories which have already been put to practical use or still being developed include flash EEPROMs employing a floating gate structure, FeRAMs employing a ferroelectric film, MRAMs employing a ferromagnetic film, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIGS. 14A through 14D","FIG. 14A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 14B","FIG. 14C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 14D","FIGS. 15A and 15B"]},"A description will be given of the principle of the circuit operation of this EEPROM by referring to , , and  as examples. In the case of an operation for writing information, as shown in , 6 V is applied to a bit line (BL), 12 V applied to a word line, and 0 V applied to a plate line (PL), for example. Due to the voltage applied to the word line, the gate receives a voltage of 12 V. Under this condition, the floating gate (FG) portion has a voltage applied thereto that ranges approximately from 1 V to 3 V, resulting in a channel being created as a path for electrons in the surface of the substrate (p-sub). The transistor is operating in the saturation region, and its channel is pinched off near the drain, so that a strong electric field is present in the proximity of the drain. Some of the electrons accelerated by this electric field jump into the floating gate. Because of this, the floating gate ends up retaining the electrons, resulting in the threshold voltage of the transistor being shifted toward a higher voltage as viewed from the gate node (word line). The injection of electrons into the floating gate is performed selectively and separately for each cell, thereby achieving the writing of information.","In the case of a read operation shown in , a difference in the threshold voltages shifted as described above is read as an electric current. 5 V is applied to the word line, 1 V applied to the bit line (BL), and (0V) applied to the plate line, for example. As a result, the transistors having floating gates connected to the word line have a read current (cell current) running therethrough. This cell current has an increased\/decreased amount, depending on the high\/low of the threshold voltage. The cell current is then amplified for the retrieval of information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A and 18B"},"For the EEPROMs that are conventional nonvolatile memories, there is a need to manufacture a transistor having the special construction, i.e., a transistor having a floating gate. As for FeRAMs and MRAMs, which achieve nonvolatile storage by use of ferroelectric material and ferromagnetic material, respectively, there is a need to form and process the film made of these materials. This is one of the big issues that need to be solved before practical use is achieved, and is also one of the factors that result in an increase in the manufacturing costs. There are memories, on the other hand, that store data by utilizing circuitry structure without requiring any special process. Such memories include SRAMs and DRAMs. SRAMs, in particular, do not require any special process in addition to the CMOS-type process, but have a drawback in that the stored contents are lost at power-off.","The issue to be solved is to provide a circuit that is CMOS-type process compatible and has a nonvolatile memory function.","It is a general object of the present invention to provide a nonvolatile semiconductor memory circuit that substantially obviates one or more problems caused by the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","Features and advantages of the present invention will be presented in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent from the description and the accompanying drawings, or may be learned by practice of the invention according to the teachings provided in the description.

whichever is selected in response to the data.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a nonvolatile semiconductor memory circuit includes two MISFET-type transistors having substantially same characteristics, characterized in that a conductive state of the first transistor is controlled by controlling a voltage of a gate electrode of the first transistor to be a voltage other than a power supply potential and a ground potential for a predetermined period, thereby inducing a secular deterioration in an on-resistance thereof, which causes a performance difference between the first and second transistors, the performance difference being read as a current difference between the two transistors simultaneously made conductive, thereby storing and reading \u201c0\u201d, and, conversely, a performance of the second transistor is degraded greater than the first transistor, thereby storing \u201c1\u201d.","According to another aspect of the present

of the present invention, a nonvolatile storage is implemented without introducing a new material or an additional manufacturing step to the CMOS-type process, thereby achieving cost reduction and shorter development periods.","In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 2A and 2B"]},"In the case of a read

As a result, the transistors connected to the word line have a read current (cell current) running therethrough. This cell current has an increased\/decreased amount, depending on the high\/low of the threshold voltage. The cell current is then amplified for the retrieval of information. This resembles to the memory circuit structure of an EEPROM that was described in the description of the background art. What fundamentally differs is, however, that it is extremely difficult, technically, to remove the electrons injected into the oxide film to erase the information. That is, it is possible to shift the threshold voltage of a transistor to a higher voltage by injecting electrons into the oxide film, but it is not possible to shift the threshold voltage to a lower voltage in the opposite direction. Basically, thus, writing can be performed only once.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 4B","FIG. 5B","FIG. 4B","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 6A and 6B"],"b":["1","1","2","2","1","2","0","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","1","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4A","FIG. 7"],"b":["0","1","0","0","1","1","0","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["00","01","02","03","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 9","FIG. 4A"],"b":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A","FIG. 14C","FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIG. 12B"],"b":["1","2","1","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","2"]},"In order to read this threshold voltage difference as information, as shown in , the level of the word line (WL) is set to a low level, and the RESTORE signal is brought down to the low level. With this, an EQ_ signal is also set to the low level for a predetermined duration, thereby setting the C node and C_ node to the same potential. With such settings of signal-line potentials, a latch circuit is formed by using the four transistors MNM, MNM, MP, and MP. Then, WLW is gradually raised from the low level to the high level. As a result, despite the fact that the drain voltages of MNM and MNM are initially at the high level, MNM and MNM experience different amounts of current flows due to the difference in their threshold voltages. Since a threshold voltage shift caused by hot carriers generally appears as a rise of the threshold voltage, MNM has a higher threshold voltage than MNM in the example described above. That is, MNM creates a larger amount of current flow. Due to a latch circuit operation, the drain node of MNM (the gate node of MNM) is set to a slightly higher level than the drain node of MNM (the gate node of MNM). At the end, the RESTORE signal is set to the high level, thereby allowing the information to be transferred to and stored in the conventional-SRAM-cell latch circuit portion comprised of the four transistors MP, MP, MN, and MN. In this manner, the information stored in MNM and MNM is readable from the exterior of the cell by using a conventional SRAM read operation. In the example described above, an electric current difference caused by the threshold voltage difference of MNM and MNM is utilized to transfer nonvolatile information. A similar readout circuit may also be designed by utilizing a principle that the transistor having the lower threshold voltage is turned on first based on the threshold voltage difference.","The embodiments of the present invention have been described with reference to an example in which a change in device characteristics is a change in the threshold caused by hot carriers. Any other phenomenon suffices if it causes a secular change in characteristics due to a continuous flow of a transistor drain current. Further, in , the transistors (MNT, MNT in ) for connecting between the memory cell and the bit lines are used for the purpose of writing information to the nonvolatile memory as well as for the purpose of routine SRAM operation. In order to optimize the performance of the circuit or the like, separate transistors may be provided. Further, in the description of the present invention, the state in which the first transistor has the higher threshold voltage is treated as \u201c0\u201d data, and the state in which the second transistor has the higher threshold voltage is treated as \u201c1\u201d data. Alternatively, such definition may be reversed.","As an advantage of the present invention, the configuration set forth in the claims can achieve a certain object, which is to implement a nonvolatile storage without introducing a new material or an additional manufacturing step to the CMOS-type process, thereby achieving cost reduction and shorter development periods.","Further, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, but various variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","In the following, explanation of reference signs will be provided to facilitate the understanding of the drawings.\n\n"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects and further features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A and 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A and 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A and 12B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A and 13B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A through 14D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A and 15B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A and 16B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A and 17B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A and 18B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
