title: Print intent type
abstract: A system can include a page type classifier to determine a page type of a file. The system can also include a print intent identifier to map the page type of the file to a print intent subtype of the file. The print intent identifier can also map the print intent subtype of the file to a print intent type of the file. The print intent type of the file can characterize a reason to at least one of print and store the file.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Digital printing (or simply printing) refers to methods of creating a digital based image for a variety of media. The digital image can be sent to a printer. In computing, a printer is a peripheral which produces a representation of an electronic file (e.g., a document) on physical media such as paper or transparency film. Some printers are local peripherals connected directly to a nearby personal computer. Some printers are network printers with built-in network interfaces that can serve any user on the network. Some local printers are designed to support both local and network connected users concurrently. Some printers can print documents stored on memory cards or from digital cameras and scanners print.","Digital clipping (or simply clipping) can refer to method of creating a digital based image for storing in data storage. The data storage could be implemented as a volatile or non-volatile machine readable medium (e.g., random access memory, flash memory, a solid state drive, a hard disk drive or the like). Data storage can be offered by third parties (e.g., cloud storage) as network online storage where data can be stored in virtualized pools of storage.","In many instances, there is a relatively strong connection between user interest and a file selected for printing and\/or storing. Such a correlation is typically greater than, for example, user interest in a webpage that is merely viewed on an electronic display. A system can include a print intent analyzer that can leverage the user interest by accurately determining a print intent of a given file that has been selected for printing and\/or storing. The print intent can characterize a reason for printing and\/or storing the given file.","A system can detect that the given file has been selected for printing and\/or storage in a printable format. The given file could be, for example, a webpage, a document, an email or the like. The system can include a page type classifier that can identify a page type (e.g., a topic) of the given file. The page type could be based on a source and\/or content of the given file. The system can also include a print intent identifier to determine a print intent subtype (e.g., a category) for the given file based on the page type of the given file. The print intent identifier could further determine a print intent type of the given file based on the print intent subtype. The print intent type of the given file could be for example, \u201carchive\u201d, \u201cread later\u201d or \u201cuse later\u201d. The print intent type of the given file can be employed, for example, by a recommendation engine to generate supplemental content (e.g., content based on a single print job or a single storage job) and\/or a composite to-print product (e.g., content based on a printing history of a user) based on the print intent type of the given file. By employing this system, the print intent type of the given file can be accurately determined thereby enhancing a probability that the supplemental content and\/or the composite to-print product will be of interest to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","2","4","4","6","8","8","6","4","6"]},"As a further example, the computer  can include a graphical user interface (GUI)  that can be employed to initiate a print job to print the given file on the printer . A print job can be any file or set of files that has been submitted to be printed. Additionally or alternatively, the GUI  can be employed to initiate a storage job to store the given file on data storage . A storage job can be any file or set of files that has been clipped to be stored in the data storage . The data storage  could be implemented, for example, as a file system or database that can store the given file. In some examples, the data storage could be a cloud service (e.g., cloud storage). In such a situation, the term \u201ccloud\u201d can indicate a network fabric that includes a virtualized pool of computers that can be hosted, for example, by a cloud host (e.g., a third party). The given file could represent, for example, a webpage, a document, an email or the like. In many instances, there is a relatively strong connection between user interest and a file selected for printing and\/or storing. Such a correlation is typically greater than, for example, user interest in a webpage that is merely viewed on an electronic display. The system  can include a print intent analyzer  that can leverage the user interest.","The print intent analyzer  can be implemented, for example, on a computer, such as a server. Additionally or alternatively, the print intent analyzer  can be integrated with the computer , the printer  and\/or the data storage . The print intent analyzer  can include a memory resource  to store machine readable instructions. The memory resource  could be implemented, for example, as volatile memory (e.g., random access memory) non-volatile memory (e.g., a hard disk drive, a solid state drive, flash memory or the like). The print intent analyzer  can also include a processing resource  to access the memory resource  and execute the machine readable instructions. The processing resource  could include, for example, a processor core.","The memory resource  can include a page type classifier  that can detect that the computer  has selected the given file for printing and\/or storing. For example, the page type classifier  can detect that a print job on the printer , which includes the given file, has been generated, thereby causing the printer  to print the given file. In another example, the page type classifier  can detect that a storage job for the data storage , which includes the given file, has been generated. In some examples, to detect the print job or storage job, the page type classifier  can receive a print message from a plugin  (e.g., an applet) installed on the computer  that characterizes the given file in the print job or storage job. In other examples, such as where the print intent analyzer  is integrated with a server (e.g., a printer server), the server can provide a similar print message that characterizes the given file in the print job or storage job. Such a characterization of the given file can include, for example, a source of the given file, which source could be implemented as a uniform resource locator (URL), such as where the given file corresponds to a webpage. In some examples, the given file can be included with the print message. In other examples, the given file can be omitted from the print message.","In some examples, the print message can be provided from a storage engine , wherein the print message can indicate that the given file has been selected (e.g., via the plugin ) for storage in a printable format. In such a situation, the print message can also include the source of the given file and the given file itself. The print message can be similar to the print message provided by the plugin . Although the storage engine  is shown and described as being integrated with the print intent analyzer , in other examples, the storage engine  could be implemented on a separate server system and\/or integrated with the computer . In still other examples, the storage engine  could be implemented as a cloud service.","In still other examples, the computer  can include a browser  (e.g., a web browser) that includes a browsing history. In some examples, the plugin  can provide the page type classifier  with access to the browser history. The browser history can include a list of web pages (including a URL) that have been selected to be printed. In the present examples described, the given file could be any one of the web pages included in the browser history that have been selected to be printed.","The page type classifier  can analyze the given file to determine a page type of the given file. The page type of the given file can be determined by the page type classifier  for example, by employing rules and\/or models that have been learnt through a machine learning process. The page type of the given file can characterize a topic of content in the given file. For instance, the page type could be one of a set of page types selected from a receipt, boarding pass, an account summary, a news article, a chart, a map, a form, etc. In some examples, there can be hundreds or thousands of different page types. To determine the content of the given file, the page type classifier  can access the given file either by accessing the source of the given file or by retrieving the given file from the print message.","To determine the page type of the given file, the page type classifier  can assign a score for each page type in a set of page types to generate a set of candidate page types. The score for each of the set of page types can be based, for example, on the rules employed by the print intent identifier . The score could be, for example a confidence value implemented as a fractional value between zero (\u20180\u2019) and one (\u20181\u2019). Additionally, depending on the rules employed to assign the scores for the set of page types, some (or all) of the page types in the set of page types can have multiple scores. In some examples, a page type in the set of page types with a score that is at or above a predetermined value (e.g., 0.51) can be a member of a set of candidate page types. Accordingly, the set of candidate page types can be a subset (e.g., a proper subset) of the set of page types.","The print intent identifier  can examine the score assigned to each of the set of candidate page types and select a given page type for the given file. The selection of the given page type can be based, for example, on a set of rules and\/or on machine learning techniques to arbitrate between the scores assigned for each page type in the candidate page types. For instance, for scores above a predetermined value (e.g., 0.7 or more), the page type classifier  can examine the content of the given file to more accurately determine a probability that the given file is the given page type.","In some instances, the score of each of the set of page types may not meet the predetermined value, such that there are no members in the set of candidate page types. In such a situation, in some examples, a new page type can be generated for the given file. The new page type can be based, for example, on machine learning techniques by evaluating similar webpages that have been printed to determine the new page type. Additionally or alternatively, new rules can be added that can be employed to determine a score for the new page type. In other examples, the given page can be assigned a page type of \u201cunclassified\u201d by the page type classifier .","The page type of the given file and the given file can be provided to a print intent identifier . The print intent identifier  can examine the page type of the given file and map the page type to an associated print intent subtype, which can characterize a category of the content of the given file. In some examples, if the page type is a receipt, or a reservation, the given file can be mapped to a print intent subtype of \u201ctransactional\u201d. Alternatively, if the page type of the given file is assigned a page type of \u201cnews article\u201d or \u201cweather report\u201d, the given file can be mapped to a print intent subtype of \u201cinformational\u201d. Still further, in examples where the given file is assigned a page type of \u201cgame\u201d or \u201cform\u201d, the given file can be mapped to a print intent subtype of \u201cfill-in\u201d. In examples where the page type is assigned \u201cunclassified\u201d, the given file can be mapped to a print intent subtype of \u201cunclassified\u201d. Additionally, in examples, where the page type is not mapped to a print intent subtype, the print intent identifier  can employ rules and\/or machine learning techniques to generate a new print intent subtype for the given file or to map the given file to an already existing print intent subtype.","The print intent identifier  can map the given file to a print intent type based on the print intent subtype. The print intent type of the given file can represent a reason that the given file has been printed. For example, if the given file has a print intent subtype of \u201ctransactional\u201d, the given file can be mapped to a print intent type of \u201carchive\u201d. An archive print intent type can indicate that the given file, upon printing and\/or storing, is likely to be deposited by a user into long-term physical storage (e.g., a filing cabinet). Additionally, if the print intent subtype of the given file is \u201cinformational\u201d, the given file can be mapped to a print intent type of \u201cread later\u201d by the print intent identifier . A read later print intent type can indicate that the user is likely to read content in the given file after the given file has been printed. Further, if the print intent subtype of the given file is \u201cfill-in\u201d, the print intent identifier  can map the given file to a print intent type of \u201cuse later\u201d. The use later print intent type can indicate that the user is likely to physically interact with (e.g., write on) the given file upon printing and\/or storing and\/or physically present (e.g., redeem) the given file to another person upon printing and\/or storing.","In some examples, the print intent type of the given file can be provided to a recommendation engine . The recommendation engine  can employ the print intent type to generate supplemental content for the given file. The supplemental content can be, for example, printable content that can be selected based on the given file. In another example, the recommendation engine  can be employed to generate a composite to-print product that can be based on multiple instances of a given file being selected to be printed (e.g., a print history). The supplemental content and\/or the composite to-print product can be provided to the computer  via the plugin . The computer  can output the supplemental content and\/or the composite to-print product via the GUI , such that a user can elect or decline to print the supplemental content and\/or the composite print product at the printer .","In other examples, the print intent type and the given file can be provided to the storage engine  that can store the given file in the data storage  in a printable format (e.g., the portable document format (PDF), HyperText Markup Language (HTML), a word processing document, or the like), which can be referred to as a printable page. In such a situation, the storage engine  can store multiple printable pages sorted (e.g., categorized) by the print intent type of each printable page. In some examples, if the given file is stored in the data storage , the given file may be printed at a later time or may not be printed.","By employment of the system , the print intent type of the given file can be accurately ascertained. Accordingly, the user experience with systems that rely on the print intent type of a given file to generate supplemental content, a composite print product or to store a printable page can be enhanced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["50","12","50","52","52","52","50","54","52","54","50","56","58"]},"The memory resource  can include a page type classifier  that can detect that a given file has been selected for printing and\/or storing. In such a situation, the given file can be already printed, be in the process of being printed or will be printed in the future (e.g., a print job or storage job that includes the given file has been generated). Alternatively, the page type classifier  can receive an indication from a storage engine  included in the memory resource  that the given file is to be stored in a printable format (e.g., PDF). In the present examples, the storage engine  is illustrated and described as being integrated with the print intent analyzer . However, in other examples, the storage engine  could be implemented externally and communicate with the print intent analyzer  via the network . In either situation, for purposes of simplification of explanation, it is presumed that the given file has been selected to be printed. The given file can represent a document, such as a web page, a word processing document, a spreadsheet, an email or the like. In some examples, the page type classifier  can receive a print message notifying the page type classifier  of the printing (or storing) of the given file. The print message can include, for example, a source of the given file (e.g., a URL). Moreover, in some examples, the print message can include the given file. In other examples the given file can be omitted from the print message.","The page type classifier  can be programmed to retrieve the given file. The given file can be retrieved by the page type classifier  either from the print message or from the source of the given file. Additionally, the page type classifier  can determine the page type of document that the given file includes. In some examples, the given file may be a private document or a public document. Examples of a private document include, for instance, a bank account statement, a web page with a secure URL (e.g., an https:\/\/www.example.com), word processing document or a spreadsheet. If it is determined that the given file is a private document, the print intent analyzer  can be designed such that no print intent type for the given file is determined. Accordingly, upon determining that the given file is a private document, the page type classifier  can cease further processing and discard the print message. In some examples, the determination as to whether the given file is a private document can be based on a set of page type rules extracted from data storage . The data storage  could be implemented, for example as volatile memory, non-volatile memory or a combination thereof. Moreover, although the data storage  is illustrated and described as being integrated with the print intent analyzer , in some examples, the data storage  could be implemented on the network  (e.g., cloud storage). In some examples, the print rules can include a list of websites and information characterizing a nature of the website. For instance, the page type rules may specify that if the given file's source is http:\/\/mail.example.com, that the given file is an email, and is therefore a private document.","Additionally or alternatively, the page type classifier  can employ a page type model stored in the data storage  to determine whether the given file is a private document. The page type model could be a model generated, for example, by machine learning techniques (e.g., a classifier, a neural network or the like). For instance, the page type model can specify keywords in a URL associated with the given file and\/or keywords in the content of the given file to determine whether the given file is a private document.","If the page type classifier  determines that the given file is not a private document (e.g., the given file contains publically available information), a candidate page type scorer  of the page type classifier  can determine a set of candidate page types from a set of page types.

Instead, Table 1 includes examples of page types that could be employed as a portion of the set of page types. The candidate page type scorer  can assign a score (e.g., a confidence score) to each page type in the set of page types. The score can be, for example, a fractional value between zero (\u20180\u2019) and one (\u20181\u2019). In some examples, the score of each page type in the set of page types can be determined by machine learning techniques. Additionally or alternatively, the score of each page type in the set of page types can be determined by a set of rules. Equation 1 includes an example of a general form of a statement (e.g., a computer instruction) that could be employed to implement a rule for determining the score for each of the set of page types.\n\n1 2 , Score;\u2003\u2003Equation 1:\n","wherein:","C is a given page type of the list of page types (e.g., News, Chart, etc.);","R1, R2 . . .

Moreover, as shown with respect to Equations 4-5, more than one logical statement can be associated with the same page type in the set of page types. In such a situation, the candidate page type scorer  can assign multiple scores to a given page type of the set of page types. The candidate page type scorer  can evaluate the scores of each of the page types in the set of page types to determine a set of candidate page types. For instance, the candidate page type scorer  can include each page type of the set of page types that has a score greater than a predetermined value (e.g., 0.51) in the set of candidate page types. Accordingly, the set of candidate page type can be a subset (e.g., a proper subset) of the set of page types. In some examples, if no page type has a score that meets the predetermined value, the candidate page type scorer  can include page types in the set of page types with the highest score (still below the predetermined value). In other examples, if no page type has a score that meets the predetermined value, the candidate page type scorer  can indicate that the set of candidate page types is an empty set. The set of candidate page types and associated scores (including multiple scores for a given candidate page type in a set of candidate page types, if applicable) can be provided to a page type selector  of the page type classifier .","The page type selector  can arbitrate between the page types included in the set of candidate page types to select a page type for the given file.

In another example, if a given page type in the set of candidate page types has scores of \u20180.8\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 while another page type in the set of candidate page types has a single score of \u20180.9\u2019, the page type selector  can select the given page type as the page type for the given file.","In still another example, if a given page type in the set of candidate page types has a score of \u20180.9\u2019 and while another page type in the set of candidate page types has also has a score of \u20180.9\u2019, the page type selector  can parse the content of the given file (which content can be stored at the source of the given file) and can apply additional rules and\/or machine learning techniques to further differentiate between the given and the another page types in the set of candidate page types. Such additional rules and\/or machine learning techniques can include, for example, calculating a probability for each of the given and the other page types, each probability indicating whether the page type for the given file should be matched with the given and the other page type included in the set of candidate page types. Since such additional rules and\/or machine learning techniques may require intensive computer processing, reducing the set of page types to the set of candidate page types (by the candidate page type scorer ) can increase an overall efficiency of the page type classifier .","Additionally, in some examples, the page type selector  may determine that no page type included in the candidate page types is satisfactory for the given file.

Alternatively, the page type selector  can employ machine learning techniques to generate a new page type based on an analysis of content of the given file as and\/or content of similar files that have been selected for printing and\/or storing.

The print intent subtype of the given file can be provided to a print intent type mapper  of the print intent identifier .","The print intent type mapper  can map a print intent subtype to a print intent type. The print intent type can characterize a reason that the given file has been selected for printing and\/or storing. The print intent type could be, for example, \u201carchive\u201d, \u201cread-later\u201d or \u201cuse-later\u201d. A print intent type of archive could indicate that the given file (upon printing and\/or storing) is likely to be physically stored in long-term storage (e.g., a filing cabinet). A print intent type of read-later can indicate that the given file (upon printing and\/or storing) is likely to be read by a user at a later time (e.g., a few second to several months later). A print intent type of use-later can indicate that the given file (upon printing and\/or storing) is intended to be either physically interacted with (e.g., written on) or presented to another person (e.g., redeemed). Moreover, if the print intent subtype of the given file is unclassified, the print intent type mapper  can select a print intent type of unclassified for the given file. There is a high probability that a given subtype accurately corresponds to a given print intent type. Thus, instances where the subtype of the given file is not mapped to a print intent type, the print intent type mapper  can employ rules and\/or machine learning techniques to map the subtype of the given file to a print intent type.
