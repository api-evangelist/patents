Embodiments of the disclosure can be equipped with a variety of communications interfaces that facilitate communication with home devices. First, a general description of one example of an environment in which an embodiment of the disclosure may operate is described.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments.

As one example, a home device can comprise a computing device, mobile device, or any device coupled to a local area network with which the gateway device  is connected. In the context of this disclosure, a home device  can include an device that can receive and\/or transmit data to or from the gateway device  via a direct connection to the gateway device  and\/or via a home network  to which the gateway device  is coupled.","Network traffic among and to home devices that may be directly coupled to the gateway device , a home network  and\/or a wide area network  can be managed by the gateway device . In other words, network traffic destined for a home device  in communication with the gateway device  can be passed (e.g., routed, or bridged.) through the gateway device . In this way, applications executed within the gateway device  can act upon network traffic to and from home devices  as well as from devices communicating with the gateway device  via a wide area network .","Therefore, the gateway device  can be employed in a residential setting and act as a conduit between the various home networks , wide area networks , home devices , and other devices and\/or users that may be in communication with the gateway device . The home networks  include, for example, a local area network (LAN), such as an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 (Ethernet) network, a wireless local area network, such as an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, etc., network. The home networks  can also include an IEEE 802.15.4-2003 low rate wireless or wired personal area network. The home networks  can also include a networking complying with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) G.9960, which is also known as a G.hn network. The home networks  can also include any of a variety of optical networks like GPON (G.984), EPON (IEEE 802.3), APON or BPON (G.983) etc (hereafter referred collectively as xPON) or any other standards based or proprietary network in which home devices  can communicate with the gateway device.

The wide area networks can include a network connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP) that provides access to the Internet through various forms of service. For example, the wide area network  can include a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection that provides access to the Internet via and Internet service provider backbone. As another example, the wide area network  can include a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) connection that provides access to the Internet via an Internet service provider backbone. As yet another example, the wide area network  can include an optical network connection like GPON (G.984), EPON (IEEE 802.3), APON or BPON (G.983) or similar, that provides access to the Internet via an Internet service provider backbone. A wide area network  can also include a wired network like Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) through which the Internet or other networks can be accessed. A wide area network  can also include a wireless network through which the Internet or other networks can be accessed. As some examples, such a wireless network can include a 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) data network, a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UTMS) data network, or other wireless networks as can be appreciated. A wide area network  can also include a connection to a telephone system (Pots), public switched telephone system (PSTN), voice-over-IP network (VoIP), Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) line, and other systems and protocols that support voice and data transmission.","Accordingly, the gateway device  can include one or more communications interfaces  to communicate with the various possible home networks  and\/or home devices  to which the gateway device  can be paired. In one embodiment, the communications interfaces  can include hardware connections that implement a hardware connectivity standard specified by a particular networking or other communications, audio and\/or video standard. For example, the gateway device  can include an HDMI connection to facilitate connectivity to a home device  such as a television. As another example, the gateway device  can include an Ethernet port to facilitate connection to a computing device, router, and\/or switch implementing the 802.3 standard. As yet another example, the gateway device  can include a wireless chipset and\/or antenna system that implements an 802.11 wireless networking standard. As yet another example, the gateway device  can include an optical chipset and\/or system that implements any of the optical networking standards. A gateway device  operating system or other libraries or application programming interfaces (API) provided by the gateway device  can provide software level access to the various hardware communications standards supported by the gateway device . The hardware and software connectivity interfaces are referred to herein collectively as communications interfaces .","In some embodiments, a modem, signal decoder, or other device external to the gateway device  can facilitate access to a wide area network  and\/or home network , and the gateway device  can communicate with such a device via another standard or proprietary network interface. For example, an external VDSL modem device can provide access to a VDSL wide area network, and allow the gateway device  or other devices access to the VDSL wide area network via Ethernet.","Similarly, the wide area network interfaces  can allow the gateway device  to communicate with the various possible wide area networks  and\/or other remote devices to which the gateway device  can be paired. In one embodiment, the communications interfaces  can include hardware connections that implement a hardware connectivity standard specified by a particular networking or other communications, audio and\/or video standard. For example, the wide area network interfaces can include an LTE radio and antenna system that facilitate connectivity with an LTE network. As another example, the wide area network interfaces  can include DSL modem hardware that facilitates connectivity with an Internet service provider network. A gateway device  operating system or other libraries or application programming interfaces (API) provided by the gateway device  can provide software level access to the various hardware communications standards supported by the gateway device . The hardware and software connectivity interfaces are referred to herein collectively as the communications interface .","The gateway device  can also include a mass storage  component. The mass storage  component can include any hard disk drive, solid state drive, flash memory, or other storage medium that can house data related to the gateway device . The mass storage  component can house content on behalf of computing devices on a home network , data related to home appliances communicating with the gateway device , wide area networks , routing tables associated with the routing of network traffic through the gateway device , and other data as can be appreciated. The mass storage  component can also be external to the gateway device  and accessible via a network connection, input\/output interface. In some embodiments, the mass storage  can be resident on another computing device external to the gateway device .","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the gateway device  according to various embodiments. The components executed on the gateway device , for example, include an application engine , which can execute one or more other applications that leverage the communications interfaces , the WAN interfaces , devices on the LAN and WAN interfaces, and\/or the mass storage  resources of the gateway device  to provide various functionality in a variety of combinations, as will be described herein. The gateway device  may also execute other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The application engine  is executed to provide a framework in which applications can access hardware services and\/or resources of the gateway device  to communicate with one or more home devices coupled to a home network  and\/or the gateway device  itself. Such an application can also access WANs to which the gateway device  is connected. Accordingly, various APIs can be provided through which applications can be authored for execution on the gateway device . For example, the gateway device  can provide a wide area connection API, which can allow an application executed in the gateway device  can access the Internet to communicate with other systems. As another example, the gateway device  can provide a home network API through which such an application can access home devices that may be coupled thereto.","The gateway device  can be in communication with one or more clients with which a user can interact. The gateway device  can provide an administrative user interface that allows a user on a client to access various configurations as well as access to operational parameters of the gateway device  and applications executed on the gateway device . For example, a user on a client can access such a user interface to query or modify gateway network settings, mass storage configurations, and other configurations. As another example, a user on a client can access such a user interface to modify a configuration of an application. To illustrate, an application that filters network traffic passed from the gateway device  to a home network  can allow a user to query and\/or modify the content filtering settings via such a user interface. A client is representative of a one or more of devices that may be coupled to the gateway device , the wide area networks , and\/or home networks . A client may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer device. Such a computer device may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, set-top box, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, mobile devices, or other devices with like capability. A client may be used to configure, operate or query various aspects of the gateway or the home-device's operation. A client may also be configured to execute various applications such as a browser and\/or other special purpose applications for the purpose of interacting with a user interface for the purpose of accessing content facilitated by the gateway device  or for the purpose of accessing a home device connected through the gateway device . Applications on the gateway may also cooperate to achieve a varying objectives. For example, a user may specify a target monthly-dollar-amount for ALL of the utilities combined. The application may be intelligent enough to determine limits that should then be set for water, gas, electricity, and other utilities. This could be done in a variety of ways, such as, for example, the application could look at past-usage data for these utilities and set limits, or it could use configured rules to determine the partitioning (e.g., no more than 50% of the monthly dollars should go to electricity etc).","Next, some non-limiting illustrative examples of applications that can be implemented in a gateway device  according to an embodiment of the disclosure are discussed. In one embodiment, an energy monitoring application  can be executed in the gateway device  that communicates with home devices such as home appliances that are in communication with the gateway device  via a home network . For example, home appliances can report energy usage information and other data with which an energy monitoring application  executed by the application engine  can make determinations regarding operational conditions of the appliance. The energy monitoring application  can also allow a user, via a client in communication with the gateway device  via a wide area network  and\/or home network  to modify the operational state or condition of an appliance or other home device. An operational condition can include the various operational states in which a home appliance or other device can be placed. For example, a refrigerator in communication with the application may report its energy usage, internal temperature, water usage, and other data. A heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit may report internal and\/or external air temperatures, energy consumption, data from which energy consumption can be derived, and other data. Such application can also allow interaction with other home devices, such as, lighting systems, window covering systems, and other systems that can be monitored, controlled and\/or actuated via a home network .","Accordingly, an energy monitoring application  can allow a user via a client in communication with the gateway device  via a home network  and\/or wide area network  to modify the operational state of a home device. The gateway device  could generate a user interface that can be displayed on a client and that reports an operating state and operating data of various appliances and other devices communicating with the gateway device  via a home network . A user can modify an operational state of an appliance or device via such a user interface. Alternatively, the client could also execute a specialized application that \u201cknows\u201d about the device and can directly query\/configure the device. For example, a user can cause a lighting system in a particular room to turn on and\/or off by initiating a request from a client to the gateway device ; the gateway would then query the lighting system to determine its state; if the lights were already in the desired state\u2014it would respond to the user with that information; if the lights were not in the desired state, it would forward the request to the lighting system which would make the appropriate changes. As another example, a user can modify whether a window covering system, such as window blinds, shades, or other mechanically actuated that can communicate via a home network , are open or closed by initiating a request from a client that is forwarded by the gateway device. As yet another example, a user can modify a temperature setting associated with an HVAC system and\/or refrigerator by initiating a request from a client that includes a temperature setting. The control function could also interact with the energy monitoring system, and notify the user that raising the temperature of the home (e.g., in winter) could lead to higher-than-configured expenses on gas for the current month (as configured in the energy monitoring system).","The energy monitoring system can also receive data about an energy pricing model that defines a particular energy price charged to a homeowner during a particular time of day, season, year, etc., where the varying prices are based at least upon user demand. Accordingly, the energy monitoring system can monitor usage of home devices such as appliances and other devices as well as modify the operational state of home devices to manage energy consumption in a way that reduces energy costs to the user. As one example, the energy monitoring application  can reduce an operational state of a clothes dryer (e.g., operating speed, temperature, etc.) during a high demand time of day when energy is priced higher relative to a low demand time of day. In this example, the gateway device  can reduce a spin speed of the dryer during a high priced period and increase the spin speed during a lower priced period. As another example, the energy monitoring application  can modify the operational state of an HVAC system (e.g., temperature, fan speed, etc.) based upon the pricing model of the current time of day.","As another example, the energy monitoring application  executed by gateway device  can communicate with an electric vehicle charging system that is configured to communicate via a home network . The application can detect when a vehicle is connected to the vehicle charging system and initiate vehicle charging during a low demand and\/or low price-of-energy time of day, such as overnight. The energy monitoring application  can also allow utility usage among devices in a home and\/or as tracked by a utility metering device to be tracked to within a specified threshold. If utility usage among devices connected to a home network  is within a specified threshold, the energy monitoring application  can modify the operational states of various home devices coupled to a home network . For example, if water usage as communicated to the gateway device  by a water metering device reflects that water usage within a billing period is approaching a specified threshold, the gateway device  can take various actions to conserve water usage in the home. As some examples, the energy monitoring application  can issue a command to a washing machine to enter a low water use mode until the next billing period commences.","As another example, if energy usage among home devices coupled to a home network  and\/or as tracked by an electricity metering device reflects that energy usage within a home is approaching a threshold that can be specified by a user, then the gateway device  can similarly take actions to reduce energy consumption in the home. For example, the gateway device  can modify an operational state, such as a temperature setting, of an HVAC system. Additionally, an energy monitoring application  can also be configured to enforce an appliance utility usage quota for a specified time period. In one example, a user can, via a user interface on a client, set an energy usage quota for a particular appliance coupled to a home network . As another example, a user can set a time usage quota for a specified time period. To illustrate such a quota, a user can set a time usage quota for a television coupled to the gateway device , after which the device can be disabled. Such monitoring can also be done per device per time-of-day or can be done per-user, per-device, per time-of-day.","The energy monitoring application  can also receive data from utility metering devices (e.g., water, electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, Internet usage, telephone, etc.) that are in communication with a home network  and forward usage data to a computing system corresponding to a utility provider for usage monitoring and billing purposes.","Some service providers may require a secure communication channel to their monitoring devices (e,g, power\/water\/gas meters). Others may want to have the gateway collect this data on a more-frequent interval and simply obtain this data on a periodic basis. Still others may want to have the utility metering on a separate administrative interface. The applications running on the application engine can address these varying requirements.","In one embodiment, the application engine  can execute a content access application , which can manage access to content accessible to the gateway device . As one example, the content access application  can provide access via a home network  and\/or wide area network  to content that is stored in the mass storage  of the gateway device . Content such as audio, video, or other content, can be hosted in the gateway device  mass storage  and accessed by a client in communication with the gateway device  via a wide area network . In such a scenario, the gateway device  can stream content requested by a client via a wide area network  and\/or allow the client to download requested content from the gateway device . In one embodiment, a mobile device can communicate with the gateway device  via an LTE network, for example, and stream music or video content housed within the mass storage  or any other media library accessible to the gateway device .","The application engine  can also execute a content scheduler , which can executes requests on behalf of clients in a time-shifted fashion. In one example, the content scheduler , can receive a request from a client to retrieve content (e.g., a movie, software, or any other content), and subsequently schedule the retrieval of content from a content provider according to various parameters that can be configured by a user. In another example, the content scheduler  can retrieve the requested content from a content provider on behalf of the user during periods of low bandwidth consumption on a home network  and\/or wide area network  by other home devices. In yet another example, the content scheduler  can retrieve the requested content on behalf of a user during an off-peak bandwidth usage time, which can be determined based upon an increased bandwidth usage billing that may be charged by an Internet service provider. An alternative way to determine an off-peak bandwidth usage period can include analyzing historical Internet usage by home devices coupled to a home network , and determining times of day in which less bandwidth is consumed, on average relative to other times of day. Accordingly, the content scheduler  can schedule a content download task during these off-peak periods of historical bandwidth usage. A content download task scheduled by the content scheduler  can download the requested content and store the content for later retrieval by a client in the gateway device  mass storage . Additionally, a client can remotely initiate request for the gateway device  to download content via a wide area network  via a user interface on the client. Accordingly, a content download task can be generated by the gateway device  that retrieves the requested content from a content provider via a wide area network  and stored in the gateway device  mass storage  for later retrieval from within a home network .","Additionally, various application executed by the application engine  can share data regarding home devices, tasks, and other data to optimize their operation. As one example, as referenced above, an application executed in the gateway device  can track historical Internet usage and determine whether usage on a particular home network  is reduced during a particular time window. Accordingly, an energy monitoring application  can issue a command to a router device or devices operating on the home networks  to operating in a reduced power consumption state or an off state during these time windows. Sharing of data between applications executed in the application engine  can be achieved through a suitable communication API between applications. Applications can be configured to store data in the gateway device mass storage  so it can be accessed even if the generating application is not active.","Another example of applications that can be executed in the application engine  in the gateway device  is illustrated by the content monitoring application . A content monitoring application  can facilitate content filtering, network traffic management, and other network management tasks. As noted above, network traffic originated by or destined for home devices can be passed through the gateway device . Accordingly, the content monitoring application  can be configured monitor network traffic associated with a home device and\/or user to enforce the type of content that can be accessed by a given user, through a given device at a given time-of-day and\/or time-of-month. In one embodiment, various usage quotas can be designated for the various users and\/or home devices  coupled, and the content monitoring application  can identify whether network traffic is associated with a user and\/or a home device . The content monitoring application  can track usage data during a specified time period (e.g., day, week, month, etc.), and generate a notification transmitted to one of a designated client, the user and\/or the home device  if a usage quota is approached and\/or exceeded. In some embodiments, the gateway device  can reject and\/or throttle additional network traffic associated with the user and\/or home device  when a bandwidth usage quota is exceeded. Additionally, the content monitoring application  can allow monitor type of content in traffic that is internal to a home network  and\/or that traverses the gateway device  to\/from a wide area network .","The content monitoring application  can also filter network traffic based at least upon the content contained therein. For example, a user can set up parental controls for certain devices and\/or users on a home network , which the content monitoring application  can enforce. In one embodiment, the content monitoring application  can reject requests to access content from a site via a wide area network  that are on a banned content list that can be configured by a user. In other words, the content monitoring application  can be configured by a user with various restrictions as well as a corresponding action to be taken upon identifying the restriction.","Another example of an application that could execute on the application engine  is Virus Protection. A virus monitoring application scans network traffic that is passed between a wide area network  and home area network  looking for virus-infected traffic. If it finds such traffic, it can take a corresponding action, such as disconnecting that traffic stream, notifying a designated client or user as per its configuration.","Other applications aside from those illustrated in the depicted example can be executed by the application engine . As an additional example, a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel application can be executed by the gateway device . Such an application can, for example, establish an encrypted or secure tunnel to a third party site that is accessible via a wide area network . Accordingly, network traffic from a home device and\/or the gateway device  that is destined for such a site can be passed through the secure tunnel.","As another example of an application that can be executed by the application engine , a network service level agreement (SLA) application establish and\/or enforce an SLA that is associated with network traffic among one or more home networks  or between home networks  and a wide area network . As one example, the gateway device  can determine a type of traffic that is requested by a home device  and allocate a set of traffic parameters (e.g., bandwidth, jitter, latency, etc.) with the network traffic. The network SLA application can identify a home device  and\/or a type of network traffic as voice traffic associated with a telephone service. Accordingly, the network SLA application can enforce the traffic parameters for voice traffic that is passed through the gateway device . As another example, the gateway device  can identify certain network traffic as a video stream, and associate a set of traffic parameters appropriate for delivery of the video stream to a home device . If the network SLA application is unable to allocate the necessary resources to meet the desired SLA, it can generate a notification that can be transmitted to a designated client and\/or to the home device  associated with the type of traffic that can inform a user that an SLA cannot be enforced within the home network  to which the home device  is coupled. Alternatively, and if configured to do so, it can prioritize one kind of traffic over another kind of traffic (e.g., prioritize voice traffic over data). As another example, a request from a client via a wide area network  can comprise a request to stream content from a home device  (e.g., outbound streaming). Accordingly, the network SLA application can identify a type of traffic associated with outbound traffic and enforce the traffic parameters if network resources are available. In other words, the network SLA application can identify and enforce traffic parameters on an ingress and\/or egress interface, which can be any of the home networks  and\/or wide area networks .","Referring next to , shown is one example of an arrangement of a gateway device  as well as various local area networks  and\/or wide area networks  of any standard or proprietary nature. In the depicted example, the gateway device  can be coupled to an 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) , which is a home network. Additionally, various computing devices  can be in communication with the gateway device  as well as other computing devices  via the 802.11 WLAN . The depicted gateway device  is also in communication with a display device . In one embodiment, such a display device  can receive video content, notifications, or other data from the gateway device . The gateway device  is also coupled to a low-rate personal area network with which home appliances can communicate with the gateway device . The gateway device can also be coupled to an 802.15.4-2003 network as well as various home appliances , utility metering devices , or other devices that can communicate via such a network. In the depicted example, the gateway device  is also coupled to various wide area networks . In the non-limiting illustration, the gateway device  is coupled to a VDSL network , an LTE network , a UTMS network , and a xPON network . In some embodiments, the wide area networks  can provide access to the Internet  or other public and\/or private networks.","Turning now to , shown is one illustration that depicts an operation of the gateway device  as well as an application executed thereon. In the depicted example, a home appliance application can receive a request  from a mobile device  via the Internet  to change an operating state of a home appliance  coupled to a home network such as an 802.15.4-2003 LAN . Accordingly, the home appliance application can pass such a request in a format that can be processed by the designated home appliance ","Turning now to , shown is one illustration that depicts an operation of the gateway device  as well as an application executed thereon. In the depicted example, a home appliance application can receive a request  from a client  via the Internet  to change an operating state of a home appliance  coupled to a home network such as an 802.15.4-2003 LAN . Accordingly, the home appliance application can pass such a request in a format that can be processed by the designated home appliance ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["305","335","215","233","215","305","233"],"i":["a ","c","c.

In the depicted non-limiting example, a home appliance application executed in the gateway device  can receive utility usage data from one or more utility metering devices , and forward usage data  to a utility system  for usage monitoring and\/or billing purposes. It should be appreciated that the examples shown in  are merely illustrative of applications and functionality that can be implemented in a gateway device  according to embodiments of the disclosure.
