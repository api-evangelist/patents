{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,822 filed Sep. 12, 2008, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/972,646 filed Sep. 14, 2007, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","I. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of molecular biology. More particularly, it concerns methods and compositions involving microRNA (miRNAs) molecules. Certain aspects of the invention include applications for miRNAs in diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostics of cervical cancer.","II. Background","In 2001, several groups used a cloning method to isolate and identify a large group of \u201cmicroRNAs\u201d (miRNAs) from , and humans (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001; Lau et al., 2001; Lee and Ambros, 2001). Several hundred miRNAs have been identified in plants and animals\u2014including humans\u2014which do not appear to have endogenous siRNAs. Thus, while similar to siRNAs, miRNAs are distinct.","miRNAs thus far observed have been approximately 21-22 nucleotides in length, and they arise from longer precursors, which are transcribed from non-protein-encoding genes. See review of Carrington et al. (2003). The precursors form structures that fold back on themselves in self-complementary regions; they are then processed by the nuclease Dicer (in animals) or DCL1 (in plants) to generate the short double-stranded miRNA. One of the miRNA strands is incorporated into a complex of proteins and miRNA called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The miRNA guides the RISC complex to a target mRNA, which is then cleaved or translationally silenced, depending on the degree of sequence complementarity of the miRNA to its target mRNA. Currently, it is believed that perfect or nearly perfect complementarity leads to mRNA degradation, as is most commonly observed in plants. In contrast, imperfect base pairing, as is primarily found in animals, leads to translational silencing. However, recent data suggest additional complexity (Bagga et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2005), and mechanisms of gene silencing by miRNAs remain under intense study.","Recent studies have shown that expression levels of numerous miRNAs are associated with various cancers (reviewed in Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006; Calin and Croce, 2006). miRNAs have also been implicated in regulating cell growth and cell and tissue differentiation\u2014cellular processes that are associated with the development of cancer.","Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer in women worldwide (Pisani et al., 2002; Parkin et al., 2005). About 470,000 new cases are diagnosed and approximately 230,000 women die of cervical cancer every year (Pisani et al., 1999). While the majority (\u02dc80%) of these new cases and deaths occur in developing countries, it is estimated that approximately 3,700 women will die from invasive cervical cancer in the United States in 2007 (Jemal et al., 2007).","Epidemiological and molecular studies have demonstrated that human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiological agents of the vast majority (99.7%) of cervical cancers and their intraepithelial precursors (Pisani, et al., 2002; Parkin et al., 2005; zur Hausen, 2002). Approximately, fifty HPV types infect the anogenital tract including the uterine cervix (Pisani, et al., 2002; Parkin et al., 2005). \u201cHigh-risk\u201d HPV types are associated with intraepithelial lesions that can progress into invasive carcinomas. Among these, HPV 16 and HPV 18 are associated with 50% and 20%, respectively, of cervical squamous cell carcinomas (Bosch and de Sanjose, 2002; zur Hausen, 2002; Clifford et al., 2003). Other high-risk HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, and 45 among others) are found in 20-30% of cervical cancers (Bosch and de Sanjose, 2002; zur Hausen, 2002; Clifford et al., 2003). High-risk HPV types are also associated with 25% of head and neck tumors, in particular tumors of the mouth, tonsils, esophagus and larynx (Gillison et al., 2000; Rose et al., 2006).","Cytological examination of cervical smears with Papanicolaou staining (Pap smears) is the screening method universally accepted for early detection of cervical cancer and its precursors. Pap smear screening has been very effective in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Abnormal pap smear results include mild dysplasias referred to as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and moderate to severe dysplasias referred to as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). A Pap smear with LSIL or HSIL indicates a need for further examination and possible treatment. In one study (ALTS Group, 2000), over 80% of LSILs were found to be positive for HPV; however, almost 50% of LSILs will regress to normal. HSILs are generally considered to be pre-cancerous in nature and indicate more aggressive treatment. In addition, as many as 3 million Pap smears are classified as inconclusive in the U.S. every year, and cervical cancer is still a significant public health problem. Pap smear screening is imperfect due, in part, to sampling and staining errors, resulting in false-negatives. It is estimated that \u02dc17% of cervical cancers develop in women with previous false-negative Pap smears. It is also estimated that approximately 9% of cervical cancers develop in women with previous true-negative Pap tests.","As an adjunct to cytology screening, The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved a nucleic acid hybridization test for HPV for all women over 30 years old and as triage for women with inconclusive Pap smears. However, several problems associated with this assay include variable assay sensitivity, the inability to genotype certain strains of HPV, and the inability to detect about half of the high risk HPV types associated with cervical cancer (Begeron et al., 2000; de Cremoux et al., 2006).","A need exists for additional diagnostic assays that can assess the condition of cervical tissue in general and accurately distinguish pre-cancerous or cancerous tissue from non-cancerous tissue in particular.","Embodiments of the invention include compositions and methods of identifying miRNAs that are differentially expressed or mis-regulated in various states of normal, pre-cancerous, cancerous, and\/or abnormal tissues, including but not limited to normal cervical tissue, pre-cancerous diseased cervical tissue (e.g., low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)), squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer (e.g., cervical squamous cell carcinoma), squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and vagina, penile intraepithelial lesions, anal cancer, cancers of the digestive tract, oral cancers, a subset of head and neck cancers, and tonsil cancer. In certain aspects, the cancers are related to or a result of HPV infection. In other aspects a subject known or at risk of infection with HPV can be monitored. In still a further aspect, a subject can be monitored periodically, e.g. miRNA assays can be conducted in conjunction with pap smears or non-invasive procedures or procedures with limited invasiveness (e.g., swabbing or flushing and the like). The method of sampling is not intended to be a limiting factor and is at the discretion of the care giver. Further, the invention describes a method for diagnosing normal, pre-cancerous, and cancerous tissues or cells, including but not limited to cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer based on determining levels (increased or decreased) of selected miRNAs in patient-derived samples. Samples may be obtained and\/or analyzed from patients, including but not limited to patients having or suspected of having pre-cancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer, or a patient suspected of having one or the other condition.","The term \u201cmiRNA\u201d is used according to its ordinary and plain meaning and refers to a microRNA molecule found in eukaryotes that is involved in RNA-based gene regulation. See, e.g., Carrington et al., 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Individual miRNAs in a variety of organisms have been identified, sequenced, and given names. Names of miRNAs and their sequences related to the present invention are provided herein.","It is understood that a \u201csynthetic nucleic acid\u201d of the invention means that the nucleic acid does not have a chemical structure or sequence of a naturally occurring nucleic acid or is made by non-natural processes. Consequently, it will be understood that the term \u201csynthetic miRNA\u201d refers to a \u201csynthetic nucleic acid\u201d that functions as or inhibits the functions of an miRNA, at least in part, in a cell or under physiological conditions.","While many of the embodiments of the invention involve synthetic miRNAs or synthetic nucleic acids, in some embodiments of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule(s) need not be \u201csynthetic.\u201d In certain embodiments, a non-synthetic miRNA employed in methods and compositions of the invention may have all or part of the sequence and structure of a naturally occurring miRNA precursor or the mature miRNA. For example, non-synthetic miRNAs used in methods and compositions of the invention may not have one or more modified nucleotides or nucleotide analogs. In these embodiments, the non-synthetic miRNA may or may not be recombinantly produced. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid in methods and\/or compositions of the invention is specifically a synthetic miRNA; though in other embodiments, the invention specifically involves a non-synthetic miRNA and not a synthetic miRNA. Any embodiments discussed with respect to the use of synthetic miRNAs can be applied with respect to non-synthetic miRNAs, and vice versa.","It will be understood that the term \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d refers to something found in an organism without any intervention by a person; it could refer to a naturally-occurring wildtype or mutant molecule. In some embodiments a synthetic miRNA molecule does not have the sequence of a naturally occurring miRNA molecule. In other embodiments, a synthetic miRNA molecule may have the sequence of a naturally occurring miRNA molecule, but the chemical structure of the molecule, particularly in the part unrelated specifically to the precise sequence (non-sequence chemical structure) differs from chemical structure of the naturally occurring miRNA molecule with that sequence. In some cases, the synthetic miRNA has both a sequence and non-sequence chemical structure that are not found in a naturally-occurring miRNA. Moreover, the sequence of the synthetic molecules will identify which miRNA is effectively being provided or inhibited; the endogenous miRNA will be referred to as the \u201ccorresponding miRNA.\u201d Corresponding miRNA sequences that can be used in the context of the invention include, but are not limited to, all or a portion of those sequences in SEQ ID NOs: 1-562, as well as any other of miRNA sequence, miRNA precursor sequence, or any complementary sequence.

useful to know whether a cell expresses a particular miRNA endogenously or whether such expression is affected under particular conditions or a particular disease state. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, methods include assaying a cell or a sample containing a cell for the presence of one or more miRNA. In other aspects, a sample may comprise RNA or nucleic acid isolated from a tissue or cells of a patient or reference. Consequently, in some embodiments, methods include a step of generating an miRNA profile for a sample. The term \u201cmiRNA profile\u201d refers to a set of data regarding the expression pattern for a plurality of miRNAs (e.g., one or more miRNA from Table 1) in the sample; it is contemplated that the miRNA profile can be obtained using a set of miRNAs, using for example nucleic acid amplification or hybridization techniques well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. It is contemplate the any one or subset of the miRNA listed in this application can be included or excluded from the claimed invention.","In some embodiments of the invention, an miRNA profile is generated by steps that include: (a) labeling miRNA in the sample; (b) hybridizing miRNA to a number of probes, or amplifying a number of miRNA, and (c) determining miRNA hybridization to the probes or detection of miRNA amplification products, wherein an miRNA profile is generated. See U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60\/575,743 and the U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60\/649,584, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/141,707, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Methods of the invention involve diagnosing a patient based on an miRNA expression or expression profile. In certain embodiments, the presence, absence, elevation, or reduction in the level of expression of a particular miRNA or set of miRNA in a cell is correlated with a disease state compared to the expression level of that miRNA or set of miRNAs in a normal cell. This correlation allows for diagnostic methods to be carried out when the expression level of an miRNA is measured in a biological sample being assessed and then compared to the expression level of a normal cell. It is specifically contemplated that miRNA profiles for patients, particularly those suspected of having a particular disease or condition such as a pre-cancerous cervical lesion or a cervical cancer, can be generated by evaluating any miRNA or sets of the miRNAs discussed in this application. The miRNA profile that is generated from the patient will be one that provides information regarding the particular disease or condition. In many embodiments, the miRNA profile is generated using miRNA hybridization or amplification, (e.g., array hybridization or RT-PCR). In certain aspects, a miRNA profile can be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, such as serum protein profiles.","Embodiments of the invention include methods for diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or assessing a condition in a patient comprising measuring an expression profile of one or more miRNAs in a sample from the patient.

About 470,000 new cases are diagnosed and approximately 230,000 women die of cervical cancer every year (Pisani et al., 1999). While the majority (\u02dc80%) of these new cases and deaths occur in developing countries, it is estimated that approximately 3,700 women will die from invasive cervical cancer in the United States in 2007 (Jemal et al., 2007).","Cytological examination of cervical smears with Papanicolaou staining (Pap smear) is the screening method universally accepted for early detection of cervical cancer and its precursors. Pap smear screening programs have been very effective in reducing cervical cancer incidence and have reduced mortality rates by 60% among women aged 30 and over. However, even in those countries where these programs are routinely used, cervical cancer is still a significant public health problem. The Bethesda system categorizes Pap smear results as negative, ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), ASCU-H (atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade lesion), LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), HSIL (high grade intraepithelial lesion) and carcinoma. While guidelines and protocols for the management of women diagnosed with ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL and cancer are well established, the ASC-US entity is a significant problem for clinicians. The morphological criteria for ASC-US are suggestive, resulting in great variations in reported rates for ASC-US between laboratories. Approximately 3 million Pap smears are classified as ASC-US every year in the US, and the predictive value is very low. Although most Pap tests indicating ASC-US will revert spontaneously, it is estimated that in 5 to 15% of cases ASC-US Pap tests might already correspond to high grade SIL at histology. The ASC-US category is thus a source of confusion to both physicians and patients due to uncertainties that can lead to either the risk of false-positive diagnosis and unnecessary treatment or the risk of missing bona-fide lesions.","Epidemiological and molecular studies have demonstrated that human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiological agents of the vast majority (99.7%) of cervical cancers and their intraepithelial precursors (Pisani, et al., 2002; Parkin et al., 2005; zur Hausen, 2002). About a dozen HPV types (including types 16, 18, 31 and 45) are called \u201chigh-risk\u201d types because they can lead to cervical cancer, as well as anal cancer, vulvar cancer, and penile cancer. Several types of HPV, particularly type 16, have been found to be associated with oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma, a form of head and neck cancer. HPV-induced cancers often have viral sequences integrated into the cellular DNA. Some of the HPV \u201cearly\u201d genes, such as E6 and E7, are known to act as oncogenes that promote tumor growth and malignant transformation.","MicroRNA molecules (\u201cmiRNAs\u201d) are generally 21 to 22 nucleotides in length, though lengths of 19 and up to 23 nucleotides have been reported. The miRNAs are each processed from a longer precursor RNA molecule (\u201cprecursor miRNA\u201d). Precursor miRNAs are transcribed from non-protein-encoding genes. The precursor miRNAs have two regions of complementarity that enables them to form a stem-loop- or fold-back-like structure, which is cleaved in animals by a ribonuclease III-like nuclease enzyme called Dicer. The processed miRNA is typically a portion of the stem.","The processed miRNA (also referred to as \u201cmature miRNA\u201d) become part of a large complex to down-regulate a particular target gene. Examples of animal miRNAs include those that imperfectly basepair with the target, which halts translation (Olsen et al., 1999; Seggerson et al., 2002). siRNA molecules also are processed by Dicer, but from a long, double-stranded RNA molecule. siRNAs are not naturally found in animal cells, but they can direct the sequence-specific cleavage of an mRNA target through a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Denli et al., 2003).","The nucleic acid molecules are typically synthetic. The term \u201csynthetic\u201d means the nucleic acid molecule is isolated and not identical in sequence and\/or chemical structure to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule, such as an endogenous precursor miRNA or miRNA molecule. While in some embodiments, nucleic acids of the invention do not have an entire sequence that is identical to a sequence of a naturally-occurring nucleic acid, such molecules may encompass all or part of a naturally-occurring sequence. It is contemplated, however, that a synthetic nucleic acid administered to a cell may subsequently be modified or altered in the cell such that its structure or sequence is the same or similar as non-synthetic or naturally occurring nucleic acid, such as a mature miRNA sequence. For example, a synthetic nucleic acid may have a sequence that differs from the sequence of a precursor miRNA, but that sequence may be altered once in a cell to be the same as an endogenous, processed miRNA. The term \u201cisolated\u201d means that the nucleic acid molecules of the invention are initially separated from different (in terms of sequence or structure) and unwanted nucleic acid molecules such that a population of isolated nucleic acids is at least about 90% homogenous, and may be at least about 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% homogenous with respect to other polynucleotide molecules. In many embodiments of the invention, a nucleic acid is isolated by virtue of it having been synthesized in vitro separate from endogenous nucleic acids in a cell. It will be understood, however, that isolated nucleic acids may be subsequently mixed or pooled together in a variety of combinations.","In certain aspects, synthetic miRNA of the invention are RNA or RNA analogs. miRNA inhibitors may be DNA or RNA, or analogs thereof. miRNA and miRNA inhibitors of the invention are typically \u201csynthetic nucleic acids.\u201d","In some embodiments, there is a recombinant or synthetic miRNA having a length of between 17 and 130 residues. The present invention concerns miRNA molecules that are, are at least, or are at most 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 140, 145, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200 or more residues in length, including any integer or any range derivable therein, be it synthetic or non-synthetic.","In certain embodiments, synthetic miRNA have (a) an \u201cmiRNA region\u201d whose sequence from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 is identical to all or a segment of a mature miRNA sequence, and (b) a \u201ccomplementary region\u201d whose sequence from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 is between 60% and 100% complementary to the miRNA sequence. The term \u201cmiRNA region\u201d refers to a region on the synthetic miRNA that is at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% identical, including all integers there between, to all or part of the sequence of a mature, naturally occurring miRNA sequence. In certain embodiments, the miRNA region is or is at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8, 99.9 or 100% identical to the sequence of a naturally-occurring miRNA.","The term \u201ccomplementary region\u201d refers to a region of a synthetic miRNA that is or is at least 60% complementary to a corresponding naturally occurring miRNA sequence. The complementary region is or is at least 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8, 99.9 or 100% complementary to its corresponding naturally occurring miRNA, or any range derivable therein. With single polynucleotide sequences, there can be a hairpin loop structure as a result of chemical bonding between the miRNA region and the complementary region. In other embodiments, the complementary region is on a different nucleic acid molecule than the miRNA region, in which case the complementary region is on the complementary strand and the miRNA region is on the active or functional strand.","In other embodiments of the invention, there are synthetic nucleic acids that are miRNA inhibitors. An miRNA inhibitor is between about 17 to 25 nucleotides in length and comprises a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence that is at least 90% complementary to the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence of a mature miRNA. In certain embodiments, an miRNA inhibitor molecule is 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotides in length, or any range derivable therein. Moreover, an miRNA inhibitor has a sequence (from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032) that is or is at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8, 99.9 or 100% complementary, or any range derivable therein, to the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence of a mature miRNA, particularly a mature, naturally occurring miRNA. One of skill in the art could use a portion of a sequence that is complementary to the sequence of a mature miRNA as the sequence for an miRNA inhibitor. Moreover, that portion of a sequence can be altered so that it is still 90% complementary to the sequence of a mature miRNA.","In some embodiments of the invention, a synthetic miRNA contains one or more design elements. These design elements include, but are not limited to: (i) a replacement group for the phosphate or hydroxyl of the nucleotide at the 5\u2032 terminus of the complementary region; (ii) one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 1 to 6 residues of the complementary region; or (iii) noncomplementarity between one or more nucleotides in the last 1 to 5 residues at the 3\u2032 end of the complementary region and the corresponding nucleotides of the miRNA region.","In certain embodiments, a synthetic miRNA has a nucleotide at its 5\u2032 end of the complementary region in which the phosphate and\/or hydroxyl group has been replaced with another chemical group (referred to as the \u201creplacement design\u201d). In some cases, the phosphate group is replaced, while in others, the hydroxyl group has been replaced. In particular embodiments, the replacement group is biotin, an amine group, a lower alkylamine group, an acetyl group, 2\u2032O-Me (2\u2032oxygen-methyl), DMTO (4,4\u2032-dimethoxytrityl with oxygen), fluorescein, a thiol, or acridine, though other replacement groups are well known to those of skill in the art and can be used as well. This design element can also be used with an miRNA inhibitor.","Additional embodiments concern a synthetic miRNA having one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 1 to 6 residues of the complementary region (referred to as the \u201csugar replacement design\u201d). In certain cases, there is one or more sugar modifications in the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more residues of the complementary region, or any range derivable therein. In additional cases, there can be one or more sugar modifications in the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more residues of the complementary region, or any range derivable therein. It will be understood that the terms \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201clast\u201d are with respect to the order of residues from the 5\u2032 end to the 3\u2032 end of the region. In particular embodiments, the sugar modification is a 2\u2032O-Me modification. In further embodiments, there is one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 2 to 4 residues of the complementary region or the first or last 4 to 6 residues of the complementary region. This design element can also be used with an miRNA inhibitor. Thus, an miRNA inhibitor can have this design element and\/or a replacement group on the nucleotide at the 5\u2032 terminus, as discussed above.","In other embodiments of the invention, there is a synthetic miRNA in which one or more nucleotides in the last 1 to 5 residues at the 3\u2032 end of the complementary region are not complementary to the corresponding nucleotides of the miRNA region (\u201cnoncomplementarity\u201d) (referred to as the \u201cnoncomplementarity design\u201d). The noncomplementarity may be in the last 1, 2, 3, 4, and\/or 5 residues of the complementary miRNA. In certain embodiments, there is noncomplementarity with at least 2 nucleotides in the complementary region.","It is contemplated that synthetic miRNA of the invention have one or more of the replacement, sugar modification, or noncomplementarity designs. In certain cases, synthetic RNA molecules have two of them, while in others these molecules have all three designs in place.","The miRNA region and the complementary region may be on the same or separate polynucleotides. In cases in which they are contained on or in the same polynucleotide, the miRNA molecule will be considered a single polynucleotide. In embodiments in which the different regions are on separate polynucleotides, the synthetic miRNA will be considered to be comprised of two polynucleotides.","When the RNA molecule is a single polynucleotide, there is a linker region between the miRNA region and the complementary region. In some embodiments, the single polynucleotide is capable of forming a hairpin loop structure as a result of bonding between the miRNA region and the complementary region. The linker constitutes the hairpin loop. It is contemplated that in some embodiments, the linker region is, is at least, or is at most 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40 residues in length, or any range derivable therein. In certain embodiments, the linker is between 3 and 30 residues (inclusive) in length.","In addition to having an miRNA region and a complementary region, there may be flanking sequences as well at either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the region. In some embodiments, there is or is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 nucleotides or more, or any range derivable therein, flanking one or both sides of these regions.","A. Nucleic Acids","The present invention concerns miRNAs that can be labeled or amplified, used in array analysis, or employed in diagnostic, therapeutic, or prognostic applications, particularly those related to diseases and conditions of the cervix. The RNA may have been endogenously produced by a cell, or been synthesized or produced chemically or recombinantly. They may be isolated and\/or purified. The term \u201cmiRNA,\u201d unless otherwise indicated, refers to the processed RNA, after it has been cleaved from its precursor. Table 1 indicates which SEQ ID NO correspond to a mature miRNA sequence. The name of the miRNA is often abbreviated and referred to without a hsa-, mmu-, or rno- prefix and will be understood as such, depending on the context. Unless otherwise indicated, miRNAs referred to in the application are human sequences identified as mir-X or let-X, where X is a number and\/or letter.","In certain embodiments, a miRNA is designated with a \u201c5P\u201d or \u201c3P\u201d suffix. \u201c5P\u201d indicates that the mature miRNA derives from the 5\u2032 end of the precursor and a corresponding \u201c3P\u201d indicates that it derives from the 3\u2032 end of the precursor, as described on the world wide web at sanger.ac.uk. Moreover, in some embodiments, a miRNA is used that does not correspond to a known human miRNA. It is contemplated that these non-human miRNA probes may be used in embodiments of the invention or that there may exist a human miRNA that is homologous to the non-human miRNA. While the invention is not limited to human miRNA, in certain embodiments, miRNA from human cells or a human biological sample is evaluated. In other embodiments, any mammalian cell, biological sample, or preparation thereof may be employed.","In some embodiments of the invention, methods and compositions involving miRNA may concern miRNA and\/or other nucleic acids. Nucleic acids may be, be at least, or be at most 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 441, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 710, 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, 770, 780, 790, 800, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900, 910, 920, 930, 940, 950, 960, 970, 980, 990, or 1000 nucleotides, or any range derivable therein, in length. Such lengths cover the lengths of processed miRNA, miRNA probes, precursor miRNA, miRNA containing vectors, control nucleic acids, and other probes and primers. In many embodiments, miRNA sequences are 19-24 nucleotides in length, while miRNA probes are 19-35 nucleotides in length, depending on the length of the processed miRNA and any flanking regions added. miRNA precursors are generally between 62 and 110 nucleotides in humans.","Nucleic acids, and mimetics thereof, of the invention may have regions of identity or complementarity to another nucleic acid. It is contemplated that the region of complementarity or identity can be at least 5 contiguous residues, though it is specifically contemplated that the region is, is at least, or is at most 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 441, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 710, 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, 770, 780, 790, 800, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900, 910, 920, 930, 940, 950, 960, 970, 980, 990, or 1000 contiguous nucleotides. It is further understood that the length of complementarity within a precursor miRNA or between a miRNA probe and a miRNA or a miRNA gene are such lengths. Moreover, the complementarity may be expressed as a percentage, meaning that the complementarity between a nucleic acid and its target is 90% or greater over the length of the nucleic acid. In some embodiments, complementarity is or is at least 90%, 95% or 100%. In particular, such lengths may be applied to any nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence identified in any of SEQ ID NO:1 through SEQ ID NO:562 or any other sequence disclosed herein. Each of these SEQ ID NOs is disclosed herein. The commonly used name of the miRNA is given (with its identifying source in the prefix, for example, \u201chsa\u201d for human sequences) and the processed miRNA sequence. Moreover, a lowercase letter in the table below may or may not be lowercase; for example, hsa-mir-130b can also be referred to as miR-130B. The term \u201cmiRNA probe\u201d refers to a nucleic acid probe that can identify a particular miRNA or structurally related miRNAs.","It is understood that a miRNA is derived from genomic sequences or a gene. In this respect, the term \u201cgene\u201d is used for simplicity to refer to the genomic sequence encoding the precursor miRNA for a given miRNA. However, embodiments of the invention may involve genomic sequences of a miRNA that are involved in its expression, such as a promoter or other regulatory sequences.","The term \u201crecombinant\u201d may be used and this generally refers to a molecule that has been manipulated in vitro or that is a replicated or expressed product of such a molecule.","The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d is well known in the art. A \u201cnucleic acid\u201d as used herein will generally refer to a molecule (one or more strands) of DNA, RNA or a derivative or analog thereof, comprising a nucleobase. A nucleobase includes, for example, a naturally occurring purine or pyrimidine base found in DNA (e.g., an adenine \u201cA,\u201d a guanine \u201cG,\u201d a thymine \u201cT\u201d or a cytosine \u201cC\u201d) or RNA (e.g., an A, a G, an uracil \u201cU\u201d or a C). The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d encompasses the terms \u201coligonucleotide\u201d and \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d each as a subgenus of the term \u201cnucleic acid.\u201d","The term \u201cmiRNA\u201d generally refers to a single-stranded molecule, but in specific embodiments, molecules implemented in the invention will also encompass a region or an additional strand that is partially (between 10 and 50% complementary across length of strand), substantially (greater than 50% but less than 100% complementary across length of strand) or fully complementary to another region of the same single-stranded molecule or to another nucleic acid. Thus, nucleic acids may encompass a molecule that comprises one or more complementary or self-complementary strand(s) or \u201ccomplement(s)\u201d of a particular sequence comprising a molecule. For example, precursor miRNA may have a self-complementary region, which is up to 100% complementary. miRNA probes or nucleic acids of the invention can include, can be or can be at least 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% complementary to their target.","As used herein, \u201chybridization,\u201d \u201chybridizes,\u201d or \u201ccapable of hybridizing\u201d is understood to mean the forming of a double or triple stranded molecule or a molecule with partial double or triple stranded nature. The term \u201canneal\u201d as used herein is synonymous with \u201chybridize.\u201d The term \u201chybridization,\u201d \u201chybridize(s),\u201d or \u201ccapable of hybridizing\u201d encompasses hybridization under \u201cstringent condition(s)\u201d or \u201chigh stringency\u201d and \u201clow stringency\u201d or \u201clow stringency condition(s).\u201d","As used herein \u201cstringent condition(s)\u201d or \u201chigh stringency\u201d are those conditions that allow hybridization between or within one or more nucleic acid strand(s) containing complementary sequence(s), but preclude hybridization of random sequences. Stringent conditions tolerate little, if any, mismatch between a nucleic acid and a target strand. Such conditions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are preferred for applications requiring high selectivity. Non-limiting applications include isolating a nucleic acid, such as a gene or a nucleic acid segment thereof, or detecting at least one specific mRNA transcript or a nucleic acid segment thereof, and the like.","Stringent conditions may comprise low salt and\/or high temperature conditions, such as provided by about 0.02 M to about 0.5 M NaCl at temperatures of about 42\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. It is understood that the temperature and ionic strength of a desired stringency are determined in part by the length of the particular nucleic acid(s), the length and nucleobase content of the target sequence(s), the charge composition of the nucleic acid(s), and to the presence or concentration of formamide, tetramethylammonium chloride or other solvent(s) in a hybridization mixture.","It is also understood that these ranges, compositions and conditions for hybridization are mentioned by way of non-limiting examples only, and that the desired stringency for a particular hybridization reaction is often determined empirically by comparison to one or more positive or negative controls. Depending on the application envisioned it is preferred to employ varying conditions of hybridization to achieve varying degrees of selectivity of a nucleic acid towards a target sequence. In a non-limiting example, identification or isolation of a related target nucleic acid that does not hybridize to a nucleic acid under stringent conditions may be achieved by hybridization at low temperature and\/or high ionic strength. Such conditions are termed \u201clow stringency\u201d or \u201clow stringency conditions,\u201d and non-limiting examples of low stringency include hybridization performed at about 0.15 M to about 0.9 M NaCl at a temperature range of about 20\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. Of course, it is within the skill of one in the art to further modify the low or high stringency conditions to suite a particular application.","1. Nucleobases","As used herein a \u201cnucleobase\u201d refers to a heterocyclic base, such as for example a naturally occurring nucleobase (i.e., an A, T, G, C or U) found in at least one naturally occurring nucleic acid (i.e., DNA and RNA), and naturally or non-naturally occurring derivative(s) and analogs of such a nucleobase. A nucleobase generally can form one or more hydrogen bonds (\u201canneal\u201d or \u201chybridize\u201d) with at least one naturally occurring nucleobase in manner that may substitute for naturally occurring nucleobase pairing (e.g., the hydrogen bonding between A and T, G and C, and A and U).","\u201cPurine\u201d and\/or \u201cpyrimidine\u201d nucleobase(s) encompass naturally occurring purine and\/or pyrimidine nucleobases and also derivative(s) and analog(s) thereof, including but not limited to, those a purine or pyrimidine substituted by one or more of an alkyl, carboxyalkyl, amino, hydroxyl, halogen (i.e., fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo), thiol or alkylthiol moiety. Preferred alkyl (e.g., alkyl, carboxyalkyl, etc.) moieties comprise of from about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, to about 6 carbon atoms. Other non-limiting examples of a purine or pyrimidine include a deazapurine, a 2,6-diaminopurine, a 5-fluorouracil, a xanthine, a hypoxanthine, a 8-bromoguanine, a 8-chloroguanine, a bromothymine, a 8-aminoguanine, a 8-hydroxyguanine, a 8-methylguanine, a 8-thioguanine, an azaguanine, a 2-aminopurine, a 5-ethylcytosine, a 5-methylcyosine, a 5-bromouracil, a 5-ethyluracil, a 5-iodouracil, a 5-chlorouracil, a 5-propyluracil, a thiouracil, a 2-methyladenine, a methylthioadenine, a N,N-diemethyladenine, an azaadenines, a 8-bromoadenine, a 8-hydroxyadenine, a 6-hydroxyaminopurine, a 6-thiopurine, a 4-(6-aminohexyl\/cytosine), and the like. Other examples are well known to those of skill in the art.","A nucleobase may be comprised in a nucleoside or nucleotide, using any chemical or natural synthesis method described herein or known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such nucleobase may be labeled or it may be part of a molecule that is labeled and contains the nucleobase.","2. Nucleosides","As used herein, a \u201cnucleoside\u201d refers to an individual chemical unit comprising a nucleobase covalently attached to a nucleobase linker moiety. A non-limiting example of a \u201cnucleobase linker moiety\u201d is a sugar comprising 5-carbon atoms (i.e., a \u201c5-carbon sugar\u201d), including but not limited to a deoxyribose, a ribose, an arabinose, or a derivative or an analog of a 5-carbon sugar. Non-limiting examples of a derivative or an analog of a 5-carbon sugar include a 2\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyribose or a carbocyclic sugar where a carbon is substituted for an oxygen atom in the sugar ring.","Different types of covalent attachment(s) of a nucleobase to a nucleobase linker moiety are known in the art. By way of non-limiting example, a nucleoside comprising a purine (i.e., A or G) or a 7-deazapurine nucleobase typically covalently attaches the 9 position of a purine or a 7-deazapurine to the 1\u2032-position of a 5-carbon sugar. In another non-limiting example, a nucleoside comprising a pyrimidine nucleobase (i.e., C, T or U) typically covalently attaches a 1 position of a pyrimidine to a 1\u2032-position of a 5-carbon sugar (Kornberg and Baker, 1992).","3. Nucleotides","As used herein, a \u201cnucleotide\u201d refers to a nucleoside further comprising a \u201cbackbone moiety.\u201d A backbone moiety generally covalently attaches a nucleotide to another molecule comprising a nucleotide, or to another nucleotide to form a nucleic acid. The \u201cbackbone moiety\u201d in naturally occurring nucleotides typically comprises a phosphorus moiety, which is covalently attached to a 5-carbon sugar. The attachment of the backbone moiety typically occurs at either the 3\u2032- or 5\u2032-position of the 5-carbon sugar. However, other types of attachments are known in the art, particularly when a nucleotide comprises derivatives or analogs of a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar or phosphorus moiety.","4. Nucleic Acid Analogs","A nucleic acid may comprise, or be composed entirely of, a derivative or analog of a nucleobase, a nucleobase linker moiety and\/or backbone moiety that may be present in a naturally occurring nucleic acid. RNA with nucleic acid analogs may also be labeled according to methods of the invention. As used herein a \u201cderivative\u201d refers to a chemically modified or altered form of a naturally occurring molecule, while the terms \u201cmimic\u201d or \u201canalog\u201d refer to a molecule that may or may not structurally resemble a naturally occurring molecule or moiety, but possesses similar functions. As used herein, a \u201cmoiety\u201d generally refers to a smaller chemical or molecular component of a larger chemical or molecular structure. Nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs or derivatives are well known in the art, and have been described (see for example, Scheit, 1980, incorporated herein by reference).","Additional non-limiting examples of nucleosides, nucleotides or nucleic acids comprising 5-carbon sugar and\/or backbone moiety derivatives or analogs, include those in: U.S. Pat.

Modified Nucleotides","Labeling methods and kits of the invention specifically contemplate the use of nucleotides that are both modified for attachment of a label and can be incorporated into a miRNA molecule. Such nucleotides include those that can be labeled with a dye, including a fluorescent dye, or with a molecule such as biotin. Labeled nucleotides are readily available; they can be acquired commercially or they can be synthesized by reactions known to those of skill in the art.","Modified nucleotides for use in the invention are not naturally occurring nucleotides, but instead, refer to prepared nucleotides that have a reactive moiety on them. Specific reactive functionalities of interest include: amino, sulfhydryl, sulfoxyl, aminosulfhydryl, azido, epoxide, isothiocyanate, isocyanate, anhydride, monochlorotriazine, dichlorotriazine, mono- or dihalogen substituted pyridine, mono- or disubstituted diazine, maleimide, epoxide, aziridine, sulfonyl halide, acid halide, alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkylsulfonate, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, imido ester, hydrazine, azidonitrophenyl, azide, 3-(2-pyridyl dithio)-propionamide, glyoxal, aldehyde, iodoacetyl, cyanomethyl ester, p-nitrophenyl ester, o-nitrophenyl ester, hydroxypyridine ester, carbonyl imidazole, and the other such chemical groups. In some embodiments, the reactive functionality may be bonded directly to a nucleotide, or it may be bonded to the nucleotide through a linking group. The functional moiety and any linker cannot substantially impair the ability of the nucleotide to be added to the miRNA or to be labeled. Representative linking groups include carbon containing linking groups, typically ranging from about 2 to 18, usually from about 2 to 8 carbon atoms, where the carbon containing linking groups may or may not include one or more heteroatoms, e.g. S, O, N etc., and may or may not include one or more sites of unsaturation. Of particular interest in many embodiments, are alkyl linking groups, typically lower alkyl linking groups of 1 to 16, usually 1 to 4 carbon atoms, where the linking groups may include one or more sites of unsaturation. The functionalized nucleotides (or primers) used in the above methods of functionalized target generation may be fabricated using known protocols or purchased from commercial vendors, e.g., Sigma, Roche, Ambion, Biosearch Technologies and NEN. Functional groups may be prepared according to ways known to those of skill in the art, including the representative information found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,404,289; 4,405,711; 4,337,063 and 5,268,486, and U.K. Patent 1,529,202, which are all incorporated by reference.","Amine-modified nucleotides are used in several embodiments of the invention. The amine-modified nucleotide is a nucleotide that has a reactive amine group for attachment of the label. It is contemplated that any ribonucleotide (G, A, U, or C) or deoxyribonucleotide (G, A, T, or C) can be modified for labeling. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following modified ribo- and deoxyribo-nucleotides: 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP; 8-[(4-amino)butyl]-amino-ATP and 8-[(6-amino)butyl]-amino-ATP; N6-(4-amino)butyl-ATP, N6-(6-amino)butyl-ATP, N4-[2,2-oxy-bis-(ethylamine)]-CTP; N6-(6-Amino)hexyl-ATP; 8-[(6-Amino)hexyl]-amino-ATP; 5-propargylamino-CTP, 5-propargylamino-UTP; 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP; 8-[(4-amino)butyl]-amino-dATP and 8-[(6-amino)butyl]-amino-dATP; N6-(4-amino)butyl-dATP, N6-(6-amino)butyl-dATP, N4-[2,2-oxy-bis-(ethylamine)]-dCTP; N6-(6-Amino)hexyl-dATP; 8-[(6-Amino)hexyl]-amino-dATP; 5-propargylamino-dCTP, and 5-propargylamino-dUTP.

Preparation of Nucleic Acids","A nucleic acid may be made or prepared by any technique known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as for example, chemical synthesis, enzymatic production or biological production. It is specifically contemplated that nucleic acids of the invention are chemically synthesized.","In some embodiments of the invention, miRNAs are recovered or isolated from a biological sample. The miRNA may be recombinant or it may be natural or endogenous to the cell (produced from the cell's genome). It is contemplated that a biological sample may be treated in a way so as to enhance the recovery of small RNA molecules such as miRNA. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/667,126 describes such methods and it is specifically incorporated by reference herein. Generally, methods involve lysing cells with a solution having guanidinium and a detergent.","Alternatively, nucleic acid synthesis is performed according to standard methods. See, for example, Itakura and Riggs (1980). Additionally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,704,362, 5,221,619, and 5,583,013 each describe various methods of preparing synthetic nucleic acids. Non-limiting examples of a synthetic nucleic acid (e.g., a synthetic oligonucleotide), include a nucleic acid made by in vitro chemically synthesis using phosphotriester, phosphite, or phosphoramidite chemistry and solid phase techniques such as described in EP 266,032, incorporated herein by reference, or via deoxynucleoside H-phosphonate intermediates as described by Froehler et al., 1986 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,629, each incorporated herein by reference. In the methods of the present invention, one or more oligonucleotide may be used. Various different mechanisms of oligonucleotide synthesis have been disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,659,774, 4,816,571, 5,141,813, 5,264,566, 4,959,463, 5,428,148, 5,554,744, 5,574,146, 5,602,244, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","A non-limiting example of an enzymatically produced nucleic acid include one produced by enzymes in amplification reactions such as PCR\u2122 (see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,202 and 4,682,195, each incorporated herein by reference), or the synthesis of an oligonucleotide described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,897, incorporated herein by reference. A non-limiting example of a biologically produced nucleic acid includes a recombinant nucleic acid produced (i.e., replicated) in a living cell, such as a recombinant DNA vector replicated in bacteria (see for example, Sambrook et al., 2001, incorporated herein by reference).","Oligonucleotide synthesis is well known to those of skill in the art. Various different mechanisms of oligonucleotide synthesis have been disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,659,774, 4,816,571, 5,141,813, 5,264,566, 4,959,463, 5,428,148, 5,554,744, 5,574,146, 5,602,244, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Basically, chemical synthesis can be achieved by the diester method, the triester method polynucleotides phosphorylase method and by solid-phase chemistry. The diester method was the first to be developed to a usable state, primarily by Khorana and co-workers. (Khorana, 1979). The basic step is the joining of two suitably protected deoxynucleotides to form a dideoxynucleotide containing a phosphodiester bond.","The main difference between the diester and triester methods is the presence in the latter of an extra protecting group on the phosphate atoms of the reactants and products (Itakura et al., 1975). Purification's are typically done in chloroform solutions. Other improvements in the method include (i) the block coupling of trimers and larger oligomers, (ii) the extensive use of high-performance liquid chromatography for the purification of both intermediate and final products, and (iii) solid-phase synthesis.","Polynucleotide phosphorylase method is an enzymatic method of DNA synthesis that can be used to synthesize many useful oligonucleotides (Gillam et al., 1978; Gillam et al., 1979). Under controlled conditions, polynucleotide phosphorylase adds predominantly a single nucleotide to a short oligonucleotide. Chromatographic purification allows the desired single adduct to be obtained. At least a trimer is required to start the procedure, and this primer must be obtained by some other method. The polynucleotide phosphorylase method works and has the advantage that the procedures involved are familiar to most biochemists.","Solid-phase methods draw on technology developed for the solid-phase synthesis of polypeptides, it has been possible to attach the initial nucleotide to solid support material and proceed with the stepwise addition of nucleotides. All mixing and washing steps are simplified, and the procedure becomes amenable to automation. These syntheses are now routinely carried out using automatic nucleic acid synthesizers.","Phosphoramidite chemistry (Beaucage and Lyer, 1992) has become by far the most widely used coupling chemistry for the synthesis of oligonucleotides. Phosphoramidite synthesis of oligonucleotides involves activation of nucleoside phosphoramidite monomer precursors by reaction with an activating agent to form activated intermediates, followed by sequential addition of the activated intermediates to the growing oligonucleotide chain (generally anchored at one end to a suitable solid support) to form the oligonucleotide product.","Recombinant methods for producing nucleic acids in a cell are well known to those of skill in the art. These include the use of vectors (viral and non-viral), plasmids, cosmids, and other vehicles for delivering a nucleic acid to a cell, which may be the target cell (e.g., a cancer cell) or simply a host cell (to produce large quantities of the desired RNA molecule). Alternatively, such vehicles can be used in the context of a cell free system so long as the reagents for generating the RNA molecule are present. Such methods include those described in Sambrook, 2003, Sambrook, 2001 and Sambrook, 1989, which are hereby incorporated by reference.","In certain embodiments, the present invention concerns nucleic acid molecules that are not synthetic. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule has a chemical structure of a naturally occurring nucleic acid and a sequence of a naturally occurring nucleic acid, such as the exact and entire sequence of a single stranded primary miRNA (see Lee 2002), a single-stranded precursor miRNA, or a single-stranded mature miRNA. In addition to the use of recombinant technology, such non-synthetic nucleic acids may be generated chemically, such as by employing technology used for creating oligonucleotides.","C. Isolation of Nucleic Acids","Nucleic acids may be isolated using techniques well known to those of skill in the art, though in particular embodiments, methods for isolating small nucleic acid molecules, and\/or isolating RNA molecules can be employed. Chromatography is a process often used to separate or isolate nucleic acids from protein or from other nucleic acids. Such methods can involve electrophoresis with a gel matrix, filter columns, alcohol precipitation, and\/or other chromatography. If miRNA from cells is to be used or evaluated, methods generally involve lysing the cells with a chaotropic (e.g., guanidinium isothiocyanate) and\/or detergent (e.g., N-lauroyl sarcosine) prior to implementing processes for isolating particular populations of RNA.","Methods may involve the use of organic solvents and\/or alcohol to isolate nucleic acids, particularly miRNA used in methods and compositions of the invention. Some embodiments are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/667,126, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, this disclosure provides methods for efficiently isolating small RNA molecules from cells comprising: adding an alcohol solution to a cell lysate and applying the alcohol\/lysate mixture to a solid support before eluting the RNA molecules from the solid support. In some embodiments, the amount of alcohol added to a cell lysate achieves an alcohol concentration of about 55% to 60%. While different alcohols can be employed, ethanol works well. A solid support may be any structure, and it includes beads, filters, and columns, which may include a mineral or polymer support with electronegative groups. A glass fiber filter or column has worked particularly well for such isolation procedures.","In specific embodiments, miRNA isolation processes include: a) lysing cells in the sample with a lysing solution comprising guanidinium, wherein a lysate with a concentration of at least about 1 M guanidinium is produced; b) extracting miRNA molecules from the lysate with an extraction solution comprising phenol; c) adding to the lysate an alcohol solution for form a lysate\/alcohol mixture, wherein the concentration of alcohol in the mixture is between about 35% to about 70%; d) applying the lysate\/alcohol mixture to a solid support; e) eluting the miRNA molecules from the solid support with an ionic solution; and, f) capturing the miRNA molecules. Typically the sample is dried down and resuspended in a liquid and volume appropriate for subsequent manipulation.","D. Labels and Labeling Techniques","In some embodiments, the present invention concerns miRNA that are labeled. It is contemplated that miRNA may first be isolated and\/or purified prior to labeling. This may achieve a reaction that more efficiently labels the miRNA, as opposed to other RNA in a sample in which the miRNA is not isolated or purified prior to labeling. In many embodiments of the invention, the label is non-radioactive. Generally, nucleic acids may be labeled by adding labeled nucleotides (one-step process) or adding nucleotides and labeling the added nucleotides (two-step process).","1. Labeling Techniques","In some embodiments, nucleic acids are labeled by catalytically adding to the nucleic acid an already labeled nucleotide or nucleotides. One or more labeled nucleotides can be added to miRNA molecules. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,723,509, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In other embodiments, an unlabeled nucleotide or nucleotides is catalytically added to a miRNA, and the unlabeled nucleotide is modified with a chemical moiety that enables it to be subsequently labeled. In embodiments of the invention, the chemical moiety is a reactive amine such that the nucleotide is an amine-modified nucleotide. Examples of amine-modified nucleotides are well known to those of skill in the art, many being commercially available such as from Ambion, Sigma, Jena Bioscience, and TriLink.","One issue for labeling miRNA is how to label the already existing molecule. The present invention concerns the use of an enzyme capable of using a di- or tri-phosphate ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide as a substrate for its addition to a miRNA. Moreover, in specific embodiments, it involves using a modified di- or tri-phosphate ribonucleotide, which is added to the 3\u2032 end of a miRNA. Enzymes capable of adding such nucleotides include, but are not limited to, poly(A) polymerase, terminal transferase, and polynucleotide phosphorylase. Terminal transferase catalyzes the addition of nucleotides to the 3\u2032 terminus of a nucleic acid. Polynucleotide phosphorylase can polymerize nucleotide diphosphates without the need for a primer.","2. Labels","Labels on miRNA or miRNA probes may be colorimetric (includes visible and UV spectrum, including fluorescent), luminescent, enzymatic, or positron emitting (including radioactive). The label may be detected directly or indirectly. Radioactive labels include I, P, P, and S. Examples of enzymatic labels include alkaline phosphatase, luciferase, horseradish peroxidase, and \u03b2-galactosidase. Labels can also be proteins with luminescent properties, e.g., green fluorescent protein and phicoerythrin.","The colorimetric and fluorescent labels contemplated for use as conjugates include, but are not limited to, Alexa Fluor dyes, BODIPY dyes, such as BODIPY FL; Cascade Blue; Cascade Yellow; coumarin and its derivatives, such as 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, aminocoumarin and hydroxycoumarin; cyanine dyes, such as Cy3 and Cy5; eosins and erythrosins; fluorescein and its derivatives, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate; macrocyclic chelates of lanthanide ions, such as Quantum Dye\u2122; Marina Blue; Oregon Green; rhodamine dyes, such as rhodamine red, tetramethylrhodamine and rhodamine 6G; Texas Red; fluorescent energy transfer dyes, such as thiazole orange-ethidium heterodimer; and TOTAB.

Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) may be employed in methods of the invention (e.g., Klostermeier et al., 2002; Emptage, 2001; Didenko, 2001, each incorporated by reference).","Alternatively, the label may not be detectable per se, but indirectly detectable or allowing for the isolation or separation of the targeted nucleic acid. For example, the label could be biotin, digoxigenin, polyvalent cations, chelator groups and the other ligands, include ligands for an antibody.","3. Visualization Techniques","A number of techniques for visualizing or detecting labeled nucleic acids are readily available. Such techniques include, microscopy, arrays, Fluorometry, Light cyclers or other real time PCR machines, FACS analysis, scintillation counters, Phosphoimagers, Geiger counters, MRI, CAT, antibody-based detection methods (Westerns, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry), histochemical techniques, HPLC (Griffey et al., 1997), spectroscopy, capillary gel electrophoresis (Cummins et al., 1996), spectroscopy; mass spectroscopy; radiological techniques; and mass balance techniques.","When two or more differentially detectable labels are employed, fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques may be employed to characterize association of one or more nucleic acid. Furthermore, a person of ordinary skill in the art is well aware of ways of visualizing, identifying, and characterizing labeled nucleic acids, and accordingly, such protocols may be used as part of the invention.

Array Preparation","The present invention concerns the preparation and use of miRNA arrays or miRNA probe arrays. The arrays can be ordered macroarrays or microarrays of nucleic acid molecules (probes) that are fully or nearly complementary or identical to a plurality of miRNA molecules or precursor miRNA molecules and are positioned on a support or support material in a spatially separated organization. Macroarrays are typically a support (e.g., sheets of nitrocellulose or nylon) upon which probes have been spotted. Microarrays position the nucleic acid probes more densely such that up to 10,000 nucleic acid molecules can be fit into a region typically 1 to 4 square centimeters. Microarrays can be fabricated by spotting nucleic acid molecules, e.g., genes, oligonucleotides, etc., onto substrates or fabricating oligonucleotide sequences in situ on a substrate. Spotted or fabricated nucleic acid molecules can be applied in a high density matrix pattern of up to about 30 non-identical nucleic acid molecules per square centimeter or higher, e.g. up to about 100 or even 1000 per square centimeter. Microarrays typically use coated glass as the solid support, in contrast to the nitrocellulose-based material of filter arrays. By having an ordered array of miRNA-complementing nucleic acid samples, the position of each sample can be tracked and linked to the original sample. A variety of different array devices in which a plurality of distinct nucleic acid probes are stably associated with the surface of a solid support are known to those of skill in the art. Useful substrates or supports for arrays include nylon, glass, metal, plastic, and silicon. Such arrays may vary in a number of different ways, including average probe length, sequence or types of probes, nature of bond between the probe and the array surface, e.g. covalent or non-covalent, and the like. The labeling and screening methods of the present invention and the arrays are not limited in its utility with respect to any parameter except that the probes detect miRNA; consequently, methods and compositions may be used with a variety of different types of miRNA arrays.","Representative methods and apparatus for preparing a microarray have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,143,854; 5,202,231; 5,242,974; 5,288,644; 5,324,633; 5,384,261; 5,405,783; 5,412,087; 5,424,186; 5,429,807; 5,432,049; 5,436,327; 5,445,934; 5,468,613; 5,470,710; 5,472,672; 5,492,806; 5,525,464; 5,503,980; 5,510,270; 5,525,464; 5,527,681; 5,529,756; 5,532,128; 5,545,531; 5,547,839; 5,554,501; 5,556,752; 5,561,071; 5,571,639; 5,580,726; 5,580,732; 5,593,839; 5,599,695; 5,599,672; 5,610,287; 5,624,711; 5,631,134; 5,639,603; 5,654,413; 5,658,734; 5,661,028; 5,665,547; 5,667,972; 5,695,940; 5,700,637; 5,744,305; 5,800,992; 5,807,522; 5,830,645; 5,837,196; 5,871,928; 5,847,219; 5,876,932; 5,919,626; 6,004,755; 6,087,102; 6,368,799; 6,383,749; 6,617,112; 6,638,717; 6,720,138, as well as WO 93\/17126; WO 95\/11995; WO 95\/21265; WO 95\/21944; WO 95\/35505; WO 96\/31622; WO 97\/10365; WO 97\/27317; WO 99\/35505; WO 09923256; WO 09936760; WO0138580; WO 0168255; WO 03020898; WO 03040410; WO 03053586; WO 03087297; WO 03091426; WO03100012; WO 04020085; WO 04027093; EP 373 203; EP 785 280; EP 799 897 and UK 8 803 000; the disclosures of which are all herein incorporated by reference.","It is contemplated that the arrays can be high density arrays, such that they contain 2, 20, 25, 50, 80, 100 or more different probes. It is contemplated that they may contain 1000, 16,000, 65,000, 250,000 or 1,000,000 or more different probes. The probes can be directed to targets in one or more different organisms or cell types. The oligonucleotide probes range from 5 to 50, 5 to 45, 10 to 40, 9 to 34, or 15 to 40 nucleotides in length in some embodiments. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide probes are 5, 10, 15, 20 to 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 nucleotides in length including all integers and ranges there between.","The location and sequence of each different probe sequence in the array are generally known. Moreover, the large number of different probes can occupy a relatively small area providing a high density array having a probe density of generally greater than about 60, 100, 600, 1000, 5,000, 10,000, 40,000, 100,000, or 400,000 different oligonucleotide probes per cm. The surface area of the array can be about or less than about 1, 1.6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 cm.","Moreover, a person of ordinary skill in the art could readily analyze data generated using an array. Such protocols are disclosed above, and include information found in WO 9743450; WO 03023058; WO 03022421; WO 03029485; WO 03067217; WO 03066906; WO 03076928; WO 03093810; WO 03100448A1, all of which are specifically incorporated by reference.","B. Sample Preparation","It is contemplated that the miRNA of a wide variety of samples can be analyzed using the arrays, index of miRNA probes, or array technology described herein and known to the skilled artisan. While endogenous miRNA is contemplated for use with compositions and methods of the invention, recombinant miRNA\u2014including nucleic acids that are complementary or identical to endogenous miRNA or precursor miRNA\u2014can also be handled and analyzed as described herein. Samples may be biological samples, in which case, they can be from biopsy, fine needle aspirates, exfoliates, scrappings, blood, tissue, organs, or any sample containing or constituting biological cells of interest. In certain embodiments, samples may be, but are not limited to, fresh, frozen, fixed, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, or formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Alternatively, the sample may not be a biological sample, but be a chemical mixture, such as a cell-free reaction mixture (which may contain one or more biological enzymes).","C. Hybridization","After an array or a set of miRNA probes is prepared and the miRNA in the sample is labeled, the population of target nucleic acids is contacted with the array or probes under hybridization conditions, where such conditions can be adjusted, as desired, to provide for an optimum level of specificity in view of the particular assay being performed. Suitable hybridization conditions are well known to those of skill in the art and reviewed in Sambrook et al. (2001) and WO 95\/21944. Of particular interest in many embodiments is the use of stringent conditions during hybridization. Stringent conditions are known to those of skill in the art.","It is specifically contemplated that a single array or set of probes may be contacted with multiple samples. The samples may be labeled with different labels to distinguish the samples. For example, a single array can be contacted with a tumor tissue sample labeled with Cy3, and normal tissue sample labeled with Cy5. Differences between the samples for particular miRNAs corresponding to probes on the array can be readily ascertained and quantified.","The small surface area of the array permits uniform hybridization conditions, such as temperature regulation and salt content. Moreover, because of the small area occupied by the high density arrays, hybridization may be carried out in extremely small fluid volumes (e.g., about 250 \u03bcl or less, including volumes of about or less than about 5, 10, 25, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 \u03bcl or any range derivable therein). In small volumes, hybridization may proceed very rapidly.","D. Differential Expression Analyses","Arrays of the invention can be used to detect differences between two samples. Specifically contemplated applications include identifying and\/or quantifying differences between miRNA from a sample that is normal and from a sample that is not normal or contains abnormal components, between a cancerous condition and a non-cancerous condition, or between two differently treated samples. Also, miRNA may be compared between a sample believed to be susceptible to a particular disease or condition and one believed to be not susceptible or resistant to that disease or condition. A sample that is not normal is one exhibiting phenotypic trait(s) of a disease or condition or one believed to be not normal with respect to that disease or condition. Phenotypic traits include symptoms of or susceptibility to a disease or condition of which a component is or may or may not be genetic or caused by a hyperproliferative or neoplastic cell or cells.","An array comprises a solid support with nucleic acid probes attached to the support. Arrays typically comprise a plurality of different nucleic acid probes that are coupled to a surface of a substrate in different, known locations. These arrays, also described as \u201cmicroarrays\u201d or colloquially \u201cchips\u201d have been generally described in the art, for example, U.S. Pat.

However, in methods of the invention, the miRNA molecule or miRNA inhibitor need not be synthetic. They may have a sequence that is identical to a naturally occurring miRNA or they may not have any design modifications. In certain embodiments, the miRNA molecule and\/or an miRNA inhibitor are synthetic, as discussed herein.","The particular nucleic acid molecule provided to the cell is understood to correspond to a particular miRNA in the cell, and thus, the miRNA in the cell is referred to as the \u201ccorresponding miRNA.\u201d In situations in which a named miRNA molecule is introduced into a cell, the corresponding miRNA will be understood to be the induced miRNA. It is contemplated, however, that the miRNA molecule introduced into a cell is not a mature miRNA but is capable of becoming a mature miRNA under the appropriate physiological conditions. In cases in which a particular corresponding miRNA is being inhibited by a miRNA inhibitor, the particular miRNA will be referred to as the targeted miRNA. It is contemplated that multiple corresponding miRNAs may be involved. In particular embodiments, more than one miRNA molecule is introduced into a cell.

It is contemplated that in these embodiments, methods may or may not be limited to providing only one or more synthetic miRNA molecules or only on or more nonsynthetic miRNA molecules.

Furthermore, any method including a list of miRNAs using Markush group language may be articulated without the Markush group language and a disjunctive article (i.e., or) instead, and vice versa.","In some embodiments, there is a method for reducing or inhibiting cell proliferation in a cell comprising introducing into or providing to the cell an effective amount of (i) an miRNA inhibitor molecule or (ii) a synthetic or nonsynthetic miRNA molecule that corresponds to an miRNA sequence. In certain embodiments the methods involves introducing into the cell an effective amount of (i) an miRNA inhibitor molecule having a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence that is at least 90% complementary to all or part of the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence of one or more mature miRNA of Table 1.","Certain embodiments of the invention include methods of treating a pre-cancerous cervical lesion or a cancerous cervical condition. In one aspect, the method comprises contacting a cervical cell with one or more nucleic acid, synthetic miRNA, or miRNA comprising at least one nucleic acid segment having all or a portion of a miRNA sequence. The segment may be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30 or more nucleotides or nucleotide analog, including all integers there between.

In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence comprises at least one segment that is at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% identical in nucleic acid sequence to one or more miRNA sequence listed in Table 1. Modulation of the expression or processing of an endogenous gene, miRNA, or mRNA can be through modulation of the processing of an mRNA, such processing including transcription, transportation and\/or translation with in a cell. Modulation may also be effected by the inhibition or enhancement of miRNA activity with a cell, tissue, or organ. Such processing may effect the expression of an encoded product or the stability of the mRNA. In still other embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence can comprise a modified nucleic acid sequence.","In particular embodiments, the cervical cell is a cervical cancer cell. Methods of the invention can further comprise administering a second therapy, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or immunotherapy. The nucleic acid can be transcribed from a nucleic acid vector, such as a plasmid vector or a viral vector.","Methods of treating a pre-cancerous or cancerous cervical condition include contacting or administering to a cervical cell one or more nucleic acid comprising a miRNA sequence, wherein expression of an endogenous miRNA is modulated in the cervical cell; where the miRNA sequence is at least 70, 75, 80, 85% or more identical to one or more of the sequences identified in Table 1.

The second therapy can be, but is not limited to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or immunotherapy.","In still further aspects, one or more miRNA are transcribed from a nucleic acid vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector.","In certain aspects, a subject is administered: one or more nucleic acid possessing a function of an miRNA having a nucleic acid segment having at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, 98, 99, or 100% nucleic acid sequence identity to those miRNA decreased or down-regulated in a disease or condition to be treated.","In certain aspects, a subject is administered: one or more miRNA inhibitors having a nucleic acid segment having at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, 98, 99, or 100% nucleic acid sequence identity to those miRNA increased or up-regulated in a disease or condition to be treated.","Synthetic nucleic acids can be administered to the subject or patient using modes of administration that are well known to those of skill in the art, particularly for therapeutic applications. It is particularly contemplated that a patient is human or any other mammal or animal.","It will be understood in methods of the invention that a cell or other biological matter such as an organism (including patients) can be provided an miRNA or miRNA molecule corresponding to a particular miRNA by administering to the cell or organism a nucleic acid molecule that functions as the corresponding miRNA once inside the cell. The form of the molecule provided to the cell may not be the form that acts as an miRNA once inside the cell.

In certain embodiments, it is specifically contemplated that the miRNA molecule provided to the biological matter is not a mature miRNA molecule but a nucleic acid molecule that can be processed into the mature miRNA once it is accessible to miRNA processing machinery. The term \u201cnonsynthetic\u201d in the context of miRNA means that the miRNA is not \u201csynthetic,\u201d as defined herein. Furthermore, it is contemplated that in embodiments of the invention that concern the use of synthetic miRNAs, the use of corresponding nonsynthetic miRNAs is also considered an aspect of the invention, and vice versa.","In other embodiments, the methods involve reducing cell viability comprising introducing into or providing to the cell an effective amount of (i) an miRNA inhibitor molecule or (ii) a synthetic or nonsynthetic miRNA molecule that corresponds to an miRNA sequence. Methods for inducing apoptosis have a number of therapeutic applications including, but not limited to, the treatment of pre-cancer or cancer.","The present invention also concerns using miRNA compositions to treat diseases or conditions or to prepare therapeutics for the treatment of diseases or conditions. It is contemplated that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40 more miRNA (or any range derivable therein) may be used for these embodiments. In certain embodiments, methods involve one or more miRNA inhibitors and\/or an miRNA molecules corresponding to any of these miRNAs, particularly for the treatment or prevention of cancer. Cancer includes, but is not limited to, malignant cancers, tumors, metastatic cancers, unresectable cancers, chemo- and\/or radiation-resistant cancers, and terminal cancers.","In certain embodiments, methods also include targeting an miRNA to modulate in a cell or organism. The term \u201ctargeting an miRNA to modulate\u201d or \u201ctargeting an miRNA\u201d means a nucleic acid of the invention will be employed so as to modulate the selected miRNA. In some embodiments the modulation is achieved with a synthetic or non-synthetic miRNA that corresponds to the targeted miRNA, which effectively provides the targeted miRNA to the cell or organism (positive modulation). In other embodiments, the modulation is achieved with an miRNA inhibitor, which effectively inhibits the targeted miRNA in the cell or organism (negative modulation).","In some embodiments, the miRNA targeted to be modulated is an miRNA that affects a disease, condition, or pathway. In certain embodiments, the miRNA is targeted because a treatment can be provided by negative modulation of the targeted miRNA. In other embodiments, the miRNA is targeted because a treatment can be provided by positive modulation of the targeted miRNA.","In certain methods of the invention, there is a further step of administering the selected miRNA modulator to a cell, tissue, organ, or organism (collectively \u201cbiological matter\u201d) in need of treatment related to modulation of the targeted miRNA or in need of the physiological or biological results discussed herein (such as with respect to a particular cellular pathway or result, such as a decrease in cell viability). Consequently, in some methods of the invention there is a step of identifying a patient in need of treatment that can be provided by the miRNA modulator(s). It is contemplated that an effective amount of an miRNA modulator can be administered in some embodiments. In particular embodiments, there is a therapeutic benefit conferred on the biological matter, where a \u201ctherapeutic benefit\u201d refers to an improvement in the one or more conditions or symptoms associated with a disease or condition or an improvement in the prognosis, duration, or status with respect to the disease. It is contemplated that a therapeutic benefit includes, but is not limited to, a decrease in pain, a decrease in morbidity, a decrease in a severity or duration of a symptom. For example, with respect to cancer, it is contemplated that a therapeutic benefit can be inhibition of tumor growth, prevention of metastasis, reduction in number of metastases, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction of cell death in cancer cells, inhibition of angiogenesis near cancer cells, induction of apoptosis of cancer cells, reduction in pain, reduction in risk of recurrence, induction of chemo- or radiosensitivity in cancer cells, prolongation of life, palliation of symptoms related to the condition, and\/or delay of death directly or indirectly related to a cancer.","Furthermore, it is contemplated that the miRNA compositions may be provided as part of a therapy to a patient, in conjunction with traditional therapies or preventative agents. Moreover, it is contemplated that any method discussed in the context of therapy may be applied as a preventative measure, particularly in a patient identified to be potentially in need of the therapy or at risk of the condition or disease for which a therapy is needed.","In addition, methods of the invention concern employing one or more nucleic acids corresponding to an miRNA and a therapeutic drug. The nucleic acid can enhance the effect or efficacy of the drug, reduce any side effects or toxicity, modify its bioavailability, and\/or decrease the dosage or frequency needed. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic drug is a cancer therapeutic. Consequently, in some embodiments, there is a method of treating cancer in a patient comprising administering to the patient the cancer therapeutic and an effective amount of at least one miRNA molecule that improves the efficacy of the cancer therapeutic or protects non-cancer cells. Cancer therapies also include a variety of combination therapies with both chemical and radiation based treatments. Combination chemotherapies include but are not limited to, for example, bevacizumab, cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin, EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib and cetuximab), procarbazine, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, camptothecin, COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) ifosfamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulfan, nitrosurea, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin (adriamycin), bleomycin, plicomycin, mitomycin, etoposide (VP 16), tamoxifen, raloxifene, estrogen receptor binding agents, taxol, taxotere, gemcitabien, navelbine, farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitors, transplatinum, 5-fluorouracil, vincristin, vinblastin and methotrexate, or any analog or derivative variant of the foregoing.","Generally, inhibitors of miRNAs can be given to achieve the opposite effect as compared to when nucleic acid molecules corresponding to the mature miRNA are given. Similarly, nucleic acid molecules corresponding to the mature miRNA can be given to achieve the opposite effect as compared to when inhibitors of the miRNA are given. For example, miRNA molecules that increase cell proliferation can be provided to cells to increase proliferation or inhibitors of such molecules can be provided to cells to decrease cell proliferation. The present invention contemplates these embodiments in the context of the different physiological effects observed with the different miRNA molecules and miRNA inhibitors disclosed herein. These include, but are not limited to, the following physiological effects: increase and decreasing cell proliferation; increasing or decreasing apoptosis; increasing or decreasing transformation; increasing or decreasing cell viability; activating, stimulating or suppressing cellular pathways; reduce or increase viable cell number; and increase or decrease number of cells at a particular phase of the cell cycle. Methods of the invention are generally contemplated to include providing or introducing one or more different nucleic acid or mimetic molecules corresponding to one or more different miRNA molecules. It is contemplated that the following, at least the following, or at most the following number of different nucleic acid molecules may be provided or introduced: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, or any range derivable therein. This also applies to the number of different miRNA molecules that can be provided or introduced into a cell.","Any of the compositions described herein may be comprised in a kit. In a non-limiting example, reagents for isolating miRNA, labeling miRNA, and\/or evaluating a miRNA population using an array, nucleic acid amplification, and\/or hybridization can be included in a kit, as well reagents for preparation of samples from cervical samples or other sample that have been, may have been, exposed to, or suspected of being infected with HPV. The kit may further include reagents for creating or synthesizing miRNA probes. The kits will thus comprise, in suitable container means, an enzyme for labeling the miRNA by incorporating labeled nucleotide or unlabeled nucleotides that are subsequently labeled. In certain aspects, the kit can include amplification reagents. In other aspects, the kit may include various supports, such as glass, nylon, polymeric beads, and the like, and\/or reagents for coupling any probes and\/or target nucleic acids. It may also include one or more buffers, such as reaction buffer, labeling buffer, washing buffer, or a hybridization buffer, compounds for preparing the miRNA probes, and components for isolating miRNA. Other kits of the invention may include components for making a nucleic acid array comprising miRNA, and thus, may include, for example, a solid support.","Kits for implementing methods of the invention described herein are specifically contemplated. In some embodiments, there are kits for preparing miRNA for multi-labeling and kits for preparing miRNA probes and\/or miRNA arrays. In these embodiments, kit comprise, in suitable container means, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or more of the following: (1) poly(A) polymerase; (2) unmodified nucleotides (G, A, T, C, and\/or U); (3) a modified nucleotide (labeled or unlabeled); (4) poly(A) polymerase buffer; (5) at least one microfilter; (6) label that can be attached to a nucleotide; (7) at least one miRNA probe; (8) reaction buffer; (9) a miRNA array or components for making such an array; (10) acetic acid; (11) alcohol; and (12) solutions for preparing, isolating, enriching, and purifying miRNAs or miRNA probes or arrays. Other reagents include those generally used for manipulating RNA, such as formamide, loading dye, ribonuclease inhibitors, and DNase.","In specific embodiments, kits of the invention include an array containing miRNA probes, as described in the application. An array may have probes corresponding to all known miRNAs of an organism or a particular tissue or organ in particular conditions, or to a subset of such probes. The subset of probes on arrays of the invention may be or include those identified as relevant to a particular diagnostic, therapeutic, or prognostic application. For example, the array may contain one or more probes that is indicative or suggestive of (1) a disease or condition, (2) susceptibility or resistance to a particular drug or treatment; (3) susceptibility to toxicity from a drug or substance; (4) the stage of development or severity of a disease or condition (prognosis); and (5) genetic predisposition to a disease or condition.","For any kit embodiment, including an array, there can be nucleic acid molecules that contain or can be used to amplify a sequence that is a variant of, identical to or complementary to all or part of any of SEQ ID NOS: 1-562. In certain embodiments, a kit or array of the invention can contain one or more probes for the miRNAs identified by SEQ ID NOS:1-562. Any nucleic acid discussed above may be implemented as part of a kit.","The components of the kits may be packaged either in aqueous media or in lyophilized form. The container means of the kits will generally include at least one vial, test tube, flask, bottle, syringe or other container, into which a component may be placed, and preferably, suitably aliquotted. Where there is more than one component in the kit (labeling reagent and label may be packaged together), the kit also will generally contain a second, third or other additional container into which the additional components may be separately placed. However, various combinations of components may be comprised in a vial. The kits of the present invention also will typically include a means for containing the nucleic acids, and any other reagent containers in close confinement for commercial sale. Such containers may include injection or blow molded plastic containers into which the desired vials are retained.","When the components of the kit are provided in one and\/or more liquid solutions, the liquid solution is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being particularly preferred.","However, the components of the kit may be provided as dried powder(s).

The dye may then be resuspended in any suitable solvent, such as DMSO.","The container means will generally include at least one vial, test tube, flask, bottle, syringe and\/or other container means, into which the nucleic acid formulations are placed, preferably, suitably allocated. The kits may also comprise a second container means for containing a sterile, pharmaceutically acceptable buffer and\/or other diluent.","Such kits may also include components that facilitate isolation of the labeled miRNA. It may also include components that preserve or maintain the miRNA or that protect against its degradation. Such components may be RNAse-free or protect against RNAses.

Total RNA was extracted from these tissue samples using the mirVana\u2122 miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion; Austin, Tex., USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Additional samples used in the study included purified total RNA from sixteen normal cervical tissue specimens (NCX) (FirstChoice\u00ae Human Cervix Total RNA, Ambion). In addition, total RNA was purified from cells of four squamous cell carcinoma-derived cervical cell lines (SW756, C4-1, CaSki, SiHa) and from an adenocarcinoma-derived cervical cell line (HeLa), using the mirVana\u2122 miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In all cases, purified total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies; Wilmington, Del., USA).

To isolate miRNA fractions, total RNA samples were fractionated and purified using the flashPAGE\u2122 fractionator and reagents (catalog #\u2014AM13100; Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Labeled miRNAs were hybridized to mirVana miRNA Bioarrays V1 (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The arrays contained 377 individual miRNA probes, including 281 human miRNAs from the mirBase Sequence Database (microrna.sanger.ac.uk) (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006), 33 new human miRNAs (Ambi-miRs) and 63 mouse or rat miRNAs from the mirBase Sequence Database.","Following hybridization, the arrays were scanned using the Axon\u00ae GenePix 400B scanner and associated GenePix software (Molecular Devices Corporation; Sunnyvale, Calif., USA). Raw array data were normalized with the variance stabilization method (VSN) (Huber et al., 2002). VSN is a global normalization process that stabilizes the variance evenly across the entire range of expression and utilizes calibration of signal followed by transformation of data to a generalized natural logarithmic space in lieu of the traditional logarithm base 2 transformation. Absolute values and differences in VSN transformed expression are denoted by H and \u0394H, respectively, and were used for all subsequent data analyses. Differences in normalized expression values between samples (\u0394H) were transformed to a generalized fold change via exponentiation base e. These values exhibit a compression for small differences in expression. For each array, the minimum observable threshold was determined by examining the foreground minus background median intensities for \u2018EMPTY\u2019 spots. The minimum threshold was defined as 5% symmetric trimmed mean plus 2 standard deviations across all \u2018EMPTY\u2019 spots on an individual array. For an overview of miRNA processing and analysis, see Davison et al., (2006).","The inventors first characterized miRNA expression profiles from 16 normal cervix specimens (Table 5).

identify miRNAs enriched or uniquely expressed in the normal cervix, the inventors performed a global comparison of miRNA expression between the 16 normal cervix samples and a reference set of human tissues. miRNA expression in 33 different human tissues was determined using the same microarray platform described above. The human reference set consisted of FirstChoice\u00ae Total RNA samples (Ambion) isolated from 33 distinct tissues: adipose, adrenal, aorta, bladder, bone marrow, brain, breast, colon, duodenum, esophagus, fallopian tube, heart, ileum, jejunum, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, muscle, ovary, pancreas, pituitary, placenta, prostate, small intestine, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid, trachea, uterus, and vena cava.","The inventors observed that mean expression levels for 103 human miRNAs in the normal cervix samples were significantly different from the mean expression levels in the 33 reference human tissues (Table 6). These include 94 miRNAs previously identified in humans (hsa-miRNAs) and nine new human miRNAs (ambi-miRs). Of these, 41 miRNAs expressed at higher levels in the cervix samples showed an expression increase greater than 2-fold; whereas, 25 miRNAs expressed at lower levels in the cervix samples showed an expression decrease greater than 2-fold. Several human miRNAs (hsa-miR-205, -196b, -203, -503, -196a, -99a, -187 and Ambi-miR-7083 and -7101) were enriched by at least five-fold (\u0394H(NCX\u2212REF)>1.6) in normal cervix samples compared to the reference tissues; whereas, two human miRNAs (hsa-miR-7 and -215) were underexpressed by at least five-fold (\u0394H(NCX\u2212REF)<\u22121.6) in the normal cervix samples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0222"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"miRNAs with Significantly Different Expression in 16 Normal"},{"entry":"Cervix Samples vs 33 Different Human Tissues.

between the nine squamous cell carcinomas (Ca) and the nine samples from adjacent normal regions of the cervixes (NAT) in the same patients (Table 8, Flag (NAT vs Ca)=1). Among these miRNAs, 53 were down-regulated (\u0394H(NAT\u2212Ca)>0.69), and 21 were up-regulated (\u0394H(NAT\u2212Ca)<\u22120.69) by at least 2-fold in Ca samples, when compared to their expression in NAT samples (Fold Change NAT vs Ca\u22672.0). Eleven miRNAs (hsa-miR-1, -133a, -204, -218, -143, -368, -99a, -100, -195, -376a, and ambi-miR-7029) were down-regulated by more than 5-fold in Ca samples versus NAT samples (\u0394H(NAT\u2212Ca)>1.6). Three miRNAs (hsa-miR-205, -141, and -182) were up-regulated more than 5-fold in Ca samples versus NAT samples (\u0394H(NAT\u2212Ca)<\u22121.6).","The inventors identified 133 human miRNAs (121 hsa-miRNAs and 12 ambi-miRNAs) whose average expression levels were significantly different between the nine cervical tumor samples (Ca) and the sixteen normal cervical samples (NCX) (Table 8, Flag (NCX vs Ca)=1). Among these miRNAs, 70 were down-regulated (\u0394H(NCX\u2212Ca)>0.69) and 27 were up-regulated (\u0394H(NCX\u2212Ca)<\u22120.69), by at least 2-fold in Ca samples, when compared to their expression in NCX samples (Fold Change NCX vs Ca\u22672.0). Seventeen miRNAs (hsa-miR-1, -133a, -204, -368, -99a, -100, -376a, -195, -218, -424, -497, -143, -299-5p, -154, -134, and ambi-miR-7101 and -7029) were down-regulated by more than 5-fold in Ca samples versus NCX samples (\u0394H(NCX\u2212Ca)>1.6). Seven miRNAs (hsa-miR-205, -183, -31, -224, -182, -21, and -203) were up-regulated more than 5-fold in Ca samples versus NCX sample (\u0394H(NCX\u2212Ca)<\u22121.6).","Overall, 103 human miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the cancer samples (Ca) and both the normal cervix samples (NCX) and the normal adjacent tissue samples (NAT). Thirty human miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between Ca and NCX samples that were not significantly differentially expressed between Ca and NAT samples. Four distinct human miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between Ca and NAT samples that were not significantly differentially expressed between Ca and NCX samples.","Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis (as determined by ANOVA) on the global miRNA expression in the 34 samples (16 NCX, 9 Ca, and 9 NAT) showed a clear segregation of the cancer samples away from the two normal tissue sample groups. Additional clustering and principal component analyses on all expressed miRNAs also showed clear segregation of the cancer samples from the two normal tissue sample groups. Similar results were obtained for principal component analysis of the miRNAs that were differentially expressed among the three groups.","The data described in this example demonstrate that miRNA expression analysis can be used to distinguish a cancerous cervical tissue sample from a normal, non-cancerous cervical tissue sample. The inventors have shown that specific miRNAs are differentially expressed (up-regulated or down-regulated) in cancerous cervical tissue as opposed to normal cervical tissues. Comparing the expression levels of these specific miRNAs in a cervical tissue sample that is suspected of being cancerous with their expression levels in a reference non-cancerous cervical tissue sample can indicate whether or not the suspect tissue sample is cancerous.","Microarray profiling of cervical squamous cell carcinomas and normal primary tissues, using the microarrays described in Example 2, identified 103 mis-regulated (differentially expressed) miRNAs between the cervical cancer samples and both normal sample types (Table 8). The inventors identified 23 miRNAs that were differentially expressed, with at least a 5-fold change, between the Ca and NCX or NAT samples and a p-value<0.0001. These 23 miRNAs whose expression is significantly affected in cervical cancer represent novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cervical squamous cell carcinoma.

verify array data, the inventors performed real-time qRT-PCR reactions for 12 of the top 23 miRNAs in Table 9 with very distinct expression patterns between cervical squamous cell carcinomas (Ca) and normal adjacent tissues (NAT) or normal cervix (NCX) samples (hsa-miR-1, -15b, -133a, -143, -205, -21, -204, -195, -100, -99a, -368, and -183) and one miRNA with no significant change (hsa-miR-16), which was used for normalization. qRT-PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan\u00ae MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, Calif., USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions included 15 ng of total RNA per reaction and were incubated in the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Initial data analysis was done using the 7500 Fast System SDS 2.3 software. The inventors analyzed the 34 samples previously profiled (16 NCX and 9 paired Ca and NAT samples).","As illustrated in , the relative variations of miRNA expression levels were very similar for qRT-PCR and array data. All 34 samples showed the expected miRNA expression patterns characteristic of normal cervix, normal adjacent tissue and squamous cell carcinoma, thus validating the array data. This was further confirmed after performing pair wise comparisons between qRT-PCR and array data for each paired Ca-NAT sample.","The inventors sought to determine if the top 23 misregulated miRNAs in cervical cancer (Table 9) could distinguish precancerous cervical squamous epithelial lesions from normal cervical samples. The inventors evaluated miRNA expression in three cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) (also known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, CINs) (Table 10). Pathological analysis classified two lesions (SIL1, SIL2) as low grade (LSIL) and one (SIL3) as high grade (HSIL).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0238","num":"0237"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 10"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Histology and HPV (Human Papillomavirus) Status for Three Cervical"},{"entry":"Cancer Precursor Lesions.

To avoid introducing a bias due to the differences in the mass input amounts for array analysis of the various samples (SIL, NCX, Ca, NAT) the inventors used the non parametric \u201crank product\u201d method (Breitling et al., 2004) for identifying differentially expressed genes. Rank Product (RP) uses fold-change to assign ranks for all features in a dataset, providing reliable and sensitive results. Importantly, RP does not depend on the variance calculation for every gene and therefore is powerful when a small number of replicates is available. The robustness of this method has been demonstrated in previous studies where the list of genes generated from RP and a Student's T-test at a false discovery rate-corrected p-value of 5% were found in agreement (Breitling et al., 2004).","Using the RP method, 29 human miRNAs were identified as the most differentially expressed miRNAs between the SILs and the sixteen normal cervix samples, based on the rank value and an estimated percentage of false positive (PFP) of 5%. (Table 11). Among those, 15 miRNAs were down-regulated (Table 11, FC (NCX\/SIL)>1) and 14 miRNAs were up-regulated in SILs (Table 11, FC(SIL\/NCX)>1) compared to NCX. Interestingly, 11 out of the 15 miRNAs down-regulated in SILs were among the miRNAs down-regulated by at least 2-fold in Ca versus NCX (miR-1, -133a, -187, -204, -145, -143, -125a, -376a, -505, -100, and -99a). It is also noteworthy that miR-1, which is the most significantly down-regulated miRNA in the cervical cancers of our series, was also the most down-regulated miRNA in SILs. Among the 14 miRNAs up-regulated in SILs compared to the normal cervix samples, eight miRNAs (miR-141, -205, -146a, -200b, -182, -203, -21, and -31) were also up-regulated by at least 2-fold in the Ca samples compared to NCX samples. The presence of numerous identical miRNAs differentially expressed between Ca and NCX samples and between SIL and NCX samples, suggests that misregulation of these miRNAs is likely an early event in cervical tumorigenesis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0241","num":"0240"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 11"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"miRNAs Differentially Expressed Between Squamous Intraepithelial"},{"entry":"Lesions (SILs) and Normal Cervix (NCX) Samples.

As more than 200 miRNAs were detected above background in the normal cervix, cervical cancer, and normal adjacent tissue specimens, this indicates that expression of some miRNAs is lost in the cell lines evaluated here. Thirty-three miRNAs expressed in normal cervix samples, 27 miRNAs expressed in cervical tumor samples, and 41 miRNAs expressed in normal adjacent tissue samples were not expressed above background levels in the cell lines.","One hundred and forty-five human miRNAs (130 hsa-miRNAs and 15 ambi-miR5) had significantly different expression levels between the cell lines and the normal cervix samples (Table 12; Flag (CL vs NCX)=1). Among these miRNAs, 83 were down-regulated and 39 were up-regulated by at least 2-fold in the CL samples (FC, CLvsNCX\u22672.0). Of these, 48 miRNAs were down-regulated by more than 5-fold in the CL samples (\u0394H(CL\u2212NCX)<\u22121.6), 31 were down-regulated by more than 10-fold in the CL samples (\u0394H(CL\u2212NCX)<\u22122.3), and 10 (hsa-miR-145, -143, -199a, -199aAS, -368, -214, -126, -133a, 199b, and Ambi-miR 7029) were down-regulated by more than 100-fold in the CL samples (\u0394H(CL\u2212NCX)<\u22124.61) (Table 12). In contrast, 11 miRNAs were up-regulated by more than 5-fold in the cell lines compared to the normal cervix samples (\u0394H(CL-NCX)>1.6), including 3 miRNAs (hsa-miR-183, -182, and -96) that were over-expressed by more than 10-fold (\u0394H(CL\u2212NCX)>2.3). Overall, 56 miRNAs were identified that had a differential expression of more than 2-fold between Ca and NCX samples or between CL and NCX samples.","Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis on the global miRNA expression data showed a clear segregation between the cell line samples (CL), and the three tissue samples (Ca, NAT, NCX). Further, the normal cervix (NCX) and normal adjacent tissue samples (NAT) clustered away from the cervical tumor samples (Ca) and the cell lines (CL) (). This observation was confirmed by pair-wise comparison of Pearson correlation values, calculated using mean normalized data for the 377 individual miRNAs on the array (Table 13). Overall, the mean miRNA expression levels in cell lines correlated better with expression levels in cervical cancer samples than with expression levels in normal adjacent and normal tissue samples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0247"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 13"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Paired Pearson Correlation Values.

To investigate whether miRNA expression profiles could help distinguish between HPV16-positive and HPV18-positive cervical cancers, a pair wise t-test comparison was performed between the four HPV16-positive cancers and the three HPV18-positive cancers. No statistically significant differences were observed between the microRNA expression profiles of HPV16-positive and HPV18-positive cervical cancers.","Similarly, a pair wise t-test comparison between the three cell lines that are HPV18-positive and the two cell lines that are HPV16-positive did not reveal any miRNAs with significantly different expression between the two groups.","Analyses of global miRNA expression profiles (Table 5, Table 7), differentially expressed miRNAs (Table 8, Table 12), and the top 23 differentially expressed miRNA markers (Table 9) indicated that miRNA expression can distinguish normal and cancerous cervical tissues. To take this classification one step further, the minimal set of miRNAs that could discriminate between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues were identified by applying a quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mature miRNAs. The inventors found that the difference between raw Ct values of two miRNAs (miR-1 and -21) fulfilled the criteria (). qRT-PCR experiments performed on the 34 samples (NCX, CA, NAT) showed a perfect segregation between normal cervix (NCX), cervical cancer (Ca) and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) with a p-value of 1.36\u00d710.","miRNA Array Expression Analysis:","microRNA-containing fractions were recovered from 10 \u03bcg of total RNA isolated from each RNA sample, using the FlashPage fractionation system (Ambion, Inc.). Purified small RNAs were enzymatically biotinylated at the 3\u2032-termini and hybridized to a custom-made Affymetrix based microRNA array, Asuragen's DiscovArrays V.1 containing probes for 14,215 verified and candidate miRNAs from a number of sources including Sanger miRBase v9.2 database (http:microrna.sanger.ac.uk\/sequences\/) and published reports. Hybridization, washing, staining, imaging, and signal extraction were performed as recommended by the manufacturer, except that the 20X GeneChip\u00ae Eukaryotic Hybridization Control cocktail was omitted.","Array Data Processing:","The signal processing implemented for the Ambion miRCHIP is a multi-step process involving probe specific signal detection calls, background estimate and correction, constant variance stabilization and either array scaling or global normalization. For an overview of miRNA processing and analysis, see Davison et al. (2006). For more details, see supplementary information.","Probe Specific Signal Detection Calls:","Each probe on an array is assayed for detection based on a Wilcoxon rank-sum test of the miRNA probe signal compared to the distribution of signals from GC-content matched anti-genomic probes. If the resulting p-value for the probes is \u22660.06 then it is considered \u201cDetected above background.\u201d Probes with p-values>0.06 have insufficient signal to discriminate from the background and are thus considered not detected.","Background Estimate and Correction:","The same set of anti-genomic probes used to determine detection calls are used to estimate GC-content matched background signals. Each miRNA probe signal has a GC-content matched background estimate subtracted from its value. This GC-specific background contribution is estimated by the median signal from the distribution of GC-matched anti-genomic probes.","Constant Variance Stabilization:","Probes with low signal often exhibit a high degree of variability once transformed into logarithmic scales. To stabilize this low signal variability we add a constant value of 16 to the background corrected signal. This technique is commonly performed on microarray data. It was the recommended data preprocessing method by Affymetrix and Illumina in the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project.","Normalization:","The data were normalized with the VSN method (Huber et al., 2002; Szafranska et al., 2007). Briefly, VSN is a global normalization process that stabilizes the variance evenly across the entire range of expression. Differences in VSN transformed expression are denoted by Log 2 diff and were used for all subsequent data analyses. Differences in normalized expression values between samples (Log 2 diff) can be transformed to a generalized fold change via exponentiation base 2. These values will exhibit a compression for small differences in expression.","Nine cervical cancer specimens (Ca1-Ca9) and four normal cervix samples (NCX3, NCX10, NCX13, and a new normal cervix sample\u2014NCX17) were analyzed by the DiscovArray\u2122 miRNA Expression Profiling Service (Asuragen). The DiscovArray\u2122 microarray contains probes for 994 miRNAs from Sanger miRBase V9.2 (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006) (467 human miRNAs, 234 rat miRNAs, 293 mouse miRNAs) and 12,894 predicted human miRNAs (see world wide web page at asuragen.com\/services\/discovarray.html).","One hundred forty four miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between NCX and Ca samples by at least 2-fold (Table 14). Of those, 136 were down-regulated (Log 2 Diff Ca vs NCX\u2266\u22121.0) and 8 were up-regulated (Log 2 Diff Ca vs NCX\u22671.0) in Ca samples compared to NCX samples. Sixty-three (63) miRNAs were down-regulated in Ca samples by more than 5-fold (Log 2 Diff Ca vs NCX\u2266\u22122.3) with a p-value<0.0001. Seventeen of those miRNAs were down-regulated by over 10-fold in Ca samples (Log 2 Diff Ca vs NCX\u2266\u22123.3).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0266","num":"0265"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"308pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 14"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"miRNAs Differentially Expressed Among Nine Cervical Cancer Samples (Ca) and Four"},{"entry":"Normal Cervix Tissue Samples (NCX) Following Expression Analysis on High-Density"},{"entry":"Microarrays.

Array Expression Analysis:","miRNA expression in six cervical cancer specimens (Ca1-4, Ca6, and Ca8) and six normal cervix samples (NCX1-3, NCX10, NCX13, and NCX16) were further evaluated using the Human miRNA Microarray (V2) (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, Calif., USA). The Human miRNA Microarray contains probes for 723 human and 76 human viral microRNAs from the Sanger database v.10.1. Samples for miRNA profiling studies were processed by Asuragen Services (Asuragen, Inc.; Austin, Tex., USA). Total RNA from each sample (200 ng) was dephosphorylated and the pCp-Cy3 labeling molecule was ligated to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA molecules. The labeled RNA was purified using a Bio-Spin P-6 column (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.; Hercules, Calif., USA). Array hybridization, washing, staining, imaging, and signal extraction were performed according to Agilent's recommended procedures.","miRNA Array Signal Processing:","The signal processing implemented for the Agilent miRNA array is a multi-step process involving probe specific signal detection calls, background correction, and global normalization. For each probe, the contribution of signal due to background was estimated and removed by the Agilent Feature Extraction software as part of the data file output. Similarly, detection calls were based on the Agilent Feature Extraction software. Arrays within a specific analysis experiment were normalized together according to the VSN method described by Huber et al., 2002.","Background Estimate and Correction and Probe Detection:","Three types of data are provided to evaluate each hybridization. The \u201cTotal Gene Signal\u201d is the total probe signal multiplied by the number of probes per gene and is calculated after the background effects have been accounted for. The \u201cTotal Gene Error\u201d is the square root of the square of the total probe error multiplied by the number of probes per gene. The \u201cTotal Probe Error\u201d is the robust average for each replicated probe multiplied by the total number of probe replicates. The \u201cDetection Call\u201d is a binary number that indicates if the gene was detected on the miRNA microarray. Probes detected at least once across all samples in the experiment were considered for statistical analysis.","Global Normalization:","The inventors have found that the Variance Stabilization Normalization (VSN) algorithm provides an ideal balance of accuracy and precision while optimizing sensitivity and specificity of signal. One advantage of VSN, is that it accommodates negative values by using the generalized logtransformation.","Generalized logTransformed:","The post-normalized data scale is reported as generalized logdata. The distribution of microarray data is typically log normal (i.e, it tends to follow a normal distribution pattern after log transformation). A normal distributed data is amendable to classical statistical treatments, including t-tests and one-way or two-way ANOVA.","For statistical hypothesis testing, a two-sample t-Test, with assumption of equal variance, was applied. This test is used to define which probes are considered to be significantly differentially expressed, or \u201csignificant\u201d, based on false discovery rate set at 0.05.","A total of 382 human miRNAs were expressed above background level in the normal cervix samples, representing 53% of the miRNAs present on the arrays. A total of 337 miRNAs were expressed above background level in the tumor samples, representing 46.6% of the miRNAs present on the arrays.","A total of 202 human miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between NCX and Ca samples (Table 15). Among these, 129 were down-regulated (Log 2 diff (NCX vs Ca)\u22671) and 41 were up-regulated (Log 2 diff (NCX vs Ca)\u22661) by more than 2-fold in Ca samples compared to NCX samples. Thirty-three miRNAs were down-regulated in Ca samples by more than 5-fold (Log 2 diff (NCX vs Ca)\u22672.3) with a Student t-test p-value\u22660.001. Of those, 7 miRNAs (hsa-miR-204, -133b, -1, -133a, -885-5p, -99a, and -143) were down-regulated in Ca samples by more than 10-fold (Log 2 diff (NCX vs Ca)\u22673.3). Among the miRNAs up-regulated in Ca samples, 11 miRNAs (hsa-miR-205, -135b, -182, -31, -31*, -96, -224, -141, -21*, -183, and -944) were up-regulated by more than 5-fold compared to NCX with a Student t-test p-value\u22660.005.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0280","num":"0279"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 15"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"miRNAs Differentially Expressed Among Six Cervical Cancer Samples (Ca) and"},{"entry":"Six Normal Cervix Tissue Samples (NCX) Following Expression Analysis on Agilent"},{"entry":"Human miRNA Microarrays.
