Further, a growing fraction of employees do not use conventional notebooks or netbooks but rather use processing devices having the form of a table, for example Apple's iPhone or iPad. Said kind of mobile devices come with a touch sensitive screen and device components being operable to detect tilting and\/or shaking motions applied on the mobile device by the user.","Hence, there is a need in the art for application programs for key performance indicator processing and\/or performance management and employee evaluation wherein said application programs do not rely on an input of a user provided via a mouse or a keyboard.","It is an objective of embodiments of the invention to provide an improved computer-implemented method and system for specifying processing operations, in particular processing operations related to key performance indicator processing and display. This objective is solved by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are given in the dependent claims.","A \u2018key performance indicator\u2019 (KPI) as used herein are any kind of parameters used to present the status and\/or trends of any kind of entity, in particular organizations, companies, departments, machines, persons, and the like. Each KPI may have assigned a KPI value relating to a particular entity. A KPI may also be used for storing context information of a particular entity, e.g. the temperature or humidity of the room in which a particular machine or manufacturing process is located. In order to evaluate the performance of a particular entity, different sets of KPIs may be used. For example, a department of a company may have assigned KPIs such as the annual turnaround, the annual profit, the total number of vacation days, and the like. It may also have assigned KPIs such as the size of the department measured in square meters, the country or region a department is located at, the name of the leader of the department, and the like. Each entity may have assigned a KPI for which an aggregated KPI value can be calculated based on the KPI values assigned to its \u201cchild entities\u201d or \u201cchild nodes\u201d. For example, although a department may not be able to take holidays itself, the total number of holidays of a department may be calculated as the sum of all holidays taken in a year by the employees of that department. In other words, a KPI is any kind of parameter which can be used to describe and\/or evaluate a particular entity of the real-world and how that entity may perform in the future.","In computing, a graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices with images rather than text commands. A GUI represents the information and actions available to a user through graphical icons and visual indicators, herein also referred to as \u2018GUI elements\u2019, as opposed to text-based command interfaces. Actions are usually performed by a user through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.","A \u2018view\u2019 as used herein comprises any arrangement of GUI elements on a graphical user interface displaying a user data related to a particular topic or problem. A view may comprise selectable GUI elements allowing a user to select or modify the displayed information and\/or GUI elements and to dynamically interact with the displayed GUI elements for controlling functions of the application program providing for said view.","A \u2018web service\u2019 as used herein denotes any kind of communication technology for exchanging data between two processing devices via a network. The term \u2018web service\u2019 therefore includes web services in the strict sense, e.g. RESTful web services, but also includes technologies for exchanging data via SMSs, via Http requests, via remote procedure calls (RPC), CORBA, DOOM, RMI or any other communication technology. In particular, the term web service refers to web services in the strict sense, conforming to the specification of the world wide web consortium (W3C).","An \u2018O-aggregated KPI value\u2019 is a value having been calculated by aggregating KPI values assigned to one or more organization nodes of an organization graph according to the topology of said organization graph by applying an aggregate function. Said aggregate function may be, for example, a summarization, a maximization, a minimization operation or a complex mathematical algorithm.","Analogously, an \u2018R-aggregated KPI value\u2019 is a value having been calculated by aggregating KPI values directly or indirectly assigned to one or more region nodes of a region graph according to the topology of said region graph.","A \u2018T-aggregated KPI value\u2019 as used herein is an O-aggregated KPI value having been calculated by aggregating KPI values assigned to one or more organization nodes of an organization graph according to the topology of said organization graph, whereby said T-aggregated KPI value in addition has assigned a rank position within an ordered list of the highest O-aggregated KPI values having been calculated for said KPI and for a plurality of organization nodes.","A \u2018L-aggregated KPI value\u2019 as used herein is an O-aggregated KPI value having been calculated by aggregating KPI values assigned to one or more organization nodes of an organization graph according to the topology of said organization graph, whereby said L-aggregated KPI value in addition has assigned a rank position within an ordered list of the lowest O-aggregated KPI values having been calculated for said KPI and for a plurality of organization nodes.","A \u2018multi-touch input device\u2019 as used herein is any processing device, e.g. a personal computer, notebook, netbook, smartphone, IPAD or the like which is capable of recognizing two or more simultaneous touches as input. For example, a multi-touch input device can comprise a multi-touch screen being operable to dynamically determine the position of one or more objects on the screen and using said data as input of the user for controlling applications and entering data.","A \u2018pinch gesture\u2019, as used herein is a form of multi-touch user input in which the user typically touches two points on the input device with two fingers, before moving them closer together or further apart from each other.","In one aspect, the invention relates to a method for providing a plurality of aggregated KPI-values of a plurality of different KPIs from a server to one or more views of a GUI of a client processing device. The method comprises:\n\n","Said features may be advantageous for a plurality of reasons: the client processing device doesn't have to calculate any aggregated KPI value by itself. Rather, the client processing device merely reads aggregated KPIs from the first database. Only in case the requested aggregated KPI values are not contained in the first database, the client device tries to receive the aggregated KPI values from the server processing device over the network. This reduces the network traffic and in addition guarantees that the client processing device is operable to work even in case no network connection is available, provided that the first database is filled with data. Said features may be particularly advantageous, because a network connection may not always be available, e.g. during a flight or in many hospitals. A client which would completely rely on the data provided by the server would not be operative without a network connection.","In a further advantageous aspect, the processing load of the client device is reduced, because the client device never calculates the aggregated KPI values but rather receives the aggregated KPI values from the second database running on the server processing device. A server processing device may be accessed by a plurality of client computing devices. A server processing device is typically equipped with sufficiently powerful hardware resources for processing a huge amount of data and for efficiently calculating the aggregated KPI values. Thereby, also client processing devices with limited hardware resources can be used for quickly providing the user with KPI values having been aggregated over a plurality of different entities.","In a further advantageous aspect, the aggregated KPI values requested by the application program are not requested and received via one single web service interface, but rather via a plurality of web service interfaces, whereby each web service interface represents a characteristic set of KPIs. Said features may be advantageous in particular if a huge amount of different KPIs is requested by the application program, and in particular when the application program needs to evaluate different sub-sets of KPIs in different application contexts. By using a plurality of web service interfaces respectively representing different sets of KPIs, it is not necessary to exchange aggregated data values of all KPIs via one single generic interface in one single, generic data structure but it is rather possible to individually query one or more interfaces representing the requested KPI sub-sets which are needed in a particular application context. Using highly generic interfaces may have the drawback that the server and also the client has to invest more processing effort in order to extract from a generic data format the information the client is actually interested in a given application context. Said effort can be reduced by using a plurality of different interfaces being particular to a sub-set of one or more KPIs being of interest in a particular application context.","In a further advantageous aspect, \u2018modularizing\u2019 the retrieval of aggregated KPIs by means of a plurality of web services respectively representing different sets of KPIs may be advantageous, because in case said interfaces are used for updating the first database, the sequence of KPIs whose aggregated values are retrieved from the second database during the update process can be dynamically changed by changing the sequence of web service interfaces queried during the update process. Thus, the data a user is most interested in can be downloaded first, whereby the data and the corresponding KPIs considered as most important may vary between different users and\/or application contexts. For example, a user of the client processing device may use the application program in five different application context, e.g. for evaluating a first, a second and a third industrial manufacturing process and for evaluating the financial figures of a first and a second department of a company. The five application contexts respectively require receiving aggregated KPI values for the KPI subsets {KPI-KPI}, {KPI-KPI}, {KPI, KPI}, {KPI-KPI} and {KPI-KPI}.","According to embodiments, the web services are web services in the strict sense of the word. They are software systems designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network having an interface described in a machine-processable format specified in a Web Services Description Language WSDL and using SOAP messages. Using said type of web services may be particularly advantageous as they allow the provision of a plurality of individually addressable (and therefore modular) interfaces for retrieving aggregated KPI values from the server, each web service being callable by the same set of client side class libraries and interfaces.","The client processing device, herein also referred to as \u2018client\u2019, \u2018frontend data processing means\u2019 or \u2018frontend\u2019 can be, for example and without limitation, a mobile phone, an iPad, an iPod, smart phones based on various operating systems such as android, and the like. The network can be, for example, the Internet, an intranet, a mobile communication network, and the like. The server computer system and the operatively connected second database may respectively be stand-alone systems or may be provided as part of a cloud if cloud computing technology is utilized.","The server computing system, herein also referred to as \u2018server\u2019, \u2018backend data processing means\u2019 or \u2018backend\u2019 may comprise or be operatively coupled to at least one data source, such as an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or one or more databases. The at least one data source can be an integral part of the server computer system or of an external processing system. The server computer system may comprise a KPI aggregation module for retrieving non-aggregated KPI values from the ERP system, aggregating the retrieved KPI values and storing the aggregated KPI values into the second database. The aggregation may be executed according to a predefined schema, e.g. on a daily or weekly basis, whereby said aggregation may be based, for example, on the execution of cron jobs.","In a further advantageous aspect, specifying sets of KPIs being provided via one common web service and a corresponding web service interface allows each web service running on the server processing device to cache the aggregated KPI values having been retrieved from the second database. The cached aggregated KPI values are then immediately available in case another client device should request the same set of KPIs. Thus, a two-fold caching of requested aggregated KPI values can be provided, a first caching provided by the individual web services and a second caching provided by database-internal caching routines implemented by the second database. Thus, data retrieval is further accelerated as requested aggregated KPI values are read from the cache instead of the second database if available.","In a further advantageous aspect, providing multiple different web service interfaces and corresponding web services allows to create web services which are adapted for providing all aggregated KPI values which are necessary in order to display a particular view on the touch screen of the client device.","For example, a user may log into the application program running on the client. Upon having received the user's login data, an organization node representing said user is identified by the application program, and information on said user as well as on persons or other entities being subordinates of the logged-in user according to the topology of the organization graph are displayed in the organization view. For example, said organization view may display one GUI element for the logged-in user and one element for each direct subordinate of said user. Each of said GUI elements may comprise one or more aggregated KPI values, e.g. the number of vacation days, the turnaround, the profit achieved by the represented person. Other KPI values such as the temperature of a room wherein several manufacturing processes are performed may be completely irrelevant in this context and for a current view. The current view may be chosen by the application program automatically or may be displayed in response to a selection by the user. Accordingly, specifying a particular web service and corresponding interface which merely provides for the KPIs \u2018vacation days\u2019, \u2018turnaround\u2019, \u2018profit\u2019 but not for any other KPIs is advantageous, because for a particular view only some web services and only a fraction of the available aggregated KPI values need to be retrieved.","In a further advantageous aspect, a synergistic effect is reached by providing the aggregated KPI values via a plurality of different web service interfaces in combination with trying to receive the aggregated KPI values from the first database before accessing the second database: the access to the second database is avoided whenever possible, thereby avoiding unnecessary network traffic and increasing, at the same time, the speed of retrieving the aggregated KPI values for display. Said approach also increases the robustness against a network failure. By using multiple KPI-set specific web service interfaces instead of one generic interface, the amount of data transferred and the time until said data can be used by the client is reduced. Thus, both features help avoiding network traffic and to minimize the necessary traffic.","The first KPIs can be determined for the current organization node in various ways. For example, all KPIs stored in association with said organization node can be used. According to some embodiments, the set of KPIs stored in association with a particular organization node may vary or the application program may dynamically determine a sub-set of all KPIs stored in association with a particular organization node and use said determined sub-set as first KPIs. For example, said sub-set may be determined in dependence on the view currently displayed by the user or other parameters of the current application context. The determination of the first KPIs may likewise be based on a user selection provided dynamically via a GUI and\/or provided upon program start, e.g. based on a configuration file. The KPIs of interest may also depend on the hierarchical level of the current organization node within the organization tree. For example, some KPIs may be defined only for company branches, not for individual departments and vice versa.","According to the embodiments, the plurality of different views is generated for display by the application program.","According to the embodiments, the first and the second database further respectively comprise a region graph, the region graph comprising region nodes, each region node representing a geographic region. Each region node is stored in association with one or more of the organization nodes, whereby the first and the second databases respectively comprise a second table for storing R-aggregated KPI-values.","Each R-aggregated KPI value is calculated for a unique combination of one of the region nodes and one of the KPIs by aggregating KPI values of said one KPI being assigned to any of a set of organization nodes, said set comprising said one organization node and its direct and indirect child organization nodes, wherein the organization nodes of said set being stored in association with said one region node. Thus, aggregated KPIs can be calculated e.g. for all subordinates of a particular employee whose corresponding organization nodes have assigned a region said employee, e.g. a CEO, is interested in.","According to the structure of the second table each table row represents a unique combination of a region node and an organization node, each of the KPIs being represented by one column of the second table, whereby each cell specified by a particular row and a particular KPI-representing column is used for storing an R-aggregated KPI-value calculated for the KPI of said cells' row and for the region node and the organization node of said cell's column.","The method further comprises the steps of: displaying a region view on the GUI, wherein at least some region GUI elements of the region view respectively represent one of the region nodes; receiving a signal being indicative of one of the region GUI elements selected by the user; identifying one region node of the region graph as being represented by the selected region GUI element and using the identified region node as current region node; G) determining one or more second KPIs for the current region node; H) accessing, by the application program, the second table of the first database for retrieving R-aggregated KPI values for one or more second KPIs for the current region node; I) in case the R-aggregated KPI values could not be retrieved, determining from the plurality of web service interfaces one or more second web-service interfaces being operable to receive and process a request for the second KPIs; J) querying, by the application program, the determined second web service interfaces via a network for receiving the R-aggregated KPI values of the second KPIs; K) storing, by the application program, the R-aggregated KPI values received from the second database in the second table of the first database; L) displaying, by the application program, the R-aggregated KPI values retrieved from the first database or received from the second database, in the region view of the GUI, the region view displaying at least one region GUI element representing the current region node, the region view enabling the user to navigate within the region graph, whereby a selection of one of the displayed region nodes triggers the re-execution of the steps G-K, whereby the selected region node is used as the current region node.","According to embodiments, a region view may comprise a graphical map, e.g. a global map, a continent-specific map or a regional map. The user may be enabled to zoom into or out of the map and to select one or more geographic sub-regions, e.g. a particular country, a particular city and the like. Each such sub-region may be represented by a region GUI element, e.g. a part of the geographic map. Upon selecting a particular country, the region node representing the selected country is selected as current region node.","The second KPIs can be determined for the current region node in various ways. For example, all KPIs stored in association with an organization node stored in association with the current region node can be used. According to some embodiments, the set of second KPIs may dynamically be determined by the application program as a sub-set of said theoretically available KPIs. For example, said sub-set may be determined in dependence on the view currently displayed by the user or other parameters of the current application context. The determination of the second KPIs may likewise be based on a user selection provided dynamically via a GUI and\/or provided upon program start, e.g. based on a configuration file. The KPIs of interest may also depend on the hierarchical level of the current region node within the region graph. For example, some second KPIs may be defined only for countries, not for cities and vice versa.","According to embodiments, the first and the second database further respectively comprise a third table. According to the structure of the third table each row represents a unique combination of one particular organization node and one particular KPI. Each of a plurality of \u2018T-columns\u2019 respectively represents a top rank position, and each of a plurality of \u2018L-columns\u2019 respectively represents a low rank position. The \u2018T-aggregated KPI values\u2019 and the \u2018L-aggregated KPI values\u2019 are calculated for each unique combination of one of the KPIs and one of the organization nodes by:\n\n","The method further comprises the steps of:\n\n","A T-column is a column of the third table of the first or second database representing a top rank position, a L-column is a column of said third table representing a low rank position, whereby the rank refers to an ordered list of aggregated KPI values.","As for the first and second KPIs, the third KPIs can be determined in various ways. For example, all KPIs stored in association with an organization node stored in association with the current organization node can be used. According to some embodiments, the third KPIs may dynamically be determined by the application program as a sub-set of said theoretically available KPIs. For example, said sub-set may be determined in dependence on the view currently displayed by the user or other parameters of the current application context. The determination of the second KPIs may likewise be based on a user selection provided dynamically via a GUI and\/or provided upon program start, e.g. based on a configuration file. The KPIs of interest may also depend on the hierarchical level of the organization node within the organization graph.","According to embodiments, a top list of aggregated KPI values is calculated for a particular organization node, e.g. a department of a company, or a particular branch of said company. For said organization node, a set of direct or indirect child nodes is determined, e.g. all employees working for a department. In order to calculate the top list for the KPI \u2018profit\u2019, the \u2018profit\u2019 value reached by each single employee of said department is calculated, e.g. by summing up profit figures for a particular year. The aggregated KPI values of said child organization nodes are sorted in descending order. The employee at the top position of the sorted list of KPI \u2018profit\u2019 is the employee having reached the highest profit in the year considered when comparing his profit value with the profit values reached by the other employees of that department. A user wanting to know the 10 top performing employees in regard to profit for a particular department merely has to specify the KPI he's interested in, has to select the organization node representing the department as current node and request for display of the top 10 T-aggregated KPI values for the KPI \u2018profit\u2019. The 10 employees performing worst can be determined analogously.","According to embodiments, the aggregated data values are calculated by a data aggregation module running on the server processing device, wherein the structure of the first, second and third table of the first database is respectively identical to or is a sub-structure of the structure of the first, second and third table of the second database. According to some of said embodiments, at least some organization nodes in the first and\/or second database are stored in association with a compressed image of the user represented by said organization node, the image compression being executed by said data aggregation module. Said features may be advantageous because the structure of the first as well as of the second database can be optimized for efficiently retrieving data to be displayed in a particular view of the client device. Compressing images of users corresponding to organization nodes is advantageous as said images can be transferred efficiently from the server to the client and help the user in navigating within the organization graph displayed on the screen of the client device.","According to embodiments, the content of the first table of the first database is automatically filled by the application program with O-aggregated KPI values by submitting a plurality of requests to the first web service interfaces until for each KPI and for each organization node being the organization node representing the logged-in user or being one of the direct or indirect child nodes of said organization node the corresponding O-aggregated KPI value is received from the second database and is stored to the first table of the first database.","In addition or alternatively, the second table of the first database is automatically filled by the application program with R-aggregated KPI values by submitting a plurality of requests to the second web service interfaces until for each combination of a region node and an organization node, said organization node being the organization node representing the logged in user or any of its direct or indirect child nodes, all R-aggregated KPI values stored in the second database are received and are stored to the second table of the first database.","In addition or alternatively, the third table of the first database is automatically filled by the application program by submitting one or more requests to the third web service interfaces for receiving for all combinations of one of the KPIs and one organization nodes, said organization node being the organization node representing the logged in user or any of its direct or indirect child nodes, all T-aggregated KPI values and all L-aggregated values contained in the second database, the received L- and T-aggregated data values being stored to the third table of the first database.","According to embodiments, the first table of the first and second database is adapted to quickly provide O-aggregated KPI values for display in an organization view, while the second table of said databases is particularly adapted for quickly providing R-aggregated KPI values to a region view. Providing the aggregated KPI values via a plurality of interfaces is advantageous, because said modularity of data retrieval allows to specifically retrieve those aggregated KPI values first which are considered as particularly relevant for the logged-in user. Other aggregated KPI values may be retrieved at a later moment in time via a background process while the user works on the aggregated KPI values already retrieved and stored for the current organization and its direct child nodes in the first database.","According to embodiments, the first database is an in-memory database. The first database is automatically kept up-to-date by executing the following steps: M) determining, by the application program, whether the first database is empty or is outdated; N) in case the first database is outdated, the application program automatically deletes the aggregated KPI values stored in the first database, thereby creating an empty database; O) in case it was determined in M) that the first database is empty or in case the database was emptied in step N), operating the application program in update mode, wherein in the update mode the step of accessing the first database for retrieving O-, R-, L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values is skipped, and wherein only the second database is accessed via the plurality of web services for retrieving the O-, R-, L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values for display, wherein in the update mode the application program automatically, as a background process, submits one or more update requests to the plurality of web-services until the first database is updated, and wherein the update-mode is terminated as soon as the first database is updated.","Depending on the embodiment, the step of determining whether the first database is outdated may be executed by comparing a timestamp or a hash value of the first database with a timestamp or a hash value of the server database. The expression of determining that a database is \u2018empty\u2019 will in the following also subsume determining that a database is not existent. Whether the content of a database is deleted while its structure is left unchanged or whether the whole database including the table structure is deleted is considered herein as a mere design choice. In the latter case the application program may comprise routines to create the database structure including the tables de novo.","According to embodiments, the first database is an in-memory database and the client processing device comprises a computer-readable, non-volatile storage medium. A third database is persistently stored by the application program in said non-volatile storage medium, the third database being an encrypted copy of the first database, the encryption being executed by the application program. The first database is not encrypted. The application program, upon program start, creates the first database by reading the persistent first database from the non-volatile storage medium, decrypting the content of the third database, initializing the first database in the memory and filling the first database with the decrypted content of the third database.","Said features may be advantageous, because they may protect the data in case the client device should get stolen or lost. As the data of the in-memory database is destroyed when the application program is terminated, the data of the in-memory database does not need to be protected from unauthorized access. This is not the case, however, for the data stored in the persistent, third database. By encrypting and decrypting data stored in the third database, potentially sensitive data relating the organization structure and key performance indicators of companies are reliably protected against unauthorized access even in case the client device gets lost.","According to embodiments, the first database and, if present, also the third database, is emptied upon each termination of the application program. Emptying a database may be based on deleting the content of the database or deleting the whole database and its tables. Said features may provide for an even more secure, \u201czero footprint\u201d application program wherein all aggregated KPIs are retrieved from the second database and are stored only temporarily to the first database during a single working session of the logged-in user.","According to embodiments, the application program is operable to automatically and dynamically switch between using the first and the second database for retrieving the O-, R-, L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values to be displayed. According to said embodiment, the first database is used by the application program by default. In case the first database is outdated, the application program switches to the second database and updates the first database in parallel. In case no network connection to the server is available when starting or executing the update of the first database, the application program does not start the updating process and automatically uses the first database or uses those parts of the first database having already been received during an update process before the network connection was terminated. Said features may be advantageous particularly if used on a client device currently in \u201cflight mode\u201d. In flight mode, application programs are still in operation although the network connection is turned off or is not available. Said features ensure that a user can work based on the data currently stored in the first database in case not network connection to the second database is available.","According to embodiments, the O-, R-, T- and L-aggregated KPI values are pre-calculated by the server processing device for all organization nodes of the organization graph, the pre-calculated O- and R-aggregated KPI values being stored in the second database.","According to other embodiments, all O-, and R-aggregated KPI values are pre-calculated while the L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values are pre-calculated by the server processing device only for those organization nodes belonging to the n top hierarchical levels of the organization graph, n being an integer larger 0 and smaller than 5. All other L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values are calculated by the server processing device upon having received a request via one of its web service interfaces. All L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values having been pre-calculated or having been calculated in response to the receipt of a web service request are stored in the second database. The client processing device does not calculate any of the O-, R-, L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values but rather receives each of said values from the first or second database.","Said features may be advantageous, because incrementally filling the database allows using the first database even in case not all data stored in the second database have been transferred yet. Using multiple different web service interfaces corresponding to different sets of KPIs is advantageous, because the achieved modularity of data retrieval allows to flexibly modify the sequence of requests for aggregated KPI values to be transferred from the second to the first database. Said sequence may depend on various criteria, e.g. user-specific preferences, the current organization node, the current region node or the like.","According to embodiments, the requested O-, R-, L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values returned by the requested web service interfaces are returned in the form of BLOBS. Said features may be advantageous as they provide for a particularly secure way of transferring data from the second to the first database. A \u2018BLOB\u2019 is a \u2018binary large object\u2019 that can hold a variable amount of data in binary form. The binary form, contrary to plain text form, ensures that even in case the transferred data should be tracked by a third party, said party cannot decipher the content of the transferred data. In particular if said kind of data object is combined with an encrypted persistent third database or with a \u2018no footprint\u2019 embodiment, said feature provides for a particularly secure means of providing aggregated KPI values from a server to a client device.","According to embodiments, the application program comprises a learning module and the method further comprises the step of: logging, by the learning module, the identity of the one or more first, second and\/or third web service interfaces used over a time period; calculating, by the learning module applying a learning algorithm on the logged web service interface identifiers, for each of the web service interfaces a score value, said score value being indicative of the probability that the logged-in user using the application program submits a web service request for an aggregated KPI value to any of said first, second and\/or third web service interfaces; and automatically submitting, upon a log-in operation of the user, one or more prefetching web service requests in dependence of the calculated score value. Said features may be advantageous as they provide for an application program being operable to \u2018learn\u2019 which sets of KPIs a logged-in user is particularly interested in. Aggregated KPI values can be retrieved, for example, when executing an update step or when filling the first database de novo. Thus, the application program may be able to retrieve, e.g. in a background process, the aggregated KPIs the user is most interested in. All other KPIs the user is typically less interested in are retrieved by the application program in the background at a later moment in time. The learning module in combination with the modularized data retrieval based on a plurality of web service interfaces thus provides for an application program which can adapt to the individual interests and needs of different users. For example, an engineer of a company may always right upon log-in navigate to one or more organization nodes representing particular machines operated by said company to retrieve KPI values such as \u2018produced items per hour\u2019, \u2018time period in failure state\u2019, \u2018supply state of consumables\u2019 and so on. Another employee working in the financial department may typically select, upon log-in, KPIs assigned to employees. Such KPIs may be, for example, parameters like \u2018monthly salary\u2019, \u2018holidays taken\u2019, \u2018monthly turnaround\u2019 and the like.","The expression the application module \u2018comprises\u2019 a learning module or an encryption\/decryption module as used in the following indicates that said modules may be integral part of the application program, may be a plug-in of the application program or may be an independent application or program component being which can be accessed and used by the application program.","The learning module may learn the KPIs typically selected by the user and use said information to preferentially retrieve aggregated values for said learned KPIs when updating or freshly filling the first database. According to some embodiments, the organization nodes and\/or region nodes typically selected by a user may further be monitored by the learning module and used for learning the KPIs which are typically of interest for a user of the application program.","According to embodiments, a higher usage probability of a web service interface is indicated by a higher score value, wherein the order of the first, second and third web service interfaces used for updating the first database depends on the score value of each respective web service. The higher the score value, the earlier the web service interface is requested during the update process.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computer-readable storage medium, the storage medium comprising computer-interpretable instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to execute the steps of the method according to any of the embodiments of the invention described above.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computing system for providing a plurality of aggregated KPI-values of a plurality of different KPIs aggregated by a server processing device to one or more views of a GUI of at least one client processing device, the computer system comprising:\n\n","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computer system that comprises a key performance indicator database, also referred herein as \u2018second database\u2019. Key performance indicator definitions are stored in the database. This facilitates use of uniform key performance indicator definitions for use within a company and\/or for benchmarking various companies that use these key performance indicator definitions. This way expert knowledge related to key performance indicator definitions is made readily available to a group of commercial entities or a \u201ccommunity\u201d of participants.","The computer system further comprises back end data processing means, also referred to as \u2018server processing device\u2019, comprising means for extracting data from at least one data source, the extracted data comprising structural data being descriptive of a structure and data values specifying values for elements of the structure.

The aggregation of the data can then be performed along various dimensions of the OLAP cube. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the extracted data is put into an OLAP cube. The data stored in the OLAP cube is then aggregated to provide aggregated values that are stored in separate database lists outside the OLAP cube. The aggregation is performed in accordance with the KPI definitions. According to embodiments, the aggregated data is transmitted to the front end data processing means for further processing and\/or for display of specific KPI values in response to a user's selection. This is particularly advantageous as this does not require transmission of the OLAP cube. As a consequence latency times experienced by the user can be minimized. However, the OLAP cube can also be transmitted to the front end in addition to the aggregated values such as for performing an in dept data analysis in accordance with user definable data analysis paths. The resultant structural data and aggregated extracted data, i.e. the OLAP cube and\/or the separate database lists, is stored within the computer system or is outputted for storage by an external storage system, such as a storage system that is located in the cloud.","According to embodiments, the computer system further comprises frontend data processing means having means for receiving at least a portion of the structural data and the aggregated data, such as a wired or wireless communication interface, in particular a digital cellular telecommunication interface, such as a GSM or UMTS interface, a WLAN interface or another kind of far-field or near-field wireless telecommunication interface. The frontend data processing means comprises a user interface for a user's selection of at least one of the key performance indicators and\/or at least one element of the structure. In accordance with embodiments of the invention the user interface is implemented as a graphical user interface.","The frontend data processing means has means for calculating a value of at least one of the key performance indicators for at least one of the elements of the structure depending on the user's selection using the received structural data and the aggregated data.

The system further comprises or is coupled to a benchmarking database for storing the anonymized structural data and\/or aggregated data. This facilitates the performance of benchmark analysis involving multiple companies due to the usage of uniform definitions of the key performance indicators. For example, a number of companies is registered for using the benchmarking database establishing a community that uses the same key performance indicator definitions such that a database is established for automated and cost effective benchmarking that avoids or reduces a need for benchmarking consultancy services of a consultancy firm and drastically reduces the cost related to benchmarking. The benchmarking database may comprise a set of software tools for providing services for automated benchmark analysis using the anonymized structural and\/or aggregated data that is stored in the benchmarking database.

This ensures data protection of the structural and the aggregated data for maintaining confidentiality of these data. This is particularly beneficial if the structural and\/or the aggregated data contain data that is to be protected in accordance with company policies and\/or legal requirements or as regards data that contains competitive and\/or critical technical information.

Hence, embodiments of the present invention provide a powerful data processing tool for identification of strengths and weaknesses in an organization in an objective way.","Selecting a Data Set by Means of a Multi-Touch Input Device","Multi-touch input devices comprise a graphical user interface such as a touch screen allowing a user to select GUI elements in order to trigger some routines of the application program displayed. Typically, a user uses no other input device than his finger in order to select GUI elements, input user data, or trigger the execution of commands. In the following, embodiments of a method will be presented which eases the selection of GUI elements and entering user data into a multi-touch mobile device, thereby making the interaction of a user with the input device more intuitive and efficient. Said methods may be used for selecting GUI elements representing organizational nodes, KPIs, and the like and may enable a user to navigate within graphs of various topologies, e.g., organization graphs of various topologies.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computer-implemented method for selecting a data set from a plurality of data sets by means of a multi-touch input device. The data sets are connected with each other according to a topology of a graph. The input device has three orthogonal axes x, y, z, the x axis defining a device-centred horizontal line from the left to the right side of the input device, the y axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the bottom of the input device to the top of the input device and the z-axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the back side to the front side of the input device. The input device comprises: a multi-touch screen; a motion sensing unit being operable to detect a tilt motion of the input device around one or more of its axes; and an acceleration sensing unit being operable to detect an acceleration of the whole input device along one or more of its axes. The method comprises: a) displaying a view by the multi-touch screen, the view comprising a plurality of GUI elements, each GUI element representing one of the data sets, whereby one of the GUI elements is used as current GUI element; b) detecting, by the motion sensing unit, one or more first tilting motions; c) determining at least one candidate GUI element in dependence on the axis and direction of the one or more first tilting motions, in dependence on the current GUI element and in dependence on the topology of the graph; e) highlighting the at least one candidate GUI element; f) detecting, by the acceleration sensing unit, a first shaking motion; g) automatically selecting, upon the detection of the first shaking motion, the data set represented by the highlighted GUI element.","Depending on the embodiment, the graph may be of different topology. For example, the graph may be a tree representing an organization graph of a company or a region graph. Said graphs may be used for calculating the O-, R-L- and\/or T-aggregated KPI values.","Said features may be highly advantageous as it may render the use of a mouse or a keyboard as input device unnecessary. Using a separate input device is disadvantageous, because using a mouse and\/or a keyboard requires considerable space and preferentially a desktop in order to place the mouse and the keyboard accordingly. Carrying a keyboard or a mouse in addition to the mobile device is often highly inconvenient or not possible at all in many situations. For example, in spontaneously arranged meetings wherein the participants have merely mobile phones and smartphones available, but not their notebooks, specially adapted input devices are not available. In trains and planes usually there's not enough space to place the additional input devices appropriately. Some of these problems are overcome by means of various finger gestures known in the art which enable a user to interact with the device without the assistance of any additional input device.","However, said approach is hampered by the fact that a finger may cover a significant portion of the mobile device. In particular, the finger will always cover exactly that particular portion of the screen displaying the GUI elements a user is currently interested in. This is highly inconvenient and may lead to erroneous selections of GUI element and\/or may slow down human\/machine interaction. Said disadvantages are overcome by embodiments of the method as claimed: a user is only requested to apply one or more tilting motions on the whole input device in order to select a candidate GUI element which is highlighted. Then, when the GUI element the user is interested in is highlighted, the user may apply a shaking motion on the whole device, thereby selecting the currently highlighted GUI element and trigger some actions to be executed by an application program on the one or more data values represented by the selected GUI element. Thus, a user is not required to touch the screen of his mobile device at all in order to efficiently interact with the mobile device. In addition, the user is not required to move a finger over the screen and is thus able to see all GUI elements on the full-screen of his device. This feature is particularly advantageous for smart phones, because the screen size of smart phones is often very small and a finger may cover a significant portion of its screen.","A further advantage may be that the mobile device can be used in a context where a finger gesture cannot be applied for various reasons, e.g. because the outside temperature requires the user to wear gloves. In addition, it is a particularly convenient way of interacting with the mobile device, because the user holding the device in his hands is not required to change the position of any of his hands in order to apply a finger gesture on the touch screen. Rather, he can keep his hands where they are and simply apply one or more tilting motions and a shaking motion on the whole device. According to embodiments, each shaking motion comprises one or more accelerations in opposite directions. According to embodiments, only acceleration motions along one particular axis, in particular the y-axis, are monitored and used for monitoring and determining if and when a shaking motion was applied on the input device. Depending on the embodiment, merely an acceleration along only one single axis, for example the z axis, is to be considered. According to other embodiments, and acceleration motion along any of the three axes, for example the z-, x-, and\/or the y-axis, may be considered.","Considering one or more acceleration motions along only one axis as \u2018shaking motion\u2019 may be advantageous, because this allows encoding shaking motions along each of the axes separately and allows assigning different functions and commands to a shaking motion along each of said axes. On the other hand, considering a shaking motion along any of said three axes may be advantageous, because this empowers the user to shake the device in any direction and still yield the same effect. Thus, the latter embodiments may be perceived by the users as particularly intuitive.","According to embodiments, the acceleration unit detects the occurrence of a shaking motion only in case a minimum number of accelerations has been detected to have been applied on the device within a predefined time period. For example, according to some embodiments, at least three acceleration steps are executed intermittently in opposite directions within a time period of 2000 milliseconds, more preferentially within a time period of 1000 milliseconds.","According to embodiments, the shaking motion is detected by means of a class library provided by an application program or an operating system of the input device, said class library being operable to receive data from the acceleration detection unit. For example, Apple' operating system iOS 3.0 provides for a UIEventSubtypeMotionShake event class. According to said library, an event is an instance of said class and is thrown whenever a shaking motion in accordance with the specifications of said class library is thrown. Corresponding libraries for other hardware platforms and\/or operating systems are known in the art allowing a user skilled in the art to make use of analogous classes, in particular event- and eventhandler classes, for detecting a shaking motion.","According to embodiments, the acceleration sensing unit is a configurable accelerometer which delivers at a particular frequency the occurrence of an acceleration event or is requested with said frequency for an occurrence of said acceleration event. Depending on the embodiment, said frequency is within a range of 50-250 milliseconds, more preferentially with a frequency of 50-150 and even more preferentially with a frequency of 80-120 milliseconds. According to one embodiment, the frequency is 100 milliseconds.","According to preferred embodiment, an acceleration event is determined if the acceleration sensing unit determines an acceleration a wherein a<\u22120.5 g or a>0.5 g, wherein g is the gravitational acceleration of the earth. According to more preferred embodiments, an acceleration event is determined in case a<\u22120.3 g or a>0.3 g. According to some embodiments, said parameters are configurable, e.g., by setting said parameters in the UIAccelerometer class of the iOS API. According to some embodiments, an acceleration event along any of the axes x, y, z is recognized as acceleration event. According to preferred embodiments, only an acceleration along the y axis can trigger the recognition of an acceleration event. This may be advantageous as said axis is considered my many user as the most ergnomical axis for applying a shaking motion.","According to embodiments, the method further comprises: displaying an additional GUI element, the additional GUI element comprising data being contained in or being stored in association with the selected data set. According to some embodiments, upon application of the first shaking motion on the input device a shaking motion event is thrown by the computer-implemented method, thereby triggering the automated selection of the data set in step f).","Navigating within Graphs with Tree Topology","According to embodiments, the graph represents an organization graph having a tree topology. Each displayed GUI element represents an organization node of the organization graph; the current GUI element represents a current organization node and the candidate GUI element represents a candidate organization node. When the at least one candidate GUI element is highlighted in step d), in addition one or more edges connecting the current organization node with the at least one candidate node are displayed and highlighted while all other edges of the graph are not displayed at all or are displayed in a non-highlighted manner.","Highlighting the edges connecting a current GUI element with the candidate GUI element in addition to highlighting the candidate GUI element may be advantageous, because said information indicates the path from a current node to a particular candidate node. In particular in case the user has applied multiple testing operations and has therefore moved multiple steps between and within the different hierarchical levels of the organization graph, highlighting the one or more edges connecting the current GUI element with a current candidate GUI element supports a user in recognizing at which particular position within the topology of the graph the candidate GUI element is located. A further advantage may be that highlighting the edges in addition to the GUI elements representing the nodes allows displaying a plurality of GUI elements being part of large, complex graphs also in a comparatively small screen, because highlighting the path from the current node to the candidate node in addition to highlighting the candidate node provides more information and allows a more intuitive understanding of the topology of the graph and the hierarchical relationships between the current node and a candidate node. According to preferred embodiments, all edges of the graph are displayed, but only the edges connecting the current node with the candidate node are highlighted. For example, the highlighted edges may have a brighter color and\/or a thicker line than all other edges. Thus, features of said embodiments may provide for a intuitive way for navigating within an existing tree data structure and may empower a user to select one of the organization nodes of an organization graph without applying any finger gesture on the device.","According to embodiments, the one or more first tilting motions enable the user to navigate in the organization graph, wherein the one or more first tilting motions are applied on the input device around its x-axis and\/or around its y-axis. Each first tilting motion around said x-axis causes the highlighting of a new candidate GUI element. The node represented by said new candidate GUI element, the new candidate node, belongs to a different hierarchical level than the candidate node whose candidate GUI element was highlighted before the application of said tilting motion. Each first tilting motion around said y-axis causes the highlighting of a new candidate GUI element, the corresponding new candidate node belonging to the same hierarchical level as the candidate node whose candidate GUI element was highlighted before the application of said tilting motion. Upon each first tilting motion the steps b)-d) are repeated, thereby enabling a user to navigate in the organization graph.","According to preferred embodiments, the navigation is implemented such that a tilting motion around the x-axis lowering the top of the input device and raising the bottom of the input device results in navigating the hierarchy one level upwards. For example, in case the graph is a hierarchical tree, navigating the hierarchy one level upwards comprises using and highlighting the parent node of the current candidate node as the new candidate node. Further, according to said preferred implementation, a tilting motion around the x-axis lowering the bottom of the input device and raising the top of the input device results in navigating the hierarchy one level downwards. For example, in case the graph is a hierarchical tree, navigating the hierarchy one level downwards comprises using and highlighting one of the child nodes of the current candidate node as the new candidate node.","A tilting motion around the y-axis lowering the left side of the input device and raising the right side of the input device results in navigating within the current hierarchical level to the left sister node of the current organization node, and a tilting motion around the y-axis lowering the right side of the input device and raising the left side of the input device results in navigating within the current hierarchical level to the right sister node of the current organization node.","According to embodiments, each of the GUI elements may represent an organizational node of the organization graph. Each node may represent, for example, a department or an employee at that department of a company. Each node may be stored in Association with additional information on said department or employee, for example, characteristic KPI values such as turnaround rate, vacation days, a photograph of the employee, e-mail address, mailing address, and the like. By selecting one of the organization nodes by means of a shaking motion applied on the mobile device, a user can trigger the execution of processing steps which result in the display of the additional information of the selected organization node or the further processing of said additional information.","Navigating within Information Sources","According to further embodiments, the graph comprises a plurality of disjoint node sets, each node set being provided by one respective information source, each node of one of said information sources representing a data portion provided by said information source. Each of the information sources is represented by an info-source pane displayed in the view. Each of said panes is one of the GUI elements and comprises a display pane. Displaying the view comprises displaying the info-source pane of each of the disjunct node sets in the view, whereby the info-source pane of a current disjunct node set is highlighted. According to the graph topology the disjoint node sets are connected to each other via first edges forming a first linear navigation path. According to the graph topology the nodes of each disjoint node sets are connected to each other via second edges forming, for each disjoint node set, a second linear navigation path. The display pane may be implemented, for example, in form of a scroll pane being operable to show text of a selected data portion. Likewise, the info-source pane may display a preview of a text document in the form of an image or in the form of a file type symbol.","Said features may be advantageous, because they may empower a user to navigate between a plurality of information sources being represented by nodes arranged along a first navigation path. This can be executed very intuitive the simply by tilting the application device, e.g. around the y-axis of the device clockwise or counterclockwise. Upon each tilting movement, a new node representing an information source may be highlighted as candidate node.","According to embodiments, the data portions are pdf documents and the info-source pane comprises a preview image of the first page of said pdf document or a symbol of the pdf document file type in combination with a file name of said currently displayed pdf document.","According to embodiments, the highlighted current info source pane is not highlighted any more as soon as another info source pane is highlighted as candidate GUI element. According to embodiments, for each information source the view further comprises a data portion GUI element representing all data portions of said information source. Said data portion GUI element can be, for example, an image representing a stack of documents.","According to embodiments, the one or more first tilting motions of step b) enable by the user to navigate within the first navigation path and to select one of the information sources, the one or more first tilting motions of step b) being applied on the input device around its y-axis. A candidate info-source pane representing a candidate disjoint node set of a candidate information source is determined as the at least one candidate GUI element in step c) whereby the topology of the first navigation path is used for determining the at least one candidate GUI element. The candidate info-source pane is highlighted as the candidate GUI element in step d) and the data set selected in step f) is the set of nodes of the disjunct node set represented by the candidate info-source pane.","According to embodiments, the navigation along the first navigation path is implemented such that a tilting motion around the y-axis lowering the left side of the input device and raising the right side of the input device results in navigating along the first navigation path to the left, thereby selecting the info-source pane to the left side of the current info-source pane as the candidate GUI element. A tilting motion around the y-axis lowering the right side of the input device and raising the left side of the input device results in navigating along the first navigation path to the right, thereby selecting the info-source pane to the right side of the current info-source pane as the candidate GUI element.","According to embodiments, the method further comprising the step of: for at least the candidate disjunct node set, automatically selecting one of its nodes as a default node; displaying first text data being contained in said default node in the display pane of the candidate info-source pane; and detecting, by the motion sensing unit, one or more second tilting motions, each second tilting motions being applied by the user and enabling the user to navigate within the plurality of data portions of the candidate disjunct node set. For each of the second tilting motions, a candidate node belonging to the candidate disjunct node set is determined in dependence on the current node, the axis and direction of said second tilting motion and in dependence on the topology of the second navigation path. Then, second text data being contained in said candidate node is automatically displayed in the display pane of the candidate info-source pane.","According to preferred embodiments, the first tilting movements applied for navigating along the first navigation path are applied on an axis being orthogonal to the axis around which the second tilting movements are applied.","According to embodiments, the data portions of each disjunct node set are sorted according to a sorting criterion. The sorting criterion of each node set determines the sequence of the nodes along each of the second paths. The navigation along the second navigation path is implemented such that a tilting motion around the x-axis lowering the top of the input device and raising the bottom of the input device results in navigating along the second navigation path, thereby selecting a data portion of a higher rank according to the sorting criterion. A tilting motion around the x-axis lowering the bottom of the input device and raising the top of the input device results in navigating along the second navigation path, thereby selecting a data portion of a lower rank according to the sorting criterion.","According to embodiments, said sorting criterion is a particular KPI, said KPI having been selected by applying a two-finger gesture for at least a first time period on one of a plurality of GUI elements respectively representing different KPI.","According to embodiments, the method further comprises: detecting, by the acceleration sensing unit, a second shaking motion; and automatically executing, upon the detection of the second shaking motion, a processing operation being selected from the group comprising: displaying the display pane of the current info-source pane in full-screen size; displaying a further GUI element in the view, the further GUI element comprising meta-data on the data portion of the candidate node; displaying the first text of the default node of the current disjunct node set in the display pane of the current info-source pane; and displaying, in each of the displayed info-source panes, a text of said pane's disjunct node set's default node.","For example, each information source may correspond to a particular newsletter provider, e.g. a particular company. Each information source is represented by a particular display pane on the first few. In addition, the totality of data portions available in the information source may be displayed in the form of a further GUI element, e.g. an image comprising a stock of documents or the like. A user may select a particular newsletter provider by navigating along the first navigation path, thereby highlighting and selecting one of the display panes and the corresponding newsletter source. Then, the user may apply one or more second tilting movements, thereby navigating along the second navigation path of the selected newsletter source. For example, by applying the one or more second tilting movements, a user may navigate in a plurality of newsletter items which may be sorted according to the time and date of having received the newsletter item.","According to some embodiments, the order of the nodes along each of the second navigation paths is based on a single sorting criterion shared by all disjunct node sets. For example, all newsletter items of each of the three information sources may be sorted according to the sorting criterion \u2018date of recipe\u2019.","According to preferred embodiments, the default node of each disjunct node set is determined by sorting the nodes of said node set according to said sorting criterion and using the first node of said sorted node set as the default node. A default node may be, for example, the first newsletter item having ever been received from a particular information source or the latest newsletter item having been received from said source.","According to embodiments, the sorting criterion may be, for example: a key word, a data, a KPI value, a document-ID, the author of the data portion, the issue date, publication date or a validity date of the data portion, a page number of a multi-page document represented by the data portion, an identifier of the information source, e.g. the IP number of a mail-server having submitted an e-mail, or an identifier of a machine having submitted status information to the input device. The date used as sorting criteria may be, for example, the time and date of having received the data portion via the respective information source or the time and date of having created the data portion. In case the information source is a particular newsletter provider, the sorting criterion is preferentially the time and date of having received the newsletter item. In case the information source is an electronic book, the sorting criterion is preferentially a page number. In case the data source is a particular file directory, the sorting criterion is preferentially the time and date of last modification of any of the files, the file name, the author or owner of the file, or the like.","According to embodiments, the information source may be an issuer of a newsletter; a machine submitting status information and\/or error codes; a machine or an organisational unit submitting KPI-values; a data repository, in particular a file directory or a database; or an electronic document.","An information source is any interface or data repository from which information can be received by the input device. The interface can be based on a particular communication technology, e.g. e-mail, SMS, radio waves or the like. A particular type of interface may also be characterized by a particular data format of the transferred data. Such a data format can be, for example, e-mail document format, an XML document, a BLOB corresponding to a custom data structure, an RSS feed or the like. An information source may also be characterized by a particular keyword, the e-mail address of the sender etc. a particular data repository comprising, for example, one or more text files is another example of an information source within the meaning of embodiments of the invention. According to some embodiments, a single, multipage electronic document, for example an e-book, can also act as information source.","According to some embodiments, each of the data portions may be an electronic document provided e.g. as a text document; a page of an electronic document, the electronic document being the information source; or an email, e.g. an e-mail of a newsletter archive.","According to a further embodiment, the user may at first, before having selected an information source of interest and before having selected a corresponding candidate info-source pane, navigate along all second navigation path in parallel by executing one or more tilting movements around the x-axis of the device. Thereby, the content of the documents shown in each of the info-source panes is changed synchronously, allowing the user to brows in parallel through a plurality of data portions provided by a plurality of different information sources. The user may then, for example, detect a data portion being of particular interest for him and may select the information source providing said data portion by executing one or more tilting movements around the y-axis of the input device, thereby also selecting an info-source pane representing the information source of interest as candidate info-source pane. Then, the user may apply a shaking motion on the input device, thereby triggering the display of the data portion of interest shown in the candidate info-source pane in greater detail.","Navigating a Perspectively Distorted, Rotatable Circle","According to embodiments, the graph comprises a set of nodes connected to each other via a plurality of edges, said nodes and said edges forming a circular path. The displayed GUI elements represent nodes of said circular path, the displayed GUI being spread across a perceptively distorted circle representing said circular path. The expression \u2018perspectively distorted circle\u2019 as used herein indicates that at least the GUI elements spread across the circle are perspectively distorted. In addition, the line of the circle may be displayed thicker at the front of the circle than at its back. The displayed circle is rotatable around a centre, wherein upon rotation of the circle the size of the GUI elements change perspectively. Upon detecting the one or more first tilting motions in step b), the circle executes a rotation motion, whereby the direction of the rotation motion depends on the direction of each of the detected one or more first tilting motions. The determination of the at least one candidate GUI elements in step c) and the highlighting of said candidate GUI element in step d) are repeatedly executed while rotating the circle, each element at the front position of the circle being thereby used and highlighted as the at least one candidate GUI element, wherein highlighting the at least on candidate GUI element comprises enlarging the size of said GUI element perspectively such that the candidate GUI element is displayed larger than all other GUI elements of the circle. Upon detecting the first shaking motion in step e) and selecting the candidate GUI element in step f), data of the node represented by the candidate GUI element is displayed in one additional GUI element, said data preferentially being meta-information and\/or aggregated KPI values.","Said features may be advantageous, because they empower a user to navigate within a plurality of nodes which preferentially belong to the same hierarchical level of a graph. For example, on employees of a particular department may be graphically represented as GUI elements distributed unload said rotatable circle. The CEO of a company may thus be provided with an overview of all employees of the whole department and be provided with means to select any of said GUI elements in order to display additional information of the employee represented by the candidate GUI element at the front of the circle.","According to embodiments, the rotation of the circle is stopped when the motion sensing unit determines that the input device is held or positioned such that the plane defined by its x and y axis is parallel to the earth' surface. As long as the device is held in a particular angle relative to the earth surface after having applied a first tilting movement, the circle keeps rotating. For example, at the beginning a user may hold his mobile device parallel to the Earth's surface such that the x and y axes of the mobile device define a plane being in parallel to the Earth's surface (for the sake of simplicity considered herein also as a plane). As soon as the user applies a tilting movement around the y-axis of the device in a clockwise fashion (in other words, the user lowers the right side of the device and rises the left side of the device), the circle starts rotating and keeps rotating until the user tilts the input device counterclockwise, thereby repositioning the mobile device and holding the xy-plane of the mobile device in parallel to the Earth's surface again. As a result of repositioning the mobile device, the rotating movement is stopped. According to preferred embodiments, in case the user applies a clockwise tilting movement around the y-axis, the circle also rotates in a clockwise fashion. In case the user applies a counterclockwise tilting movement around the y-axis, the circle rotates counterclockwise.","According to embodiments, the motion sensing unit is a device or component operable to detect the direction of a motion of the device thermally, optically, mechanically, electromagnetically or electrically or based on geomagnetism.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computer-readable storage medium, the storage medium comprising computer-interpretable instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to execute the steps of any of the embodiments described previously.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a multi-touch input having three orthogonal axes x, y, z. The input device comprises: a multi-touch screen; a motion sensing unit being operable to detect a tilt motion of the input device around one or more of its axes; and an acceleration sensing unit being operable to detect an acceleration of the whole input device along one or more of its axes. The input device further comprises a processor and a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to execute method steps for selecting a data set from a plurality of data sets according to any of the embodiments described previously.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computer-readable storage medium, the storage medium comprising computer-interpretable instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to execute for selecting a data set from a plurality of data sets, the storage medium being part of a multi-touch input device, the data sets being connected with each other according to a topology of a graph, the input device having three orthogonal axes x, y, z, the x axis defining a device-centred horizontal line from the left to the right side of the input device, the y axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the bottom of the input device to the top of the input device and the z-axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the back side to the front side of the input device, the method comprising:\n\n","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a multi-touch input device having three orthogonal axes x, y, z, the x axis defining a device-centred horizontal line from the left to the right side of the input device, the y axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the bottom of the input device to the top of the input device and the z-axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the back side to the front side of the input device, the input device comprising:\n\n","In a further aspect the invention relates to a computer-implemented method for specifying a processing operation by means of a multi-touch input device. The input device has an x-axis and an y-axis orthogonal to said x-axis, the x axis defining a device-centred horizontal line from the left to the right side of the input device, the y axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the bottom of the input device to the top of the input device and the z axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the back side to the front side of the input device. The input device comprises a multi-touch screen. The method comprises: displaying a first view on the multi-touch screen, the first view comprising a plurality of first GUI elements; receiving signal data being indicative of a gesture applied by a user on one of the first GUI elements via the multi-touch screen, the gesture being a one-finger or a two-finger gesture wherein a two-finger gesture is a gesture in which two fingers both keep in contact with the multi-touch screen while the two-finger gesture is executed; executing the processing operation in dependence on the signal data. The processing operation can be, for example, one of: sorting a plurality of data objects, each data object having assigned at least one KPI value; aggregating a set of KPI values; disaggregating an aggregated KPI value; determining one or more second views accessible by executing a further gesture on said one first GUI element; or updating the first view in dependence on a result of the processing operation. The signal comprises positional data being indicative of the x and y coordinates of each of the two fingers on the screen. The gestures described in the following may be advantageous as they may provide for a particular intuitive and ergonomic means of selecting and triggering the execution of processing operations by means of a multi-touch input device.","Using gestures instead of input devices such as a mouse or a keyboard may be advantageous as this kind of input means require no additional space and can therefore be easily applied by travellers. Selecting a data set from a plurality of data sets by means of a gesture applied on the screen of the device may be particularly advantageous in the context of managing and evaluating the performance of employees, machines, or production facilities by managers and executive employees which typically spend a considerable fraction of their working time travelling. Often, said employees need to quickly get an overview of a department but also be able to quickly get additional information of a particular employee and his or her performance. Embodiments of the invention therefore provide for an application being particularly adapted for allowing travelling CEOs to manage and evaluate the performance of their employees.","According to embodiments wherein the input device is based on a client device architecture being operable to retrieve O-, R-, T- and L-aggregated data values from a local database and, if not available from there, from a backend database, may be particularly advantageous as said architecture guarantees that the user may access the server database in case a network connection is available and may access the local database of his input device if no network connection is available\u2014as is often the case when travelling. Thus, a combination of the client-server system architecture as described above with the selection of data portions related to employees or other business related items provides for a performance management application being particularly suited for frequent travellers.","KPI Sorting","According to embodiments, the processing operation is the sorting of the plurality of data objects. Each of the first GUI elements represents one of a plurality of different KPIs. The gesture is a two-finger gesture. A two-finger gesture is a gesture of two fingers placed on one of said first GUI elements, whereby the position of each of the fingers on said GUI element is not changed while applying the gesture. The computer-implemented method further comprises: in case said two-finger gesture is applied for at least a first time period, selecting the KPI being represented by said one first GUI element; Upon having selected the KPI, a plurality of data objects is sorted. Each of said data objects has assigned a value for each of one or more different KPs. Said data objects are sorted according to their respectively assigned value of the selected KPI. A list of second GUI elements is displayed, each second GUI element representing one of said data objects. The list is sorted in accordance with the sorting of the data object.","Said feature may be advantageous for the following reasons: requiring a two finger gesture instead of a finger gesture for triggering a sorting operation may be advantageous, because a user is provided with additional means for triggering different actions. For example, a one finger gesture applied on a GUI element may trigger a process being completely unrelated with any sorting operation. In addition, the two finger gesture is applied on a first set of GUI elements resulting in the sorting of data values being represented by second GUI elements. Thus, the effect of triggering the sorting operation by means of a two finger gesture is not negatively affected by the fingers covering at least one of the first GUI elements.","According to embodiments, the first time period is between 0 and 3000 milliseconds, and more preferentially between 0 and 2000 milliseconds and more preferentially between 0 and 1500 milliseconds.","According to embodiments, the list of second GUI elements is displayed in an order being in accordance with the sorting of the data objects. The sorting is implemented such that the first GUI elements and the second GUI elements are simultaneously displayed in the first view before the two-finger gesture is applied. Before the sorting is executed, the second GUI elements are not sorted or sorted in accordance with another sorting order. As a consequence of the selection of the KPI, the second GUI elements are sorted according to the value of the selected KPI and the first view is updated such that the sorted list of second GUI elements is shown.","According to embodiments, the sorted data objects are organisation nodes of an organization graph and the sorting criterion is one out of a plurality of KPI values having been selected by a user via the two finger gesture applied.","Line Chart","According to embodiments, the processing operation is rescaling the line chart. The first GUI element the gesture is applied on is a diagram. The x-axis of the diagram is a time axis, the y-axis of the diagram represents a second scale for indicating the height of at least one of the KPI values. The diagram comprises a plurality of vertical guide lines, the guidelines being separated from each other by a first distance representing a first time period. The diagram comprises a curve being indicative of a development of the at least one KPI value over time. The gesture is a two-finger gesture, wherein the two-finger gesture is a pinch gesture. Said pinch gesture may, for example, be executed by a user changing a distance of two of his fingers on the screen relative to each other. The distance of the two fingers along the x-axis may increase or decrease during the execution of said two-finger gesture. For example, the pinch gesture may be based on a sliding motion of said two fingers relative to each other in opposite directions.","The signal data comprises a plurality of signal data packages received at a plurality of moments while executing the two-finger gesture. According to said embodiments, the method further comprises: for each of the signal data packages, updating the displayed diagram, wherein the first distance increases proportionally to an increasing distance of the two fingers along the x-axis and wherein the first distance decreases proportionally to a decreasing distance of the two fingers along the x-axis.","According to embodiments, the pinch gesture is recognized by means of a class library being operable to recognize and handle pinch-gesture. According to embodiments, the multi-touch input device is an iPhone or an iPad having the operating system iOS. The iOS developers library provides for a UIPinchGestureRecognizer class which is operable to indicate to an application program that a pinch gesture was applied on particular sections of the screen of the multi-touch input device.","Depending on the orientation of the path of said pinch gesture on the screen, the movement of the fingers along the screen may comprise increasing the distance of the x-coordinates of the two fingers and\/or increasing the distance of the y-coordinates of the two fingers. If the movement is executed in the opposite directions, the distance of the x- and\/or the y-coordinates decrease.","According to some embodiments, the change in the distance in the x-coordinates of the two fingers is selectively used for rescaling the x-axis of the line-chart accordingly. Said x-axis of the line-chart represents the time. The change in the distance in the y-coordinates of the two fingers is ignored in embodiments wherein the y-axis of the line chart is not rescalable. According to further embodiments, the y-axis of the line chart is rescalable in addition to the x-axis and the rescaling of the y-axis of the line-chart is executed in accordance with the change in distance of the y-coordinates of the two fingers. This approach may be advantageous as the user can intuitively, by means of one single gesture, determine the degree of rescaling the x-axis and\/or the y-axis of a line chart.","According to embodiments, the line-chart comprises first guidelines separated from each other by a first distance, the first guidelines lying parallel to the y-axis of the line chart, whereby said first distance is rescaled in accordance with the change of the distance of the x-coordinates of the two fingers. According to some embodiments, the line-chart further comprises second guidelines separated from each other by a second distance, the second guidelines lying parallel to the x-axis of the line chart, whereby said second distance is rescaled in accordance with the change of the distance of the y-coordinates of the two fingers when executing a pinch gesture.","According to embodiments, executing a pinch gesture on a line chart triggers the retrieval of O-aggregated KPI values assigned to one or more organization nodes wherein said O-aggregated KPI values have assigned a time stamp information allowing to plot a line chart curve for said O-aggregated KPI value along a time axis. Thus, a user zooming in or out a line-chart by means of the pinch gesture triggers a request for retrieving O-aggregated KPI values. The O-aggregated KPI values may be retrieved as described beforehand from the first (client side) and\/or the second (server side) database as described beforehand.","Map-Based Disaggregation of Data","According to embodiments, the processing operation is disaggregating the set of KPI values. The one first GUI element the two-finger gesture is applied on is a geographic map, wherein a screen distance between any two objects displayed on the screen showing the geographic map is proportional to a physical distance of two corresponding physical objects, the proportionality being based on a geographic scale. The geographic map comprises, for each of one or more first geographic sub-regions, at least one first aggregated KPI value having been aggregated on a first plurality of data objects stored in association with said first geographic sub-region. The gesture is a two-finger gesture, the two-finger gesture being a pinch gesture of two fingers placed on said one first GUI element, whereby the distance of the two fingers increases during the execution of said two-finger gesture. The signal data comprises a plurality of signal data packages received at a plurality of moments while executing the pinch gesture. The method further comprises: for each of the signal data packages, updating the geographic scale and the displayed geographic map. Thereby, each update of the geographic map is executed in accordance with the updated geographic scale, wherein the geographic scale is modified proportionally to an increasing distance of the two fingers relative to each other such that the user zooms into the displayed geographic map, thereby displaying one or more second geographic sub-regions, each second sub-region being a sub-region of one of the first geographic sub-regions. Then, for each of the second geographic sub-regions, calculating and displaying a second aggregated KPI value, each second aggregated KPI value being calculated by aggregating KPI values of a second plurality of data objects stored in association with said second sub-region. Thus, a disaggregation operation is triggered by applying a pinch gesture with increasing finger distance on a map whose map elements correspond to nodes within a hierarchical region graph.","According to embodiments, each of the first and second geographic sub-regions is geographic node of a hierarchical region graph. The second geographic sub-region nodes are child-nodes of the first geographic sub-region nodes and the region graph is used as a drill-down graph for executing a drill-down analysis. Thereby, zooming into the map by means of the two-finger gesture triggers the execution of a disaggregation of aggregated KPI-values in accordance with the topology of the region graph and in accordance with the updated geographic scale.","According to embodiments, each zooming factor of 10% specified by the pinch gesture and resulting in zooming-into a current view of the map may correspond to moving in the hierarchical drill-down graph one level downwards, calculating an aggregated score vale for a node of said lower hierarchical level (which is less aggregated than the previously displayed aggregated value and may therefore be regarded as \u2018disaggregated value\u2019) and displaying said disaggregated value on the zoomed-in map.","Map-Based Aggregation of Data","According to embodiments, the processing operation is aggregating the set of KPI values. The one of the first GUI element the two-finger gesture is applied on is a geographic map. A screen distance between any two objects displayed on the screen showing the geographic map is proportional to a physical distance of two corresponding physical objects, the proportionality being based on a geographic scale. The geographic map comprises, for each of one or more first geographic sub-regions, at least one first aggregated KPI value having been aggregated on a first plurality of data objects stored in association with said first geographic sub-regions.","The two-finger gesture is a pinch gesture, whereby the distance of the two fingers decreases during the execution of said gesture.","The signal data comprises a plurality of signal data packages received at a plurality of moments while executing the two-finger gesture. The method further comprises the following steps: for each of the signal data packages, updating the geographic scale and the displayed geographic map, wherein each update of the geographic map is executed in accordance with the updated geographic scale. During the update, the geographic scale is modified proportionally to a decreasing distance of the two fingers relative to each other such that the user zooms out of the displayed geographic map, thereby displaying one or more third geographic sub-regions, each third geographic sub-region being a super-region of one or more of the first geographic sub-regions. For each of the third geographic sub-regions, calculating and displaying a third aggregated KPI value, each third aggregated KPI value being calculated by aggregating KPI values of a third plurality of data objects stored in association with any of the first sub-region being a sub-region of said third sub-region.","According to embodiments, each of the first and third geographic sub-regions is a geographic node of a hierarchical region graph. The first geographic sub-region nodes are child-nodes of the third geographic sub-region nodes and the region graph is used as a drill-down graph for executing a drill-down analysis. Thereby, zooming out of the map by means of the two-finger gesture triggers the execution of an aggregation of KPI-values in accordance with the topology of the region graph and in accordance with the updated geographic scale. According to embodiments, each zooming factor of 10% specified by the pinch gesture and resulting in zooming-out from a current view of the map may correspond to moving in the hierarchical drill-down graph one level higher, calculating an aggregated score vale for a node of said higher hierarchical level and displaying said aggregated value on the zoomed-out map.","According to some embodiments, only the change in the relative distance of both fingers is considered irrespective of the component of said distance in the x- and\/or y-axis when the pinch gesture is applied on the geographic map. Thus, embodiments may allow a particular intuitive way of rescaling the geographic map and triggering the execution of the aggregation or disaggregation task. This approach is intuitive, as a map is typically based on a single scale and the aggregation or disaggregation is based on a single drill-down graph topology.","According to embodiments, executing a pinch gesture on a geographic map triggers the aggregation and\/or disaggregation of KPI values assigned to one or more organization nodes being stored in association with a region node represented by a section of the displayed geographic map. Thus, a user zooming in or out a geographic map by means of the pinch gesture triggers a request for retrieving R-aggregated KPI values corresponding to the hierarchical level of the region graph displayed. The R-aggregated KPI values may be retrieved as described beforehand from the first (client side) and\/or the second (server side) database as described beforehand.","Application Context Preview","According to embodiments, the one or more second views are accessible by executing the further gesture on said one first GUI element. Each of the second views comprises one or more second GUI elements for processing one or more KPI values. The gesture consists of touching said one first GUI element by one finger for at least a first time period for selecting said first GUI element. The further gesture consists of dragging said one first GUI element to a target GUI element, the target GUI element being one of the first GUI elements, by moving the finger along a path from said one first GUI element to the target GUI element, thereby keeping in touch with the surface of the screen. After having reached the target GUI element, upon receiving a signal that the finger is removed from the screen surface, said one dragged first GUI element is dropped on the second GUI element.","Each of the target GUI elements represents one of the second views. Upon executing said dropping action, the display of the second view represented by the target GUI element is triggered. According to embodiments, the method further comprises: selecting the one first GUI element on which the gesture was applied; upon receiving the signal data, determining one or more target GUI elements to which the selected first GUI element can be dragged, said dragging to be executed by means of the further gesture; displaying, for each of the target GUI elements, a pointer GUI element being indicative of the path from the selected GUI element to said target GUI element; and upon receiving further signal data indicating a dragging movement of the selected GUI element to one of the target GUI elements, displaying parts of the second view represented by said one target GUI element.","According to embodiments, the portion of the displayed parts of the second view correlates with the portion of the path already covered while executing the further gesture. The portion of the second view displayed is 0% at the moment when selecting the one first GUI element and is 100% at the moment when the selected first GUI element is dropped on the target GUI element.","According to embodiments, the portion of the displayed parts of the second view and the portion of the first view together cover 100% of the screen. The portion of the first view is 100% at the moment when selecting the one first GUI element and is 0% at the moment when the selected first GUI element is dropped on the target GUI element.","According to embodiments, the portion of the displayed parts of the second view increases as a result of executing a sliding motion on the second view along the selected path. The sliding motion of the second view is executed in the same speed and direction as the dragging movement of the finger. While executing the dragging movement, the second view thereby covers and hides a growing portion of the first view.","According to some embodiments, the second view moves into the screen in the form of an overlay on the first view.","According to embodiments, the second view is transparent as long as the second view covers only parts of the first view, and wherein the second view turns opaque at the moment of dropping the selected first GUI element onto the target GUI element. This may be advantageous, as the user is empowered to perceive a preview of the application context provided by the second view while still being aware of all functionalities provided by the first view. In case the user removes the finger from the screen before the target GUI is reached, the second view disappears and the data of the selected first GUI element is not manipulated.","According to further embodiments, the second view moves into the screen by executing the following steps: sliding the first view in accordance with the speed and direction of the dragging finger, whereby the area not covered any more by the first view is covered by the second view. Thus, the first and the second view are moved synchronously along the path until the finger reaches the original xy coordinates of the target GUI element. At this moment, the first view is slid completely out of the screen and the second view covers the full screen. According to said embodiment, the original path connecting the selected first GUI element and the target GUI element are determined based on the x and y coordinates of said respective GUI element at the moment when the user selects the first GUI element. As the first view moves slides together with the finger along the path to the xy coordinates of the target GUI element, the user may have to remember the position of said target GUI element as the sliding first view may not provide him with visual feedback on the portion of the path he has already passed with his finger.","According to embodiments, the selected first GUI element represents a KPI and the second view represented by the target GUI element comprises at least one GUI element for aggregating, disaggregating and\/or displaying one or more values of said KPI. In other words, upon selection of the target GUI element a process aggregating, disaggregating and\/or displaying one or more values of said KPI is triggered. The selected first GUI element represents an organization node of an organization graph having assigned a value of said KPI and wherein the second view represented by the target GUI element comprises at least one GUI element for displaying additional information stored in association with the organization node of represented by the selected GUI element.","According to embodiments, the selected first GUI element represents an organization node of an organization graph and the second view represented by the target GUI element comprises at least one GUI element for performance management tasks to be executed on the departments and\/or employees represented by the selected first node.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computer-readable non-transitory storage medium being contained in a multi-touch input-device, the storage medium comprising computer-interpretable instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to execute a method for specifying a processing operation, the method comprising:\n\n","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a multi-touch input device, the input device having an x-axis and an y-axis orthogonal to said x-axis, the x axis defining a device-centred horizontal line from the left to the right side of the input device, the y axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the bottom of the input device to the top of the input device and the z axis defining a device-centred vertical line from the back side to the front side of the input device, the input device comprising:\n\n","In the following like elements of the various embodiments are designated by identical reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0222","num":"0299"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 13","FIG. 12","FIG. 14","FIG. 15","FIG. 17"],"b":["150","165","154","156","151","161","151","152","150","156","157","158"]},"The application program  is operable to access the tables of the first database  for retrieving aggregated KPI values stored to the first database and for displaying said data values in one of the views -.

Touching the first GUI element is recognized as first gesture, dragging and dropping said GUI element to a target GUI element is recognized as a second gesture. For each of the determined target GUI elements -, a pointer GUI element - being indicative of a path from the selected first GUI element  to said target GUI element is displayed. Said four pointer GUI elements are depicted in . The GUI elements - cannot act as target GUI elements. Therefore, no corresponding pointer GUI element for GUI elements - are determined and displayed in upon selection of the first GUI element . Thus, a user being unfamiliar with an application program intuitively recognizes which drag-and-drop targets and corresponding processing operations are available for a particular GUI element  within a particular view .","According to , the user may have decided to choose GUI element  as target. As soon as the user starts dragging the selected first GUI element  along the path indicated by the pointer GUI element , a second view  appears. The appearing second view is determined automatically by the application program in dependence of the target GUI element chosen by the user. A plurality of second views may exist, each view corresponding to a different application context and\/or processing operation to be executed on data represented by the first GUI element. A user choosing a particular target GUI element thus determines which kind of second view and corresponding application context should be displayed and which further processing operation should be executed.","When executing the dragging operation by means of the finger of the user, the portion of the displayed parts of the second view  proportionally correlates with the portion (i.e., the ratio of the area of the second view covering the first view in relation to the area of the first view covered) of the path between the first GUI element  and the target GUI element  already covered when executing the dragging gesture. This is indicated in -. When the user removes this finger  from the touch screen when having reached the target GUI element , the selected first GUI element  is dropped onto the target GUI element . As a consequence, upon a refresh of the GUI, the second view represented by the target GUI element  as depicted in covers the first view completely. According to other embodiments (not shown), the selected first GUI element  may represent one or more KPIs. By dragging and dropping said KPI on a target GUI element, e.g. onto a GUI element representing a particular organization node of an organization graph, retrieval of said selected KPIs for the organization node of the target GUI may be triggered.

As a consequence, the KPI represented by the selected GUI element is used as sorting criterion. In this case, the KPI \u201cprofit margin\u201d is used as sorting criterion. The selection of said KPI as sorting criterion triggers a sorting process of a plurality of data objects. Each of said data objects is represented by a second GUI element -. For example, the sorted data objects may be organization nodes of an organization graph, in particular employees. Each data object representing an employee may comprise a KPI value of said employee for each or for at least some of the KPIs available. Upon selection of one of that KPIs as sorting criterion, the data objects representing the employees are sorted according to said selected KPI.
