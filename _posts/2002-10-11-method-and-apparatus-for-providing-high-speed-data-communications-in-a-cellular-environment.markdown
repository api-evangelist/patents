title: Method and apparatus for providing high speed data communications in a cellular environment
abstract: A method and apparatus for transmitting digital data in a cellular environment. Adjacent cells of the cellular system are prevented from simultaneously transmitting data. Because the noise from transmissions of adjacent cells is a primary source of interference, the transmission rate of power limited base stations can be dramatically increased when the noise from adjacent cells is eliminated. The transmissions to each subscriber station are made at a fixed transmission power level. However, the data rate of transmitted signals differs from one subscriber station to another depending the path loss differences. In a first exemplary embodiment, the data rate of transmissions to a subscriber station is determined by selecting an encoding rate for the transmitted signal while holding the symbol rate constant. In a second exemplary embodiment, the data rate of transmissions to a subscriber station is determined by selection a modulation format for the transmitted signal which directly changes the symbol rate of transmission to a subscriber station.

No. 08\/741,320, filed on Oct. 26, 1996, now Patent No. 6,496,543.","I. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for providing high speed data in a wireless cellular communication environment.","II. Description of the Related Art","As wireless communication technology has advanced, an increase in the demand for high speed data services in a wireless environment has grown dramatically. The use of code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation is one of several techniques for providing digital wireless transmission that is well suited for the transmission of digital data. Other methods of digital wireless transmission include time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA).","However, the spread spectrum modulation technique of CDMA has significant advantages other digital modulation techniques. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. The method for providing digital wireless communications using CDMA modulation was standardized by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) in -95---(hereafter IS-95).","The current wireless communication systems can only accommodate relatively low transmission rates. In addition, most current wireless communication systems have not been optimized for the transmission of digital data, but rather have been optimized for the transmission of speech information. Therefore, there is a need in the industry for a method of providing high speed digital data in a wireless environment.","The present invention is a novel and improved method and apparatus for transmitting digital data in a cellular environment. In the present invention, adjacent cells of the cellular system are prevented from simultaneously transmitting data. Thus, if a first base station on one side of a cell boundary is transmitting, then a second base station on the other side of the cell boundary is silent throughout the transmission period of the first base station. Because the noise from transmissions of adjacent cells is a primary source of interference, the transmission rate of power limited base stations can be dramatically increased when the noise from adjacent cells is eliminated.","In the present invention, all transmissions from a base station are transmitted at a fixed power level and the transmissions to each subscriber station in a cell are transmitted in non overlapping bursts. Thus, when a base station is transmitting, its transmissions are directed to one subscriber station within the cell, allowing the full amount of available power to be used to transmit data to that subscriber station which maximizes the available data rate to the subscriber station.","For the sake of clarity, it should be noted that two separate but related rates are referred to herein. One is the information rate which refers to the rate of user generated information bits. The second is the transmission rate which is the rate of bits transmitted over the air.","When transmissions are made at a fixed power level, the amount of information that can be transmitted between the base station and the subscriber station varies with link budget factors which are well known in the art. The most significant link budget factor in a wireless communication system is the path loss between the base station and the subscriber station. The path loss is strong function of the distance between the base station and the subscriber station.","In the present invention, the transmissions to each subscriber station are made at a fixed transmission power level. However, the information rate of transmitted signals differs depending the distance between the subscriber station and the base station. In the first exemplary embodiment, the information rate of transmissions to a subscriber station is determined by selecting an encoding rate for the transmitted signal while holding the transmission rate constant. In the second exemplary embodiment, the information rate of transmissions to a subscriber station is determined by selecting a modulation format for the transmitted signal which directly changes the transmission rate of transmission to a subscriber station.","In the following description, the same reference number is used to describe both the cell or area serviced by a base station and the base station itself. In the present invention, two adjacent cells are prohibited from simultaneously transmitting. Thus, in , when the base station  is transmitting then the base stations A-F are prevented from transmitting. The noise (N) experienced by a base station transmitting in a cellular environment is described by equation (1) below:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere Nis the noise from base stations in adjacent cells, Nis the interference from multipath reflections and Nis the thermal noise in the system and Naccounts for all other sources of noise.\n","The noise value (N) limits the amount of information that can be transmitted in a power limited wireless communication system. The present invention eliminates the noise from adjacent cells, N, by preventing any two adjacent cells from transmitting simultaneously. In addition, because a base station transmits to only one subscriber station at a time, all of its available energy can be used for the transmissions to that one subscriber station. Reducing the total noise (N) and increasing the power available for transmission to a given subscriber station greatly increases available the information rate for transmissions to the subscriber station.","Referring to , base station controller (BSC)  controls the operation of a large number of base stations within a geographical region. In the present invention, BSC  coordinates the transmission by base stations , A-F and A-L such that no two adjacent cells are simultaneously transmitting. In the present invention, BSC  sends a signal to a selected one of base stations , A-F and A-L, directing the selected base station to transmit for a predetermined time interval.","In a preferred implementation, the cells are grouped into sets of non adjacent cells wherein any of the cells within that set may simultaneously transmit. For example, a first set of non adjacent cells may consist of cells A, C, E, C, K and G. A second set of non adjacent cells may consist of cells B, D, F, A, E and I. In this preferred implementation, BSC  selects the subset of non adjacent cells which can transmit and any or all cells within that set of non adjacent cells can transmit during that frame cycle.","Referring to the timing diagram of , BSC  sends a transmit message to base station  at time 0. In the preferred implementation, BSC  sends a message to all base stations of the set of nonadjacent base stations which includes base station . In response to that message, base station  transmits during the time interval from 0 to T. At time T, BSC  sends a transmit message to base station A directing base station A to transmit during the time interval between time T and time 2T. This process is repeated for each base station of base stations B-F as shown in . At time 7T, BSC  sends a message to base station  which transmits during the time interval between time 7T and 8T.","Note that when one of base stations A-F are transmitting, it is possible for a subset of base stations A-F to be transmitting, so long as no two base stations share a common cell boundary. For example, when base station A is transmitting then cells , B, F, E, D and F cannot transmit because they are adjacent to cell A. However, cells C-F may transmit during this period because they are not adjacent to cell A. In a preferred embodiment, the time intervals for transmission are the same so as to reduce the management complexity of coordinating the transmissions of base stations in the system. It should be noted that the use of varying time intervals is foreseen as a possibility.","In the exemplary embodiment, illustrated in , the transmission cycle of cells follows a simple deterministic pattern. It is understood that in simple deterministic transmission cycle, it is not necessary for the base station to operate under the control of BSC  because each base station can transmit at predetermined times without control from BSC . In a preferred embodiment, the transmission cycle is not determined by a simple deterministic pattern such as the one illustrated in .","In the preferred embodiment, BSC  selects a base station or set of nonadjacent base stations which is to transmit in accordance with the amount of information queued for transmission in the base station or set of non adjacent base stations. In the preferred embodiment, BSC  monitors the amount of messages that are in a queue maintained by each base station or set of non adjacent base stations and selects the base station to transmit based on the amount of data in the queues.","Within each cell may be a plurality of subscriber stations, each which require data to be transmitted to them by the base station serving that cell. In the exemplary embodiment, the base station designates the identity of the subscriber station to which it is transmitting by means of a header. Referring to , in the first time interval (time 0 to T), base station  transmits to a selected subscriber station. In the exemplary embodiment, each frame is 2 ms in duration. The transmitted data is provided with a header that identifies the selected subscriber station.","In an alternative implementation, each cell is divided into narrow sectors wherein each sector can be transmitted to independently of transmitting to any other sector in the cell. This can be accomplished by means of highly directional antennas the design of which is well known in the art.  illustrates a cell  served by base station , which is divided into sectors A-O. In this embodiment, each cell of the communication system which is similarly sectorized transmits to a random sector or subset of sectors in it. The probability of overlapping simultaneous transmissions from adjacent sectors is small as long as each cell is divided into a sufficiently large number of sectors.","It should be noted, with reference to , that all forward link transmissions are provided at the same energy E, which would typically be the maximum transmission energy allowed for by government regulations. Equation (2) below illustrates a general link budget analysis which describes the interrelation of parameters in a wireless communication system with fixed power (E):\n\n(bits\/)()+()()+()+(),\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere Eis the fixed transmission energy of the base station, R is the transmission rate, (Eb\/No)req is the required signal to noise ratio for a given error rate, Lis path loss in decibels and Lis the other loses in decibels. The path loss, L, depends strongly on the distance between the base station and the subscriber station. In the present invention, either the transmission rate, R, or the required signal to noise ratio, (Eb\/No), is varied based on the distance between the subscriber station and the base station.\n","Referring to , three subscriber stations A, B and C are within the cell boundary  and as such are served by base station . The distances to the subscriber stations A, B and C are r1, r2 and r3, respectively. In an alternative embodiment, an effective distance can be used wherein the effective distance is a metric which is selected in accordance with the path loss between base station  and the receiving subscriber station. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the effective distance is related to but not the same as the physical distance between the base station and the subscriber station. The effective distance is a function both of the physical distance and the course of the propagation path.","Referring back to equation (2), it can be seen that the effects of differences in the path loss (L) can be offset holding all else constant by changing the value of (Eb\/No). The value (Eb\/No)depends on the error detection and correction techniques employed to protect the transmitted data. The encoding rate refers to the ratio of the number of binary symbols output by the encoder to the number of bits input into the encoder. In general the higher the encoding rate of the transmission system the greater the protection to the transmitted data and the lower the required signal to noise ratio of the signal (Eb\/No). Thus, in a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the encoding rate for transmissions to subscriber stations is selected based on the distance between the subscriber station and the base station. Because communication systems are bandwidth limited, the higher encoding rate employed results in lower data throughput of the system.","In equation (2), it can be seen that the effects of differences in the path loss (L) can, also, be offset by changing the value of the transmission rate, R. The transmission rate, R, is given by the equation:\n\n\u00b7log\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere Ris the number of symbols transmitted and M is the number of symbols in the modulation constellation. Thus, if the distance between the base station and the subscriber station is great, the transmission rate, R, is reduced. In the present invention, the transmission rate is varied by changing the modulation format to one with more or less symbols in the modulation constellation. Whereas, when the distance between the base station and the subscriber station is small, the transmission rate, R, is increased. In the second exemplary embodiment, the symbol rate is set by selection of a modulation format. The information rate is the rate at which actual bits of uncoded user information is transmitted.\n","Assuming that the physical distance and the effective distances to be closely related, base station  will transmit at a lower information rate to subscriber station A than it will to subscriber station B, since the effective distance to subscriber station A is longer than the effective distance to subscriber station B.","In the exemplary embodiment, each subscriber station transmits a message indicating its location to the base station serving the cell in which it is located. In an alternative embodiment, methods of positioning which are well known in the art can be used by the communication station to estimate the location of the subscriber station. In an alternative embodiment, the base station uses an effective distance which is determined in accordance with a measurement of the path loss between the base station and the subscriber station. The measurement of path loss can be performed by transmitting a signal of a known power from the base station and measuring the received power at the subscriber station. Similarly, the measurement of path loss can be performed by transmitting a signal of a known power from the subscriber station and measuring the received power at the base station. It should be noted that the references to distance between the base station and the subscriber station apply equally to the physical distance and the effective distance based on measured path loss.","In the present invention the initial encoding rate or modulation format are selected and provided initially during the service set up procedure. Then the distance is tracked. If a sufficient change in the distance results during the service a new encoding rate or modulation format is selected in accordance with the new distance.","In the first exemplary embodiment, the base station selects an encoding rate in accordance with the distance between the base station and the subscriber station. The base station transmits an indication of the selected encoding rate to the receiving subscriber station. The receiving subscriber station, in accordance with the selected encoding rate, selects a decoding format appropriate for use with the selected encoding rate.","In the second exemplary embodiment, the base station selects a modulation format based on the distance between the base station and the subscriber station. The base station then transmits an indication of the selected modulation format to the receiving subscriber station. The receiving subscriber station, in accordance with the selected modulation format, sets up the demodulator appropriate for reception of the signal modulated in accordance with the selected modulation format.","A block diagram of the exemplary embodiment of base station  is illustrated in . A block diagram of the exemplary embodiment of subscriber station A is illustrated in .","In the first exemplary embodiment, the encoding rate for transmissions to a subscriber station is selected in accordance with the distance between the base station and the subscriber station. Thus, the information rate is varied with the transmission rate, R, held fixed by selecting one of a plurality of encoding rates. First, subscriber station A registers with base station . In the registration process, mobile station A alerts base station  of its existence and performs basic system set up tasks as is well known in the art. An exemplary embodiment for device registration is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,289,527, entitled \u201cMOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE REGISTRATION METHOD\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","In the exemplary embodiment, signal generator  of subscriber station A generates a message indicating its location and provides the message to transmission subsystem . Transmission subsystem  encodes, modulates, upconverts and amplifies the message and provides the message through duplexer  for transmission through antenna . The location message is received by antenna  and provided to receiver subsystem . Recevier subsystem  amplifies, downconverts, demodulates and decodes the received location message and provides it to transmission controller .","In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mobile station A transmits a message indicating its location to base station  during the registration process. In addition, in the exemplary embodiment, subscriber station A tracks its own movement and if the distance changes by at least a certain amount, subscriber station A transmits an indication of its new location. As described above alternative methods for determining the subscriber station's location or methods based upon the measured the path loss can be employed. In the exemplary embodiment, the location information is provided to transmission controller  of base station , which computes the distance between base station  and subscriber station A.","Transmission controller  selects an encoding rate in accordance with the distance between subscriber station A and base station . In a preferred embodiment the distances between base station  and subscriber station A is quantized in to discrete values as illustrated in . Referring to , all subscriber stations that are located between base station  and the circle A would receive information at a first encoding rate. All subscriber stations that are located between circle A and the circle B would receive information at a second encoding rate. All subscriber stations that are located between circle B and the circle C would receive information at a third encoding rate. For example, referring to , base station  may use a rate \u00bd code when transmitting to subscriber station B which is close to base station . However, base station  may use a rate \u215b code when transmitting to subscriber station A which is far from base station .","If the distance between the base station and the subscriber station is great, a higher encoding rate code will be selected. Whereas, when the distance between the base station and the subscriber station is small, a lower encoding rate will be selected. Error correction and detection methods employed at subscriber station A will permit a lower required signal to noise ratio, (Eb\/N0), for a given error rate. The lower the rate of coding, the greater the number of errors that can be corrected and the lower the required signal to noise ratio (Eb\/N0).","In the first exemplary embodiment, transmission controller  selects the encoding rate as described above and sends an indication of the selected rate to subscriber station A. In the exemplary embodiment, the message indicating the encoding rate is transmitted over a paging channel during the registration process. Paging channels are used in wireless communication systems for sending short messages from a base station to a subscriber station. In a preferred embodiment, the communication system permits base station  to change the encoding rate by subsequent messages transmitted on the traffic channel. One reason to provide for changing the encoding rate is to allow for changes in the location of subscriber station A.","In the exemplary embodiment, the message indicating the selected encoding rate is provided by transmission controller  to encoder  which encodes the message. The encoded symbols from encoder  are provided to interleaver , which reorders the symbols in accordance with a predetermined reordering format. In the exemplary embodiment, the interleaved symbols are provided to scrambler  which scrambles the interleaved signal in accordance with a CDMA spreading format as described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,901,307 and 5,103,459.","The scrambled read signal is provided to modulator  which modulates the signal in accordance with a predetermined modulation format. In the exemplary embodiment, the modulation format for the paging channel is quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK) modulation. The modulated signal is provided to transmitter , where it is upconverted and amplified and transmitted through antenna .","The transmitted message indicating the encoding rate is received by antenna  and provided to receiver (RCVR) . Receiver  downconverts and amplifies the received signal and provides the received signal to demodulator . Demodulator  demodulates the received signal. In the exemplary embodiment, demodulation format for the paging channel is a QPSK demodulation format. In the exemplary embodiment, the demodulated signal is provided to equalizer . Equalizer  is a channel equalizer which reduces the effects of the propagation environment such as multipath effects. Channel equalizers are well known in the art. The design and implementation of a channel equalizer is disclosed in copending U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,006 entitled \u201cAdaptive Despreader\u201d, filed Jul. 31, 1995, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","The equalized signal is provided to descrambler  which descrambles the signal in accordance with a CDMA despreading format described in detail in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,901,307 and 5,103,459. The despread symbols are provided to de-interleaver  and reordered according to a predetermined de-interleaving format. The reordered symbols are provided to decoder  which decodes the message indicating the selected encoding rate and provides the decoded message to control processor .","In response to the decoded message, control processor  provides a signal to decoder  indicating a decoding format that will be used for high speed data transmissions. In the exemplary embodiment, decoder  is capable of decoding a received signal in accordance with a plurality of trellis decoding formats where each decoding format corresponds to a corresponding different encoding format.","Referring back to , data to be transmitted to the subscriber stations in cell  (subscriber stations A, B and C) is provided to queue . The data is stored in queue  according to the subscriber station to which it is to be transmitted. The data for subscriber station A is stored in memory A, the data for subscriber station B is stored in memory B, the data for subscriber station C is stored in memory C, and so on. The different memory elements (A-N) are purely for illustrative purposes, it will be understood that the queue typically consists of a single memory device and the separate memory devices illustrated simply refer to memory locations within the device.","At the first time interval (t=0), in , BSC  sends a message to transmission controller  directing base station  to transmit. In response transmission controller  selects a receiving subscriber station within its coverage area and the period of time the data has been sitting in the queue. In a preferred embodiment, the selection of the receiving subscriber station is based on the amount of data queued for transmission to the subscriber stations in the coverage area. Transmission controller  selectively provides a signal to one of memory elements A-N based on its selection of the receiving subscriber station. In addition, in accordance with the receiving subscriber station selected, transmission controller  provides a signal to encoder  indicating the encoding rate to be used for transmissions to the selected subscriber station.","Transmission controller  provides, to encoder , a header message identifying the receiving subscriber station. In an exemplary embodiment, encoder  encodes the header message using an encoding format to be used to encode the headers for transmissions to all subscriber stations. In an exemplary embodiment, the header information is encoded separately from the rest of the data, so that a subscriber station need not decode the very large amount of data transmitted during the transmission interval if it is not intended for that subscriber station.","Transmission controller , then, provides a signal to memory element A directing it to provide data and specifying the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted to receiving subscriber station A during the predetermined time interval. The predetermined maximum is the maximum of information that can be transmitted to subscriber station A within the time interval, T, at the selected encoding rate (R), for the fixed transmission rate, R, as shown in equation (4) below.\n\nMax Data=()\/\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nIn response to the signal from transmission controller , memory element A provides an amount of data less than or equal to Max Data to encoder .\n","Encoder  encodes the data using the selected encoding format and combines the encoded symbols of the header message with the encoded symbols of data. In the exemplary embodiment, encoder  is capable of encoding the data at a plurality of convolutional encoding rates. For example encoder  may be capable of encoding the data using a rate \u00bd, \u2153, \u00bc and \u2155 convolutional encoding formats. Encoding rates can be varied to essentially any rate by using a combination of encoders typically used and data puncturing. Encoder  provides the encoded symbols to interleaver .","Interleaver  reorders the symbols in accordance with a predetermined reordering format and provides the reordered symbols to scrambler . Scrambler  scrambles the symbols in accordance with a predetermined CDMA spreading format and provides the spread symbols to modulator . It should be noted that because only one subscriber station A is being transmitted to, the use of scrambler  is for the purposes of scrambling the data for security purposes and to increase the signal's immunity to narrow band noise and not for the purpose of multiple access communications.","Modulator  modulates the spread symbols in accordance with a predetermined modulation format. In the exemplary embodiment, modulator  is a 16-ary QAM modulator. Modulator  provides the modulated symbols to transmitter (TMTR) . Transmitter  upconverts and amplifies the signal and transmits the signal through antenna .","The transmitted signal is received by subscriber station A at antenna . The received signal is provided to receiver (RCVR) . Receiver  downconverts and amplifies the received signal.

The demodulated signal is provided to equalizer  which is a channel equalizer as described above. The channel equalized signal is provided to descrambler  which descrambles the signal in accordance with a predetermined CDMA despreading format as described above. De-interleaver  reorders the despread symbols and provides them to decoder .","In the exemplary embodiment, decoder  first decodes the header message contained in the reordered symbols. The header message is provided to header check means  which verifies that the information being transmitted is intended for subscriber station A. If the data is intended for subscriber station A, then the rest of the data is decoded. When the header indicates the data is intended for the user of subscriber station A, header check  sends a signal to decoder  indicating that the remaining information should be decoded. In an alternative embodiment, all information is decoded and then the header is checked after the decoding process.","Decoder  decodes the symbols in accordance with the selected decoding format from control processor . In the exemplary embodiment, decoder  decodes the reordered symbols in accordance with one of a plurality of trellis decoding formats selected based on the selected encoding rate. The decoded symbols are then provided to the user of subscriber station A.","In the second exemplary embodiment, transmission controller  selects the modulation format in accordance with the distance between the base station and the mobile station. Base station  sends an indication of the selected modulation format to the subscriber station. The modulation format directly effects the transmission rate R. Referring to equation (2), all parameters are fixed in this case except the path loss, L, and the transmission rate, R. Higher transmission rates (R) are transmitted using a modulation format that contains a larger set of modulation symbols. For example, 28-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) can be used for transmission to subscriber station near the base station. Whereas 16-ary QAM modulation would be used for transmission to subscriber stations further from the base station.","In the exemplary embodiment, subscriber station A transmits a message indicating its location to base station . In response, base station  selects a modulation format. As described with respect to the previous embodiment, the distances computed by transmission controller  are quantized. The modulation format is selected in accordance with the quantized distances. Referring to , all subscriber stations that are located between base station  and the circle A would receive information using a first modulation format. All subscriber stations that are located between circle A and the circle B would receive information using a second modulation format. All subscriber stations that are located between circle B and the circle C would receive information at using a third modulation format. For example, referring to , base station  may use a QPSK modulation format when transmitting to subscriber station B which is close to base station . By contrast, base station  may use a 64-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) when transmitting to subscriber station A which is far from base station . In the exemplary embodiment, the message indicating the selected modulation format is transmitted over a paging channel during the registration process. Again, in a preferred embodiment, the communication system permits base station  to change the modulation format by subsequent messages transmitted on the paging channel.","The transmitted signal indicating the modulation format is received by subscriber station A as described above and provided to control processor . Control processor  provides a signal to demodulator  indicating a demodulation format that will be used. Demodulator , of the second exemplary embodiment, is capable of demodulating a received signal in accordance with a plurality of demodulation formats. In response to the signal from control processor , an appropriate demodulation format is selected.","Referring back to , data to be transmitted to the subscriber stations in cell  (subscriber stations A, B and C) is provided to queue . At the first time interval (t=0), BSC  sends a message to transmission controller  directing base station  to transmit. In response to the signal, transmission controller  selects a receiving subscriber station as described above. Transmission controller  selectively provides a signal to one of memory elements A-N based on its selection of the subscriber station. In addition, in accordance with the subscriber station selected, transmission controller  provides a signal indicating the selected modulation format to modulator .","Transmission controller  provides, to encoder , a header message that identifies the subscriber station to which the data is being sent. Encoder  encodes the header message as described above. Transmission controller , then, provides a signal to memory element A directing it to provide data and specifying the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted to receiving subscriber station A during the predetermined time interval. The predetermined maximum is the maximum of information that can be transmitted to subscriber station A within the time interval, T, at the selected rate as shown in equation (4) below.\n\nMax Data=\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nwhere M is the number of modulation symbols used in the selected modulation format and Ris the symbol rate.
