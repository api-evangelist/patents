{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service provider networks transport network traffic associated with a variety of services, applications, and content. The network traffic may include voice, text, video and\/or data. Service provider networks are sized and\/or scaled in order to transport an increasing quantity of traffic that is sent by and\/or received from an increasing number of users and\/or content providers. Additionally, the increase in the quantity of traffic corresponds to an expanding demand for various types of services, applications, and\/or content.","Unfortunately, the service provider networks transport content or services to user devices in a manner that is not always tailored to the user devices. Further, as the service provider networks transport the increasing quantity of traffic, the service provider networks do not always have the capacity to process the traffic in a manner that tailors the content or the services to the user devices.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods, described herein, may enable information, associated with traffic being transported over a radio access network (RAN), to be dynamically obtained on a real-time basis. The information associated with the traffic may be used to identify a cell, within the RAN, via which a user device is communicating with a service provider network associated with the RAN. The identified cell may permit information associated with a location of the user device (hereinafter referred to as \u201clocation information\u201d) to be obtained and encoded for use by a content provider to provide content that is uniquely tailored (hereinafter referred to as \u201ccustomized content\u201d) for the user device.","As described herein, a RAN modeling server may perform a RAN modeling operation by monitoring traffic flowing to and\/or from the service provider network via the RAN. The RAN modeling server may monitor packets, associated with the traffic, that are being transported over the RAN via cells that serve one or more user devices. The RAN modeling server may obtain information associated with the traffic based on the packet monitoring. The RAN modeling server may forward the information associated with the traffic to a content distribution system associated with the service provider network.","As also described herein, an analytics and reporting (AR) server, associated with the content distribution system, may used the information associated with the traffic to generate one or more location codes based on a location associated with a cell via which the user device is communicating. The AR server may, for example, generate location information, associated with the user device, based on a particular geographical location associated with a cell that is serving the user device.","The AR server may encode the location information to create one or more location codes each having a different code length (e.g., a different quantity of characters, values, bits, etc.). The location codes may correspond to a particular location associated with a site of the cell via which the user device is communicating. Each of the location codes may represent a respective different quantity of location error relative to the particular location. The different quantities of location error may correspond to geographical areas, of different sizes, in which the cell site is located.","In one example, a location code of a particular length, when decoded by a content provider, may correspond to a geographical boundary (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cgeo fence\u201d) that encompasses a geographical area associated with the cell site within which the user device is located. In another example, another location code, of a length that is greater than the particular length, may correspond to another geo fence, associated with the cell, that encompasses another geographic area that is less than the geographical area. The other location code, when decoded, may correspond to a quantity of location error that is less than another quantity of location error associated with the location code. Generally, as a code length of a location code increases, a quantity of location error may decrease and\/or a size of a corresponding geo fence, within which the user device is located, may decrease. The AR server may send one or more of the location codes to a content provider.","A content provider may generate customized content for the user device based on a length associated with a location code to which access is authorized (e.g., based on a service level agreement (SLA) and\/or a key to decode the location code). The content provider may, for example, decode the location code to obtain information associated with the location of the user device and\/or a quantity of location error. The content provider may use the information associated with the location and\/or the quantity of location error to generate a logical geo fence that surrounds a geographical area within which the user device is located. The content provider may use the geo fence to identify advertising entities (e.g., firms or businesses for which the content provider sells advertising) that are located within the geo fence. The content provider may generate advertising content associated with the entities and may send the content to the user device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","1","110","110","110","120","1","120","120","120","130","130","140","150","160","170"]},"Also, in some implementations, one or more of the devices of environment  may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices of environment . For example, RAN server  and CDS  may be integrated into a single device. Devices, systems, and\/or networks of environment  may interconnect via wired connections, wireless connections, or a combination of wired and wireless connections.","User device  may include any computation or communication device, such as a wireless mobile communication device that is capable of communicating with base stations . For example, user device  may include a radiotelephone, a personal communications system (PCS) terminal (e.g., that may combine a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities), a personal digital assistant (PDA) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet\/intranet access, etc.), a laptop computer, a camera, a personal gaming system, a smart phone, or another type of mobile computation or communication device.","Base station  may include one or more devices that receive, process, and\/or transmit traffic, such as voice, video, text, and\/or other data, destined for and\/or received from user device . As shown in , one or more base stations  may be associated with a RAN that receives traffic from and\/or sends traffic to service provider network .

RAN server  may, for example, monitor traffic being transported via cells associated with base station  to dynamically obtain information associated with the traffic being transported via base station . In one example, RAN server  may monitor one or more interfaces associated with signal bearers (such as, for example, an S1-U interface between base station  and a service gateway server (SGW) associated with service provider network ) via which user device  communicates with service provider network . In another example, RAN server  may monitor one or more interfaces associated with control-plane signaling (such as, for example, an S11 interface between a mobility management entity (MME) server and the SGW and\/or an S10 interface between the MME and another MME during, for example, a handover event). The control-plane signaling may control signal bearers during establishment or execution of a communication session associated with user device .","RAN server  may identify information associated with user device  from packets associated with the traffic. The information, associated with user device , may include a device identifier, a source address (e.g., an Internet protocol (IP) address), a status of user device  (e.g., active, dormant, off-line, etc.), etc. RAN server  may identify a type of traffic associated with user device  (e.g., streaming video, voice, data, etc.), information associated with a cell via which the traffic is being served to user device  (e.g., a cell identifier), information associated with a base station  with which the cell is associated (e.g., a base station identifier), etc. RAN server  may obtain information associated with a traffic load associated with the cell and\/or base station  via which user device  is communicating. The information associated with the traffic load may identify a quantity of bandwidth, data rate, and\/or throughput associated with the cell and\/or base station . RAN server  may transmit the information associated with the traffic to CDS .","CDS  may include one or more devices that gather, process, search, store, and\/or provide information in a manner similar to that described herein. CDS  may perform operations associated with content distribution within environment . For example, CDS  may perform caching operations by obtaining content from content provider  and temporarily storing the content in a memory associated with CDS . CDS  may retrieve particular content, from the memory, in response to a request to receive the particular content from user device . CDS  may, in another example, process the content in order to ensure that the content is sent to user device  in a manner that satisfies a quality of service (QoS) threshold. CDS  may, in yet another example, convert content into a format and\/or protocol based on a type of user device . CDS  may process the content by sending the content, to user device , at a bandwidth, data rate, and\/or packet size that maximizes network throughput without inducing congestion, jitter, and\/or other conditions. CDS  may, in an example implementation, provide a location-based service that enables content to be customized for user devices .","For example, CDS  may receive, from RAN server , information associated with a flow that is being transported to and\/or from user device  via the RAN. CDS  may, for example, identify user device  based on a source address obtained from the information associated with the flow. CDS  may, in another example, identify a cell, within the RAN, that is serving user device  based on the information associated with the flow. CDS  may use the identified cell to generate and\/or encode location information associated with user device . CDS  may use the location information and\/or the encoded location information to provide a location-based service to content provider .","Content provider  may include any type or form of content provider. For example, content provider  may include free television broadcast providers (e.g., local broadcast providers, such as NBC, CBS, ABC, and\/or Fox), for-pay television broadcast providers (e.g., TNT, ESPN, HBO, Cinemax, CNN, etc.), and\/or Internet-based content providers (e.g., Youtube, Vimeo, Netflix, Hulu, Veoh, etc.) that stream content from web sites and\/or permit content to be downloaded (e.g., via progressive download, etc.). Content provider  may produce media streams (e.g., television broadcasts). A \u201cmedia stream,\u201d as used herein, may refer to a stream of content that includes video content (e.g., a video stream), audio content (e.g., an audio stream), and\/or textual content (e.g., a textual stream).","In an example implementation, content provider  may use a key, received from CDS , to decode a location code associated with user device . Content provider  may obtain, as a result of decoding the location code, information associated with a geo fence that corresponds to a geographic area within which user device  is located and\/or is likely to be located. CDS  may use the geo fence to indentify advertising entities, located within the geo fence, for which CDS  generates advertising content for. CDS  may transmit advertising content, associated with the identified advertising entities, to user device .","Service provider network  may include one or more wired and\/or wireless networks via which user devices  communicate and\/or receive content. For example, service provider network  may include a cellular network, the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), a second generation (2G) network, a third generation (3G) network, a fourth generation (4G) network (e.g., a long term evolution (LTE) network), a fifth generation (5G) network, and\/or another network. Additionally, or alternatively, service provider network  may include a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), an ad hoc network, an intranet, a fiber optic-based network (e.g., a fiber optic service (FiOS) network), and\/or a combination of these or other types of networks.","Network  may include one or more wired and\/or wireless networks. For example, network  may include a cellular network, the PLMN, a 2G network, a 3G network, a 4G network (e.g., an LTE network), a 5G network, and\/or another network.

In one example implementation, AR server  may generate location information and\/or encoded location information that may be used to provide a location-based service for CDS  and\/or content provider .","AR server  may receive information associated with a traffic flow being transported, via a cell within the RAN, between service provider network  and user device . AR server  may send a query to CO server  to determine whether user device  has authorized location information to be used to track a geographic location associated with user device . The query may include a source address (e.g., an Internet protocol (IP) address associated with user device ) obtained from the information associated with the traffic flow.","Based on a determination that user device  authorizes the use of the location information, AR server  may retrieve, from a memory associated with AR server , information associated with a geographic location that corresponds to a cell site at which the cell is located. In another example implementation, AR server  may obtain location information associated with user device  from service provider network  using an application programming interface (API) that enables AR server  to receive the location information. In yet another example implementation, AR server  may send a query to user device  to obtain the location information.","AR server  may generate one or more location codes based on the location information associated with user device . AR server  may, for example, encode the location information to create one or more location codes each having a different length (e.g., a different quantity of characters, values, bits, etc.). In one example, AR server  may generate the location codes using a hash function (e.g., Bernstein, Fowler-Noll-Vo, etc.), a cryptographic hash function, and\/or some other mathematical function. Each of the location codes may be generated using a different key. Each of the location codes may be decoded using a respective different key.","The location codes may, when decoded, correspond to a particular location associated with the cell site and\/or user device , and\/or different quantities of location error associated with the particular location. A location code may, for example, correspond to a quantity of location error relative to the particular location based on a length associated with the location code. The quantity of location error may be associated with a geo fence that encompasses a geographic area within which the cell site and\/or user device  are located. Another location code may, for example, correspond to another quantity of location error associated with the particular location. The other location code may correspond to another quantity of location error relative to the particular location based on a different length associated with the other location code. The other quantity of location error may be associated with another geo fence that encompasses another geographic area (e.g., that is greater than or less than the geographical area) within which the cell site and\/or user device  are located. AR server  may transmit the one or more location codes to content provider . Additionally, AR server  may transmit a key that corresponds to one of the location codes that enables content provider  to decode a location code to which the key corresponds. AR server  may select which key to transmit to content provider  based on a service level agreement (SLA) that identifies a level of location error to which content provider  has subscribed and\/or is authorized to access.","CO server  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, store, and\/or provide information in a manner similar to that described herein. In one example implementation, CO server  may perform content optimization operations on content being served to user devices . For example, CO server  may process content, destined for user device , to maximize throughput and\/or avoid congestion while being transported over service provider network  and\/or the RAN associated with service provider network . CO server  may, in another example, process the content to meet a level of QoS specified in a service level agreement (SLA) associated with a particular content provider  from which the content originates. CO server  may, in yet another example, convert the content to a format, based on a type of user device , that enables the content to be received, processed, and\/or rendered on user device  within a period of time that is less than a threshold.","CO server  may perform network access translation (NAT) operations on traffic being sent to and\/or received from user device  via service provider network . For example, CO server  may translate an internal IP address (e.g., associated with service provider network ) and\/or a port range associated with the internal IP address, obtained from traffic that is received from user device , to a corresponding public IP address that can be used by network  and\/or content provider  during a communication session with user device . In another example, CO server  may translate the public IP address, associated with traffic received from network  that is destined for user device , to an internal IP address and\/or port range that can be used by service provider network  to send the traffic to user device . CO server  may store, as information associated with NAT bindings, information associated with the internal IP address, port range, and\/or public IP address in a memory associated with CO server .","CO server  may extract and\/or remove information that permits the identity of user device  to be determined based on traffic and\/or other information that is sent to network  and\/or content provider .

The other quantity of error may correspond to another geo fence that encompasses another geographical area that surrounds the particular location in which the cell site and\/or user device  is located.","In one example, the other code length may be greater than the code length (e.g., where length1>length 0), which may enable the other quantity of error to be less than the quantity of error (e.g., where error1<max error). The other quantity of error may be associated with the other geo fence that encompasses the other geographical area that is less than the geographical area.","AR server  may, in a further example, generate further latitude codes  (e.g., lat2, lat3, etc.) and\/or longitude codes  (e.g., long2, long3, etc.) that correspond to progressively increasing code lengths  (e.g., where length1<length 2<length 3, etc.) (e.g., as shown by ellipse ). The further latitude codes  and\/or longitudes codes may, when decoded, be associated with progressively decreasing quantities of error (e.g., error2, error3, etc.). The further latitude codes  and\/or longitude codes  may, when decoded, represent progressively decreasing quantities of error (e.g., error1>error 2>error3, etc.) (e.g., as shown by ellipse ). The progressively decreasing quantities of error may correspond to progressively smaller geo fences within which the cell site and\/or user device  are located.","In another example implementation, latitude code  and\/or longitude code , when decoded, may represent coordinates other than latitude and\/or longitude, respectively. For example, latitude code  and\/or longitude code  may represent grid coordinates (e.g., X and\/or Y, etc.) on a map associated with a geographic area within which the RAN is located. In another example, latitude code  and\/or longitude code  may represent cylindrical coordinates (e.g., a radius centered at the particular location and\/or an angle relative to some reference direction, such as, for example, due North, etc.) on the map associated with the geographic area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["110","700","210","700","210"]},"As shown in , process  may include receiving information associated with a flow being transported via a RAN associated with a service provider network (block ) and sending a query to identify a user device associated with the flow and\/or to determine whether location information may be used to track a location of the user device (block ). For example, AR server  may receive a notification from RAN server  that includes information associated with a flow being transported via a RAN. The flow may be transported via a cell within the RAN, that serves one or more user devices  that are communicating with service provider network . The information associated with the flow may include all or a portion of information stored in a data structure (e.g., data structure  of ) as a result of RAN server  monitoring traffic being transported via the RAN.","AR server  may, in response to the notification, generate a query to identify which of the one or more user devices  are associated with the flow. Additionally, AR server  may generate the query to determine whether a user, of user device  that is identified as being associated with the flow, authorizes the use of location information, associated with user device , for tracking a location of the identified user device . AR server  may transmit the query to CO server , which includes all or a portion of the information associated with the flow.","CO server  may receive the query and may obtain a source address from the information associated with the flow. CO server  may use the source address to identify user device  with which the flow is associated from NAT bindings stored within a memory associated with CO server . CO server  may obtain, from the NAT bindings, information associated with user device  that corresponds to the source address. CO server  may retrieve, from another server device associated with service provider network  (e.g., a policy resource control function (PRCF) server; a home subscriber server (HSS); an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server; etc.), information associated with a user profile of a user of user device . The information associated with the user profile may identify parental controls specified by the user, preferred content (e.g., content genres, content types, etc.) as specified by the user, whether the user authorizes location information to be disclosed or used to track a location of user device . CO server  may transmit, to AR server , the information associated with user device  and\/or the information associated with the user profile.","As also shown in , if tracking a location of the user device is not authorized (block \u2014NO), then process  may include receiving information associated with another flow being transported via a RAN associated with a service provider network (block ). For example, AR server  may receive the information associated with user device  and\/or the information associated with the user profile. AR server  may determine, from the information associated with the user profile, that the user does not authorize the location information, associated with user device , to be used to track a location of user device . AR server  may not perform an operation to generate and\/or encode the location information for the purpose of providing a location-based service to content provider . AR server  may receive information associated with another flow and may generate another query to identify another user device  and\/or to determine whether another user, of the other user device , authorizes a location of the other user device  to be tracked.","As further shown in , if tracking a location of the user device is authorized (block \u2014YES), then process  may include retrieving information associated with a network topology that corresponds to the RAN (block ). For example, AR server  may receive the information associated with user device  and\/or the information associated with the user profile. AR server  may determine, from the information associated with the user profile, that the user authorizes the location information, associated with user device , to be used to track the location of user device . AR server  may perform the operation to generate and\/or encode the location information based on the determination that the user authorizes the location, of user device , to be tracked using the location information.","AR server  may retrieve, from a memory associated with AR server , information associated with a network topology associated with the RAN. The information associated with the network topology may identify a respective cell site for each cell within the RAN. In one example, the cell sites may correspond to a respective geographic location associated with each of base stations  with which the cells are associated. Each of the geographic locations may be identified by a set of coordinates (e.g., grid coordinates, latitude and\/or longitude coordinates, etc.) within a geographical area associated with the RAN.","As yet further shown in , process  may include identifying a cell that is serving the user device associated with the flow and\/or obtaining a geographic location associated with the cell (block ). For example, AR server  may obtain information associated with a cell (e.g., a cell ID, a base station ID, etc.) via which user device  is communicating with service provider network . AR server  may use the information associated with the network topology to identify a geographic location associated with the cell. Additionally, or alternatively, AR server  may identify a geographic area that corresponds to a cell coverage area within which user device  is located while communicating with service provider network .","In another example implementation, AR server  may use an API to communicate with service provider network  to identify a location associated with user device . In yet another example implementation, AR server  may send a query to user device  to obtain the location of user device  (e.g., based on Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates provided by user device ).","As still further shown in , process  may include encoding location information associated with the user device (block ). For example, AR server  may generate one or more location codes based on location information associated with user device . The location information may include the geographical location associated with the cell site and\/or the geographic area associated with the cell coverage area. AR server  may generate the location codes using a hash function and\/or some other mathematical function.","For example, AR server  may, in a manner similar to that described above (e.g., with respect to ), generate a location code, based on the location information, that when decoded, represents a maximum quantity of error associated with the location information. The maximum quantity of error may correspond to a maximum geographic area in which user device  and\/or the cell coverage area are located. The location code associated with the maximum quantity of error may be generated in a manner that a length of the location code corresponds to a minimum code length (e.g., a minimum quantity of bits to be include in the location code). The location code may be generated (e.g., using the hash function and\/or the other mathematical function) using a particular key.","In another example, AR server  may, in a manner similar to that described above (e.g., with respect to ), generate another location code, based on the location information, that when decoded, represents another quantity of error (e.g., that is less than the maximum quantity of error associated with the location information). The other quantity of error may correspond to a geographic area (e.g., that is less than the maximum geographic area) in which user device , the location associated with the cell site, and\/or the cell coverage area are located. The other location code, associated with the other quantity of error, may be associated with another code length (e.g., that is greater than the minimum code length). The other location code may be generated (e.g., using the hash function and\/or the other mathematical function) using another key that is different than the particular key.","AR server  may generate other location codes based on respective different code lengths and using respective different keys. A code length that is greater than another code length may enable AR server  to generate a location code, that when decoded, represents a quantity of error that is less than another quantity of error that corresponds to the other code length. In one example, the code length may correspond to a geographical area that is less than a coverage area associated with the cell. In another example, the code length may correspond to a maximum code length. The maximum code length may correspond to a minimum geographical area. The minimum geographical area may, for example, correspond to a particular location that corresponds to the cell site or a location associated with user device .","As also shown by , process  may include retrieving information associated with a usage history of the user device (block ). For example, AR server  may retrieve, from a memory associated with AR server , information associated with a usage history of user device . The information associated with the usage history may include information associated with a location history of user device . The information associated with the location history may identify one or more geographic locations where user device  was located over a prior period of time. The information associated with the location history may include a respective time period during which user device  was located at each of the one or more locations. In another example, the information associated with the usage history may include a list of uniform resource locators (URLs) that were accessed by user device  during the prior period of time. In yet another example, the information associated with the usage history may include information associated with other user devices  (e.g., an MDN, etc.) with which user device  has communicated via one or more calls and\/or messages (e.g., via a short message service (SMS) protocol, a multi-media service (MMS) protocol, an instant message (IM) protocol, and email protocol, etc.) in the prior period of time.","As further shown in , process  may include sending, to a content provider, the encoded location information and\/or information associated with the usage history of the user device (block ). For example, AR server  may send, to content provider  and via CO server , the information associated with the usage history of user device  and\/or the encoded location information. Content provider  may receive the information associated with the location history and\/or the encoded location information and may retrieve, from a memory associated with content provider , a key that was received from AR server  and\/or CO server  at a prior point in time. Content provider  may use the key to decode one of the location codes stored in the encoded location information. Content provider  may obtain, from the decoded location code, information associated with a geographic location that corresponds to a cell site and\/or base station . Content provider  may also obtain, from the decoded location information, a quantity of error associated with the geographic location. The cell and\/or base station  may be associated with a cell via which user device  communicates or has communicated with service provider network .","Content provider  may use information associated with the geographic location and\/or the quantity of error to identify a geo fence that encompasses a geographic area associated with the cell. Depending on the quantity of error, the geo fence may encompass a coverage area associated with the cell, may coincide with the coverage area of the cell, and\/or may be encompassed by the coverage area of the cell. Content provider  may retrieve, from the memory, a list of advertising entities (e.g., advertisers, businesses, etc.) that are located within the geo fence. Content provider  may transmit, to CO server , advertising content and\/or other content, associated with one or more the advertising entities. CO server  may receive the advertising content and may transmit the advertising content to user device  via service provider network  and\/or the RAN.","Systems and\/or methods, described herein, may enable information associated with traffic being transported over a radio access network (RAN), to be dynamically obtained by a RAN modeling server on a real-time basis. The systems and\/or methods may enable the information associated with the traffic to be used to identify a cell, within the RAN, via which a user device is communicating with a service provider network associated with the RAN. The systems and\/or methods may use the identified cell to obtain location information associated with the user device. The systems and\/or methods may encode the location information to create one or more location codes (e.g., using one or more keys) that, when decoded, represent different levels of error associated with a particular location of the user device. The different levels of error correspond to different code lengths associated with the location codes. The systems and\/or methods may transmit the one or more location codes to a content provider, which enables the content provider to use a key to decode one of the location codes. The systems and\/or methods may permit the content provider to identify a geographical area, within which the user device is located, based the particular location and\/or a particular quantity of error obtained from the decoded location code. The systems and\/or methods may enable the content provider to transmit advertising content, associated with one or more advertising entities located within the geographical area, to the user device.","The foregoing description provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the implementations to the precise form disclosed.
