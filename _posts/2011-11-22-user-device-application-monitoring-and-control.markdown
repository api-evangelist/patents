{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["User devices perform an increasing variety of tasks that allows users to make and receive calls, send and receive messages (e.g., emails, instant messages, etc.), surf the Internet, play games, make electronic purchases, perform social networking, etc. Many of the tasks are performed using applications that are installed on and executed by the user devices. The applications may communicate with a network to transmit and\/or receive information, such as to update the application, obtain information for use by the application when executing, to provide information about the user device, etc.","Unfortunately, the applications may communicate with the network without the knowledge and\/or authorization of the users. This may cause data usage, associated with the user devices, to become greater than a threshold specified by agreements between the users and service providers associated with the network. Additionally the applications may use network resources, such as bandwidth, processing capacity, etc., when communicating with the network. The quantity of resources used by the applications may cause service providers to expend resources to increase network capacity so that services can be provided to the users at a particular quality of service and\/or to avoid congestion on the network.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","A system and\/or method, described herein, may allow a server device to monitor and\/or control a flow of traffic, associated with an application that is installed on a user device, based on an application policy that is set up by a user of the user device. The server device may control the flow by causing an amount of resources, associated with the flow, to be decreased to a level that is less than a threshold identified by the application policy. The server device may control the flow by terminating the flow when the application policy does not permit the application to communicate with the network. The server device may control the flow by allocating an amount of resources, associated with the flow, to provide a particular quality of service (QoS) based on a service that is subscribed to by the user (e.g., at a particular cost) and an application policy associated with the service. The server device, by enforcing the application policy, may enable the user device to use the application while conforming to an agreement between the user and a service provider associated with the network.","A system and\/or method, described herein, may allow a server device to monitor and\/or control traffic, associated with one or more applications installed on user devices within the network, based on a network policy that is specified by an operator of the server device. The server device may cause the traffic bandwidth, data rate, etc. to be controlled when the network policy indicates that the traffic is to be curtailed. Curtailing the traffic may allow the network to operate without becoming congested and\/or may permit a quality of service (QoS) to be delivered to users that have subscribed to a particular QoS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","1","110","110","110","120","1","120","120","120","130","140","150","160"]},"Also, in some implementations, one or more of the devices and\/or servers of environment  may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices and\/or servers of environment .

Management server  may, for example, determine whether an amount of bandwidth and\/or a data rate associated with the flow is greater than an amount of bandwidth and\/or a data rate identified by the application policy.

For example, monitoring server  may monitor traffic being processed by one or more base stations  to obtain traffic load information associated with each of the one or more base stations . Monitoring server  may, in a manner similar to that described with respect to block  of , analyze packets associated with the traffic to obtain the traffic load information. Additionally, or alternatively, monitoring server  may, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to block , receive traffic information, from base station  and\/or associated with one or more user devices  and may associate all or a portion of the traffic information with the traffic load information.

The notification may, for example, identify the flows that are to be controlled as flows associated with one or more applications identified in the network policy. The notification may also, or alternatively, identify a bandwidth and\/or throughput to which the flows are to be reduced to remedy the congestion. The notification may also, or alternatively, identify a bandwidth and\/or throughput to which the one or more flows are to be reduced to reduce the quantity of delayed, mis-ordered, and\/or dropped packets.

The server device may control the flow by causing an amount of resources, associated with the flow, to be decreased to a level that is less than a threshold identified in the application policy. The server device may control the flow by terminating the flow when the application policy does not permit the application to communicate with the network.
