title: Electronic book connection to world watch live
abstract: An electronic book selection and delivery system distributes text to subscribers. The system includes the ability to use electronic links as well as a system for creating electronic links between specific electronic books and other electronic files. The links may be used or accessed by a menu system or by operation of a cursor and a select button. The other electronic files could be portions of a specific electronic book, such as a Table of Contents. The other electronic files could also exist external to a specific electronic book. For example, definitions provided in an electronic English-language dictionary could be linked to terms contained in an electronic book. The electronic links may be created by the book publisher or may be subscriber-defined. The links may use standard programming language such as hypertext markup language (HTML). The links may be established through use of a relational database.

The invention has particular use with respect to global networks such as the Internet and \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d. The invention also relates to education. Particularly, the invention provides an alternative to in-person classroom instruction.","There is a constant desire to improve education and knowledge at all levels. It is thought that true human progress can only be achieved if people's understanding of each other is improved and if people's understanding of nature and the environment is improved. Traditionally, education and knowledge have been obtained in schools from classroom instruction and from the reading of books.","The disadvantage of current classroom instructional systems is that students must be physically present in the classroom to participate in the educational process. Therefore, students who are geographically displaced from the location of the classroom often cannot attend class instruction as often or as timely as students who are nearby to the classroom.","The disadvantage of textbooks is that they are often not kept current with recent events or technological changes. Textbooks are usually only updated on a yearly or less frequent basis, while important changes may occur monthly or more frequently. Also, to save funds, schools may not purchase new textbooks even though the textbooks have been updated. Therefore, the new knowledge, although available, is not communicated to students.","Recently, audiovisual presentations have begun to be used in the field of education. These systems may provide playback of a recording of a lecturer who provides a presentation on an educational topic. For example, students may learn about math from watching a videotape or television broadcast of a math professor's lecture. Education can also occur on a more informal basis. For example, specialty channels in the United States such as the Discovery Channel\u00ae and The Learning Channel\u00ae (headquartered in Bethesda, Md., U.S.A.) broadcast educational programming that both entertains and educates a diverse viewership.","The disadvantage of these audiovisual systems is that they are not interactive. Students are unable to ask questions, and the lecturer is unable to tailor the presentation of material to the specific needs of the current student audience. Consequently, the needs of the students are not met.","Cable and broadcast television are commonly known media which supply information to large numbers of viewers equipped with receivers known as \u201ctelevision sets.\u201d By receiving a broadcast, cablecast or satellite signal, users are able to view scenes from remote locations and observe newsworthy events which occur far from the user's location. However, conventional television is a one-way media in which users cannot communicate with each other or the broadcaster.","Recently, the advent of the Internet, and the World Wide Web, in conjunction with the proliferation of personal computers, has allowed people to exchange information and ideas on a global and inexpensive basis. Generally speaking, the Internet is a large computer network which connects host computers. Users with a computer, modem and telephone line commonly call via telephone to connect with a host. The host, being in communication with other hosts (connected to other users) is able to transfer information between users. The Internet is used, for example, to transfer, data files, still images, sounds and messages between virtually any two points in the world with telephone access.","The use of the Internet has increased dramatically since 1981, when approximately 300 host computers were linked together. In 1989, the number of linked host computers was fewer than 90,000; but by 1993, over a million host computers were connected. Currently over 10 million host computers are linked (not including the personal computers people use to access these hosts via modems) and as many as 40 million people around the world may have access to the Internet medium. This number is expected to grow to 200 million by the end of 1999.","Users on the Internet are able to transfer text, graphics, and still pictures between remote locations. Other types of information which can be transmitted include files containing prerecorded sequences of images. To view these images, users download a large data file, and after running appropriate software, see a sequence of images on the computer screen. These images typically are not provided in real time, and are not viewable while the user is accessing the Internet.","Therefore, even though the Internet is a two-way communication medium, it is not currently being utilized to provide video information and audiovisual presentations. This is a disadvantage, in that a large number of people have been accustomed to television audiovisual presentations, and prefer an audio-video presentation to a textual or graphical presentation.","The electronic book selection and delivery system is a new way to distribute books to bookstores, public libraries, schools and consumers. The technological breakthroughs of this invention provide a secure electronic system for both delivering selected books and receiving payments. The system has an unusual combination of features that provides the consumer with a daily use household appliance that has a high tech aura while being very practical, portable, and easy to use.","An advantage of the system is that it eliminates the distribution of any physical object such as a paper book or computer memory device from any book or text distribution system. The purchase of a book becomes a PAY-PER-READ\u2122 event avoiding the overhead, \u201cmiddle-men,\u201d printing costs, and time delay associated with the current book distribution system. Published material and text such as the President's speech, a new law, a court decision on abortion, or O.J. Simpson's testimony can be made immediately available to the consumer at a nominal fee. Alternatively, books may be made available free to the end use consumer, subsidized by advertisers who sponsor books or embed advertising within the books.","The system is a novel combination of new technology involving the television, cable, telephone, and computer industries. It utilities high bandwidth data transmissions, strong security measures, sophisticated digital switching, high resolution visual displays, novel controls, and user friendly interface software.","The primary components of the text delivery system are the subsystem for preparing the text for delivery and the subsystem for receiving and selecting text that was delivered. An embodiment of the system includes additional components and optional features that enhance the system. The system may be configured for use by bookstores, public libraries, schools and consumers. In one embodiment, the system for consumer use is made up of four subsystems, namely: (1) an operations center, (2) a distribution system, (3) a home subsystem including reception, selection, viewing, transacting and transmission capabilities, and (4) a billing and collection system. Alternative configurations of the system are defined to allow for a variety of traditional and non-traditional delivery methods.","The operations center performs several primary functions: manipulating text data (including receiving, formatting and storing of text data), security encoding of text, cataloging of books, providing a messaging center capability, and performing uplink functions. In one embodiment, the system delivers the text from the operations center to consumer homes by inserting text data within analog video signals. The insertion of text is generally performed with an encoder at an uplink site that is within or near the operations center. The system can use several lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI), all the lines of the analog video signal, a digital video signal or unused portions of bandwidth to transmit text data. Using the VBI delivery method, the top ten or twenty book titles may be transmitted with video during normal programming utilizing existing cable or broadcast transmission capability without disruption to the subscriber's video reception. Using the entire video signal, thousands of books may be transmitted within just one hour of air time. Nearly any analog or digital video or data distribution system may be used to deliver the text data. The text data may also be transmitted over other low and high speed signal paths including a telephone network (e.g., a public switched telephone network) having a high speed connection such as a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection and the Internet, for example.","The home subsystem performs at least four functions: connecting to the distribution system, selecting text, storing text, and transacting through a communicating mechanism. The components of the home subsystem may be configured in a variety of hardware configurations. Each function may be performed by a separate component, the components may be integrated, or the capability of existing cable set top converter boxes, computers, and televisions may be utilized. A connector, library unit and viewer unit may be used. In one embodiment, the connector portion of the home subsystem receives an analog video signal and strips or extracts the text from the video. The home library stores the text signal, provides a user friendly software interface to the system and processes the transactions at the consumer home. The viewer provides a screen for viewing text or menus and novel user friendly controls. Alternative embodiments are presented that support delivery of text using a variety of communication mechanisms.","The viewing device may be a portable book shaped viewer which stores one or more books for viewing and provides a screen for interacting with the home library unit. A high resolution display is used to both read the books and to interact with the home library software. In one embodiment, an optional phone connector or return-path cable connection initiates the telephone calls and, with the aid of the library, transmits the necessary data to complete the ordering and billing portion of the consumer transaction. Alternative embodiments are presented that support ordering and billing using a variety of communication mechanisms. The user friendly controls include a bookmark, current book and page turn button. The billing and collection system performs transaction management, authorizations, collections and publisher payments automatically.","A system similar to the system for consumer use may be used in bookstores, schools and public libraries.","In one aspect of the invention, video is collected at a remote site. The term \u201cvideo,\u201d as used herein, includes stereophonic or monophonic audio signals which may accompany a video signal. Additionally, \u201cvideo\u201d is used broadly herein to include still images, groups of related still images, animation, graphics, pictures, or other visual data, including textual data. The remote video information may be obtained from a video cassette, CD ROMs, television channels, one or more video cameras, or other well known sources. If video cameras are used, they may be connected to a computer so that they are remotely controllable, or they may be oriented such that a perception of control can be created for users. The video may relate to remote sites of interest, such as a pyramid in Egypt, or the images may relate to an educational lecture being conducted at a remote site.","The collected video may be transferred to a web site, either in compressed or uncompressed form. The video may be physically transported or may be transmitted through a communications medium to the web site.","The web site may contain a storage media that stores some or all of the video. Additionally, the web site may pass camera control commands, if applicable, to the remotely controlled cameras or may simulate the remote control of a camera. One function of the web site is to pass video to a plurality of users, through a communication media such as the Internet, in response to user selections. The video passed to the plurality of users may be live video being fed to the web site, or may be stored video. A number of video servers may be used to output the video to the users through the communications media, such as the Internet. The video may be tailored by the web site for the particular user's hardware, including data communication equipment, or memory size, i.e. the data rate matches the highest speed which the user's equipment can handle.","Users receive and display the video sent from the web site. Many simultaneous video pictures may be received. The quality and frame rate of the video is dependent on the user's communications hardware. Users having electronic book viewers with high-speed modems or cable modems may receive higher quality video. The users are able to send commands and\/or queries to the web site. The commands and queries are forwarded to remote locations to control remote cameras or query remotely located instructors. Alternatively, the commands may cause the web site to change from among many video signals with different camera angles or locations (or to transmit a different portion of a wide angle image), causing the user to have a perception of remote camera control. The user's commands may also cause a different portion of a received wide angle image to be displayed, giving the user a perception of camera control.","In addition to video, the web site provides information, such as graphics and text, which may be related to the video or may be a separate program. This information may be automatically supplied, or provided upon user request. Therefore, the user may be provided with a comprehensive set of information concerning remote sites, remotely located documents, or other information or data, enabling the user to be quickly educated about the remote site of interest.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a ","b":["100","110","110","120","115","115","115","115","115"]},"In , the content provider  and the distribution center  are shown as separate components of the electronic book distribution system . However, the content provider  and the distribution center  may be co-located.","The distribution center  may convert printed matter into an electronic format. Alternately, the distribution center  may receive electronic files from an outside source, such as the content provider . The distribution center  may process and store electronic books.","The distribution center  distributes electronic books. The distribution may be, for example, over distribution path , distribution network , and distribution path  to an electronic book subsystem or terminal , which may include an electronic book viewer (not shown). The terminal may also be a television, a set top terminal, a personal computer, or similar device. An apparatus and method for distributing electronic books is disclosed in greater detail later. The distribution network  may be an electronic book store, an Internet web site, a wired or wireless telecommunications network, an intranet, a radio program delivery system, a television program delivery system, including cable television, satellite television broadcast, and over-the-air broadcast, for example. The electronic book distribution network  could include direct delivery through a mail delivery system of electronic books on a fixed media, such as a CD-ROM, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b ","b":"170"},"In the embodiment shown in , the components of the electronic book selection and delivery system  are an encoder , a video distribution system , a connector , and a text selector . The encoder  places textual data on a video signal to form a composite video signal. Although the composite signal may contain only textual data, it usually carries both video and textual data. A variety of equipment and methods may be used to encode text data onto a video signal. The video distribution system  distributes the composite video signal from the single point of the encoder  to multiple locations, which have connectors . The connector  receives the digital or analog video signal from the video distribution system  and separates, strips or extracts the text data from the composite video signal. If necessary, the extracted text data is converted into a digital bit stream. The text selector  works in connection with the connector  to select text.","Using the connector  and text selector  combination, various methods of selecting and retrieving desired text from a composite or video signal are possible. Text may be preselected, selected as received or selected after being received and stored. One method is for the connector  to strip or extract all the text from the video signal and have the text selector  screen all the text as received from the connector . The text selector  only stores text in long term or permanent memory if the text passes a screening process described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","250","254","208","258","212","262","266","270","274","279","278","258","259","261","200","259","261","266"]},"The operations center  receives textual material from outside sources  such as publishers, newspapers, and on-line services. Alternately, the outside sources may maintain electronic books at the Internet web site . The outside sources  may convert textual and graphical material to digital format, or may contract with another vendor to provide this service. The operations center  may receive the textual and graphical material in various digital formats and may convert the textual material to a standard compressed format for storage. In so doing, the operations center  may create a pool of textual material that is available to be delivered to the home system . The textual material may be grouped by books or titles for easy access.","As used herein, \u201cbook\u201d means textual, graphical or video information. Such information may be contained in any novels, encyclopedias, articles, magazines, newspapers, catalogues, periodicals, or manuals or any portion or section of the above. The information may also be provided as a video clip, for example. The term \u201ctitle\u201d may represent the actual title assigned to a book, a video program, or any other designation indicating a particular group, portion, or category of textual information. The title may refer to a series of related textual, video or graphical information, a grouping of textual, video or graphical information, or a portion of textual, video or graphical information. For example, \u201cLatest Harlequin Romance\u201d, \u201cFour Child Reading Books (Ages 10-12),\u201d \u201cEncyclopedia \u2018BRITANNICA\u2019\u2122,\u201d \u201cPresident's Speech,\u201d \u201cInstruction Manual,\u201d \u201cSchedule of 4th of July Events,\u201d \u201cPet Handbooks,\u201d \u201cRoe v. Wade,\u201d and \u201cThe Joy of Cooking,\u201d are suitable titles. Also, the title may be a graphical symbol or icon. Thus, a picture of a wrench may be a title for a repair book, a picture of a computer a title for a computer book, a graphical symbol of a telephone a title for a telephone book, a drawing of a dagger a title for a mystery book, a picture of a bat and ball a title for a sports book, and a picture of tickertape a title for a business book.","The operations center  includes the uplink site  for placing the text or other information onto a telecommunications signal and sending the telecommunications signal into a distribution system. The uplink site  may include an encoder  (not shown in ) to encode the text onto the telecommunications signal.","Many analog and digital video distribution systems may be used with the electronic book delivery system , such as cable television distribution systems, broadcast television distribution systems, video distributed over telephone systems, direct satellite broadcast distribution systems, and other wire and wireless video distribution systems. Nearly any distribution system which can deliver a telecommunications signal, including a video signal, will work with the electronic book delivery system . It is also possible to distribute the electronic book without using a telecommunications signal as described in the embodiments presented in Section VII below.","The home system  performs five functions: (1) connecting with a video distribution system; (2) selecting data; (3) storing data; (4) displaying data; and (5) handling transactions. An important optional function of the home system  is communicating using, in one embodiment, a telephone communication system . The home system  may be made up of four parts: a video connector  or similar type of connector for connecting with the distribution system , a library  for storing and processing, a viewer  for viewing menus and text and a telephone connector  for connecting with a telephone communications system . Additional embodiments are presented in Section VII that address alternative communication mechanisms.","The billing and collection system  may be co-located with the operations center  or located remote from the operations center . The billing and collection system  may be in communication with the home system  using telephone-type communication systems (for example ). Any of a number of communication systems as presented in Section VII, such as a cellular system or the Internet, will operate with the billing and collection system . The billing and collection system  records the electronic books or video, or portions of text or video that are selected or ordered by the subscriber. The collection system will charge a subscriber's credit account or bill the subscriber. In addition, the billing and collection system  may monitor that amount due to publishers or other outside sources  who have provided textual data or other services such as air time to enable the text delivery system  to operate.","Also shown in  is an intranet \u2032.

The Operations Center",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["250","254","250","302","250","402","402","404","406","404","250","410","410","414"]},"The processing at the operations center  is controlled by a processor , which uses an instruction memory . The processor  and instruction memory  may be supplied by a personal computer or mini-computer, for example. To perform the catalog and messaging functions, the operations center  uses a catalog and message memory  and the text generator  if necessary.","The data stream of text, catalog and messages may be encoded by security module encoding  prior to being sent to the uplink module . Various encoding techniques may be used by the security encoding module  such as the commercial derivative of NSA's encryption algorithm (Data Encryption System (DES)) and General Instrument's DigiCipher II. Following encoding, the encoded text may be stored in text memory  prior to being sent to the uplink . A first-in-first-out text memory arrangement may be used under the control of the processor . Various types of memory may be used for the text memory  including RAM. The operations center  may use file server technology for the text memory  to catalog and spool books for transmission as is described below. The operations center  may also store the electronic book as compressed data files.","In an embodiment, to transmit textual data, the distribution system  (see ) may use high bandwidth transmission techniques such as those defined by the North American Broadcast Teletext Standard (NABTS) and the World System Teletext (WST) standard. Using the WST format (where each line of the Vertical Blanking Interval contains 266 data bits), a four hundred page book, for example, may be transmitted during regular television programming using four lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval at a rate of approximately one book every 1.6 minutes (63,840 bits per second). Alternatively, books may be transmitted over a dedicated channel, which interrupts programming so that 246 lines of video can be used to transmit approximately 2,250 books every hour (3.9 Mbits per second). A teletext type format is the simplest but possibly the slowest text format to use with the electronic book delivery system . In either event, an encoder  may be used at an uplink site  to insert textual data into the analog video signal. In many other respects, the delivery of the textual information may be completed using an existing cable television plant and equipment. Alternative transmit formats and delivery systems are presented in Section VII.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a ","b":["282","250","500","282","250","254","504","254","250","282"]},"In , the electronic books are distributed to consumers using a video distribution system such as a cable television system. However, the electronic books may also be packaged as data packets and distributed over other telecommunications networks such as a digital wireless telephone network, for example.","In one embodiment, as shown in block , files are broken into smaller packets of information. Header information is added to the packets. The bit stream is converted from a serial digital bit stream to an analog bit stream that is compatible with an NTSC video signal. Block  shows the switching of analog data into the video lines of a video signal. The analog data may be placed either in the VBI or the active video lines. In some instances, unused portions of bandwidth (such as 5-40 MHZ, 70-75 MHZ, 100-109 MHZ or other guard bands) may be used instead of the video lines. Alternate transmission methods are presented in Section VII.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b ","b":["508","512","516","520","532","524","524","532","528","524","536","540","544","544","516","548","552"]},"As an alternative to cable, broadcast or other television delivery methods, the public telephone system may be used to transmit books to the subscribers. An average book would take about 7 minutes to transmit over the public telephone system. Using the telephone system, it is not necessary to combine video and text into a composite signal. In most other respects, the operations center would remain similar whether text delivery was by telephone or cable. File server technology (such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875, entitled , issued to Mincer, et al., and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, entitled -, issued to Noveck, et al., incorporated herein by reference) may be used at the operation center with a telephone system text delivery method.","As another alternative to cable, television, and telephone system delivery, the public telephone system may be used to provide access to the Internet, where the Internet web site  may be accessed. Electronic books may be ordered, paid for, and delivered directly from the Internet web site  over the telephone system.","When a wireless telephone network is used to distribute electronic books, or otherwise communicate with the home system , the home system may receive data using any one or more standard protocols including time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), Global Systems for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMPS) protocols.","In any delivery system using the telephone system, individual subscribers may increase the electronic book deliver rate by incorporating high speed modems or other communications devices such as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connector, or by use of a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL).","II. The Home Subsystem","The hardware configuration for a four component home system  is shown in . shows a hardware configuration for a two component home subsystem. The home system  performs several functions, such as receiving data and video transmissions, stripping (or extracting) the data from the video signal, screening and storing the data, providing user friendly interface controls and software, displaying menus and text, processing transactions, initiating telephone calls and transmitting billing data. Various hardware configurations may be utilized to achieve the desired functions of the home system . For example, as shown in , the home system  can be configured to utilize the reception and channel tuning capability of the current installed subscriber base of cable converter boxes and televisions  and networked computers. The home system  can also be designed as an advanced set top terminal converter box with menu generation capability, electronic memory and a telephone modem as described in section V below. Alternatively, the home system  can be configured to support alternate delivery and ordering methods as described in Section VII.","The electronic components, which make up the home system  can be arranged in a variety of ways. In the four unit subsystem of the viewer  and library  are wired together while the remaining components communicate through RF transceivers . In a simple version of the home system  there are only two units, a library  and a viewer . shows a two unit home system  with certain optional features.","The viewer  is generally equipped with a high resolution viewing area , digital logic (including a key , security , and a microprocessor ), video graphics control and memory , power supply circuitry  (not shown), an optional battery  and an optional RF transceiver . In a two unit arrangement, the library  contains the connector function to the electronic book distribution system , connector function to a public telephone communications system, and memory  (which may be removable and portable \u2032). More specifically, the library  would include data stripping functions , digital logic , memory storage , power circuitry , optional connections  (including cellular or PCN \u2032), optional battery (not shown), optional tuner module  and an optional RF transceiver . The connector  and the public telephone system connection , as well as the removable portable memory unit  of the library  may be broken out into separate components. (shows a removable portable hard disk memory \u2032 with removable cartridges .) Finally, the home system  may include an attached keyboard  or a wireless keyboard . Both the attached keyboard  and the wireless keyboard  may be used to communicate with the viewer  (not shown) or the library unit . The wireless keyboard  may communicate using radio frequency (RF) signaling, for example.","In an alternate arrangement, all functions of the home system  may be incorporated into a single unit. The functions of the library , for example, may be carried out by a card or chipset in the viewer .

Personalized book or author suggestions are made to the subscriber by obtaining information from the subscriber indicative of general subscriber interests. Subscriber entries may be solicited from the subscriber using the book suggestion entry submenu . The system uses these subscriber entries either directly or indirectly to search for books or authors to suggest to the subscriber.","Generally, the electronic book suggestion methods may be categorized into two categories, either responsive methods (which respond to a series of subscriber menu entries), or intelligent methods (which analyze data to suggest a book). Using a responsive or intelligent method, the system  determines a list of suggested titles or authors and creates a second or third level submenu ,  to suggest the titles for subscriber selection.","Responsive methods of suggesting titles include, for example, the use of mood questions, searching for authors, and keyword searching. Using the instruction memory  and menu generation hardware (e.g., ) of the viewer , a series of mood questions can be presented on menus to determine a subscribers interest at a particular time. For this methodology, the operations center's  processor  and instruction memory  assign each title mood indicators (and sub-indicators) from a group such as light, serious, violent, short, long, dull, exciting, complex, easy-read, young theme, old theme, adventure, romance, drama, fiction, science-fiction, etc. These indicators are sent to the home system  with the text data and are stored in library memory . Based upon the subscriber entries, the processor associates a set of indicators with the subscriber's request and a set of books with matching indicators are located for suggesting to the subscriber.","Responsive searches for authors or keywords (a search word provided by the subscriber) are generally performed by the library processor  and instruction memory  on data stored in the library memory . For example, a keyword given by the subscriber may be searched for a match in library memory  storing the book reviews, critics and previews databases. Thus, if a subscriber provided an entry of the word \u201csubmarine\u201d on an appropriate submenu, the title \u201cHunt For Red October\u201d may be located by the microprocessor  using instruction from a routine in instruction memory .","Intelligent methods of suggesting programs include analyzing personal profile data on the subscriber and\/or historical data about the subscriber such as past books ordered by the subscriber (or buy data). This method may be performed at the distribution point or operations center  by the on-site processor  using subscriber databases stored in memory . The home system  receives the text data including program suggestion information from the distribution point or operations center  and generates the program suggestion submenus , ,  using the same text data receiving  and viewer menu generation hardware (e.g., , ) described above. Software routines and algorithms stored in instruction memories (e.g. , ) are used to analyze historical data and book ordered data to determine a line of books to suggest to the subscriber.","The algorithms for this powerful feature of suggesting books or authors to subscribers is disclosed in great detail in U.S. Pat.

The bookstores can rent the public viewer  to customers with the text for one or two books loaded onto the public viewer . The public viewer  may be provided with an automatic timeout sequence. The timeout sequence would erase the textual data for the books after a certain period of time, for example, two weeks. It is expected that after a period of time (perhaps within two weeks) the renter would return the public viewer  to the bookstore and receive additional books for viewing. Using this arrangement, it is also possible for the bookstore to (permanently) sell a viewer  to a regular customer. The customer then returns to the bookstore from time to time to receive textual data for a book which the customer can then store permanently on the customer's own viewer . Various other configurations are possible for bookstores, schools and public libraries using the file server  and public viewer  described.","V. Use of a Set Top Converter","Existing set top converter boxes such as those made by Scientific Atlanta or General Instruments are presently unequipped to handle the book selection system of the present invention. Although set top converters may be built which include the library functions, hardware modifications are necessary in order to use the book selection system with existing set top converter technology.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0185","num":"0189"},"figref":["FIGS. 16","FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"i":["a ","b ","a","b"],"b":["16","601","601"]},"A card addition  to a set top converter  is depicted in . The card  shown provides the additional functionality needed to utilize the book selection system with existing set top converter  technology. The card  may be configured to slip inside the frame of a set top terminal and become part of the set top terminal, an advanced set top terminal. The primary functions the card  adds to the set top converter  are the interpreting of data signals, generating of menus, sequencing of menus, and, ultimately, the ability of the subscriber to select a book using either the television or a viewer . The card  also provides a method for a remote location, such as the cable headend, to receive information on books ordered. The books ordered information and control commands may be passed from the cable headend to the card  using telephone lines or alternative ordering methods as presented in Section VII.","The primary components of the card  are a PC chip CPU , a VGA graphic controller , a video combiner , logic circuitry , NTSC encoder , a receiver , demodulator (not shown), and a connector \u2032, which consists of a dialer. The card  operates by receiving the data text signal from the cable headend through the coaxial cable. The logic circuitry  of the card  receives data , infrared commands , and synchronization signals (not shown) from the set top converter . Menu selections made by the viewer  on the remote control are received by the set top converter's  IR equipment and passed through to the card . The card  interprets the IR signal and determines the book (or menu) the subscriber has selected. The card  modifies the IR command to send the information to the set top converter . The modified IR command contains the channel information needed by the set top converter . Using the phone line  and dialer \u2032, the card  is able to transmit electronic books ordered information to the cable headend. It is also possible to receive the electronic books over the telephone lines and other telecommunications networks, including wireless networks, and by-pass the video distribution system.","These commands are passed through the interface linking the set top terminal's microprocessor with the microprocessor of the hardware upgrades. In this way, subscriber inputs, entered through the set top terminal keypad or remote control, can be transferred to any of the hardware upgrades for processing and responses generated therein can then be sent back to the set top terminal for display. In one embodiment the IR commands  are transferred from set top terminal  to hardware upgrade.","Hardware upgrades may include a microprocessor, interactive software, processing circuitry, bubble memory, and a long-term memory device. In addition to these basic components, the hardware upgrade may make use of an additional telephone modem or CD-ROM device.","An information download hardware upgrade  shown in allows the subscriber to download large volumes of information from the operations center  or cable headend using a set top terminal . The hardware upgrade  will enable subscribers to download data, such as electronic books and electronic magazines, to local storage. Primarily, the hardware upgrade  is an additional local storage unit  (e.g., hard disk, floppy, optical disk or magnetic cartridge and may include a microprocessor , instruction memory , and a random access memory , as shown in ). A small portable viewer may also provided with the upgrade  to enable downloaded text to be read without the use of a television.","The downloadable information may be text or graphics supplied by the operations center  or cable headend. With the upgrade , electronic books may be downloaded and read anywhere with the viewer . Using the upgrade , electronic books may be downloaded and stored in compressed form for later decompression. The electronic books may be decompressed only at the time of viewing. Important text that the public desires immediate access may made available through this system. Text such as the President's speech, a new law, or a recent abortion decision rendered by the Supreme Court may be made immediately available.","In one embodiment, electronic book ordering information is stored at each set top terminal  until it is polled by the cable headend using a polling request message format. An example of a polling request message format consists of six fields, namely: (1) a leading flag at the beginning of the message, (2) an address field, (3) a subscriber region designation, (4) a set top terminal identifier that includes a polling command\/response (or P\/F) bit, (5) an information field, and (6) a trailing flag at the end of the message. A similar response frame format for information communicated by the set top terminal to the cable headend in response to the polling request may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0193","num":"0197"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 17"],"b":["610","617","1011","610","1011","617","1011","610"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0194","num":"0198"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["617","613","1013","1015","266","613","1017","1017"]},"Data targeted to individual set top terminals is received by the data receiver \u2032 according to each set top terminal's specific address or ID. In this way, each addressable set top terminal \u2032 only receives its own data. The data receiver \u2032 may receive set top terminal \u2032 specific data in the information field of the signal frame described or on a separate data carrier located at a convenient frequency in the incoming spectrum.","The received data includes information regarding electronic books and menus available for selection. The subscriber may enter a series of commands  using a keypad or remote control in order to choose an electronic book or menu. Upon receipt of such commands, the set top terminal's microprocessor  instructs the tuner to tune to the proper frequency of the channel carrying data and subsequently instructs the processing circuitry  to begin descrambling of this data.","Upon selection of an electronic book, the microprocessor  stores any selection information in local memory (not shown) for later data transmission back to the cable headend. The set top terminal's microprocessor  coordinates all CATV signal reception and also interacts with various upstream data transmission components. Typically, the data transmitter  operates in the return frequency band between 5 and 30 MHZ. In an alternative embodiment, the frequency band of 10 to 15 MHZ may be used. Regardless, however, of the frequency band used, the data transmitter  sends information to the cable headend in the information field of the response frame described. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of variations and combinations of the above-described set top terminal hardware components may be used to accomplish upstream data transmissions.","VI. Books-On-Demand System","The electronic book system  described may also be configured in a book-on-demand style. shows one example of a configuration for a book-on-demand system. A book on demand system requires more powerful two-way communications between the consumer's home, bookstore, school or public library and either the operations center  or a distribution site  such as the cable headend. In one embodiment, this type of two-way communication can be provided by the hardware shown in  and described above. Additional methods related to alternative communication paths are presented in Section VII.","Referring to , in a book-on-demand system, the subscriber selects the book to be download from an available menu of books (see for example and ). The data for menus of available books is usually sent to the subscriber location by the distribution site . After the subscriber's menu selection, information about the subscriber selection (or request) is then communicated to either a distribution point  (such as a cable headend) or the operations center . Upon receipt of this request, the needed textual and graphical information for the book is spooled and sent to the subscriber. In this manner, electronic books are only sent when requested by the subscriber and are sent immediately upon demand for the electronic book (or text).","In order to support such a demand system, the text delivery and distribution must be conducted on a strong nodal architecture distribution system, such as, a video-on-demand cable or telephone television system, through use of individual telephone calls on the public telephone system or cellular phone system, through the use of the Internet, or a number of other data network options.","The book-on-demand system allows for a greater selection of electronic books to the subscriber and limits the amount of communicated book data that is unnecessary or unneeded. It also provides the electronic book to the subscriber in a much timelier fashion.","In addition to a stronger distribution system, a book-on-demand system requires a distribution point  to have more sophisticated equipment to access and \u201cspool out\u201d the textual information. This can be accomplished using file server technology  for storing the books and distribution technology such as ATM  or telephone-type switching (not shown) to distribute the textual information. The file server  and distribution technology that can be used in configuring such a book-on-demand system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, cited above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0203","num":"0207"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"i":["a ","a "],"b":["282","1032","1028","1036","1040","1024","1020","1044"]},"The library  can be connected to either a basic premium-type service cable system , a near video-on-demand type cable system (or pay-per-view (PPV) ) or a video-on-demand cable system . In connecting with either of these three systems the library  may access the cable directly or may access the system through a set top terminal \u2032, \u2033, or \u2032\u2033.","Using the two-way video-on-demand system , a subscriber is able to request a specific book title and receive that text immediately following its request. To accomplish this, the distribution point  transmits a list of available books through the cable delivery system to the library . The library  displays the list of available books on a menu or similar format. As described earlier, the library  may use menus which list categories of available books to form its request from the distribution point . After selecting a book the library  then sends a request signal on the two-way communication system  back to the distribution point . This request signal can be handled in two ways. The library  either initiates the request or the distribution point  polls the various libraries on to the two-way system .

Alternative Delivery and Ordering Methods","Electronic books and related data, including electronic book menu data, may be provided to subscribers by use of an on-demand delivery system in which electronic books are delivered after an order is received by the delivery system. The delivery system may supply the electronic books in real time or near-real time (i.e., near on-demand), or after a delay period that allows the delivery system to process, package and transmit the electronic book. Alternatively, the delivery system may broadcast one or more electronic books in a continuous fashion. In this alternative, the subscriber indicates a desired electronic book from a list of the broadcast electronic books. The delivery system may include a billing system that debits a subscriber's account, or debits a credit card, for example, upon delivery of the electronic book. The delivery system, or a related authorization system, may provide a local authorization code that allows the subscriber to decrypt, store and view the desired electronic book.

The library  and the bookstore  may also provide electronic books to the subscriber .","When electronic books are provided by the Internet web site , the billing and collecting functions may be incorporated into the Internet web site . For example, a subscriber may pay for an electronic book selection by entering a credit card number into a data field of a page of the Internet web site . In this configuration, a separate billing and collection system may not be required. Alternatively, the Internet web site  may communicate information with the billing and collection system .","Electronic book delivery over the Internet may be handled using a number of methods. In a method, the electronic book may be downloaded to the requesting home system  immediately after the order has been processed. Alternatively, the electronic book may be e-mailed to an e-mail address that is entered as part of the ordering process. In another embodiment, as part of the ordering transaction process, the subscriber is provided with location and authorization information that allows the subscriber to retrieve the ordered electronic book at the subscriber's convenience. For delivery of subscription electronic book products, like newspapers, magazines or other periodicals, the Internet web site  can deliver the latest version of the product to the subscriber automatically immediately upon logon by the subscriber to the Internet web site . Electronic book data may also be embedded into continuous multicast streaming video, audio, or data feeds.","Delivery methods that allow for dedicated, full time delivery can be used to provide continuous distribution of electronic book data including requested electronic books from subscribers, electronic books to be broadcast to all subscribers, updated menu contents, and updated advertising. For delivery methods that allow for non-dedicated or user established connectivity, the operations center  may manage the timing and delivery of content by delivering the electronic book only when requested, or periodically, to ensure delivery for those home systems that may not be able to receive the delivery. Finally, delivery methods that are capable of two-way communication may be used to provide a return path to the operations center  or billing and collection system  for the purpose of ordering or requesting updated electronic book information. Two-way communications paths may be used to allow linking from an electronic book home system  or viewer  to external nodes that provide world watch live content. These delivery methods are described in detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

Mobile Environments","A feature provided by delivery methods using a wireless broadcast system, satellite broadcast system, wireless personal communication system, or terrestrial television broadcast system is mobility of the electronic book home system  or viewer . This mobility allows for ordering and receiving electronic book data anytime or anywhere, from sitting on a beach in Florida to sitting on a bus in New York City. This mobility allows for the delivery of electronic book data subscription products such as daily newspapers, monthly magazines, or books from book-of-the-month clubs. These subscription products may be delivered automatically to the appropriate home system  or electronic book viewer . Enhanced end-to-end error correction techniques can be added to the transmission system to ensure higher probability of receipt for these mobile environments. Additionally, transmission methods may be implemented that resend packets of electronic book data, changing their delivered order on each resend, to improve likelihood of receipt. For lower bandwidth mobile environments, an electronic book file may be broken up into packets and the packets sent a limited number of times. If the electronic book file is not received completely, the electronic book viewer  may initiate a request to the operations center  to resend only that portion of the electronic book file yet to be received.","VIII. Electronic Book Link System","Electronic book links allow the subscriber to use the electronic book viewer  to traverse pre-defined paths between content in their currently viewed electronic book to related information contained either elsewhere in the electronic book, elsewhere on the viewer , or external to the viewer , including in the library unit  or in a connected Internet web site. These links provide an organized and methodical method for the subscriber to quickly access related topic areas or seek clarification of the currently viewed material.","An electronic book includes first locations, or components, such as words, phrases, sentences, sections of text, paragraphs, pages, chapters, figures, drawings, maps, video clips, and audio clips. Links to second and subsequent locations, or components, contained in the same electronic document or in another related electronic document, file, or database can be associated with each of these first components. First components with underlying links can be highlighted and displayed on the viewer display  or on the connected television  or a personal computer  (see ). First components that have underlying links associated with them may be identified by assigning them a unique identifier. The unique identifier can be a word or phrase, an alpha-numeric value, a coordinate point, or other unique identifier. In an embodiment, each such first location may be assigned an identifying index value.","The use of the index value allows the first components to maintain links with other components, even if the electronic book is altered. For example, a subscriber may use a cut and paste edit feature to move a block of text containing a first component. Cutting and pasting will not affect the status of the first component and its links to other components. Similarly, changing font style or font size will not affect the status of the links.","In the creation of an electronic book, or subsequently, the electronic book may undergo a process that maps identifying index values to each of the first components. These index values can then be accessed by software directives that drive the presentation of alternative or linked material (e.g., material at one of the second locations) once a selection is made. For each electronic book, these index values may be contained in a hidden table that maps the identifying index values of all first components with underlying links to the location of the linked material (the second location). Moreover, each such first component may be linked to one or many linked material locations. That is, the first component may be linked to a second component, a third component and soon.

For example, digital images may be decompressed, combined with other decompressed images, and then re-compressed; or the images may be decompressed and converted to analog, combined, and then converted to digital and compressed for transmission.","The signals switched by the video matrix switch  are preferably digital. This is because the communicated video streams  are preferably digital. It is preferred to process all the signals in the web server in the digital domain to improve simplicity and maintain maximum flexibility.","The various streams of video output from the video matrix switch  are passed to the firewall access control unit  for output to the router  and the communication equipment .","Using this system, any user may receive any signal present at any input, including stored signals within audio and video database  or data storage unit . Additionally, any compressed digital signal present at the input to digital matrix switch  may be stored in the audio and video storage unit  or data storage unit . This is advantageous in the perceived camera control embodiment () where the web server  must output a different video picture to the user upon user request. When the user request is received by the web server , the administrative unit  directs the matrix switches  and  to output the correct video stream to the user. If the user is requesting stored video, the administrative unit directs the database server  to provide the video to digital matrix switch . If graphics or textual data are required, the administrative unit  directs the database server  to output the text or graphics to digital matrix switch .","Although shown as one functional box, the database server  may be implemented by using several servers and\/or multiport servers. The audio and video storage unit  and data storage unit  may be implemented by using many storage media of different types, such as optical storage devices (i.e. CD-ROM), magnetic disks, magnetic tape, or memory circuits (i.e. RAM\/ROM). The number of units depends on the amount of stored data, the number of users, and the desired output speed. The database server  may be one or multiple units. The audio and video storage unit  stores (preferably compressed) audio and video presentations, including all relevant camera angles. The video servers  may also be implemented as one or more servers and\/or multiport servers.","The data storage unit  is used to store information relating to audiovisual displays. This information relates to the menu structure and screen displays communicated to connected users. The stored information may also relate to specifically to the audio and video which is currently being displayed and heard. For example, in the demolition embodiment of , a user may click on a \u201cmore info\u201d icon, to obtain information on demolition. Such information, which could include statistics on dynamite, for example, would be stored as text or graphics in data storage unit . The \u201cmore info\u201d command would be transmitted to the communications equipment , pass through the router , and the firewall access control  to administrative unit . The administrative unit  then directs the database server  to recall the relevant information, such as statistics on dynamite, from data storage device  and pass the information to digital matrix switch . The recalled information is then passed to the firewall access control unit , the router , and the communication equipment  for transmission to the proper subscriber. The data may be combined with audio and video in the firewall access control unit , or be a separate transmission.","In the perceived camera control embodiment, the communication equipment  forwards the user's command (such as \u201cpan right\u201d) to the router , which detects the command and forwards it to the firewall access control unit , which passes it to the administrative unit . The administrative unit  controls the video being fed to each connected user. The administrative unit  also responds to user commands by instructing either the matrix switch  or the matrix switch  to pass a different audiovisual signal from another source (i.e. camera, for example, the camera to the right of the present camera) to the connected user. If the user is receiving a stored image from database , the administrative unit instructs the database server  to recall the appropriate video signal.","In the actual camera control embodiment (shown in and ), commands from the user (such as \u201cpan right\u201d) are received by the communication equipment  and forwarded to the router . The commands enter the web server  via the firewall access control unit , and are passed to the administrative unit . The commands may be stored in the administrative unit  or passed to the database server . Either way, the commands pass through the camera control unit  which formats the commands as necessary for remote camera control. The formatted commands are passed to the transmission unit . The transmission unit  provides the commands to data communication network  for reception at remote cameras and CPU  ().","In the system with the spherical (or other wide angle) lens (shown in and ), where the remote camera uses a spherical lens , the administrative unit  determines which segment or quadrant of the audiovisual image is to be supplied to the user in response to the user's command. The spherical image may be stored in database  prior to being output to digital matrix switch . The image is split into a number of sections, which when combined form the entire 180\u00b0 sphere. By using suitable image processing software, the distortion is removed or minimized in each segment. The administrative unit , in response to a user command, determines which segment of the sphere should be sent to the user. The administrative unit then directs the database server  to retrieve and output the correct segment to the digital matrix switch . By controlling the digital matrix switch  and video matrix switch , the administrative unit  is able to ensure that the user receives the correct segment of the spherical image.","In one system the entire spherical (or other wide angle) video is communicated to the user, and the distortion removed by software at the user's terminal. This minimizes the complexity of the processing necessary at the web site , and allows the user to store the entire spherical (or other wide angle) video.","The communication equipment  may be designed to automatically determine the maximum data rate at which information can be transmitted to the connected users. The data rate depends on the type of connection the web sites has with the user, and the type of equipment the user is operating. The communications equipment may use the maximum data rate possible as sensed from the user's communications. Alternatively, users may enter their data rates when prompted by a menu screen, as shown in  and described below. The data rates are then stored in communications equipment . The communications equipment  may also compress the video streams prior to transmission using any known compression algorithm. Additionally, the communications equipment may remove video frames, preferably prior to compression, such that the resulting data rate is reduced to be compatible with the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0312","num":"0316"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 32"],"i":["b ","a"],"b":["2225","2235","2225"]},"For example, the input interface  may obtain images or video from a paging system, and the output interface  may be connected to a paging system to broadcast video or images to a selective call receiver.

Surveillance Systems","The remote camera systems discussed above may be used in a surveillance or tracking system. For example, a researcher may place a video camera in the center of a watering hole, preferably connected to a video recorder for storing many hours of activity at the watering hole. Multiple cameras or a wide-angle lens may be used such that virtual camera control (as described previously) may be performed on the video. Such a surveillance system has many advantages.","First, the surveillance system allows for automatic scanning of the surveyed area, without the need for moving any cameras. Additionally, viewing multiple segments of the area under surveillance may be viewed at the same time in a split-screen or multi-screen image. All that needs to be done is the removal of distortion in multiple segments of the video (if using a wide-angle lens). The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,363, issued Oct. 25, 1994 to Kuban et al., incorporated herein by reference, discloses one example usable with the surveillance system.","Second, automatic monitoring and\/or tracking may be performed. Often, researchers and photographers wait through long periods of inactivity before a desired event occurs. For example, a photographer may wait for hours for a lion or other wildlife to approach the photographer's position. The system may be used to automatically monitor a remote region for activity. In this case, a processor may monitor the multiple cameras or the digital wide-angle video for pixel changes indicating the desired event. For example, an approaching lion in an otherwise inactive desert environment will cause a moving pattern to form on a camera's output or in the wide angle image. A processor may detect the pattern and alert a wildlife researcher that an event is occurring.","Further, the processor may automatically and continually display the relevant camera output, or the segment of the wide angle image containing the lion, thereby tracking the lion. Thus, the present invention may employ tracking techniques, known in the prior art, to the obtained digital image.","In the monitoring and tracking embodiment distortion may be removed from the wide angle image prior to performing the processing to determine whether an event is occurring. The type of event being monitored and nature of the object being tracked controls whether monitoring and\/or tracking may be performed on the distorted or undistorted image. One of ordinary skill in the art will choose the system best suited for the particular monitored event or tracked object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0346","num":"0350"},"figref":"FIG. 42","b":["258","266"]},"Referring to , an \u201cinput frame of reference\u201d routine  is executed. This routine is optional, and is used to establish a frame of reference direction, such as north. The frame of reference may deter mine the first segment of a wide-angle image to view, or the first camera to view. Next, a \u201creset segment counter\u201d routine  is executed. This sets the segment or camera to be first displayed.","Each segment or camera is viewed only for a limited time, prior to viewing the next segment or camera. Thus, a \u201creset timer\u201d routine  is executed to reset the interval when segments or cameras are switched.","Next, the \u201cobtain image\u201d routine  is executed. This routine obtains the wide angle image (live or prerecorded), or images from all the cameras (in the multiple camera perceived control embodiment of ). The obtained image from a wide-angle lens may be processed to remove the distortion or not, depending on what is being monitored.","The obtained image is processed to determine active areas (cameras or segments). Active areas are areas where the processor deter mines that activity is taking place, either by changes in the pixels at those locations, by using other known image\/video processing techniques, or by using external sensors. The processing is performed as known in the art and is not described further herein. The processing occurs during the \u201cprocess for activity\u201d routine . This routine uses the frame of reference to determine which segment(s), relative to the normal (i.e., north) is\/are active.","If activity is present, the \u201cdisplay active segments\u201d routine  displays the active segments or cameras on a display. Distortion from the relevant segments is removed in the wide-angle lens embodiment. If more than one segment is active, a split screen display may show each segment simultaneously. The split screen display may make reference to the frame of reference that was previously entered during routine . The \u201creset timer\u201d routine  is then executed so that the last segment under view is returned when activity is no longer present.","If activity is not present, the \u201cdisplay current segment\u201d routine  is executed. This routine displays the current segment or camera until the timer expires, at which point the next segment or camera is displayed. The display may make reference to the frame of reference which was previously entered during routine .","After displaying the current segment or camera, the \u201ctime limit exceeded\u201d routine  is executed. If the time limit has not been exceeded, a branch to the \u201cobtain image\u201d routine  occurs and processing continues until the time limit is exceeded, or until activity occurs. In an \u201cautopan\u201d embodiment (), the time limit value may be increased by pressing the \u201c\u2212\u201d button in conjunction with the \u201cspeed\u201d button (), for a slower autopan, and the time limit may be decreased by pressing the \u201c+\u201d button in conjunction with the \u201cspeed\u201d button () for a faster autopan.","If the time limit is exceeded, the segment (or camera) counter is incremented by the \u201cincrement segment counter\u201d routine . If the counter is greater than the maximum number of cameras or segments, the \u201ccounter>max\u201d routine  branches to the \u201creset segment counter\u201d routine , to restart the automatic panning. If the counter is not greater than allowed, a branch occurs to the \u201creset timer\u201d routine  so that the next segment or camera may be displayed, and processing for activity continues.","Thus, the flow chart of  allows for automatic panning and for automatic tracking. If the \u201cprocess for activity\u201d routine , the \u201cactivity?\u201d test , and the \u201cdisplay active segments\u201d routine  were removed, the \u201cautopan\u201d function described previously and shown with respect to -would be achieved. In this case, \u201cdisplay current segment\u201d routine  would follow \u201cobtain image\u201d routine .","Monitoring and automatic panning may be combined. When combined, all active segments or cameras are automatically panned for a brief timeframe. Thus, if a lion and zebra are both moving towards the camera from opposite direction, each would be displayed for a brief timeframe before switching to a display of the other. This is an alternative to the split screen display previously described.","I. Display of Video Data","In the systems described above, the user may select or be provided data concerning the video currently displayed. For example, superimposed on the video may be the date and time the video was recorded, a name of the image location, remaining time for the video, or data pertaining to the segment (or camera source) of the video which is currently being viewed.","This segment\/camera data may be a compass heading (such as north) or angle from a reference (such as 40 degrees), or coordinate information (such as X\/Y, X\/Y\/Z, R\/\u0398, and X\/R\/\u0398) relating to the location of the center of the segment\/video currently displayed in relation to the wide angle image or other cameras. A graphical representation of the lens (or layout of the cameras) may show which segment of the wide angle image (or camera) is being displayed. In order to display the image segment, a frame of reference may be adopted, especially for a spherical lens. The frame of reference would be either generated by a processor at the web site or user's terminal, or entered by a user or operator.
