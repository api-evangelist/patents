title: System and method for generating and tracking field values of mortgage forms
abstract: A system for generating field values of mortgage forms. The system includes a database, a calculation module, a monitoring module. The database contains jurisdictional tax and fee information used to calculate field values for the mortgage form. The calculation module is configured to calculate field values for the mortgage form and to generate a transaction log for mortgage and related transactions. The monitoring module communicates with the database and identifies when changes in the field values of tax and fee information occur in the transaction log, and report those changes to the affected lender.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to a system and method for generating and tracking field values used in mortgage forms.","2. Description of Related Art","Mortgage information is gathered at various times throughout the mortgage application and closing processes. However, typically mortgage information is gathered and used by different entities at different times during the process. For example, the loan originator may be a different entity from the lending institution. In addition, many lending institutions will utilize the services of a closing agent, such as a title company, to close the transaction between the borrower and the lender. Currently, there is no good way to coordinate the passing of information between these entities. In addition, the information required on the forms often requires complex calculations, combinations of underlying information, and may change over time. For example, in calculating a good faith estimate (GFE), the method of calculating taxes and fees may vary significantly based on jurisdiction. Further, the taxes may change between the time the loan is originated and the time of closing. If this happens, the customer may need to be notified within a certain time period and prior to the actual closing of the loan. If these changes and errors are not identified timely, the lending institution may incur significant additional costs.","In view of the above, it is apparent that there exists a need for an improved system and method for generating and tracking field values of mortgage forms.","In satisfying the above need, as well as overcoming the enumerated drawbacks and other limitations of the related art, the present application provides a system and method for generating and tracking field values of mortgage forms.","The system includes a database, a calculation module, a monitoring module, a reconciliation module and an analysis module. The database contains jurisdictional tax and fee information used to calculate field values for the mortgage form. The calculation module is configured to calculate the field values for the mortgage form. For example, the system may calculate field values for the good faith estimate and later calculate field values for the HUD-1 form. The monitoring module communicates with the database and transaction logs to identify changes in the jurisdictional tax and fee information used to calculate field values for the mortgage form. The reconciliation module compares related mortgage forms for variations between them. Finally, after the transaction has closed, an analysis module analyzes many transactions for trends, compliance audits and adjustment of estimates.","Each module may provide an output to the interface module, which may then be communicated to lending institutions or consumers in electronic, paper, or other form. The calculation module may transmit the field values of mortgage forms calculated based on jurisdictional and tax information. The monitor module may transmit notifications based on changes in jurisdictional and tax information. The reconciliation module may transmit reconciliation reports between mortgage forms. The analysis module may transmit the results of statistical and other bulk analyses.","The system may also include transactional logs (e.g. databases) configured to store field values for each mortgage form based on a transaction identification. The monitoring module can query transactions from the transactional database based on an applicant unique key, a transaction jurisdiction and\/or a date (e.g. the closing date) according to a change in the tax and fee information for the transaction jurisdiction and the output module may send the notification based on the query.","In another aspect of the application, the system may include a reconciliation module configured to identify differences in the field values calculated by the calculation module relative to previously calculated field values for a previously calculated form. In addition, the reconciliation module may be configured to transmit a notification of the difference between the field values calculated by the calculation module and the previously calculated field values from the previously calculated form.","The system may also include an analysis module in communication with a statistical database of transactions. The form comparison module stores differences between the field values of a mortgage form and field values of the related, previously calculated mortgage form in the statistical database for later analysis.","Further objects, features and advantages of this application will become readily apparent to persons skilled in the art after a review of the following description, with reference to the drawings and claims that are appended to and form a part of this specification.","Referring now to , a system embodying the principles of the present application is illustrated therein and designated by reference numeral . The system  includes a calculation module  and a database . The system  is configured to generate and deliver field values, such as the field values of a good faith estimate for loan origination or lending institutions . In a typical scenario, the consumer  wishes to get a loan from the loan originator or lending institution . As such, the consumer  provides consumer information  to the loan originator or lending institution . In order to evaluate the loan application, the loan originator or lending institution  may also retrieve information from other support entities . The other entities  may for example, include title companies, flood insurers, appraisers, or other institutions that will be involved in the closing process. The information from the other entities  is provided to the loan originator or lending institution  as denoted by line .","The loan originator or lending institution  must provide certain mortgage forms to the consumer . For example, a good faith estimate of the loan costs must be provided to the consumer . To facilitate generation of the good faith estimate, the loan originator or lending institution  provides loan information  to the system . The loan information  may include the consumer information , the information for the other entities , property information, as well as additional information generated by the loan originator or lending institution . The system  includes a database  with up to date information for recording taxes and fees charged by each state or local jurisdiction.","The system  requests information periodically from local jurisdictions and states to update the tax and fee information in the database . The request  may be a request that is manually processed (e.g. a survey or request letter) or, alternatively, may be an electronic request for manually or electronically stored information from the local state and local jurisdictions . In turn, the state and local jurisdictions  provide an updated fee and tax information  to the system  and the system  updates the database . The information  may be provided manually from the state and local jurisdictions , for example by fax, which would require manual entry into the database . If the request  is electronically provided to the states and local jurisdictions , the information  could be provided to the system in an electronic format. For example, the information  may be provided over the internet or through a form of mailed electronic media (e.g. CD or DVD) which may be automatically loaded into the database  to update the tax and fee information.","After the tax and fee database  is updated, the system  can then calculate the field values for the good faith estimate using the calculation module . The system  may then store the calculated field values for the mortgage form (e.g. tax and fee values) into a transaction database  based on a transaction ID. Further, the field values of the mortgage form may be provided along with the transaction ID to the loan originator or lending institution  as denoted by line . In addition, the system  may also provide information on where and how to file the taxes and fees upon closing to the loan originator or lending institution  as denoted by line .","The mortgage forms may be printed at the loan originator or lending institution  facility or electronically stored on computers at the facility of the loan originator or lending institution . The loan origination or lending institution  may provide the completed mortgage forms including the good faith estimate to the consumer  as denoted by line .","As discussed above, the system  can request updated tax or fee information  from the state or local jurisdictions . As such, the system  can be configured to monitor changes that would affect the mortgage forms. When changes are identified, the system  can recalculate the field values of mortgage forms, and specifically the good faith estimate, based on the new tax and fee information. The system  can forward the updated good faith estimate to the loan originator  thereby ensuring the consumer  can be notified of changes that may occur between the loan application and the closing.","One method for monitoring tax and fee changes is illustrated in . Monitoring tax and fee changes can be beneficial as jurisdictions may, typically, change their tax or fee calculation methods once or twice a year. Further, additional regulations may soon come into place where the lender must notify the borrower of these changes promptly or be penalized. As such, continually monitoring such changes may have increased importance for loan originators and lending institutions. As denoted by block , the system  will search its database each night for all active transactions which will experience or have already experienced a change that affects the good faith estimate. Active transactions may be defined as consumer applications that have been received within a certain time period, for example the last sixty days. The system  may then send a report, by email or other means, to each lender daily identifying the account transaction number and good faith estimate changes for all active accounts to which the change may apply. The lending institution  may automatically or manually request that field values for a new good faith estimate is calculated to update the transaction information as denoted by line . As such, the lending institution  may notify the consumer  about the changes in the good faith estimate as denoted by line . In one example, the lending institution  may provide the consumer  with the updated good faith estimate by printing and mailing a new good faith estimate form to the consumer . Alternatively, the lending institution may have a software module forming part of the system  that remotely resides at the lending institution  that automatically generates an email with updated good faith estimate to the consumer . Whenever a change to a field value in the database generate a change in the corresponding field value detected by the monitor module for a borrower, a monitor report can be forwarded to the lender, identifying the change in enough detail for the lender to determine based on its own internal policies whether the change is significant enough to require reissuing a corrected good faith estimate, the monitor module maintains a database of the changes that allows the lender to apply automated methods to generate the new good faith estimate. If the lender produces a new good faith estimate, when the field values for the new good faith estimate are generated from the calculation module, the system then recognizes the new transaction as the current transaction record for use in future monitoring.","Another method for monitoring changes in a good faith estimate is illustrated in . As denoted by , the lender  provides the expected closing date to the system  along with all the other required loan information (as described above with regard to the loan information  in ). The system  identifies the lenders of all borrowers who are affected by the jurisdictional change based on their closing date, as denoted by block . In one example, the updated field values are provided when the closing date is less than a predetermined time period from the current date. The system  may then provide updated field values for the good faith estimate based on the closing date and the changed jurisdiction taxes and fees, as denoted by line . As such, the lender  can notify the consumer  of a change in the good faith estimate, as denoted by line .","Now referring to , a more detailed diagram of the system  is provided. The system  may include an interface module configured to communicate with the lending institution  through a network connection . The network connection  may communicate with the lending institution  through an internet connection over the worldwide web, as denoted by reference numeral . In addition, the interface module  may communicate over the network connection  to retrieve updated tax and fee information from state and local jurisdictions  as denoted in the monitoring processes provided above. The interface module  may also be in communication with a user interface  to allow manual input of updated tax and fee information for state and local jurisdictions. The user interface  may be a graphical user interface including a monitor for displaying tax and fee information, as well as other transaction information. The user interface  may also include an input device, such as a keyboard or mouse, to modify such information in the databases. The interface module  is in communication with the calculation module to receive the loan information from the lending institution or loan originator . The calculation module  may retrieve the tax and fee information from the database  based on the jurisdiction provided in the loan information. Based on the loan information provided by the lending institution  and the tax and fee information retrieved from the database , the calculation module may calculate the field values for the mortgage form (e.g. the good faith estimate). In another example, the calculation module  may calculate field values for the good faith estimate and later calculate field values for the HUD-1 form. The calculation module  may save the field values along with a transaction identification key into the transaction database  for later retrieval or manipulation. The calculation module  may also provide the field values for the mortgage forms to the interface module  as an output of the calculation module . The calculation module output may include the field values formatted for transmission to the lending institution . For example, the calculation module  may provide field values for the good faith estimate in an XML format, a delimited data format, a PDF format (such as a filled form), or any other data interface format. Accordingly, the calculation module  is in communication with the interface module  for transmitting field values of the mortgage forms (e.g. the good faith estimate) over the network connection  to the lending institution or loan originator .","In addition, the monitoring module  may be in communication with the interface module  to receive updated tax and fee information from the state or local governments over the network connection . The monitoring module  communicates with the database  and transaction logs  to identify changes in the jurisdictional tax and fee information used to calculate field values for the mortgage form. For example, as described above, the updated tax and fee information may be provided automatically in electronic format from the state and local jurisdictions  over the internet . As such, the interface module  could receive the updated tax and fee information through the network connection  and provide the updated tax and fee information to the monitor module . In addition, the updated tax and fee information may be manually provided over the user interface  to the interface module . As such, the interface module  would provide the updated tax and fee information to the monitor module .","In another example, an update module  may update the tax and fee information in the tax and fee database  based on information received from the interface module , as described above. The monitor module  may query the tax and fee information in the tax and fee database  to indentify changes. As such, the calculation module  may receive a request from the monitor module  to recalculate the field values based on the transaction information from the transaction database  and the updated tax and fee information from the tax and fee database . The request from the monitor module  may be based on a query of the transaction database  for transactions that match jurisdictions with updated tax and fee information. Alternatively, the monitor module  may issue the request based on the transaction closing date or a combination of such information.","The monitor module  may be provided to compare the field values calculated by the calculation module  to previous field values calculated with the previous tax and fee information. As such, the monitor module  may retrieve the previous field values from the transaction database  for comparison with the updated field values provided by the calculation module  (based on the updated tax and fee information). If the monitor module  identifies a difference in the field values calculated with the new tax and fee information relative to the previous field values, the output module  may transmit updated field values (e.g. updated transfer taxes and recording fees for an updated good faith estimate) to the interface module  for transmission to the loan originator or lender  through the network connection . In one example, a monitor module output may include a report comparing changes in government laws and local usage to the content of previously recorded transactions for the same recording jurisdiction.","The modules described relative to  may be implemented all on one server as denoted by dotted line . Alternatively, the modules may be implemented on multiple servers that are connected through a local area network connection. For example, each module and database could be implemented on a separate server where each module and database communicates through an Ethernet connection over a distributed software interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","7","112","512","512","112","514","512","110","110","512","512","110","512","110","516","518","512","112","520"]},"In , the loan originator or lending institution  may have a customized software solution  for printing the mortgage forms or obtaining information from other entities such as title insurance, flood insurance, appraisal fees, etc. As such, the customized software , at the facility of the loan origination or lending institution, may provide the loan information to the system  at a remote site in XML format or through another predefined application programming interface (API) as denoted by line . Again, as described above, the system  generates the field values for the mortgage forms. The field values are transmitted along with a transaction identification number directly to the customized software  as denoted by line . As such, the field values and transaction identification number may be provided in an XML format or other predefined format, for example, through an application programming interface.","Now referring to , in one implementation, the system  may be particularly implemented on a server  located at the site of the loan originator or lending institution . In this implementation, the customized software  may be implemented on the same server as a portion of the system . In this scenario, the customized software  may interface with the system  through an application programming interface that may be provided through for example, a dynamic link library (DLL) service. In this implementation, at least the calculation module ( from ) and the databases ( and  from ) may be implemented on the server . In one example, the monitor module  may be implemented on a separate server  at a remote site. As such, the speed of calculating the field values for the mortgage forms is increased and not dependent on the internet connection .","The monitor module  receives updated tax and fee information either electronically from state and local jurisdictions in an automated fashion or manually through a user interface. In this scenario, the server  may include an updated tax and fee database  and update the tax and fee database  stored on the server  on a periodic basis. For example, the monitor module  may transfer information from the updated tax and fee database  to the tax and fee database  on the server  when the server  is less likely to be in use.","Further, the system denoted as  in  may have the capability to compare field values from one form to field values in another form. For example, a loan originator  may communicate with the system  to provide loan information to the system  and receive a good faith estimate from the system . As such, the loan originator would provide the good faith estimate to the consumer . Further, the good faith estimate and additional loan documentation may be provided from the originator  to the lending institution .","Based on additional information provided from the consumer , the lending institution  may request an additional good faith estimate from the system  or, alternatively, the system  may provide the lending institution  an updated good faith estimate based on a change in the tax or fee information for the jurisdiction of the loan. As such, the lending institution  would provide the updated good faith estimate to the consumer . The loan documentation from the lending institution as well as the good faith estimate would be provided to the closing agent  for closing of the loan.","The closing agent may be the lending institution, an attorney, a title company, or other entity, but is generically represented as the closing agent  for purposes of illustration. The closing agent  will have to compile the closing forms (e.g. the HUD1\/1A forms) to be signed by the consumer and, for certain documents, to be recorded with the local recording jurisdiction. As such, the closing agent  may provide the loan information to the system  to generate the field values for closing forms. The system  may use the calculation module to access the tax and fee information and calculate the field values for the closing forms. The closing agent  then coordinates with the original mortgage holder  to pay the remaining balance of the mortgage, the title company  to procure title insurance, the seller of the property  if any remittance is due the seller of the property, and the jurisdictional entities  to pay the appropriate fees and taxes for the transaction.","One implementation of the system  is provided with more detail in . Relative to the calculation of the field data for each form, the system operates in a manner consistent with the description above, and like referenced numbers are used for corresponding modules. For example, the good faith estimate form may be calculated in a manner consistent with the description above in . Separately, the calculation of the closing forms (e.g. HUD1\/1A) may be calculated in a manner consistent with the processes described above. In addition, the system  may also include a field value reconciliation module . The reconciliation module  compares related field values in different mortgage forms for variations between them.","After calculation of the field values for the closing forms, the reconciliation module  may compare field values for the good faith estimate forms to corresponding field values in the closing forms. As such, the reconciliation module  may access the transaction database  to retrieve the field values for the good faith estimate and closing forms. In addition, the reconciliation module  may store differences between the field values for the good faith estimate form and corresponding field values for the closing forms and store the identified differences in a statistical database  for later bulk analysis. More specifically, at the time the proposed HUD1\/1A is submitted to the lender for approval to disburse funds, the actual taxes and fees are computed and the lender is informed of any loss resulting from the differences between actual and estimated taxes and recording fees. The difference and the reason for the difference may be stored in the statistical database  according to the transaction identification","The reconciliation module  may calculate both the amount of under-estimation of the \u201cestimated\u201d transfer taxes, and the amount of under-estimation of the total of a class of costs that includes recording fees. Accordingly, the reconciliation module  closes the life loop of a successful transaction by comparing the HUD1\/1A information provided by the closing agent to the latest GFE sent to the borrower. The reconciliation module  may generate a reconciliation report of field values between the lender's latest GFE transaction record content and the closing agent's estimated or actual information about that same transaction. For the purposes of (1) obtaining lender approval to fund, and (2) to enter field values into the HUD1\/1A. Further, the reconciliation module  may generate reconciliation reports to both lenders and closing agents. The reconciliation module  may provide the reports to the interface module  for transmission to the Loan Originator , Lending Institution , or Closing Agent , for example over the network connection .","The GFE form, breaks out the total of recording fees (field 7) and the total of transaction taxes (field 8) into separate field values, as shown in Table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["7","Government recording charges"]},{"entry":[{},"These charges are for state and local fees to record your loan and"]},{"entry":[{},"title documents."]},{"entry":["8.","Transfer taxes These charges are for state and local fees on mortgages"]},{"entry":[{},"and home sales."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"These field values have corresponding field values on the HUD1\/1A forms, detailing recording fees and transaction taxes.

Therefore if the estimated taxes totaled $1,600, but the actual taxes to be paid are now $2,000, the $2,000 figure is entered below on line , and the lender would post a $400 loss to balance its books with the HUD1\/1A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Comparison of Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and",{},{}]},{"entry":["HUD-1 Charges","Good",{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"HUD-1","Faith",{}]},{"entry":["Charges That Cannot Increase","Line Number","Estimate","HUD-1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Our origination charge","#801",{}]},{"entry":["Your credit or charge (points) for the","#802",{}]},{"entry":["specific interest rate chosen",{},{}]},{"entry":["Your adjusted origination charges","#803",{}]},{"entry":["Transfer taxes","#1203"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The analysis module  analyzes many transactions for trends, compliance audits and adjustment of estimates. The analysis module  may perform statistical analysis of stored historical records of transaction estimated and actual field values. Based on the stored historical records, the analysis module  may generate reports to assist lenders in better handling the requirements pertaining to field values in good faith estimates (mortgage forms), including loss analysis due to breaking tolerances.","Further, the analysis module  may compare penalty payments over a period of time (i.e., monthly) to determine trends in the types of differences. As such, internal changes may be tracked that may also result in sending revised GFEs, including, for example, a change in the consideration of a property purchase price or a change in the amount of the mortgage loan. The analysis module  may provide the reports to the interface module  for transmission to the Loan Originator , Lending Institution , or Closing Agent , for example over the network connection .","As described above, the analysis module  or monitoring module  may generate reports identifying errors for each account or a group of accounts for a particular lender. One example of a report is provided in . Upon request, the system may provide a single account report  for each account reportable. The single account report  may include many items, for example, a date that a change in the tax or fee is posted , a transaction identification number , an applicant number , a date of the last inquiry for the local jurisdiction , the local jurisdiction , an explanation of the change , an estimate closing date of the loan , the amount of consideration , the previously calculated field value for the GFE transfer tax , the updated field value for the GFE transfer tax , the change in transfer tax , account specific notes , and an action recommendation for the user  (such as sending a revised GFE). The report may be generated on a web page, emailed to the user (e.g. the originator or lender), mailed to the user, or communicated in some other means to the user or consumer.","Alternatively, when there are many changes to outstanding applicants, the results may be provided in a group report , as illustrated in . The group account report  may include many items, for example, an explanation  of the change in the tax or fee, the item on the mortgage form that is affected by the change , a date that a change in the tax or fee is posted , an action recommendation for the user  (such as sending a revised GFE), an applicant number , a date of the last good faith estimate , the previously calculated field value for the GFE transfer tax , the updated field value for the GFE transfer tax , the amount change in transfer tax , and the percentage change in transfer tax . Although it is understood that each of the items provided in the single account report may also be provided in the table format of the group report . The report may be generated on a web page, emailed to the user (e.g. the originator or lender), mailed to the user, or communicated in some other means to the user. The report may also be provided in an Excel or equivalent database to make it possible for the system to prepare automated GFEs if the change is deemed material.","Referring again to , the analysis module  may analyze the differences stored in the form comparison database  to identify commonly occurring errors in form preparation and\/or information capture. Further, the analysis module  may identify trends relative to particular lenders or jurisdictions in minimizing differences between the good faith estimate provided to the consumer and the HUD1\/1A forms used at closing. In addition, the differences from the statistical database  and statistics generated from the differences may be transmitted from the lender or loan originator  on a periodic basis through the network connection , for example over the internet . In addition, the statistical information may be presented to the user interface  for display to the user or printing in report format.","Any of the modules, controllers, servers, or engines described may be implemented in one or more computer systems. One exemplary system is provided in . The computer system  includes a processor  for executing instructions such as those described in the methods discussed above. The instructions may be stored in a computer readable medium such as memory  or a storage device , for example a disk drive, CD, or DVD. The computer may include a display controller  responsive to instructions to generate a textual or graphical display on a display device , for example a computer monitor. In addition, the processor  may communicate with a network controller  to communicate data or instructions to other systems, for example other general computer systems.
