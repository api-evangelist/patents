{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to detection and monitoring systems and, more particularly, to a real-time method and system for detecting leaks and inventory loss and for managing information corresponding thereto. The present invention may be employed with respect to, for example, gas and liquid pipeline network systems, storage tanks of process systems, blood vessels and stroke management.","2. Background of the Invention","Most conventional pipeline leak detection systems have failed in terms of response time, sensitivity, robustness and cost. Pipeline leaks can be detected by observation of the external effects of the spill, or by monitoring and analysis of the internal hydraulics of the pipeline. One of the objectives of a pipeline leak detection system is to alert operators so that the size of the spill can be limited, which argues for speedy detection as well as reliability and sensitivity.","In choosing the optimum model, a leak detection system that provides continuous monitoring of pressures, temperatures, and flow at points along the pipeline, supported by automated analysis of the data is most ideal. A conventional leak detection system is based on several models. One of the oldest techniques, over short analysis is based on the application of the principle of conservation of mass using flow meters to establish whether the flow in the pipeline is balanced by the flow out. The existence of flow transients makes this method for leak detection a slow response technique, since it is necessary to either average flow over a long time period to filter out the effect of line pack changes due to transients. For long transmission pipelines, the response time is usually very long. Such long response time is unsatisfactory, and has the additional problem of significant data loss during the averaging time. This model cannot detect leak location, but can be used to establish commodity release and the volume spilled. Another model for leak detection is the Pressure Point Analysis. The basic idea of this model is that a leak initiation event produces a pressure drop that propagates in both directions from the leak site. Pressure changes can be detected with great sensitivity, and so it should be possible to detect the onset of small leaks. Pressure surges or operational changes can mask leaks if they are positive or cause false alarms if they are negative. It is applicable to pipelines operating under steady flow.","The dynamic model based real time leak detection system compares measurements collected by the Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition (SCADA) System, with a simulated model of the flow in the pipeline in lock step with actual operations. The results of simulation can be used to provide accurate line pack changes that, in combination with measured flow, give fast volume response. They can be used to support deviation analysis such as pressure drop or flow deviations, by correcting for changes not caused by leaks. This dynamic system model can be used to establish a leak location through a set of statistical and probability mathematical models. The major draw back to this model is the cost of installing the software and instrumentation. Another draw back is the incidence of false alarms due to fluctuating threshold setting, model complexity and poor instrumentation. Automatic threshold adjustment to optimize the sensitivity\/false alarm\/response time trade off and various means of coping with data problems would reduce the incidence of false alarms, but significantly increase the cost. Other leak detection system models are wave alert, acoustic and statistical pipeline leak detection models.","Most conventional systems are computer assisted to conform to Application Programming Interface (API) documentation on leak detection, which mandate all operators of U.S. hazardous Liquid pipelines to engage in pipeline leak detection known as Computational Pipeline Monitoring (CPM). For example, CPM must use, by reference the document API 11.30, the newest technology for pipeline monitoring for leaks. API 11.30 defines CPM as \u201can algorithmic monitoring tool\u201d as it allows the pipeline controller to respond to a pipeline-operating anomaly that may indicate product release. As a system therefore, CPM is computer based.","As can be appreciated, because of inherent shortcomings of previous leak detection system models, a need exists for better models, methods, and systems for leak detection that have a fast response time and produce no false alarms, and that are obtained at optimal cost preferably in range of conventional leak detection systems. Also, the model should be capable of being employed with any kind of fluid system, locating leaks precisely, detecting small leaks, and predicting and assessing inventory loss precisely in any pipeline network system.","Current thresholds of false alarms reported by operators of most commonly used conventional leak detection systems create serious concerns for the need of more robust and optimal leak detection systems. Moreover, the slow level of response time and false alarm thresholds have led to serious revenue loss translating in millions of dollars in some cases, resulting from commodity, operational and asset lost, couple with penalties for spillage to the environment and lost man hours. There is a need for a more robust leak detection system that is error proof and has a fast response feedback time, which is enabled by a web based interactive platform for expert leak detection that reduces the feed back time between detection and control.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,548,530 (hereinafter the \u201c'530 patent\u201d), entitled \u201cHigh-Precision Leak Detector and Locator\u201d, issued on Aug. 20, 1996, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, describes a method and apparatus for leak detection which involves creating site stations at the beginning and the end of a pipeline, and dividing each pipeline segment into a plurality of hypothetical pipeline sections, each section having the same nominal volume, measuring the liquid flow into the first section and determining a volume of liquid that has passed the first section and determining a volume of liquid that has passed the first site station for a defined period, measuring the temperature of the liquid entering the first section of the first site station, measuring the liquid flow out of the last pipeline section of the segment and determining a volume of liquid that has passed the second site station for a defined period, measuring the temperature of the liquid leaving the last section at the second site stations, measuring the ambient temperature of the pipeline at the first station or that representative of the topography of the segment, measuring the ambient temperature of the pipeline at the second site station or that representative of the topography of the segment. The invention of the '530 patent computes changes in one segment relative to the penultimate, correcting the difference in measured volume of all sections during the defined period, comparing the corrected difference in measured volume between the first and second site stations and generating an alarm signal if the difference exceeds the threshold level.","U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2002\/0124633 (hereinafter the \u201c'633 application\u201d), entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Pattern Match Filtering for Real Time Acoustic Pipeline Leak Detection and Location\u201d, filed on Sep. 12, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, describes a pattern match filter that includes using previously recorded leak profiles that benchmark pressure waveforms suggesting leaks against previous data. At site processes located at multiple points along a pipeline, a series of previously recorded signature leak profiles are continuously compared in real-time against pipeline pressure signals. The '633 application acknowledges that multiple transients on the pipeline from normal operating procedures can produce pressure disturbances (similar to an expansion wave generated by leak event), which are located on the monitored segment of pipeline and thus cause false leak alarms. The '633 application further acknowledge that previous techniques such as moving average, repetitive filter, dynamic threshold and band pass filters have only been successful in removing a certain type of noise, but has little effect on other types of transient noise such as pumps, compressors and valve operation, which produce signals with amplitudes similar to the amplitudes of signals produced by leaks, which has led to a high false alarm rate and reduced sensitivity. The '633 application further states that knowing the exact time of arrival of the expansion pressure wave at each monitor is critical for precisely locating the leak on the pipeline. Precise measurement by each monitor of arrival times is critical. However, the low frequency content of the expansion pressure wave produces a wavelength from a few hundred meters to 100,000 meters or more. Due to the length of the wave front and other factors, an uncertainty in the time tag between monitors occur, which in the past has limited leak location accuracy to typically +\/\u2212500 or more meters out of 10,000 meters. This has led to the inability to accurately locate leaks. Furthermore, this system uses a real-time acoustic pipeline leak detection technique that requires placing permanent monitors on a pipeline for detecting expansion pressure waves associated with a sudden breakdown in pressure boundary due to a rupture in a pipe wall. The '633 application discloses that in the past it was the amplitude of the signal that was of concern. The source of the pressure waves was located between the monitors by recording the times when the expansion pressure waves arrived at the monitors. Using these times (tand t) and knowing the fluid sound velocity (V) and the length of the pipe between the monitors (D) the leak event could be located. Denoting the leak event location (distance from sensors number I) as \u201cX\u201d, the leak event location is computed as follows:\n\n2(t)\/2\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In U.S. Published Patent Application 2002\/0134140, entitled \u201cLeak Locator For Pipe Systems\u201d, filed on Sep. 26, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, describes a system and method for determining a time of occurrence of a pressure wave in a pipe that provides a first sonic transducer and a second sonic transducer at each of a plurality of site locations along a pipe, with sonic waves being generated through a pipe wall at a particular rate. At each of the plurality of site locations, the sonic waves travel from the first sonic transducer to the second sonic transducer through a liquid flow in the pipe, with a measure of travel time set for the sonic waves. The measure is compared to each of the successive travel times for the sonic waves as the sonic waves arrive at respective second transducers. A string of counts is output at each second transducer. Each count includes a first count value if a present sonic wave has a travel time that is late as compared to the measure. A time of occurrence of the pressure wave is determined based on a reference clock when the string of counts includes a string of first count values longer than a threshold value. The time of occurrence of a pressure transient is indicated by a first count in the string of first count values.","As can be appreciated, a need exists for a dynamic facile, voice and virtual automated system for the representation, sorting and management of information about leaks and inventory loss in pipeline network systems through assessable web based stations.","Accordingly, it would be desirable and highly advantageous to have a real-time, computer-assisted, leak detection\/location reporting and inventory loss monitoring system that overcomes the above-identified problems of the prior art.","The problems stated above, as well as other related problems of the prior art, are solved by the present invention, which is directed towards a software based leak detection system for pipeline leak detection and commodity release assessment, monitoring and control. The present invention may be implemented by a computer assisted feedback system that achieves a fast response time, has no false alarm thresholds and has robust attributes, and which can analyze any kind of pipeline network configuration and fluid system.","The present invention is an online, web-based leak detection and inventory loss information management system that allows users the flexibility to assess information and interact with the pipeline network system to track leaks or inventory loss in any pipeline system, enhanced by use of security features like enhanced web-based encryption capability with a backup failed server platform.","The present invention can detect, assess and track leaks and inventory loss in pipeline network systems and can trigger an alarm to operators or users through a fax\\modem, a web modem or voice modem in any part of the world accurately with a response time of less than a minute.","A computer host server is coupled online for intercommunication to a plurality of stations or clients from which respective authorized users each have a browser-based interface with the computer host server.","Leak detection in accordance with the present invention completely eliminates false alarms associated with instrument error or error generated by complexity of model describing the flow behavior.","The present invention at least differs from conventional leak detection systems in that the present invention does not rely on models describing flow behavior or instrument accuracy, as it only measures the density, temperature, flow and pressure at sensor instruments, and uses data collected in real-time from the sensors to construct a Jacobean matrix of flow parameters, from where the Eigenvalues can be generated. The leak detection system according to the present invention locates leaks through a feedback mechanism that allows the time lag and the particular sonic velocity to be measured, from which a location log chart profile can be constructed.","The present invention provides a leak detection apparatus that is web-based, interactive and proactive, which allows operators and users to set up an information monitoring system that is proactive in leak detection and inventory loss assessment, with the capability to locate leaks in the pipeline system to avert the consequences of pipeline failure and environmental degradation.","The present invention embodies a database apparatus for collecting and recording data on a pipeline system, flow behavior, leak and inventory loss status and transposing these data into a plurality of information scenarios which can be provided, for example, by fax, e-mail or a voice modem mode at the user's discretion.","The database apparatus forms part of an active subsystem of the integrated leak detection and inventory loss apparatus of the present invention. The database apparatus also includes source codes that manage entry, storage and retrieval of data associated with leaks and inventory loss. Furthermore, the apparatus includes a database information section, a file management section, and a report generating section.","One of the many advantages of the present invention is that characteristic eigenvalues generated from a matrix of deviation provide users with a fast response time, zero false alarm thresholds and greater flexibility in managing the information flow and wider accessibility through a web-based internet apparatus, interfaced with the pipeline system, to announce and locate leaks and inventory loss status.","Another of the many advantages of the present invention is that all information can be managed in one central database assessable by a plurality of user database stations.","According to an aspect of present invention, there is provided a method for detecting and locating leaks in a pipeline network in real-time. A flow model is provided that characterizes flow behavior for at least one of steady and unsteady states respectively corresponding to an absence and a presence of model leaks in the pipeline network, the flow model including a leaking factor kL. A deterministic model is provided to evaluate at least one of a leak status and a no leak status relating to the pipeline network using deterministic criteria. The deterministic criteria is based on a Liapunov Stability Theory. A deviation matrix is constructed based on the flow model and the deterministic model to generate eigenvalues. A leak alarm is generated when at least one of the eigenvalues is less than a predetermined value.","These and other aspects, features the advantages of the present invention which will become apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention is directed to a Real-Time Computer Assisted Leak Detection\/Location Reporting and Inventory Loss Monitoring System. It is to be appreciated that the present invention may be employed for any type of pipeline system, including single pipeline systems and complex pipeline systems. The pipeline system may be used to transports, e.g., liquids and\/or gases. The liquids may include, but are limited to, petroleum-based liquids, water, blood, and so forth.","It is to be understood that the present invention may be implemented in various forms of hardware, software, firmware, special purpose processors, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the present invention is implemented as a combination of hardware and software. Moreover, the software is preferably implemented as an application program tangibly embodied on a program storage device.

Given the teachings herein, one of ordinary skill in the related art will be able to contemplate these and similar implementations or configurations of the present invention.","Advantageously, the present invention provides a leak detection\/location reporting and inventory loss monitoring system and method for detecting, locating and reporting leaks in a pipeline network system on a real-time basis. The leak detection system and method are based on a new model for detecting and tracking leaks in pipeline flow system. The model uses the theory of Liapunov stability criteria to establish a basis for establishing a leak or no leak in the pipeline. A mathematical model, which incorporates a leaking factor k, is used to describe the behavior of the flow system if there are leaks in the pipelines. A Bayesian probability model is used to establish the certainty of leaks in the pipeline, while a deterministic model is used to track the location of leaks in the pipeline segment of interest. An advanced mesh model based on nodal analysis and Kirchoff's Laws is applied to complex pipeline network systems to analyze flow behavior with leaks. Using a modified hardy cross method with the model for leak detection, a simulation computer program was developed for detecting leaks in complex network system. The Leak detection architecture incorporates a model that interface with controllers, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) and sensor devices to provide a system for detecting and locating leaks in single or complex gas and liquid pipeline system.","It is to be appreciated that the phrases \u201cJacobean matrix\u201d, \u201cstability matrix\u201d, and \u201cdeviation matrix\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to a matrix used to generate eigenvalues. While all equivalent in their overall function (e.g., to generate eigenvalues), the stability matrix is referred to herein when the pipeline network to which the present invention is applied is in a steady state, while the deviation matrix is referred to herein when that pipeline is in an unsteady state. These phrases and the derivations of the matrices will be described in further detail herein below.","The present invention provides a method for locating leaks in a pipeline system for simple and complex gas or a liquid pipeline system. The method involves placing permanent monitors on the pipeline that detects expansion pressure waves associated with a sudden breakdown in the pressure boundary due to a rupture in the pipe wall as well as the measurement of the flow velocity associated with fluid movement.","The method of the present invention uses measurements of the propagating pressure and the flow velocity in series, as well as the temperature of the fluid (in the case of gas, specific volume and enthalpy are used), to create a Jacobean matrix of flow from these measurements, where evaluation of the matrix generates a solution vector of eigenvalues (pressure and velocity) specific to the fluid system at the time of measurement.","The leak is located by calculating the fluid sonic velocity at the upstream and downstream sensors of the pipeline from where the leak is located using the average of the product of sonic velocity and time lag of deviation at the upstream and downstream sides.

The system  includes a complex array of trunk lines and tie lines interconnected through a series of manifolds. The manifolds are connected together by adjacent delivery lines or trunk lines. Trunk lines are pipelines \u2033 and above, which are the distribution system for transporting large volumes of crude oil to the terminal. Delivery lines, which are 8\u2033 and 12\u2033 pipelines, connect the flow station with an adjacent manifold, from where the oil enters the trunk line distribution system.
