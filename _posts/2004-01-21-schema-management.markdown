{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Additional Implementation Details"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is related to schema management.","2. Description of the Related Art","Extensible markup language (XML) may be described as a language specification developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). XML allows creation of XML documents that provide data and format information. XML documents contain elements and attributes defined by the XML specification. An XML schema is a type of XML document that is used to assess the validity of \u201cwell-formed\u201d elements and attributes in other XML documents. Each XML document is associated with at least one XML schema. For more information on schemas, see XML Schema Part 1: Structures. W3C Recommendation 2 May 2001 (http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xmlschema-1\/).","There are many instances in which users and\/or components use XML schemas. For example, XML databases, XML-relational databases, and XQuery processors access XML schemas for use in validating XML documents and elements. XQuery is a query language that uses the structure of XML to express queries across data. XML documents are validated to ensure that they are \u201cwell-formed\u201d as defined by the XML specification. Additionally, XML databases and XML-relational databases associate with XML schemas for use in constraining XML documents or elements. Constraining refers to identifying whether an XML document fits a constraint. For example, if a folder or a column of a table is created to hold XML documents that are resumes, then a particular schema may be used to determine whether a particular XML document is a resume. Also, schema-specific XML parser generators access and associate with XML schemas for parser generation and usage. Moreover, general purpose XML parsers access XML schemas for use in validating XML documents.","Currently, there may be a large number of XML schemas associated with a larger number of XML documents for a particular system. Typically, a user or component needs to know which particular XML schema is needed for processing (e.g., for validating an XML document). With so many XML schemas and XML documents, it is difficult for users and components to know which XML schema to access for a particular XML document.","An XML namespace is a collection of element type and attribute names that are uniquely identified by the name of the unique XML namespace of which they are a part. For example, in an XML document, any element type or attribute name can have a two-part name consisting of the name of its namespace and then its local name. Also, several schemas may share a namespace. Currently, an XML document may describe an XML namespace of its associated XML schema, but because a namespace may imply multiple XML schemas, the namespace alone may not identify a desired XML schema.","Moreover, an XML document may include a statement that declares a namespace and a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that identifies a point of content, but the URI does not necessarily provide the physical location of the XML schema. Therefore, such a statement may not be useful in identifying a specific XML schema. Thus, again, a user or component needs to know which XML schema is required.","An XML schema is a logical entity, and, management of XML schemas requires more than managing XML schema documents associated with the XML schema. Also, because XML schemas are not managed in conventional systems, it is difficult to identify a particular XML schema in conventional systems. Thus, there is a need in the art to improve schema management, for example, for XML schemas.","Provided are a method, system, and program for managing schemas. A schema and one or more associated schema documents are registered. A schema information document is automatically generated based on the schema and the one or more associated schema documents. A request to be performed on at least one of the schema, an associated schema document, and the schema information document is processed.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which illustrate several implementations of the present invention. It is understood that other implementations may be utilized and structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","190","120","190","100","104","110","104"]},"The server computer  includes system memory , which maybe implemented in volatile and\/or non-volatile devices. A schema manager  and a schema document manager  execute in the system memory . In certain implementations, the schema manger  performs management tasks related to schemas, such as, for example, registering schemas, deregistering schemas, and versioning of schemas. In certain implementations, the schema document manager  performs management tasks related to schema documents; such as, for example, versioning.

Additionally, one or more server applications  execute in system memory .","The server computer  provides the client computer  with access to data in one or more data stores  (e.g., databases). Although data stores  are illustrated for ease of understanding, data in data stores  may be stored in data stores at other computers connected to server computer .","Also, an operator console  executes one or more applications  and is used to access the server computer  and the data store .","The data store  may comprise an array of storage devices, such as Direct Access Storage Devices (DASDs), Just a Bunch of Disks (JBOD), Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), virtualization device, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["170","170","171","172","174","176","171","172","174","176"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","142","202","208","202","142","171"]},"A schema document may be a simple schema document or a compound schema document. A simple schema document may be described as a single schema document. A compound schema document may be described as a primary schema document that includes, redefines, and\/or imports other schema documents recursively.  illustrates a conceptual schema in accordance with certain implementations of the invention. The term \u201cconceptual\u201d is used to highlight that a schema is a logical entity that is comprised of schema documents that are physical entities. The conceptual schema is represented by a set of XML schema documents encompassing three namespaces, namespace , namespace , and namespace . A compound schema document is represented by primary schema document a.xsd, which includes schema document b.xsd in namespace  and imports schema document c.xsd from namespace . Another compound schema document is represented by primary schema document e.xsd, which redefines schema document f.xsd in namespace . A simple schema document is d.xsd in namespace . The \u201cxsd\u201d suffix of each schema stands for \u201cXML schema document.\u201d The conceptual XML schema may be used (e.g., for validating XML documents) after registration of the three separate XML schemas: (a.xsd with b.xsd and c.xsd), (d.xsd), and (e.xsd with f.xsd). Although the examples herein may refer to XML schemas and XML schema documents, implementations of the invention are applicable to other schemas and documents.","In , at block , the schema manager  generates an identifier for the schema. In certain implementations, to support common usage scenarios and versioning, a schema is associated with and uniquely identified by a three-part composite key: (target namespace, schema location, version). The target namespace and schema location of a schema document in a compound schema may be taken from those of a primary schema document. In certain implementations, either the target namespace or schema location may be null, but not both. Optionally, a version identifier may be included. The version identifier may be provided by user or generated by the schema manager . The version identifier may be null. Also, a schema may also be associated with and identified by a unique name in addition to the three-part composite key.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","400","1","1","1"]},"In block , the schema document manager  generates an identifier for the one or more schema documents. A schema document is also associated with and uniquely identified by a three-part composite key: (target namespace, schema location, version). The target namespace may be one that is specified in the schema document. The schema location may be provided by a user or may be null. The version identifier is optional and may be provided by a user or generated by the schema manager. The version identifier may be null.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["410","410","1","1","1"]},"The schema manger  supports versioning of schemas and schema documents. For a schema document, which is associated with and uniquely identified by a three-part composite key (target namespace, schema location, version), the schema manager  supports namespace versioning, schema location versioning, and\/or a version attribute. Namespace versioning refers to embedding a version identifier in the namespace URI. Schema location versioning refers to embedding a version identifier in the schema location URI. The version attribute refers to embedding a version identifier as the value of the version attribute of the schema element.","For a schema that is associated with and uniquely identified by a three-part composite key (target namespace, schema location, version), the target namespace and schema location may be identical to those of its primary schema document. The version identifier, however, is independent of that of the primary schema document. This allows versioning of schemas to be in sync with versioning of schema documents where applicable, but independent of versioning of schema documents when needed. For example, for schema version , primary schema document a.xsd may be version and schema document b.xsd may be version, while for schema version, primary schema document a.xsd may be version and schema document b.xsd may be version.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","510","510","500","510","510","500","510","500"]},"In certain implementations, the schema repository  consists of a schemas collection and a schema documents collection. The schemas collection is used to store metadata about schemas. Such metadata includes the identification of a primary schema document and the associations (e.g., include, redefine, and\/or import) between the primary schema document and other schema documents, recursively. Then, the schemas collection is indexed by target namespace, schema location, version, and\/or name. The schema documents collection is used to store schema documents and is indexed by target namespace, schema location, and\/or version.","In block , the schema manager  automatically generates a schema information document for the schema and one or more schema documents. The schema information document formalizes and records the meta-information of a schema. The meta-information of a schema includes, for example, identification of a primary schema document, identification of other associated schema documents, and how the primary and other schema documents are related to each other (e.g., through include, redefine, and or import associations, etc.). The meta-information of the schema is recorded at registration time for later use in the schema information document. In certain implementations, the schema information document may be an XML document.

invention:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<?xml

6"},"Control begins at block  with the schema manager  receiving a request. The register request may be, for example, a command or Application Programming Interface (API), provided by implementations of the invention. In block , the schema manager  determines whether the user submitting the request has the appropriate privilege to perform the request. That is, in block , the schema manager  performs access processing. The schema manager  supports access control of schemas and associated schema documents. The following privileges for accessing schemas are supported: register, read, replace, and deregister. In certain implementations, the access privileges are associated with users of particular schemas. Then, the access privileges associated with a schema for a user are also associated with schema documents that are associated with the schema. In certain alternative implementations, separate privileges for accessing schema documents are supported.","For example, if a user wishes to replace a schema document that is shared by more than one schemas, the schema manager  ensures that the user has a replace privilege on at least one schema. Each schema for which the user has the replace privilege is affected. To affect all schemas that share the schema document, the schema manger  ensures that the user has the replace privilege on all schemas that share the schema document. When a schema document is replaced, then new binary representations are generated for the schemas that share that schema document.","If the user has access control, processing continues to block , otherwise, processing continues to block . In block , denial of access processing is performed by the schema manager . In certain implementations, a message may be sent to the user indicating that the user does not have the appropriate privilege to perform the request.","In block , if the request is a register request, processing continue to block , otherwise, processing continues to block .","In block , the schema manager  performs registration and storage processing. The registration and storage processing includes generating identifiers for the schema and one or more schema documents and generating a schema information document for the schema and the one or more schema documents, as were discussed with reference to .","Additionally, more than one schema may share the same schema document. A schema may be related to one or more associated schema documents through references. When a schema is registered in the schema repository, the associated schema documents are stored in the schema repository using the following technique. First, the schema manager  determines whether a copy of the newly received schema document already exists in the schema repository. The determination of whether a copy of the newly received schema document exists may be made by determining whether the newly received schema document is identical to an existing schema document. In certain implementations, two schema documents are identical to each other if they have the same target namespace, the same schema location, and the same content (e.g., using binary comparison). If a schema document already exists in the schema repository, the newly received schema document is not stored again as only one copy of a given schema document is stored in the schema repository. However, in certain implementations, different versions of a schema document are not considered to be identical.","If there is a (target namespace, schema location) collision (i.e., there already exists a schema documents with the same target namespace and schema location but different content as the newly received schema document), the schema manager  stores the newly received schema document with a version identifier. The version identifier may be generated by the schema manager  or provided by a user.","In block , if the request is a deregister request, processing continues to block , otherwise, processing continues to block . In block , the schema manager  performs deregister processing. In certain implementations, deregistering a schema refers to deleting the schema.","Once registered, a schema may be deregistered according to deregister rules associated with the schema when the schema is provided for registration. The associated schema documents, which are not referenced by other schemas, are removed from the schema repository when the schema is removed. The deregister rules are, in the order of decreasing precedence: restrict, cascade, set NULL, and no action. For the restrict deregister rule, if there are schema documents that were validated using the schema, the schema is not deregistered. For the cascade deregister rule, the schema is deregistered and schema documents that were validated using the schema are deleted. For the set NULL deregister rule, the schema is deregistered and schema documents that were validated using the schema are set to the status of \u201cnot validated\u201d. The no action deregister rule is similar to the restrict deregister rule, but the no action deregister rule is enforced after the other higher-priority deregister rules have been enforced.","In block , if the request is a lookup request, processing continues to block , otherwise, processing continues to block . in block , the schema manager  performs lookup processing. The schema manager  is able to lookup a schema and associated schema documents. To lookup a schema, the lookup request provides a three-part composite key (target namespace, schema location, version) or unique name. In the three-part composite key, either target namespace or schema location is used for the lookup, and the other may be NULL. Also, the version is optional.","In certain implementations, the following look-up technique is used. If there is one matching schema, the schema manager  returns this schema. If there are multiple matching schemas, the schema manager  applies a user-defined technique and\/or a system-defined (e.g., default) technique to filter the results. If at the end of the filtering process, there are still multiple schemas, the schema manager  raises an error. If there is no matching schema, the schema manager  optionally applies a user-defined technique and\/or a system-defined technique to find a matching schema. For example, the lookup request may reference namespace, which results in no match, but the user-defined technique may specify that namespace is equivalent to namespace, and then a lookup is performed of namespace. If, after applying the user-defined technique, there is still no matching schema, the schema manager  returns NULL.","Once a schema has been found, associated schema documents are located using the information contained in its schema information document.","In block , if the request is a replacement request, processing continues to block , otherwise, processing continues to block . In block , the schema manager  performs replacement processing. That is, the schema manager  supports replacement of schemas and schema documents. In certain implementations, a schema may be replaced after registration if the new schema is backward compatible (i.e., all schema documents that were validated against the existing schema remain valid against the new schema). Similarly, in certain implementations, a schema document, which is associated with one or more schemas, may be replaced after registration if the new schema document is backward compatible (i.e., the new schema document is backward compatible with schemas that reference the new schema document).","In block , other processing may be performed.","Thus, implementations of the invention provide registration and management of schemas and associated schema documents; identification of schemas and schema documents; formalization of meta information of schemas in schema information documents; lookup of schemas and associated schema documents; versioning of schemas and schema documents; sharing of schema documents among schemas; replacement of schemas and schema documents; and, access control of schemas and associated schema documents.","IBM is a registered trademark or common law mark of International Business Machines Corporation in the United States and\/or other countries.","The described techniques for schema management maybe implemented as a method, apparatus or article of manufacture using standard programming and\/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof.
