Section 111(a) with claiming the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/558,555 filed Apr. 2, 2004 and U.S. provisional application No. 60\/608,873 filed Sep. 13, 2004 under the provision of 35 U.S.C. 111(b), pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Section 119(e)(1).","The present invention relates to a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer modified in the solvent resistance and mechanical properties without impairing the electrical properties, a production process thereof, an electrically conducting composition using the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer, a product coated with the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer, and an electronic device. As for the electronic device, more specifically, the present invention relates to an organic light-emitting element using the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer.","A self-doping type electrically conducting polymer is usually soluble in water and easily shapable or film-formable into an arbitrary shape and by virtue of such properties, production of a large-area film is facilitated and such a polymer, for its excellent processability, can be employed in production of electrical elements requiring high-precision processing technology.","In recent years, by taking advantage of these properties, self-doping type electrically conducting polymers are used for prevention of charge-up in lithography process using a charged particle beam such as electron beam or ion beam.","A method of imparting water resistance to a water-soluble self-doping type electrically conducting polymer is disclosed. More specifically, a method of performing a dehydration treatment for enhancing the water resistance of a water-soluble polythiophene-based self-doping type electrically conducting polymer is disclosed (see, JP-A-3-221520 (the term \u201cJP-A\u201d as used herein means an \u201cunexamined published Japanese patent application\u201d)).","However, in this method, the water insolubility is attained by decreasing the amount of water contained, and the essential difference between the water-soluble self-doping type electrically conducting polymer and the water-insoluble self-doping type electrically conducting polymer is unclear since the document does not include description about it.","A method of heat-treating a substrate coated with a water-soluble aniline-based self-doping type electrically conducting polymer to obtain a water-resistant electric conductor is disclosed (see, JP-A-2001-98069).","However, in this method, the water resistance is imparted by eliminating a sulfonic acid group and\/or a carboxyl group of the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer and therefore, the original electrical conductivity is disadvantageously liable to decrease. In particular, high temperature treatment, which causes decomposition of the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer itself, gives rise to a problem that the electrical conductivity is seriously decreased.","Also, a water-soluble polyisothianaphthene-based self-doping type electrically conducting polymer and a production process thereof are disclosed (see, JP-A-6-49183), but this aqueous solution is known to be affected by oxygen (see, JP-A-8-259673) and there is no known method for improving the water resistance and solvent resistance at present.","With respect to method for enhancing the water resistance and solvent resistance of an electrically conducting composition containing a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer, a method of adding a thermosetting matrix resin is disclosed in JP-A-2000-186218. In this method, a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer is used as a mixture with an insulating polymer and therefore the electrical conductivity decreases as compared with a case where a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer alone is used. Also, it is known that, in the case of using an electrically conducting composition as a coating film, since the coating film formed must have a large thickness so as to ensure predetermined electrical conductivity, transmission of the film thus formed is low as compared with a film formed of the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer alone.","Incidentally, an electronic device is used in the state that a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer-containing composition and various thin films are stacked. In this case, an electrically conducting polymer component of the electrically conducting polymer-containing composition or additives contained therein may dissolve out between the electrically conducting polymer composition layer and a thin film layer in contact therewith, or components of various thin film layers may dissolve out into the electrically conducting polymer composition layer, resulting in a problem that the performance of the electronic device seriously decreases. Thus, a material excellent in the solvent resistance as an electrically conducting composition is being demanded.","For example, the polymer-type organic light-emitting element developed to-date is typically constructed by providing anode(transparent)\/anode buffer layer\/light-emitting layer\/cathode in this order on the transparent substrate and is used in the state that various thin films are stacked.","In this construction, the anode buffer layer is inserted for the purpose of flattening the anode surface to prevent an electrical short circuit or for the purpose of buffering the barrier against hole injection from the light-emitting layer into the anode. For this anode buffer, a mixture of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) which is an electrically conducting polymer material and polystyrenesulfonic acid (PSS) is being widely used at present.","Also, the present inventors have already proposed that a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer having an isothianaphthene skeleton showing weak acidity at 1% by mass is useful as the anode buffer layer.","In these techniques, the above-mentioned mixture of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polystyrenesulfonic acid (PSS) contains a sulfonic acid group in PSS working out to a dopant, and the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer also contains a sulfonic acid group in its molecular structure. Whichever of the electrically conducting polymers is used for the anode buffer layer, there remains another problem that water embraced as a crystal water in the sulfonic acid group is released in the device to deteriorate the element, which should be solved to avoid the deterioration.","Intensive studies are being made on such a problem regarding deterioration resulting from movement of water. In particular, a method of providing a barrier layer to prevent water present in ambient air which permeates into the element from reaching the light-emitting layer is disclosed (see JP-A-2004-134151).","A first object of the present invention is to provide a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer having solvent resistance and mechanical properties with polymer chains being crosslinked, in place of a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer incapable of exhibiting solvent resistance and mechanical properties without greatly decreasing electrical conductivity, and a production process of the polymer.","A second object of the present invention is to provide a product coated with the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer imparted with solvent resistance and mechanical properties by having crosslinked polymer chains, and an electronic device using it, more specifically, an organic light-emitting element.","The present inventors have found that the solvent resistance and mechanical properties can be obtained by partially crosslinking self-doping type electrically conducting polymers, and accomplished the present invention.","In particular, by crosslinking isothianaphthene skeleton-containing electrically conducting polymers, the solvent resistance and mechanical properties can be imparted without losing the electrical properties.","Furthermore, by crosslinking 3-position substituted thiophene skeleton-containing electrically conducting polymers, the solvent resistance and mechanical properties can be imparted without greatly impairing the electrical properties.","It has been found that the self-doping type electrically conducting polymer containing an isothianaphthene skeleton having a sulfonic, acid group does not decompose by heating for a short time and when heated at a high temperature, undergoes crosslinking and changes into a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer having high solvent resistance and excellent strength. This is considered to occur due to dehydration reaction between the sulfonic acid group and a hydrogen atom in the aromatic ring of another isothianaphthene under heating and the resulting generation of sulfone bond.","Furthermore, the present inventors have found that also a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer containing a thiophene skeleton having a sulfonic acid group substituted at the 3-position of the thiophene structure directly or through a side chain undergoes crosslinking when heated at a high temperature, and changes into a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer having high solvent resistance and excellent strength. This is considered to occur due to dehydration reaction between the sulfonic acid group and a hydrogen atom at the 4-position of the thiophene whose 3-position is substituted and the resulting generation of sulfone bond.","That is, the present invention relates to a self-doping type electrically conducting polymer, a production process thereof, an electrically conducting composition containing the electrically conducting polymer, a product coated with the electrically conducting polymer, an electronic device using the electrically conducting polymer, and the like, which are described below.","More specifically, the present invention includes the following inventions.","1.
