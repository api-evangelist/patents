title: System and method for bioremediating wastestreams containing energetics
abstract: A bioremediation system converts a waste stream, at least part of which is a fluid containing energetics, to carbon dioxide (CO), water, and environmentally benign end products. It uses gas-enhanced sequencing-batch-reactors (SBRs), treating the waste stream in three SBRs seriatim. The first SBR uses a nitrogen purge, the second a hydrogen gas supplement, and the third an oxygen gas or forced air supplement. Each reactor may be supplemented with additives to optimize conditions such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient level. The system may be implemented under manual control, semi-automated, or fully automated, as needed. A waste stream of consideration is the pink water resultant from munitions fabrication and handling.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","Provided is a system and method for treating a waste stream, in particular treating a system applying a relatively rapid multi-step bioremediation process to a waste stream containing energetics.","Pink water is wastewater generated from the load-assemble-pack (LAP) operations at U. S. Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs). Constituents of pink water include 2,4,6 trinitrotoluene (TNT), trimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and cyclotetramethylenetetramine (HMX). Carbon sorption is the conventional method for treating this LAP waste. Using granulated activated carbon (GAC) filters, the waste is passed through the GAC removing the explosive constituents by sorption onto the carbon. This method is non-destructive, i.e., the sorbed molecules of contaminant remain intact chemically. Thus, the process generates spent contaminant-laden GAC filters that require further treatment, to include regeneration of the carbon filter for re-use or safe disposal at the end of the filter's useful life. The U. S. military and its contractors generate a substantial amount of spent GAC from pink water treatment and would save considerable resources by replacing the GAC filtration process with a process that actually destroys or neutralizes energetic contaminants. An alternative to GAC is microbial treatment.","Because TNT has a high electron deficiency, any initial microbial transformation is reductive. Vorbeck, C., et al., 2,4,6-64, 246-252, 1998. Treating TNT waste streams under aerobic conditions produces a variety of partially reduced TNT daughter products. Vorbeck et al. 1998; Pasti-Grigsby, et al., 2,4,6-(TNT) from TNT- , Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62, 1140-1123, 1996; Fiorella, P. D. and Spain, J. C., 2,4,6-63, 2007-2015, 1997. These daughter products converge TNT to aminodinitrotoluenes, diaminonitrotoluenes, tetranitroazoxytoluenes and combinations thereof. Roberts, D. J., et al., -, Environ. Sci. Technol. 30, 2021-2026, 1996. Under aerobic conditions, these metabolites are resistant to further degradation and are therefore considered dead-end products. Vorbeck et al., 1998. Anaerobic conditions are required for the complete reduction of TNT to triaminotoluene (TAT). Funk, S. B., et al, --59, 2171-2177, 1993; Boopathy, R. and Kulpa, C. F., (TNT) as a . () , Current Microbiol., 25:235-241, 1992; McCormick, N. G., et al., 2,4,6-, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 31, 949-958, 1976; Preuss, A., et al., 2,4,6-(TNT), Arch. Microbiol. 159, 345-353, 1993; Hwang, P., et al., , Environ. Toxic. Chem. 19, 836-841, 2000. The fate of TAT is largely unknown, although phenolic products of TAT hydrolysis and an adduct of TAT have been identified, apparently formed by the condensation of TAT and pyruvic aldehyde. Lewis et al., 1996; Lewis, T. A., et al., 2,4,6-(TNT) , Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62, 4669-4674, 1996.","RDX is reported to be more easily biodegraded under anaerobic, rather than aerobic conditions. Funk et al., 1993; Kitts, C. L. et al., 1,3,5-1,3,5---, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 60:4608-4711, 1994; McCormick, N. G., et al., 1,3,5--1,3,5-, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 42, 817-823, 1981; Roberts et al., 1996. One of the few exceptions includes RDX biodegradation by a white rot fungus. Fernando and Aust, (2,4,6-), (1,3,5-1,3,5-) , Emerging Technologies in Hazardous Waste Management II, ACS Symposium Series, 468, 214-232, 1991. Another exception is degradation by the bacterium PB when using RDX as the sole source of nitrogen. Binks, P. R., et al., -1,3,5-1,3,5-() 161, pp 1318-1322, 1995. A third exception occurs during composting of explosives-contaminated soil. Williams, R. T., et al., , J. Indus. Microbiol., 9, 137-144, 1992.","Most of the studies demonstrating RDX biodegradation under anaerobic conditions were conducted under poorly defined conditions where the electron donor and acceptors were not firmly established. For example, the bacterial cultures were grown in nutrient broth. McCormick et al., 1981. They were also grown in yeast extract. Kitts et al., 1994. A third example involves growth in Brain Hear Infusion media. Regan, K. M., and R. L. Crawford, of 2,4,6-(TNT) 1,3,5--1,3,5-(), , 16, 1081-1086, 1994. In the latter two cases, RDX biodegradation was carried out by pure cultures of bacteria isolated from explosives-contaminated soil. In the former case, the nutrient broth was inoculated with organisms from activated sludge.","Anaerobic conditions are required for complete explosives degradation, but little is known about the bacteria carrying out the transformation or the environmental conditions that would further enhance the degradation activity. A preferred embodiment of this invention was motivated by the explosives biodegradation research results at the U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC), Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL). Adrian, N. R., and Lowder, A., , P 1-6, in B. C. Alleman (ed.) , Battelle Press, Ohio, 1999; Adrian, N. R. and Sutherland, K., RDX 99\/15, ADA 360452, 1998; Adrian, N. R. and Sutherland, K., , Q-359, Miami, Fla., 1997. The authors investigated biodegradation of energetic compounds under anaerobic conditions using ethanol as the sole electron donor. They found that the inhibition of the methanogens did not affect the degradation of RDX and did not even appear to be involved in the degradation of RDX. Adrian and Sutherland, 1998. Adding RDX to the mixed culture did, however, inhibit methane generation. Adrian and Lowder, 1999. That same year experiments demonstrated the use of Hand the involvement of acetogenic bacteria in carrying out explosives degradation. Further evidence indicates that the acetogens are the major metabolic group in the mixed culture that degrades TNT, RDX, and HMX. Arnett, C. and Adrian, N. R., -RDX, HMX, and TNT, , Leesburg, Va., 1999.","In a parallel effort to the above microbiological research, the ERDC\/CERL conducted engineering evaluation of treatment of energetic compounds using biotechnology. A granular activated carbon fluidized bed reactor (GAC-FBR) was demonstrated to biologically degrade energetic compounds under anaerobic conditions at bench and pilot scales. Berchtold, S. R., et al., 2,4--, Water Env. Res., 67, 1081-1091, 1995; Maloney, S. W., et al., , Water Env. Res., 70, n, p.52, 1998. These investigations confirmed other work that found that, based on mass balance, end products from TNT degradation included nitrate and biomass in the effluent. VanderLoop, S. L., et al., 2,4-, Water Research, 33, n, p. 1287, 1999; VanderLoop, S. L., et al., -2,4,6---, Water Env. Res., 70, n, p. 189, 1998. Successful GAC-FBR treatment of TNT was demonstrated at McAlester AAP, Oklahoma. Maloney, S. W., et al., GAC, Journal of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, accepted for publication, 2001.","Certain U.S. patents relate to bioremediation of explosive contaminated soils and groundwater. U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,772, Treatment of TNT-contaminated soil to Hater et al., May 23, 2000 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,199, to Moser and Gray, Dec. 7, 1999, use natural organisms to degrade the explosives contaminated soil in anaerobic compost following aerobic compost processes. To achieve an anaerobic condition, at least one oxidizable carbon source is added.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,271, Feb. 7, 1995; U.S. Pat. No. 5,616,162, Apr. 1, 1997; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,084,150, Jul. 4, 2000, each issued to Crawford et al., and each entitled , use two-step anaerobic treatment to decontaminate soil and water containing nitroaromatics. The first step is fermentation of a carbohydrate such as starch by facultative microorganisms, thus exhausting oxygen and insuring anaerobic conditions. The second step uses anaerobic microorganisms to destroy energetic compounds, while using a carbohydrate for the carbon and energy source.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,420, Method for the Decontamination of Soil Organic Explosives, to Radtke and Roberto, May 20, 1998, describes a method for decontaminating soil in situ by first providing an organic solvent to dissolve chunks of explosives, thus facilitating bioremediation of the smaller particles by bacteria while further being aided by the addition of an organic nutrient to the treated soil.","Each of these methods involves adding a carbon source and multiple stages that may require extensive time to complete. A need for a treatment plan that does not require the addition of an expensive carbon source nor require an extended treatment period is met by a preferred embodiment of this invention.","In a preferred embodiment, an advanced bioremediation system converts a waste stream, at least part of which is a fluid containing energetics, to carbon dioxide (CO), water, and environmentally benign end products. It uses gas-enhanced sequencing-batch-reactors (SBRs), treating the waste stream in three SBRs seriatim. The first SBR uses a nitrogen purge, the second a hydrogen gas supplement, and the third an oxygen gas or forced air supplement. A waste stream of consideration is the pink water resultant from munitions fabrication and handling.","In the first batch reactor the waste is allowed to settle, providing a sludge that is periodically drawn from the bottom of the reactor. Simultaneously the reactor de-oxygenates the waster by introducing nitrogen gas through a disperser such as a bubbler diffuser. This yields a first treated fluid output that is amenable to anaerobic bioremediation in a second batch reactor. The fluid from the first batch reactor is pumped from a floating decanter to the second batch reactor.","The second batch reactor employs anaerobic microorganisms whose activity is enhanced by bubble diffusing hydrogen gas therein. The benefit of using hydrogen gas in a reactor is detailed in the report of Neal R. Adrian, , A Research Note Submitted to Byung Kim in Support of a Patent Application for Reactor System Using HGas as the Cosubstrate to Support Explosives Degradation, ERDC, Champaign, Ill., Apr. 19, 2000, and incorporated herein by reference. The anaerobic microorganisms may be suspended in the liquid or disposed on a sludge or a biofilm of a carrier. If the microorganisms are disposed on sludge, a paddle stirrer may be employed to insure proper dispersal of the microorganisms. After a sufficient processing time in the second batch reactor, nominally two hours, the treated fluid is pumped to a third batch reactor. To minimize the transfer of solids, the second reactor may also use a floating decanter.","The third batch reactor employs aerobic microorganisms whose activity is enhanced by bubble diffusing a gas having at least some oxygen. For example, either an oxygen bottle or a simple air compressor line may provide the input to the bubble diffuser. The fluid from the final reactor is drawn off, perhaps using a floating decanter, and re-used in processing.","The sludge that accumulates within each reactor is pumped out periodically as accumulation warrants. Each of the batch reactors may incorporate a valve for accessing sludge therein and the valve may be powered to permit automated or semi-automated control of this function.","Conventionally, pink water is generated as a hot waste. Thus, the system may require the use of a subsystem for maintaining a pre-specified temperature, such as a heat exchanger to cool the waste stream prior to pumping it to any of the reactors, in particular, a reactor containing microorganisms. Further, depending upon the ambient conditions in the area around the reactors, the reactors may require supplemental heating to maintain an optimum 25-30\u00b0 C. temperature for the microorganisms over the period of time required to bioremediate the pink water.","In addition to optimizing the temperature in each reactor, one or more of the batch reactors may require additives to maintain the pH, provide necessary nutrients or carbon sources, and establish the required dissolved oxygen levels, typically less than about 0.1 mg\/l. For example, COgas may be added to the second batch reactor to provide air flow and buffering capacity. The list of required additives may include: nitrogen gas, hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide gas, oxygen gas, forced ambient air, organic carbon, carbon compounds, nutrients, micronutrients, acids, bases, flocculating agents (flocculents), anaerobic microorganisms, aerobic microorganisms, and combinations thereof.","Ideally, the first and second batch reactors are enclosed, i.e., each incorporate a top having a breather, while the final reactor may be open depending on the requirements for maintaining purity of the final effluent or reducing evaporation.","To facilitate control of the process, whether automated, semi-automated or manual, a series of sensors are desirable. Each reactor may need temperature sensors or thermometers, pH sensors, dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors, pressure sensors, fluid level sensors, turbidity meter, electrolytic sensors, flow sensors, or combinations thereof. Information from the sensors should be provided to a display for an operator to monitor as well as to any controller or microprocessor involved in semi-automated or automated control of the process. This display could be a panel of analog or digital meters or a cathode ray tube (CRT) that is able to provide information based on a simple query.","Depending on the size of the reactors, a single pump with a piping and valve system could handle the entire operation on the \u201cfluid\u201d system of the operation while a similar pump, properly set up with the reactors, could handle the sludge pumping. Of course, each reactor could also use its own pump for each of the operations (fluid pumping and sludge pumping), thus reducing the length of the head for any one pumping operation.","The microorganisms within the second and third batch reactors may be of a suspended growth type on a fixed film or suspended in the liquid. In the fixed film type, biofilms reside on small media, i.e., millimeter size, activated carbon, or combinations thereof. Thus, the microorganisms may be located on a biofilm resident upon a small element of less than about 10 mm in its longest dimension, a thin porous contactor of approximately 5 mm diameter and 1-2 mm thickness, a biofilm resident on activated carbon, and combinations thereof. In addition, some microorganisms may be present in sludge. Also provided is a method for treating wastes containing energetics.","In summary, a method for treating a waste having a fluid component entraining energetics comprises monitoring and adjusting conditions to optimize conditions within the system while:\n\n","Refer to the FIGURE. Three batch-processing, or SBR, systems , ,  are operated in series to breakdown energetics in a waste stream and provide re-cycled water and benign solid waste. A source  of waste, such as a holding tank for pink water, provides the waste stream. The waste stream may be released on a pre-specified schedule via a power-actuated control valve  in a source tank  or other carrier such as a direct pipeline from a processing system. The waste stream may be provided to the first SBR system  by a pump . The entire treatment process may be controlled by a central controller  consisting of one or more microprocessors and necessary communications paths to the various components of the treatment system. This controller  may communicate via hardwires, fiber optics, hydraulics, pneumatics, or may use any of a number of wireless technologies such as RE or infrared, or combinations thereof, thus enabling flexibility in upgrading control devices as technology improves.","The functions of the first SBR system  are flow equalization, sedimentation, supplemental heat exchange, and de-oxygenation. For example, LAP operations intermittently generate hot pink water waste streams. For this reason it is sometimes beneficial to include a subsystem for maintaining a pre-specified temperature, such as a heat exchanger  in the front end of the treatment system. Initial flow rate along the input path  to the first SBR system  is measured by a flow meter  that may also be displayed on an operator's panel  in the first SBR system  and from correlating this measure with the time of operation of the pump , the flow volume is derived.","The enclosed first SBR tank  assists in stabilizing the waste stream, containing it until the volume reaches a pre-specified amount and the target temperature range is met, e.g., 25-30\u00b0 C. for bioremediation of pink water. The tank  is enclosed by a suitable cover  that is penetrated to provide entrance and exit of the waste stream and for venting through a breather . To facilitate cooling, the SBR tank  has an open breather  that may be integral with the input path . As well, the surface of the SBR tank , perhaps constructed of a heat conducting material such as stainless steel, provides additional cooling. Any suspended or colloidal solids in the waste stream are allowed to settle in the cone shaped bottom of the SBR  for a suitable period, nominally a minimum of 2 hours. Solids are removed as sludge via a pump  through activation of a valve  at pre-specified intervals, or as necessary to optimize the operation of the SBR tank . This process is also monitored via a meter  that may also be displayed on an operator's panel  to insure optimal timing and conditions for operation of the pump . Subsequently, the breather  is closed and nitrogen purging starts by opening a valve (not separately shown) on a nitrogen bottle  having a meter  in a line to the SBR tank . The meter  may also be displayed on an operator's panel . To de-oxygenate the waste stream, nitrogen flows through a tubular bubble diffuser  that establishes a turbulent flow regime  in the SBR tank . The breather , in addition to its cooling function, also allows the mixture of nitrogen and released oxygen gasses to escape when the internal tank pressure as indicated by a sensor (not separately shown) increases above a pre-specified amount as displayed by an internal pressure meter shown as one of a collection of meters on an operator's panel . Suitable communication may be established with an internal pressure sensor, the nitrogen gas pressure sensor , a tank thermometer (not separately shown), a water level sensor (not separately shown), a pH sensor (not separately shown), and a dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor (not separately shown). Typically DO is maintained at less than about 0.1 mg\/l. Each not separately shown sensor may communicate with a related meter represented in the figure as one of a collection of meters on an operator's panel  that enables automated process control. Preferably, each sensor associated with an SBR system , ,  is displayed via a series of meters on an operator's panel , , .","When de-oxygenation is complete, i.e., when the DO is typically \u22660.1 mg\/l, the liquid portion of the de-oxygenated waste stream is collected through a floating decanter  and transferred via a pump  from the outlet  of the first SBR tank  to a second SBR system .","The second SBR system  uses a hydrogen-gas-enhanced biological SBR tank  specially designed for biological breakdown of energetic compounds. The de-oxygenated waste stream is transferred by a pump  through a meter  to the tank's inlet that may be colocated with a breather  to the enclosed SBR tank , wherein the waste stream is broken down by acclimated anaerobic microorganisms (not separately shown). This SBR tank  is also fitted with a top  that is penetrated to facilitate the entrance and exit of the waste stream as well as a vent in the form of a breather . The microorganisms may inhabit suspended growth (not separately shown) or be resident upon a biofilm (not separately shown) affixed on activated carbon or other carrier. The carrier has a nominal density of about 1.0 g\/cc, a porous structure, a surface capable of good attachment, and small size (<5 mm diameter). While the de-oxygenated waste stream fills the reactor tank  to a pre-specified level, hydrogen gas (H) is injected by opening the valve (not separately shown) of the hydrogen gas bottle . Status available by monitoring a meter  allows the hydrogen flow to be monitored via an appropriate one of a series of meters on an operator's panel  to facilitate process control. As in the first SBR tank , the hydrogen gas may enter the second SBR tank  via a tubular bubble diffuser . Optionally, a mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide (CO) (source not separately shown) is provided through the diffuser . The COmay be needed to facilitate the growth of suspended biomass at the level of agitation  provided by the diffuser . A breather  allows H(and COif present) to escape when headspace pressure, as determined by a gas pressure sensor (not separately shown) internal to the SBR tank , is above a pre-specified value, nominally 6-10 psi. The internal gas pressure sensor, a water level sensor (not separately shown), and pH sensor (not separately shown) may be used in the SBR tank  to facilitate process control. Each not separately shown sensor may be in communication with a meter represented in the figure as one of a collection of meters on an operator's panel  that may enable semi-automated or automated process control.","Hydrogen concentrations in the liquid waste stream and in the headspace above it in the SBR tank  are maintained at pre-specified levels. Nominal values of Hfor treating pink water are 440-4600 ppmv in the waste stream and 10ppmv in the headspace. The pH is also maintained within a pre-specified range, typically 6.0-7.2 for pink water. Bicarbonate, nutrients, micronutrients, or other carbon sources, and appropriate chemicals for pH control, as necessary, may be added from an off line source  through a separate inlet . Although a 12-hour hydraulic retention time (HRT) is sufficient to break down TNT and RDX, a 16-hour HRT may be used to coincide with an operator's work schedule, if necessary. For example, a first shift operator initiates the process at the end of a shift and terminates it 16 hours later upon the beginning of the shift the next morning.","Optionally, a slow paddle mixer (not separately shown) may be used in the second SBR tank  for mixing the sludge with the pink water to enable an efficient reaction. When the required anaerobic treatment within the second SBR  is complete, the liquid is settled for a pre-specified period, nominally about two hours for a pink water waste stream, collected through a floating decanter , and transferred by a pump  through a pipe  to a third SBR system  into which it is metered by meter . Should excess sludge accumulate in the second SBR tank , a power activated valve  and meter  are provided for sludge disposal with activation via the valve  and the sludge pump . Optionally, the second SBR tank  may be fitted with a heater (not separately shown) to maintain the optimum temperature for the anaerobic microorganisms to work.","The third SBR system  aerobically polishes the anaerobically treated liquid from the second SBR system . In the third SBR tank , aerobically mixed culture microorganisms (not separately shown) in suspended growth convert the product generated in the second SBR tank  into CO, water, and environmentally benign final products. While the product from the second SBR tank  fills the third SBR tank  from the outlet pipe , oxygen gas (O) or air is injected into the third SBR tank  by opening the valve (not separately shown) of the oxygen bottle  and metering the Othrough a meter , or by blowing air through a conduit (not separately shown) to a tubular bubble diffuser  in the third SBR tank . The oxygen or air thus introduced maintains suspended growth of the aerobic biomass at the level of agitation  provided by the diffuser . This third SBR tank  is different from the first two in that it may be open to the atmosphere. The third SBR tank  may also be enclosed to prevent accumulation of dust or insects or to retard evaporation, however, it need not be enclosed to ensure proper operation. A thermometer (not separately shown), a water level sensor (not separately shown), a DO sensor (not separately shown), and a pH sensor (not separately shown), are used to facilitate process control. Each not separately shown sensor may be associated with a meter represented in figure as one of a collection of meters on an operator's panel  that may enable semi-automated or automated process control. Bicarbonate, nutrients, micronutrients, or other carbon sources, and appropriate chemicals for pH control, as necessary, may be added from an offline source  through a separate inlet . For example, it may be desirable to have a pH in the range of 6.5-7.5 for any treated water that is to be re-cycled. Further, to hasten the settling process within each reactor it may be appropriate to add a flocculent such as one available from a swimming pool supply outlet and marketed as a \u201cclarifier.\u201d Optionally, the third SBR tank  may be fitted with a heater (not separately shown) to maintain the optimum temperature for the aerobic microorganisms to work.","When the required aerobic treatment is complete and suspended solid concentrations are higher than 2,000 ppm in the third SBR tank , the fluid is settled for about two hours, aqueous fluid collected through a floating decanter , and pumped through the outlet  for recycling. Sludge is removed as necessary. Generation of a large volume of sludge is not expected. However, a power activated valve  and meter  are provided for sludge disposal with activation via the valve  and sludge pump . All sludge is transferred at a pump outlet  for disposal or recycling.","In comparison with existing activated carbon adsorption methods, a preferred embodiment of this invention generates much less sludge. Further, as compared to a GAC-FBR, it provides hydrogen directly to microorganisms and does not require a significant carbon source such as ethanol.","Other embodiments of the present invention include a facility for processing products containing energetics at which facility a waste that has a fluid component and contains energetics is created, the fluid component treated for safe disposal by any of the embodiments specifically described above. Further embodiments involve treatment processes encompassing the use of Henhanced anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactors for treating groundwater or wastewater contaminated with energetics. Anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactors have been shown to be effective for treating pink water using ethanol as the co-substrate. Another embodiment of this invention uses a similarly designed bioreactor, substituting Hgas for ethanol as the co-substrate to enhance, accelerate, or support the anaerobic biodegradation of energetics. Advantages include less sludge and a product effluent with a low biological oxygen demand (BOD) suitable for discharge to domestic wastewater treatment plants or reintroduction back to groundwater.","In addition to pink water treatment, other applications include systems for: demilitarization wastewater treatment, red water treatment for TNT manufacturing, bioremediation of ground water contaminated with TNT and RDX, and treatment of other biologically recalcitrant pollutants, e.g., chlorinated solvents.","Although specific functions for this system and method have been described, other functions using the described system and method are not excluded from falling within the ambit of the claims herein.","The abstract is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract, which will allow a searcher to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure of any patent issued from this disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. 37 CFR \u00a71.72(b).
