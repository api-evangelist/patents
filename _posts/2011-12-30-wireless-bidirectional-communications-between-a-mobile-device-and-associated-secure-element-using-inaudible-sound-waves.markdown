All of the above-referenced patent applications are incorporated by reference herein.","The disclosed embodiments relate generally to wireless communications for a mobile device, and more particularly, to wireless communications between a mobile device and an associated secure element using sound waves.","A secure element can be physically coupled to a mobile communication device to allow for transactions with remote terminals such as point-of-sale and point-of-entry terminals. Implementing wireless communications between the mobile communication device and the secure element, however, presents challenges. For example, it is desirable to transmit data between the mobile communication device and the secure element in a manner that allows for easy receipt of the data especially in cases where a wireless carrier network or WIFI connection is not available. Also, a method of communication between the mobile communication device and the secure element should allow for convenient activation of the secure element and remote deactivation of the secure element.","Disclosed embodiments allow a mobile communication device to communicate wirelessly with a secure element that is physically coupled to the mobile communication device. Communications from the mobile communication device to the secure element use a different protocol than communications from the secure element to the mobile communication device.","In some embodiments, a system includes a mobile communication device and a secure element physically coupled to the mobile communication device. The mobile communication device includes a first wireless transceiver, first processor, first memory, first microphone, first speaker, first audio to digital converter (ADC), and first battery. The secure element includes a second wireless transceiver, second processor, second memory, second microphone, second speaker, a second audio to digital converter (ADC), a second digital to audio converter (DAC), and second battery. The mobile communication device is configured to wirelessly transmit data via the first speaker the second microphone in the secure element using inaudible sound waves The secure element is configured to wirelessly transmit data via the second wireless speaker to the microphone in the mobile communication device also using inaudible sound waves","In some embodiments, a method of communicating between a mobile communication device and a secure element physically coupled to the mobile communication device is performed. The mobile communication device includes a first microphone, first wireless transceiver, first processor, and first memory, and the secure element includes a second wireless transceiver, second processor, and second memory. The method includes wirelessly transmitting data between the first microphone\/speaker in the mobile communication device to the secure element via the second microphone\/speaker using inaudible sound waves.","Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present inventions. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present inventions may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","110","120","120","110","120","110","110","120","110","124","110","125"]},"A secure element  is physically coupled to the mobile communication device . In some embodiments, the secure element  is externally attached to the mobile communication device . For example, the secure element  is adhesively affixed or mechanically secured to the housing of the mobile communication device . Alternatively, the secure element  is housed within the mobile communication device . The secure element  includes an antenna  for wireless communication. While the antenna  is shown as extending from the secure element  for visual clarity, the antenna  may be implemented internally within the secure element . Also, the secure element  may include more than one antenna . Communication occurs wirelessly between the secure element  and the mobile communication device  via respective antennas  and , over a direct wireless channel  between the mobile communication device  and the secure element . Thus, in some embodiments, the channel  does not pass through a network.","The secure element  also can communicate wirelessly with different point-of-sale (POS) or point-of-entry (POE) terminals - to -N via the antenna . In some embodiments, a POS terminal  receives a transaction request signal from the secure element  and transmits the transaction request signal to a transaction server  over a network . Alternatively, a POE terminal  receives an entry request signal from the secure element  and transmits the entry request signal to the transaction server  over the network . The network  is any suitable wired and\/or wireless network and may include, for example, a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), the Internet, a metropolitan area network (MAN), or any combination of these or similar networks. The transaction server  verifies the request and forwards a verification signal to the management server  via the network . The management server  identifies the user corresponding to the verification signal and provides a response signal back to the mobile communication device , which the mobile communication device  receives via the antenna . The response signal thus is communicated back to the mobile communication device  using a communication channel that is different from the communication channel used to initiate the transaction. Alternatively, the response signal is communicated back to the mobile communication device  using communication channels from the management server  to the secure element  through the network  and POS terminal , and then from the secure element  to the mobile communication device  via the antennas  and .","In the example of an entry request signal received at a POE terminal , the entry request is verified by the POE terminal  or the transaction server , upon which the POE terminal  admits the user of the mobile communication device  to the corresponding venue or facility.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","123","122","124","125","126","122","120","1","120","123","129","120","2","120","122"]},"The processor  has the capability to perform not only the radio communication services necessary to allow for phone and data communications (e.g., via the transceivers  and\/or ), but also to execute various application programs (e.g., applications , ) that are stored in the memory . These application programs can receive inputs from the user via the display  and\/or keypad . In some embodiments, application programs stored in the memory  and run on the processor  are, for example, iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, BREW, J2ME, or other mobile applications and can encompass a broad array of application types. Examples of these applications include wallet e-commerce applications  (), games  (), enterprise applications  (), and multimedia applications  (). E-commerce applications can include ticketing applications; content, item and service purchase applications; and\/or payment management applications. One example of an e-commerce application that runs on the processor  and is stored in the memory  is an event application that provides event information and ticketing (e.g., for movies, concerts, sports, airplanes, busses, trains, etc). In some implementations, the processor  recognizes secure communications (e.g., as received via the transceiver  and\/or ) and transmits data from the secure communications to the secure element  for storage therein. The processor  also processes data received from the secure element . These applications can be preinstalled on the mobile communications device or downloaded from the remote server to the mobile communications device using conventional wireless communications. Alternatively, these applications can be pre-installed on the secure element or downloaded from the remote server to the secure element. The secure element can then transfer these applications to the mobile communication device. Stated another way, if it's not possible to download the applications directly to the mobile device due to restrictions by wireless carriers and\/or technical difficulties, they can be installed from the secure element where the applications are already pre-installed or the applications may downloaded from the remote transaction server  or management server .","An NFC enabled device is one that includes a secure element and enables contactless transactions which have been described in more detail in previous patents including U.S. patent application Ser.

The one or more additional transceivers  are adapted to communicate wirelessly with the mobile communication device  (e.g., via the transceiver  and\/or  () in the mobile communication device ).","In some embodiments, the secure element includes a second microphone (), a second speaker (), a second analog to digital converter (), a second digital to analog converter (), and a second battery as shown in . These components are adapted to communicate wirelessly with the mobile communication device  (e.g., via the microphone  and\/or speaker  () in the mobile communication device ).","The memory  stores one or more applications, including one or more e-commerce applications (e.g., applications , ), to be executed by the processor . Associated with respective e-commerce applications are respective application programming interfaces (APIs) for interacting with corresponding applications run on the processor  in the mobile communication device  () and with POS or POE terminals  (). Examples of such interactions are provided below with respect to . It should be important to note that the applications API's  that interact with the POS and POE are different than the application API's  that interact with the mobile communication device or remote servers. The application API's  that interact with the POS and POE are designed to respond to a near field communication induction signal. The application API's  are executed in response to the near field communication signal from a remote POS and\/or POE.","In some embodiments, the secure element , while physically coupled to the mobile communication device , is not electrically coupled to the device  and does not receive power from the device . Instead, for example, the secure element receives RF power from a remote terminal (e.g., a POS or POE terminal ) resulting from induction when in proximity to the remote terminal and uses this power to operate the processor , memory , and transceivers  and . In this scenario, the secure element can be embedded in the cell phone case which is affixed to the mobile communication device  and still not be electrically coupled to the mobile communication device.","In some embodiments, the secure element  is electronically coupled to the mobile communication devices and receives its power indirectly from the battery  within the mobile communication device. This is accomplished when the mobile wallet application which resides on the mobile communication sends an audio signal and thereby creating an electronic current over the cable  connected to the secure element which triggers induction and activates the secure element . In this scenario, if the secure element embedded in the cell phone case it can also be electrically coupled to the mobile communication device  through the analog cable  connecting the secure element to the mobile communication device analog port , for example. The secure element  can also be electrically coupled though the data port of the mobile communication device.","In the absence of another power source, the secure element thus communicates with the mobile communication device  only when receiving power from a remote terminal. In some embodiments, a secure element includes the components of the secure element and also includes a battery , as shown in . The battery can be charged using conventional methods such as an AC charger, solar charger, etc. Alternatively, the battery  is charged inductively (e.g., using a power harvester such as the power mat), which allows the battery  to be encased within the housing or body of the secure element . In some embodiments, the battery  is surrounded by or encased in RF shielding to prevent interference between the battery  and the transceiver  or transceiver , in the secure element . In other embodiments the antennae is encased in RF shielding. In an alternative embodiment a thin RF shield is placed between the battery  and the transceiver  or transceiver  to prevent interference. The secure element also may include one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs)  to indicate a charge status of the battery .","In other embodiments, a secure element includes the components of the secure element and also includes power harvesting circuitry , as shown in . The power harvesting circuitry  harvests power from ambient radio-frequency (RF) signals from the mobile device battery or external sources around the mobile device and uses the harvested power to power the battery  other components of the secure element . The power harvesting circuitry  can also harvest power generated during the near field communication interaction between the secure element and a remote POS or POE device. Thus, every time a user uses their NFC enabled mobile device with associated secure element for a NFC transaction, the power harvester utilizes the power to recharge the battery inside the secure element. In some embodiments, a secure element  includes both a battery  and power harvesting circuitry ; the power harvesting circuitry  is used to recharge the battery. In , the power bussing between the battery  () or power harvesting circuitry  () and other components is not shown, for visual clarity.","In some embodiments, the components of the secure element are implemented on a single integrated circuit (IC); this single integrated circuit is sometimes referred to as a smart chip. The smart chip and any other components (e.g., the battery , , or power harvesting circuitry , ) of the secure element  are encased within a card, referred to as a smart card, that serves as a housing of the secure element . In some embodiments, the smart card is adhesively affixed to the mobile communication device  and is referred to as a sticker.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 1","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3A"],"b":["130","130","130","110","130","130","130","702","130","702","150","110","134","136"],"i":["d","d ","d ","d ","d ","a "]},"In some embodiments, the transceivers  and\/or  in the smart chip  are low-power RF transceivers. Their low power output makes them susceptible to RF interference from neighboring devices, such as the mobile communication device  to which the smart card is attached. Thus, in some implementations, the smart card includes an RF shield to insulate the smart chip  from external interference. In one implementation, a lining of the smart chip  is composed of an RF absorbent material. In general, each phone has different levels of interference, and a material, size and thickness of the RF lining can determine an effectiveness of the RF shield. Alternatively, instead of incorporating an RF shield within the smart card , an RF shield can be placed between the smart card and the mobile communication device .","Given the abuse a mobile communication device  can take, smart cards that are attached externally to a mobile communication device are designed to withstand some abuse. In some embodiments, the smart card includes a ruggedized shell  that encases the smart chip . In some implementations, the shell  is formed of a composite plastic or polymer. The shell  can be hard (and substantially inflexible) or soft (and pliable). In some implementations, the shell  includes a protective membrane for the smart chip  which prevents damage to internal circuitry of the smart chip , a surface to adhere to an RF lining and\/or the mobile communication device  with appropriate adhesive, and a surface that faces outward when the smart card is attached to the mobile communication device , on which to print branding and advertising. Types of adhesives that can be used to affix the smart card to the mobile communication device  include, for example, paper glue, super glue, adhesive polymers, and the like. In one implementation, the shell  has a maximum width (or diameter) of 25 mm, and has a maximum thickness (or depth) of 5 mm.","In some embodiments the shell can include a small screen  to show images stored in the secure element memory . The screen  is depicted in FIG. CC. It is mounted to a controller board and displays images that are stored in the secure element memory . The mini screen  may be based on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). LCD can be a passive monochrome display such as a Super-Twisted Nematic display (STN), a passive color Super-Twisted Nematic display (CSTN), or an active color Twisted Nematic (TN). The LCD's vary in terms of power consumption, image quality, and response time. For example, while an STN requires less power than the TN, it has lower image quality and slower response time.","In a preferred embodiment, the screen  is based on a an Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) which converts electricity to light. It does not require power when its inactive which makes it great for the secure element when it's not in use. Therefore, the screen  may not display any image when the secure element is not in use or in passive mode. Also, when it does use power, it uses power more efficiently than LCD. In fact, an OLED may only utilize 60-80% of the power of an LCD.","The images can be preinstalled in the memory, downloaded directly to the secure element  from a remote server, or downloaded to the mobile device and then transferred to the secure element memory . The images can be one or more logos representing financial institutions (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Bank Of America, Citbank, etc) that have payment credentials stored in the secure element. Thus, the images serve as a branding opportunity for financial institutions. The images can change automatically based on which payment credential is active at any given time. For example, if the user elects to use their American Express card, the image will change automatically to be the American Express logo. The image will change if the user elects to use a different payment method. The user uses the mobile wallet to select which payment card they want to use. Upon doing so, using techniques described in previous patents referenced herein, the mobile wallet sends a notification to the secure element controller which executes the appropriate secure element application to change the status of the appropriate secure element payment application to active as well as changes the status of the corresponding image to active","The images can be treated as advertisements and so the advertiser who pays for placement for a given time period will be able to display the image of their choice. Advertisers can bid on placement of images on the secure element screen . The highest bidder will be able to display the image of their choice on the screen .","Images can be displayed based on the users geographic location utilizing the GPS function built into the mobile communication device, prior shopping history, gender, interests, and other attributes as previously described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/944,267, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Delivering Information to a mobile communication device based on consumer transactions\u201d, filed Nov. 21, 2007.","Users may elect to display a generic image that has no branding, Alternative, they may elect to display an image of their favorite sports team, celebrity, alumni, children, etc. The mobile wallet enables a user to select which image they want to display on the screen . The user can also purchase an image from a remote server and download it to the mobile device which then transfers it to the secure element memory for display on the screen . In some cases the image can be downloaded directly to the secure element  from a remote server or the user can receive an image from another user who has an NFC enabled device through a peer-to-peer transfer using NFC as described in previous patent applications referenced herein. If a user does not select an image and there are no advertisements, the secure element displays a default image on the screen . If the secure element is embedded in a cell phone case, the image is displayed through the case if the cell phone case is clear or through a window\/opening in the cell phone case.","The screen  may show 1 or more images and size them appropriately. For example, if there is only 1 image, the secure element will automatically display the image in the center of the screen. In another example if there are 2 images, the secure element will display the images in the center of the screen such that they are positioned side by side next to each other or stacked vertically on top of each other. The API in the secure element will determine how to dynamically rotate the image, \/resize them to fit the screen, and placement location on the screen.","In some embodiments, instead of being externally attached to the mobile communication device , a secure element  is physically coupled to the mobile communication device  by being disposed internally within a body of the mobile communication device . For example, as shown in  in accordance with some embodiments, the mobile communication device  includes a slot  into which a secure element is inserted. The secure element is an example of a secure element , , or (). Even though the secure element is physically housed within the slot , the secure element and the mobile communication device  still communicate wirelessly with each other. Accordingly, in some implementations the slot  only provides for physical insertion and mechanical connection of the secure element to the body of the mobile communication device , and does not electrically couple the secure element to the mobile communication device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 3F","b":["130","132","133","134","135","137","139","141","144","146","148","148","134","133","132"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 3G","FIG. 3G","FIG. 3G","FIG. 3H","FIG. 3H"],"b":["138","138"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3I"},"Attention is now directed to methods of communication between various elements of the system  (), including the mobile communication device  and the secure element . Data is transmitted between the mobile communication device  and the secure element  using inaudible sound waves in one of several ways.","In a first embodiment, the secure element includes a miniature speaker and microphone. For example, the speaker may be is about 0.476 centimeters or wide enough such that when the sound waves travel through the speaker opening, they bend or diffract spreading out at least 2\u00bd inches which will enable the sound waves to reach the microphone in the mobile communication device. The speaker in the mobile communication device may also be the same width and benefit from diffraction to such that the sound waves that traverse through its opening can spread to the microphone in the secure element. During transmission, the signal is diffused or bent in radial circumference that is ratio of the wavelength (lambda or \u03bb) and the width of the speaker in the secure element as shown in . The wavelength is the ratio of the velocity of the transmission and the frequency of the transmission. For example, since the velocity of sound through air is 340 m\/s and the inaudible sound wave is 10 Mhz, the wavelength is 0.034 meters or 3.4 centimeters. Diffraction is wavelength or 3.4 centimeters divided by the width of the speaker opening which is designed to be 0.476 CM. So, diffraction is approximately 7.14 centimeters or almost 4 inches which is sufficient distance to transmit the inaudible sound wave between the mobile communication device  and the secure element .","In another embodiment as shown in , inaudible sound waves can be reflected off a flat surface and directed to another surface. So, for example if a mobile device is housed inside a case  or the mobile device case  is affixed to a mobile device, the mobile device case may include a flat reflector  located at the bottom of the case . When the inaudible sound wave is transmitted from the microphone  in the mobile device , it is reflected off the reflector  so that it is directed at the speaker  located in the secure element . The reverse process is true as well. An inaudible sound wave leaving the microphone  in the secure element  can be reflected off the reflector  such that it is directed towards the speaker  located in the mobile communication device . The angle of impendence of the inaudible sound wave is equal to the angle in which the sound wave leaves the origination.

The appropriate parameters for calculating the angle of incidence and the index of refraction may be preinstalled in the secure element or downloaded to the secure element or the mobile communication device","Examples of messages transmitted in the operation  include the messages transmitted in the operations  (),  (),  (), and  ().","In some embodiments, the message confirms () that the secure element received the sound wave","In some embodiments, prior to the operation , the secure element  An API in the secure element  creates a message with security code as first 40 bits. The ecommerce data is appended to the security code. Security code is a 10 digit number that is indexed based on transaction number. The secure element for example may be preloaded with 100 unique security codes for the first 100 transactions. After the initial set of security codes are used, the management server  will download more to the mobile device  which will in turn transfer them to the secure element.","If the mobile wallet application on the mobile device  is already open, the wallet will turn on the microphone inside the mobile communication device. The microphone in the mobile communication device receives the analog sound wave from the secure element. The ADC  converts the analog signal to digital. The digital message is stored in memory and decrypted. The API in the device  extracts the first 80 bits from the message which is the security code and compares the transmitted code with the expected code value using the transaction number as the index of the code. Alternatively, the secure element can be unlocked remotely by the remote server or the remote server downloads the secure element key to the mobile device which then unlocks it per methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/184,209, entitled \u201cMethod and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices\u201d filed on Jul. 15, 2011.","If the message is authentic, API formulates and encrypts a message to the Secure element  that the message has been received and is authentic. The DAC converts the message from digital to analog at 10 Mhz using sigma-delta and transmits it to the secure element . The API then performs any necessary action on the ecommerce data such as deleting relevant commerce data (e.g. deletes ticket or coupon if ticket or coupon was transferred to the device ). API in the secure element  checks the available memory capacity. If the memory capacity is less than 50%, the API will delete other ecommerce data with status equal to redeemed, expired. The API will check the number of security codes. If the number of security codes is less than 50%, API formulates a message indicating this to send to the management server  and to request more codes. The ADC  converts digital message to sound at 10 Mhz using sigma-delta, and transmits it to the device . An API in the secure element creates a message confirming performance of these tasks and transmits this message to the device . After receiving an acknowledgement back from the device , the API then sets the switch to the internal battery  to \u201csleep mode\u201d so as to minimize interference between the internal battery  and battery associated with a POS\/POE during inductions","In some embodiments, rather than using static codes, a dynamic code is used to verify the authenticity of the message. The secure element or mobile communication device  generates a Dynamic Verification Code (DVC) according to an algorithm as previously described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/213,840, entitled, \u201cTransferring Data Between NFC Enabled Mobile Devices With Multiple Secure Elements\u201d filed on Aug. 19, 2011. After the user holds the NFC enabled device near the POS, the POS powers the Secure Element Controller  which triggers the designated application (e.g. \u201ctransfer songs\u201d, transfer EMR\u201d) which is determined by the application ID associated with the feature. To reiterate, the application API  that is triggered by induction is stored in the secure element of the users NFC enabled mobile device. The Secure Element controller  application API transfers the user ID to the POS. The POS transfers a value to the Secure Element Controller. If the POS is capable of \u201cwriting\u201d back to NFC enabled devices and secure elements. The Secure Element Controller application API calculates a Dynamic Verification Code (DVC) according to a verification algorithm stored in the secure element and transmits the DVC, UserID, POS value, date, time and any other transaction data according to the DVC algorithm to the POS. To reiterate, the NFC application API's  stored in the secure element is different than an application that may reside on a mobile device. The NFC application API's  stored in the secure element is designed to activate when the secure element is held in proximity to another NFC enabled device.","The POS transfers the DVC, UserID, POS value, date, time and any other transaction data according to the DVC to a remote server The remote server uses the transaction data it receives from the POS to calculate the DVC according to the same verification algorithm. The UserID is an alphanumeric value such as a social media ID or a numeric value such as a cell phone number or an account number. The remote server uses the UserID to lookup the secure element ID stored at the remote server. The DVC is computed according to the same algorithm stored in the secure element. It uses the value from the POS if provided, the unique ID in the secure element such as the secure element ID, the current date, and time. The algorithm, for example, computes the largest integer resulting from multiplying the secure element ID by the value received from the POS. Then, dividing the result by the concatenation of the current date and military time. For example, if the secure element ID is 12,345,678 and the value provided by the POS is 10,000, then the multiplication of these values results in 123,456,780,000. If the current date is Aug. 19, 2011 and time is 1:00 PM, then the concatenation of the date and military time is 81,920,221,300. 24. The result of dividing 123,456,780,000 by 81,920,221,300 is equal to 1.5. When rounded up to the largest integer, the DVC value is 2. If the POS is not able to \u201cwrite\u201d a value back to the secure element, then the secure element utilizes a default POS value that is pre-configured in the secure element and is also utilized by the remote server.","The remote server uses the User ID to lookup secure element ID stored in a database at the remote server. Then, the remote server computes the DVC using the secure element ID and the date and time stamp, POS value. If the DVC that it calculates is the same as the DVC that it received, then authentication is successful. At any given time, the remote server can download a new algorithm to the secure element or to the mobile device which transfers it to the secure element. In this way, if an algorithm is compromised, it can be replaced by a new one.","If dynamic Verification Codes are used, additional static codes are not downloaded to the mobile communication device nor the secure element.","If the message is not authentic, the API in the device  creates a message with the mobile device 10 digit number or wallet ID, transaction number, date, time, and transmits it to the management server using WIFI or the carrier network. The API also displays a message to the user to contact the help desk and\/or customer care center associated with the service provider.","If the wallet API in the device  is not activated or open, the user will have to open it. Once the user selects an action to perform (e.g. view account balance and receipt data), the wallet API in the device  will turn on the microphone  and speaker . The wallet API in the device will formulate a request for the appropriate action (e.g. get data for the selected account) and send the request using diffracted sound waves from its speaker  to the microphone  in the secure element which had been turned on during the induction process of holding the secure element  in proximity to the POS\/POE associated with the purchase. The API in the secure element  will formulate the message with the ecommerce data, convert it to sound waves using ADC , encrypt it, and transmit it through the speaker  using diffraction to the microphone  in the device .","Alternatively, the inaudible sound wave can be reflected off a reflector located on a computer monitor, keyboard, laptop, ebook, or even business card. In this scenario, the user points the mobile communication device at the reflector in the same way they would point a remote control at a television.","Instead of using sound waves, the preceding embodiments can also utilize light waves to transmit the data between the mobile communication device  and the secure element . The angle of refraction is a function of the angle of incidence and the index of refraction for the material associated with the reflector in accordance with Snells law. For example, the index of refraction for plexi glass is 1.5. The appropriate parameters for calculating the angle of incidence and the index of refraction may be preinstalled in the secure element or downloaded to the secure element or the mobile communication device","If the wallet API on the device  has not received the request in the time it takes for sound to travel through air (i.e. 340 meters per second), the wallet API in the MCD  will send another request to the secure element . If the requests and data transmission are successful, an API in the secure element  will turn off the microphone  inside the secure element.","If the secure element  does not receive acknowledgment of its original message, it will resend the request a predetermined number of times. If it does not receive an acknowledgment, the secure element  creates a message with the secure element serial number, date, time, error message, etc), stores the message until it can be transmitted to the device  which sends a copy to the management server .","In some embodiments, the message provides transaction data (e.g., as in the operation , ). The transaction data are associated with an e-commerce or other transaction. For example, the message provides a receipt from an e-commerce transaction; the receipt includes, for example, a transaction number, transaction amount, transaction date, transaction time, merchant ID, merchant name, product id, product name, location of transaction\/merchant, and\/or cashier ID. In another example, the message provides an indication of redemption of an electronic coupon. Other examples of transaction data include date, time, amount, and identifier of other secure element from a peer-to-peer funds transfer resulting from holding 2 secure elements in close proximity; a virtual hotel key if the customer checks into a hotel; date, time, and GPS locations associated with unlocking the door of a vehicle, office, home, apartment, or other building; date, time, and GPS location of receiving a coupon from a smart poster or merchant as well as coupon details; date, time, location, physician name, and key information from a doctor visit, medical exam, medical tests, hospital visit; date, time, GPS location of ATM machine, amount of withdrawal; are described with respect to operations - in the method  ().","The mobile communication device  receives the message via the first transceiver (e.g., transceiver , ), or alternatively via another transceiver distinct from the first transceiver (e.g., transceiver , ). In some embodiments, the device  receives messages from a cellular service provider (e.g., forward by the cellular service provider but initially transmitted by another party) at a first port, and receives the message from the secure element  at a second port distinct from the first port.","In some embodiments, the secure element  receives power from a remote terminal (e.g., a POS or POE terminal , ). For example, the secure element  receives power via RF signals transmitted by the remote terminal. The wireless transmission of the message in operation  is performed using the power received from the remote terminal when the secure element  is in proximity to the remote terminal. In other embodiments, the secure element  harvests power from ambient RF signals from the mobile communication device, neighboring electrical devices, or during NFC induction (e.g., using power harvesting circuitry , ). The wireless transmission of the message in operation  is performed using the harvested power. In still other embodiments, the secure element  includes a battery (e.g., a battery , ), and the wireless transmission of the message in operation  is performed using power from the battery. For example, the secure element  determines whether power is available from a nearby remote terminal. If power is not available from the nearby terminal, the message is wirelessly transmitted using power from the battery.","The method  thus allows for wireless bi-directional communication between a mobile communication device  and associated secure element  using an in audible sound wave in both directions. While the method  includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order, it should be apparent that the method  can include more or fewer operations, which can be executed serially or in parallel. An order of two or more operations may be changed and two or more operations may be combined into a single operation. For example, the order of the operations  and  may be reversed.","In another embodiment, if the mobile communication device is an older feature phone with limited capabilities including limited memory, limited storage, and limited processing, it may not be able to store and run a rich mobile wallet application necessary to enable the transfer of information between the mobile device and the secure element. So, ringtones which are prevalent in almost all mobile communication devices are used to facilitate the transfer of data between the mobile communication device and the secure element. The commands to transfer the inaudible signals between the mobile communication device and the secure element are stored in the ringtones. Not only do the ringtones store the commands, but they are used as the vehicle to transmit the inaudible signals. Stated another way, if the mobile communication device does not have enough memory to store a rich mobile wallet application or software API's to transfer data, then ringtones are leveraged to do so. Some of the commands that are embedded in ringtones enable the user to add a new payment method, delete a payment method, update their billing information for a payment method, change information for a specific card such as expiration date, deactivate a card, and make one of their many payment methods\/cards\/accounts the active account for a specific purchase.","In this case, a light weight or thin mobile wallet client may be installed on the older legacy mobile communication device  as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 8,019,365 entitled \u201cConducting A Payment Using A Secure Element And SMS\u201d granted on Sep. 13, 2011 and U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 11\/933,337, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Transmitting Data Between A Server And A Mobile Communication Device Using Short Message Service (SMS)\u201d filed on Oct. 31, 2007","During the set up process the user sends a text message to the mobile wallet provider shortcode to register for the mobile wallet lite application. In response to this, the older legacy mobile communication device  will receive a text message with a hyperlink which enables the user to download the mobile wallet lite application from the remote server.","The user can register the mobile wallet lite application after they download it. Upon doing so, the user can set up their payment methods in the mobile wallet lite application. Upon doing so, the mobile wallet lite application creates a ringtone for that function utilizing the ringtone composer already pre-installed on the older legacy mobile communication device . After creating the ringtone, the user is prompted to save the ringtone and to give it a nick name such as \u201cVisa1\u201d which will enable the user to use their Visa1 card for a particular purchase. Afterwards, the user can activate the ringtone. If the older legacy mobile communication device  enables the user to save and activate the ringtone in one step, then this saves the user time and is more convenient.","As an alternative to setting up payment methods (i.e. credit cards, checking account, savings accounts) and\/or downloading a thin mobile wallet client using an older legacy mobile communication device , the user may set up their payment accounts on a website located at the management server . This may be necessary if the older legacy mobile communication device  doesn't\u2019 have enough memory to run a client application and\/or the user does not prefer to set up their payment accounts on an older legacy mobile communication device  which may require triple tapping a 16 digit credit card number which is time consuming and prone to error. Upon doing so, the user may receive one or more text messages which have links to download ringtones that have commands embedded in them to transfer data between the mobile device and the secure element using inaudible tones.","Users can also download pre-scripted or canned ringtones for certain standard functions such as retrieving the current receipts from the secure element after a contactless payment and displaying the receipt on the mobile communication device.","In addition to there being different ringtones for different commands (e.g. activate a card, delete a card, add a card, change billing address, get receipts, etc) the user will have a different ringtone for each card or account. For example, \u201cAmex1\u201d will be ringtone for American Express card, Visa1\u201d will be ringtone one for their Visa Card, \u201cDiscover1\u201d will be the ringtone for their first Discover card. The mobile communication device will transfer the ringtones to the secure element and a copy to the management server for back up. If the secure element  is locked prior to transmission, it is first unlocked remotely by the remote server or the remote server downloads the secure element key to the mobile device which then unlocks it per methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/184,209, entitled \u201cMethod and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices\u201d filed on Jul. 15, 2011.","When the user wants to make one of their accounts stored in the secure element active, the user will open the mobile wallet lite on the mobile communication device and select the account. The mobile wallet will execute or play the appropriate ringtone (e.g. \u201cVisa1\u201d). Upon doing so, the mobile communication device plays the appropriate inaudible ringtone. The microphone in the secure element  listens for the ringtone, converts it to digital, transmits it to the secure element processor for processing. If the secure element  is locked prior to transmission, it is first unlocked remotely by the remote server or the remote server downloads the secure element key to the mobile device which then unlocks it per methods described in U.S. patent application Ser.

Stated another way, instead of the management or remote server downloading the ringtone to the mobile communication device or sending an SMW with a link to download the ringtone, the mobile wallet creates the ringtone for the command using the ringtone compose feature favailable in the mobile communication device. The mobile wallet will select the frequency and temp (i.e. beats per minute) that renders the ringtone inaudible, save the ringtone, and transmit a copy to the management server for backup.","In order to transfer data from the secure element  to the mobile communication device , the secure element transfers an inaudible signal from the speaker  in the secure element to the microphone  in the mobile communication device. For example, after a contactless payment, the POS may write a receipt to the secure element. The secure element converts the receipt from digital to analog using the DAC . The mobile wallet lite application converts the signal from audio to digital using DAC , displays the receipt in the mobile wallet lite application. If storage is a problem, the mobile wallet light application may also prompt the user to delete older receipts or other messages to free up space\/memory on the mobile device.","As an alternative, the secure element creates a ringtone from the receipt or other transaction data stored in the secure element, converts it to an inaudible analog signal, and transmit it to them bole communication device. The mobile wallet converts it to digital and displays it to the user.
