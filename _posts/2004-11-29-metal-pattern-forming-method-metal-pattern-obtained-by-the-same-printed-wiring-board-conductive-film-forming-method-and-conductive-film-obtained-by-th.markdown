In particular, the present invention relates to a method of forming a metal pattern useful as a metal wiring board, a printed wiring board and the like, a metal pattern obtained by using the method, a printed wiring board, a method of forming a conductive film, and a conductive film obtained by using the method.","Three major conventional metal pattern forming methods known in the art are \u201csubtractive method\u201d, \u201csemi-additive method\u201d, and \u201cfully-additive method\u201d.","The subtractive method includes steps of forming a photosensitive layer sensitive to activated light irradiation over a metal layer formed on a substrate, exposing the photosensitive layer imagewisely, forming a resist image by developing, forming a metal pattern by etching the metal, and finally removing the resist. The substrate interface of the metal substrate used by this method has often been roughened to provide an anchoring effect for improvement in the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer. As a result, the substrate interface of the metal pattern formed became rough, often causing a problem of deterioration in high frequency characteristics when the product is used for electric wiring. In addition, it also carried the problem of requiring a complicated step of treating the substrate with a strong acid such as chromic acid or the like, as surface roughening of the substrate is required before forming the metal substrate.","To overcome these problems, for example, a method of providing a certain degree of adhesiveness by subjecting the substrate surface to a surface grafting treatment and thus simplifying the processing steps of substrate and a method of modifying the substrate surface by grafting a radical polymerizable compound thereon, thus minimizing the roughness of the substrate and accordingly simplifying the substrate processing step were proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 58-196238, and Advanced Materials 20, pp. 1481-1494, 2000. However, an expensive apparatus such as a \u03b3-ray generating apparatus and an electron beam generating apparatus is necessary. Further, it is predictable that a polymerization initiating group which causes graft polymerization is not introduced into the substrate, resulting in small amount of a graft polymer to be formed.","Accordingly, even if a metal substrate prepared by this method is patterned by the subtractive method, the product still contained a problem inherent to the subtractive method as follows. For forming a metal pattern having a thinner line width by the subtractive method, so-called over-etching method, whereby the line width of a resist pattern becomes thinner after etching, is effective. However, when a fine metal pattern is directly formed by the over-etching method, it was difficult to form a metal pattern having a line width of 30 \u03bcm or less from the practical viewpoint of forming a favorable fine metal pattern, due to the defects of the wire formed such as bleeding, thinning, disconnection, and the like. In addition, it also carried the problems in cost and environmental friendliness, as it demanded removal of the metal film present in the area other than the patterned area, and it also required a significant cost for processing the metal wastewater from the etching treatment.","To overcome these problems, a new metal pattern forming method, called semi-additive method, was proposed. The semi-additive method is a method including following steps. That is, a thin metal underlayer of Cr or the like is formed on a substrate by plating or the like, and then a resist pattern is formed on the metal underlayer. A wiring pattern is produced by forming metal layer of Cu or the like on the region of the metal underlayer other than the resist patterned area by plating and then removing the resist pattern. A metal pattern is subsequently formed on the region other than the resist patterned area by etching the metal underlayer while masking the wiring pattern. The method allows easier formation of a thin line pattern having a line width of 30 \u03bcm or less, as it is an etching-less process; and it is also advantageous in cost, as the metal is deposited only on the area required. However, the method demands roughening of substrate surface for improvement in the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal pattern, and as a result, the substrate interface of the metal pattern formed became rough, causing a problem of deterioration in the high frequency characteristics of product when it is used for electric wiring.","Alternatively, a metal pattern forming method called fully-additive method was also proposed. The fully-additive method is a method of forming a resist pattern on a substrate by depositing a metal on the region other than the resist pattern by plating and then removing the resist pattern. The fully-additive method allows easier formation of a thin line pattern having a line width of 30 \u03bcm or less as it is an etching-less process; and it also made the substrate interface rough in a similar manner to the semi-additive method, causing a problem of deterioration in the high frequency characteristics of product when it is used for electric wiring.","As described above, a metal pattern forming method allowing formation of a thin line pattern, having smaller substrate interface roughness, and producing a smaller amount of etching wastewater is yet to be proposed, and there existed a need for a new metal pattern forming method","The metal pattern described above is useful as a wiring (conductive film) for a printed wiring board for a semiconductor device. In recent year, for electronics, there has been a high demand for processing mass storage data at high processing rate. Internal clock frequencies or external clock frequencies in a semiconductor device for processing images or controlling processing increase year by year, and the number of connecting pins also increases. In order to carry out high-speed conduction, it is important to reduce delay and damping of signals. In order to reduce propagation delay of signals, it is effective to decrease dielectric constant. In order to reduce dielectric loss, it is effective to decrease dielectric constant and dielectric tangent, respectively. However, since dielectric constant in dielectric loss is the root of dielectric constant, in actuality, dielectric tangent is largely concerned with this. For this reason, from a viewpoint of material characteristics, it is advantageous to adopt insulating materials having low dielectric tangent characteristics for carrying out high speed data processing.","Further, surface smoothing of conductive materials substantially contributes to forming materials with high density. In a conventional built-up printed wiring board, roughening treatment has been employed for obtaining stripping strength. However, status quo, roughness of several microns interferes finer wiring.","Accordingly, from a viewpoint of forming a printed wiring board useful for a semiconductor device, means for forming very fine metal patterns with high adhesiveness on a smooth insulating substrate.","The first object of the invention is to provide a method of forming a metal pattern and a method of forming a conductive film that allows formation of a metal pattern or a metal layer (conductive film) superior in the adhesiveness to a substrate and having smaller roughness of the interface with the substrate.","The second object of the invention is to provide a method of forming a metal pattern that allows formation of a fine metal pattern superior in the adhesiveness between a substrate and a metal layer without need for an etching step.","The third object of the invention is to provide a metal pattern superior in high frequency characteristics, and a printed wiring board using the metal pattern as a conductive layer.","After intensive studies, the inventors have found that the objects can be achieved by effecting electroless plating on the polymer layer in which a polymer having an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is bound directly in the pattern form to the substrate.","The inventors have also found the above objects can be achieved by using a substrate having a particular polymerization initiating layer formed on the base material, forming a polymer layer where a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is chemically bonded in the pattern form directly onto the polymerization initiating layer, and effecting electroless plating on the polymer layer; or by chemically bonding a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof directly onto the entire surface of the polymerization initiating layer and effecting electroless plating on the polymer layers.","The metal pattern forming method according to the invention including the steps of (I) forming on a substrate a polymer layer in which a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is chemically bonded directly to the substrate in a pattern form, (II) adding the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof to the polymer layer, and (III) forming a metal layer in the pattern form by electroless plating.","Step (I) above may further have a step of forming a polymerization initiating layer (hereinafter, may be referred simply to as \u201cparticular polymerization initiating layer\u201d) in which a polymer having, on a side chain thereof, a crosslinking group and a functional group having polymerization initiating capability is immobilized by a crosslinking reaction on a base material, and a step of forming a polymer layer in which a polymer having a functional group that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof is chemically bonded in the pattern form directly onto the particular polymerization initiating layer.","In the step of forming the particular polymerization initiating layer in which the polymer having, on the side chain thereof, the crosslinking group and the functional group having polymerization initiating capability by the crosslinking reaction, is preferably immobilized by a crosslinking reaction using a crosslinking agent.","The crosslinking reaction using the crosslinking agent is preferably carried out at a temperature of 50\u00b0 C. or more and 300\u00b0 C. or less.","The \u201cbase material\u201d according to the invention is a material such as a polyimide film, glass-epoxy resin, epoxy resin or the like that becomes a support when a metal pattern is formed thereon.","The \u201csubstrate\u201d according to the invention is a material onto which the graft polymer described in detail below can be chemically bonded directly. For example, when an intermediate layer such as a polymerization initiating layer or the like is formed on a base material and a graft polymer is generated thereon, the substrate is a material including the base material and the intermediate layer formed thereon, and if the graft polymer is generated directly on the base material, the substrate is the base material itself.","Step (I) in the invention, i.e., a step of forming a polymer layer in which a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is chemically bonded directly onto a substrate in a pattern form, has following embodiments (1) to (3).","Embodiment (1) is an embodiment including a step (I-1-1) of forming on the substrate a polymer layer by chemically bonding a polymer which has a functional group whose structure is changed to a structure that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof or loses the interaction capability with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof, due to application heat, acid, or radiation (hereinafter, may be referred simply to as \u201cpolarity-transition group\u201d), and a step (I-1-2) of forming, in the pattern form, a polymer layer that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof, due to application of heat, acid, or radiation to the polymer layer in the pattern form.","Embodiment (2) is an embodiment including a step (I-2) of contacting a compound having a polymerizable group and a functional group that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof with the substrate, irradiating the substrate with radiation in the pattern form, chemically bonding the compound directly to the substrate, and thus forming, in the pattern form, a polymer layer that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof.","Embodiment (3) is an embodiment including a step (I-3-1) of forming on a base material a photosensitive layer containing a light to heat conversion substance and a binder, and forming a polymer layer by chemically bonding a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof directly onto the entire surface of the photosensitive layer, and a step (I-3-2) of forming, in the pattern form, a polymer layer that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof by irradiating the polymer layer with radiation in the pattern form and ablating the photosensitive layer.","In addition, the metal pattern forming method of the invention may have additionally a step (IV) of carrying out electroplating after the step (III), which allows formation of a metal pattern having a desirable film thickness. Further, the metal pattern forming method of the invention may have additionally a step of carrying out drying after the step (III) or the step (IV). This step provide an advantage that a metal pattern having any layer thickness can be formed.","The metal pattern of the invention is a metal pattern having a metal layer locally formed on a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less, and the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer is 0.2 kN\/m or more.","The metal layer in the metal pattern of the invention is preferably a metal layer formed on the substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less by forming a polymer layer in which a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is chemically bonded in a pattern form directly on the substrate, adding the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof to the polymer layer, and carrying out electroless plating on the polymer layer.","The polymer layer in the metal pattern of the invention preferably has a region in which fine particles including at least one of electroless plating catalyst particles and metal particles deposited by the electroless plating are dispersed, in a content of 25% by volume or more, and the region extending 0.1 \u03bcm or more from the interface of the polymer layer and the metal layer in a direction toward the substrate.","Additionally, the conductive film forming method according to the invention characteristically include a step (A) producing a substrate having a polymerization initiating layer in which a polymer having, on a side chain thereof, a crosslinking group and a functional group having polymerization initiating capability is immobilized by a crosslinking reaction on a base material, a step (B) generating a graft polymer by chemically bonding a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof directly onto the entire surface of the polymerization initiating layer, a step (C) adding the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof to the graft polymer, and a step (D) forming a metal layer by electroless plating.","A preferable embodiment of Step (B) above further includes a step (B-1) of generating an active site on the polymerization initiating layer by applying energy to the surface of the particular polymerization initiating layer after contacting a compound having a polymerizable group and a functional group that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof with the polymerization initiating layer; and then generating, with the active site as a base point, a graft polymer having a functional group that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof and chemically bonding directly to the surface of the polymerization initiation layer.","The conductive film forming method according to the invention may have additionally a step (D) of electroplating after step (C) above, which allows formation of a metal pattern having a desirable film thickness.","The conductive film of the invention is a conductive film using the above conductive film forming method. That is, a conductive film formed on a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or more, wherein the substrate includes a polymerization initiating layer in which a polymer having, on a side chain thereof, a crosslinking group and a functional group having polymerization initiating capability is immobilized by a crosslinking reaction on a base material, wherein the conductive film is formed on the substrate by forming on the polymerization initiating layer a polymer layer in which a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is chemically bonded directly on the particular polymerization initiating layer, adding the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof to the polymer layer, and carrying out electroless plating on the polymer layer, and wherein the polymer layer has a region having dispersed therein fine particles including at least one of electroless plating catalyst particles and metal particles deposited by the electroless plating, in a content of 25% by volume or more, and the region extending 0.1 \u03bcm or more from the interface of the polymer layer and the metal layer in a direction toward the substrate.","The metal pattern forming method according to the invention or the conductive film forming method characteristically provides a metal pattern or metal layer (conductive film) which is superior to the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer, even if the surface roughness of the substrate is small. And as a rough standard of the substrate surface smoothness, a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less is preferable. According to the method of the invention, a metal pattern favorable in adhesiveness, for example a metal pattern having an adhesiveness to substrate of 0.2 kN\/m or more, is formed on a smooth substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less.","In the invention, use of a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less allows production of a polymer layer in a pattern form having a surface roughness also of 500 nm or less. Electroless plating after addition of an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof to the pattern results in a state (composite state) where the plating catalyst and plating metal are dispersed in the pattern and further a metal plate layer is formed over the pattern. The roughness of the interface of between the metal pattern and the substrate thus formed, i.e. interface between the metal and the polymer layer (organic components), becomes slightly larger than that of the polymer pattern surface, because of the plating catalyst and plating metal penetrated into the polymer pattern, but the extent is so small that there is no significant influence on the high frequency characteristics of the products. Therefore, these metal patterns have improved high frequency characteristics when used for electric wiring. High frequency characteristics are related to the transmission loss during high-frequency electric transmission and in particular to the conductor loss.","As described above, in studying details of a polymer layer (organic components) interposed between a metal layer (metal pattern) and a substrate, the polymer layer between the substrate and the metal layer is that including a region in a thickness of 0.05 \u03bcm or more that contains, from an interface between the substrate and the metal layer toward the substrate, 25% by volume of fine particles comprising an electroless plating catalyst, and\/or, a metal deposited by electroless plating dispersed therein. It is considered that the existence of the fine particles containing therein metals or the like can form a composite state that is useful for enhancing adhesiveness of a metal layer.","Use of a substrate having a surface roughness of 100 nm or less is preferable, as a smaller substrate surface roughness leads to a smaller roughness of the substrate interface of metal pattern, which in turn leads to improvement in the high frequency characteristics of the metal pattern obtained.","In the invention, Rz defined in JIS B0601, i.e., \u201cdifference between the average of the Z data of the highest to fifth highest mountains and the average of those of the deepest to fifth deepest valleys on a particular surface\u201d, is used as a rough indicator of the surface roughness.","If the substrate according to the invention is a substrate having a particular polymerization initiating layer formed, it is considered to have the following actions. That is, in the particular polymerization initiating layer in the invention of the invention, the photopolymerization initiating group is boded to the polymer as a pendant and the polymer is hardened by a crosslinking reaction. Probably because of this, when a particular polymerization initiating layer is immersed in a monomer solution or a monomer solution is applied over the layer, in order to form a polymer layer in which the polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is chemically bonded directly in the pattern form or on the entire surface, the initiator component is not dissolved in the monomer solution, so that the polymerization reaction starts only from the substrate surface and many active sites can be generated. In contrast, photopolymerization initiating layers of commonly known surface grafting methods contain an initiator dispersed in a crosslinked binder layer, but the initiators are not firmly immobilized in the photopolymerization initiating layers and are easily dissolved into the monomer solution, causing a polymerization reaction not only on the surface but also in the monomer solution and generating homopolymers not directly bonded to the substrate surface.","As described above, the adhesiveness of metal layer according to the invention is increased, probably because radicals are generated and polymerization occurs only on the substrate surface, as a result of extremely smaller solubilization of the initiator component when a particular polymerization initiating layer is formed, suppressing the generation of the homopolymer not directly bonded to the substrate surface, eliminating incidences of exfoliation due to ablation or the like of the metal layer formed by plating.","In addition, the particular polymerization initiating layer has an advantage that there is no need for a large-scale facility, as the photopolymerization initiating group is connected to the polymer as a pendant and thus active species can be generate easily by an activated light such as UV or the like without use of an ultra-activated light such as plasma or y ray.","In the invention, a metal pattern higher in resolution than those obtained by conventional pattern-forming methods of etching by using a resist pattern can be easily obtained because the region interactive with the electroless plating or the precursor thereof formed by the methods of embodiments (1) to (3) is provided selectively with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof and subsequently is subjected to electroless plating. The method is also advantageous in that there is no etching wastewater discharged.","In the invention, a surface graft layer (graft polymer layer) is formed by subjecting the substrate to a surface-grafting treatment (described below in detail). When the surface graft layer is added with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof and subjected to electroless plating, surface graft polymer chain contained in the surface graft layer, which is formed by polymerization from the substrate interface, has a larger motility and thus is more reactive with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof. In addition, as the surface graft polymer chain has a higher motility, the electroless plating bath penetrates more easily into the layer, allowing the electroless plating to proceed on and inside the surface graft layer. As a result, the metal pattern or metal layer (conductive film) on the surface become in the hybrid state with the surface graft polymer chain directly bonded to the substrate. In the invention, modification of the substrate surface by the surface-grafting treatment in this manner seems to minimize the surface roughness of the substrate surface where the metal patterned area or the metal layer (conductive film) is formed, and a metal layer superior in adhesiveness is formed on such a smooth substrate surface probably due to the hybrid state described above.","In addition, when surface graft polymerization is carried out on the particular polymerization initiating layer, generation of homopolymer not bonded to the substrate is seemingly suppressed and the adhesiveness between the metal pattern or metal layer (conductive film) formed and the substrate is increased drastically.","When the metal pattern or the conductive film obtained by the method according to the invention is used for electric wiring, smaller interface roughness of the interface between the formed conductive area (plating catalyst, plating metal layer) and the organic material (graft polymer chain) leads to smaller electric loss during high-frequency electric transmission (transmission loss).","Hereinafter, the method of forming a metal pattern and a method of forming the conductive film (hereinafter, may be referred simply to as metal layer) according to the present invention will be described in detail.","[Method of Forming Metal Pattern]","The metal pattern forming method according to the invention comprises the steps of (I) forming on a substrate a polymer layer in which a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof is chemically bonded directly to the substrate in a pattern form, (II) adding the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof to the polymer layer, and (III) forming a metal layer in the pattern form by electroless plating.","Namely, the metal pattern forming method according to the invention comprises the steps of forming a region that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof and a region that does not interact therewith on a substrate, adding an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof to the interactive region, and then subjecting the substrate to electroless plating. In the invention, the region having a polymer that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof (i.e. polymer layer) will be referred to as \u201cgraft pattern\u201d.","Hereinafter, the steps (I) to (III) will be described in that order.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US08252364-20120828-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US08252364-20120828-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}]},"Methods of forming a graft pattern on a substrate include the following embodiments (1) to (3).","Embodiment (1) comprises a step (I-1-1) of forming on the substrate a polymer layer by chemically bonding a polymer which has a functional group whose structure is changed to a structure that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof or loses the interaction capability with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof, due to application heat, acid, or radiation, and a step (I-1-2) of forming, in the pattern form, a polymer layer that interacts with the electroless plating catalyst or precursor thereof, due to application of heat, acid, or radiation to the polymer layer in the pattern form.","Hereinafter, the \u201cfunctional group that is converted to a structure that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof or a functional group that loses the interaction by application of heat, acid, or radiation\u201d will be called a polarity-transition group.","(Surface Graft Polymerization)","The polymer layer in the step (I-1-1) is prepared by means of so-called surface graft polymerization.

As described above, the surface of base material per se may have such a property, or alternatively, an intermediate layer having such a property may be formed on the base material surface.","\u2014Substrate Surface or Intermediate Layer\u2014","The substrate surface may be an inorganic or organic layer, if the surface has a property suitable for forming the surface graft layer described above by graft synthesis. In this embodiment, the substrate surface is independent of polarity and may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic, as transition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic states is governed by a thin pattern-forming layer having the polymer compound.","In the intermediate layer, especially when the thin polymer layer of the embodiment is prepared by a photo-graft polymerization method, plasma irradiation graft polymerization method, or radiation graft polymerization method, the surface is preferably a layer having an organic surface, in particular, an organic polymer layer. Examples of the organic polymers include synthetic resins such as epoxy resins, acrylic resins, urethane resins, phenol resins, styrene resins, vinyl resins, polyester resins, polyamide resins, melamine resins, and formalin resins; and natural resins such as gelatin, casein, cellulose, and starch, but because the graft polymerization is initiated by hydrogen abstraction from the organic polymer in the photo-graft polymerization method, plasma irradiation graft polymerization method, radiation graft polymerization method, or the like, use of a polymer highly vulnerable to hydrogen abstraction, such as acrylic resin, urethane resin, styrene resin, vinyl resin, polyester resin, polyamide resin, or epoxy resin is particularly preferable from the point of productivity.","The intermediate layer may play the role as the base material described below or an intermediate layer formed on the base material as needed.","In the embodiment, to make the surface roughness of substrate 500 nm or less, it is preferably to adjust the surface roughness of the base material per se or that of an intermediate layer surface when the intermediate layer is formed on the base material surface, to 500 nm or less. To make the surface roughness of substrate 500 nm or less, it is preferably to select a resin base material superior in surface smoothness as the material and form an intermediate layer superior in thickness uniformity if such an intermediate layer is formed.","\u2014Layer Allowing Initiation of Polymerization\u2014","In embodiment (1), from the purpose of generating active site more efficiently and improving the pattern-forming sensitivity, it is preferable to form a layer allowing initiation of polymerization as an intermediate layer or a substrate surface by adding a polymerizable compound and a polymerization initiator to the base material surface as the compounds allowing initiation of polymerization by application of energy.","The layer allowing initiation of polymerization (hereinafter, concessionary referred to as polymerizable layer) can be formed by dissolving needed components into a solvent that dissolves these components, forming a layer on the surface of the base material for example by application, and hardening the layer by heating or photoirradiation.","(a) Polymerizable Compound","The polymerizable compound for use in polymerizable layer is not particularly limited, if it adheres to the substrate tightly and binds to a hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group at the terminal and\/or on the side chain contained in the upper layer by application of energy for example by irradiation of activated light, and among many such compounds, a hydrophobic polymer having a polymerizable group in the molecule is preferable.","Specific examples of the hydrophobic polymers include diene homopolymers such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polypentadiene, and homopolymers of an allyl group-containing monomer such as allyl (meth)acrylate and 2-allyloxyethyl methacrylate; two- or multi-component copolymers of styrene, a (meth)acrylic ester, (meth)acrylonitrile, and the like, containing a diene monomer such as butadiene, isoprene, and pentadiene or an allyl group-containing monomer as the constituent unit; linear polymers or three-component polymers having a carbon-carbon double bond in the molecule such as unsaturated polyester, unsaturated polyepoxide, unsaturated polyamide, unsaturated polyacryl, and high-density polyethylene; and the like.","In the specification, the group representing both or one of \u201cacryl and methacryl\u201d groups is referred to as \u201c(meth)acryl\u201d group.","The content of the polymerizable compound is preferably in the range of 0 to 100% by mass and more preferably in the range of 10 to 80% by mass with respect to the solid matters in the polymerizable layer.","(b) Polymerization Initiator","The polymerizable layer in embodiment (1) preferably contains a polymerization initiator for allowing initiation of polymerization by application of energy. The polymerization initiator used can be suitably selected from known thermal polymerization initiators, photopolymerization initiators and the like that allows initiation of polymerization by application of certain energy, for example, by irradiation of an activated light, heating, irradiation of an electron beam, or the like, according to applications. Among these polymerization initiators, use of a photopolymerization initiator is preferably from the point of productivity, as photopolymerization is higher in reaction rate (polymerization rate) than that of thermal polymerization.","The photopolymerization initiator usable in the embodiment is not particularly limited, if it can be activated by the activated light irradiated and can polymerize a polymerizable compound contained in the polymerizable layer and a hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group at the terminal or on the side chain contained in the upper layer, and, for example, a radical polymerization initiator, anion polymerization initiator, cation polymerization initiator or the like may be used.","Specific examples of the photopolymerization initiators include acetophenones such as p-tert-butyltrichloroacetophenone, 2,2\u2032-diethoxyacetophenone, and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropane-1-one; ketones such as benzophenone, 4,4\u2032-bisdimethylaminobenzophenone, 2-chlorothioxanthone, 2-methylthioxanthone, 2-ethylthioxanthone, and 2-isopropylthioxanthone; benzoin ethers such as benzoin, benzoin methylether, benzoin isopropylether, and benzoin isobutylether; benzyl ketals such as benzyldimethylketal and hydroxycyclohexylphenylketone; and the like.","The content of the polymerization initiator is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 70% by mass and more preferably in the range of 1 to 40% by mass with respect to the solid matters in the polymerization layer.","The solvent for use in application of the polymerizable compound and polymerization initiator is not particularly limited if it can dissolve these components. From the points of easiness in drying and workability, the solvent preferably does not have an excessively high boiling point, and more specifically, a solvent having a boiling point of about 40 to 150\u00b0 C. is preferable.","Specific examples thereof include acetone, methylethylketone, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, ethylene glycol monomethylether, ethylene glycol monoethylether, ethylene glycol dimethylether, propylene glycol monomethylether, propylene glycol monoethylether, acetylacetone, cyclohexanone, methanol, ethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 3-methoxypropanol, diethylene glycol monomethylether, diethylene glycol monoethylether, diethylene glycol dimethylether, diethylene glycol diethylether, propylene glycol monomethylether acetate, propylene glycol monoethylether acetate, 3-methoxypropyl acetate, and the like.","These solvents may be used alone or in combination. The concentration of solid matters in the coating solution is preferably 2 to 50% by mass.","The coating amount when a polymerizable layer is formed on a substrate is preferably 0.1 to 20 g\/mand more preferably 1 to 15 g\/mas dry mass, for the purpose of allowing initiation of polymerization sufficiently and preventing layer exfoliation while maintaining the layer properties.","As described above, a polymerizable layer is formed on a substrate surface by coating the composition for the polymerizable layer, for example, by application and removing the solvent, and it is preferable to harden the layer by heating and\/or photoirradiation at the same time. In particular, it is preferably to dry the layer by heating and subsequently harden the layer partially by photoirradiation, which allows hardening of the polymerizable compound to some extent, for effective prevention of such troubles as exfoliation of the entire polymerizable layer after the completion of the hydrophilic compound grafting. The reason for the use of photoirradiation for partial hardening is the same as that described in the section of the photopolymerization initiator.","The temperature and the period of heating may be suitably selected in the range of conditions that allow sufficiently removal of the coating solvent, but the temperature is preferably 100\u00b0 C. or less and the drying time is 30 minutes or less, and further, the heating condition of a drying temperature of 40 to 80\u00b0 C. and a drying time of 10 minutes or less is more preferable from the viewpoint of productivity.","A light source for use in the pattern formation described below may also be used for the photoirradiation conducted as needed after heating, and for prevention of inhibition to the subsequent formation of graft pattern and the bond formation between the active sites on the polymerizable layer and the graft chain by application of energy, it is preferable to conduct photoirradiation to an extent that allows only partial but not complete radical polymerization of the polymerizable compound present in the polymerizable layer. The photoirradiation time may vary according to the strength of the light source used, but is generally preferably 30 minutes or less. The rough standard for the partial hardening is a layer residual ratio after solvent washing of 10% or less and an initiator residual ratio after partial hardening of 1% or more.","\u2014Particular polymerization initiating layer formed by immobilizing a polymer having, on a side chain thereof, a crosslinking group and a functional group having polymerization initiating capability by a crosslinking reaction on a base material (particular polymerization initiating layer)\u2014","In embodiment (1), the polymerization initiating layer formed by immobilizing a polymer having, on a side chain thereof, a crosslinking group and a functional group having polymerization initiating capability by a crosslinking reaction on a base material (particular polymerization initiating layer) may be formed as an intermediate layer.

Preparation of the particular polymerization initiating layer above can prevent solubilization of the initiator component in the polymerization initiating layer (component allowing initiation of polymerization) into a solution containing a compound having a polymerizable group when it is brought into contact with or applied on the polymerization initiating layer. In forming the particular polymerization initiating layer, it is possible to use not only common radical crosslinking reactions but also the condensation and addition reactions between polar groups, allowing generation of a firmer crosslinked structure. As a result, as it is possible to prevent solubilization of the initiator component in the particular polymerization initiating layer more proficiently and generation of homopolymers which are not directly bound to the polymerization initiating layer surface, graft polymers directly bound to the polymerization initiating layer surface are formed predominantly.","Hereinafter, each component of the particular polymerization initiating layer polymer will be described in detail.","<Copolymerization Component Having a Functional Group Having Polymerization Initiating Capability>","The copolymerization component having a polymerization initiating group in the particular polymerization initiating polymer is preferably a radical, anionic, or cationic polymerizable group having the following pendant structure allowing initiation of polymerization.

The temperatures of these reactions are preferably 50\u00b0 C. or more and 300\u00b0 C. or less and still more preferably 80\u00b0 C. or more and 200\u00b0 C. or less.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0230","num":"0229"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00030","num":"00030"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00030","he":"52.83mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US08252364-20120828-C00030.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The amount of the crosslinking agent added into the coating solution may vary according to the amount of the crosslinking groups introduced into the particular polymerization initiating polymer, but is normally 0.01 to 50 equivalences, more preferably 0.01 to 10 equivalences, and still more preferably, 0.5 to 3 equivalences, with respect to the molar number of the crosslinking group. If the amount of the crosslinking agent added is smaller than this lower limit value, the resulting particular polymerization initiating layer becomes more soluble into the monomer solution as the degree of crosslinking thereof decreases. Alternatively, if the amount of the crosslinking agent added is larger than the upper limit value, the unreacted crosslinking agent component remains in the polymerization initiating layer and dissolves into the monomer solution, occasionally exerting adverse effects on the polymerization reaction.","<Forming Particular Polymerization Initiating Layer>","In this step, a polymerization initiating layer is formed by dissolving the particular polymerization initiating polymer above in a suitable solvent thus preparing a coating solution, placing the coating solution on a substrate (support) for example by application, and removing the solvent allowing the progress of a crosslinking reaction. The layer may be formed only on one face or on both faces of the substrate in this step. Preparation of the polymerization initiating layers on both faces of the substrate allows processing on both faces in the graft pattern-forming and metal pattern forming steps. It is also possible to generate graft polymers and thus conductive films on both faces similarly. In this manner, it becomes possible to form a wider area for electric wiring on a substrate, and according to applications, for example, if the substrate is used in the FPC application, it is preferable to form the particular polymerization initiating layers on both faces of the substrate.","\u2014Solvent\u2014","The solvent for use during formation of the particular polymerization initiating layer is not particularly limited, if the solvent dissolves the particular polymerization initiating polymer above. From the points of easiness in drying and workability, the solvent preferably does not have an excessively high boiling point, and more specifically, a solvent having a boiling point of about 40 to 150\u00b0 C. is preferable.","Specific examples thereof include acetone, methylethylketone, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, ethylene glycol monomethylether, ethylene glycol monoethylether, ethylene glycol dimethylether, propylene glycol monomethylether, propylene glycol monoethylether, acetylacetone, cyclohexanone, methanol, ethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 3-methoxypropanol, diethylene glycol monomethylether, diethylene glycol monoethylether, diethylene glycol dimethylether, diethylene glycol diethylether, propylene glycol monomethylether acetate, propylene glycol monoethylether acetate, 3-methoxy propyl acetate, and the like. These solvents may be used alone or in combination. The concentration of the solid matters in the coating solution is suitably 2 to 50% by mass.","The amount of the particular polymerization initiating layer coated is preferably 0.1 to 20 g\/mand more preferably 0.1 to 15 g\/mas dry mass.","If the coating amount is less than 0.1 g\/m, the resulting layer does not allow effective initiation of polymerization, often resulting in poor graft polymerization and in a graft structure that does not have a desired stiffness, while if the coating amount is more than 20 g\/m, the properties of the resulting layer deteriorate, unfavorably leading to more frequent incidences of film exfoliation.","(Base Material)","The base material for use in the invention is preferably a plate-shaped material having a smooth surface, preferably having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less and higher in dimensional stability. Examples thereof include metal plates (e.g., aluminum, zinc, copper, etc.); plastic films (e.g., cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose nitrate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyvinylacetal, polyimide, epoxy resins, etc.); the plastic films described above whereon a metal is laminate or vapor deposited; and the like. A polyester or polyimide film is preferable as the substrate for use in the invention.","The substrate for use in the invention preferably has a smoother surface, considering the high frequency characteristics of the resulting wiring, and specifically, and thus it is preferably to select a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less, more preferably 300 nm or less, still more preferably 100 nm or less, and particularly preferably 50 nm or less. The lower limit is not particularly limited, but seems to be about 5 nm from the practical aspects such as easiness of production. If the metal layer or the metal pattern according to the invention is used for metal wiring, smaller surface roughness favorably leads to smaller electric power loss during high-frequency electric transmission.","If expressed in the 10-point-average roughness (Rz) according to JIS B0601 described above, the substrate surface roughness is 500 nm or less, preferably 300 nm or less, still more preferably 100 nm or less, and particularly preferably 50 nm or less. Substrates inherently having a smooth surface such as resin substrates may be used as the substrate to make the surface roughness of substrate 500 nm or less. Even if a substrate higher in surface roughness is used, it is possible to control the surface roughness in the preferred range during formation of the particular polymerization initiating layer or the like. Accordingly, it is preferable to make a particular polymerization initiating layer having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less on the substrate, and the requirement can be satisfied, for example, by controlling the surface smoothness and the uniformity of the coated film during film forming.","Further, when a printed wiring board is formed by using the metal pattern of the present invention as a conductive layer, it is preferable to use an insulating resin as a substrate.","Examples of the insulating resin include resins such as polyphenylene ether or denatured polyphenylene ether, cyanate ester compounds, and epoxy compounds. Use of a substrate formed by a thermosetting resin composition containing at least one of these resins is preferable. When at least two of these resins are combined for forming a resin composition, preferable examples of a combination of resins include: a combination of polyphenylene ether or denatured polyphenylene ether and cyanate ester compounds, that of polyphenylene ether or denatured polyphenylene ether and epoxy compounds, and that of polyphenylene ether or denatured polyphenylene ether and cyanate ester compounds and epoxy compounds. When a multilayer printed wiring board is formed by using the thermosetting resin compositions, use of the thermosetting resin compositions without containing inorganic fillers selected from a group of silica, talc, aluminum hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide is preferable, and use of the thermosetting resin compositions containing bromine compounds and phosphorous compounds is also preferable.","Preferable example of other insulating layers for forming a substrate of a printed wiring board includes a 1,2-bis(vinyl phenylene) ethane resin or a denatured resin of a polyphenylene ether resin and the 1,2-bis(vinyl phenylene) ethane resin. Further details of this resin are described in \u201cJournal of Applied Polymer Science\u201d edited by Satoru Amaba et al, vol. 92, pp. 1252 to 1258 (2004).","Further, preferable examples of other insulating layers include a liquid crystal polymer commercially available as a product name \u201cVecster\u201d (manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd.) or fluororesin such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a typical example.","Among these resins, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a material having the most excellent high frequency characteristics among polymer materials. However, since PTFE is a thermal plastic resin having low Tg, and has poor dimensional stability with respect to heat, PTFE is worse than a thermosetting resin material in mechanical strength. PTFE also has a problem in that formability is worse than workability. Further, a thermoplastic resin such as polyphenylene ether (PPE) can be used in alloy with a thermosetting resin. Examples of alloy include: an alloy resin of PPE and an epoxy resin, that of PPE and triallylisocyanate or that of a PPE resin having a polymerizable functional group introduced therein and other thermosetting resins.","Unmodified epoxy resin cannot exhibit sufficient dielectric characteristics. However, due to introduction of bulky skeleton or the like, epoxy resins are intended to be modified. In this way, use of resins in which the respective characteristics are made the best use of, a structure for compensating their drawbacks is introduced thereinto, and denaturation is adopted is preferable.","For example, among thermosetting resins, although cyanate ester is a material having the most excellent dielectric characteristics, cyanate ester is not often used singly but used as a denatured resin of an epoxy resin, a maleimide resin or a thermoplastic resin. For further details, examples of cyanate ester are described in \u201cElectronic technology\u201d No. 9, pp. 35 (2002), from which insulating resins described above can be selected.","As described above, when a metal pattern is used as a wiring (conductive layer) for a printed wiring board, from a viewpoint of processing of mass storage data at high speed, in order to reduce delay and damping of signals, it is effective to decrease dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent, respectively. Use of low dielectric loss tangent materials is exactly as described in \u201cElectronics Packaging Institutional Journal\u201d vol. 7, No. 5, pp. 397 (2004). From a viewpoint of data processing at high speed, use of insulating materials having low dielectric loss tangent characteristics is particularly preferable. More specifically, it is preferable that a substrate is formed by an insulating resin whose dielectric constant, i.e. relative dielectric constant, is 3.0 or less at 1 GHz, and it is more preferable that a substrate is formed by an insulating resin whose dielectric constant is 0.01 or less at 1 GHz. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent of the insulating resin can be determined by a conventional method, for example, a method described in the Abstracts of 18JIEP Annual Meeting, 2004, p189, in which a cavity resonator perturbation method using a measuring device and system \u2208r and tan \u03b4 for an ultra thin sheet manufactured by Keycom Co., Ltd is used. Thus, it is useful to select the insulating resin in light of dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent. An insulating resin having a dielectric constant of 3.5 or less, and a dielectric loss tangent of 0.01 or less, include a liquid crystal resin, polyimide resin, fluororesin, polyphenylene ether resin, cyanate ester resin, bis(bisphenylene) ethane resin and the like, and further include modified resins thereof.","(Formation of Pattern (Image))","In embodiment (1), a pattern is formed by irradiation of a radiant ray such as light. If the photoirradiation is carried out, for example, in the presence of a light to heat converting substance, a pattern can be formed by the heat generated by scanning exposure of a laser beam having a wavelength in the infrared ray region or the like.","Examples of the methods of causing polarity transition in the patterned manner include writing by heating and radiant ray irradiation including exposure to light. For example, usable are photoirradiation with an infrared laser, ultraviolet lamp, visible light, or the like, thermal writing by thermal head, and the like. Examples of these light sources include mercury lamp, metal halide lamp, xenon lamp, chemical lamp, carbon arc lamp, and the like.

In addition, g-ray, i-ray, Deep-UV ray, are high-density energy beam (laser beam) are also used.","Specific examples thereof commonly used include direct writing, for example, by thermal recording head; scanning exposure by infrared laser; high-illumination flash exposure, for example, by xenon discharge lamp; infrared ray lamp exposure; and the like.","If the photoirradiation is carried out, for example, in the presence of a light to heat converting substance, the polarity transition may be induced in the patterned manner by the heat generated by scanning exposure of a laser beam having a wavelength in the infrared ray region or the like.","Alternatively, in the case of a polymer layer obtained by using a polarity-transition group sensitive to a light at a wavelength of 700 nm or less, any photoirradiation method may be used as the method for inducing the polarity transition in the patterned manner, if it can decomposes, opens or dimerize the polarity-transition group and modifies the hydrophilicy and hydrophobicity. For example, usable is photoirradiation by an ultraviolet lamp or of visible light, or the like. Examples of these light sources include mercury lamp, metal halide lamp, xenon lamp, chemical lamp, carbon arc lamp, and the like.","It is preferable to use the method of inducing polarity transition for direct patterning based on digital data of computer by laser exposure.

A surface graft polymerization method may be used as the method of forming chemical bonds between the polymerizable group of the interactive group-containing polymerizable compound and the substrate surface. By the surface graft polymerization method, it is possible to form a region in the pattern form that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof and to form chemical bonds between the surface having active species and the terminal of the interactive group-containing polymerizable compound chain directly or via a backbone polymer compound.","The surface graft according to embodiment (2) can be formed in a similar manner to the surface graft polymerization described in embodiment (1) above.

In the invention, Pd and Ag are particularly preferable as they are easier in handling and higher in catalytic activity. Methods of adding the O-valent metal to the interactive region include, for example, a method of applying to the interactive region a metal colloid of which the charge on the colloids is adjusted to interact well with the interactive group above in the interactive region. Generally, metal colloids are prepared by reducing a metal ion in a solution containing a charged surfactant or charged protecting agent. The charge of the metal colloids can be controlled by adjusting the surfactant or protecting agent used here, and it is possible to make a metal colloid (electroless plating catalyst) selectively absorbed on the graft pattern by making such a charge-controlled metal colloid interact with the interactive group on the graft pattern.","<Electroless Plating Catalyst Precursor>","The electroless plating catalyst precursor used in this step is not particularly limited if it becomes an electroless plating catalyst in a chemical reaction. The O-valent metal ion used in the electroless plating catalyst above is commonly used. The electroless plating catalyst precursor, metal ion, is converted in a reduction reaction to the electroless plating catalyst, O-valent metal. The electroless plating catalyst precursor, metal ion, may be converted to the electroless plating catalyst O-valent metal in a separate reduction step after addition to the substrate and before immersion in an electroless plating bath in step (b), or alternatively, the electroless plating catalyst precursor may be immersed in an electroless plating bath as it is and converted to the metal (electroless plating catalyst) by the reducing agent present in the electroless plating bath.","The electroless plating precursor metal ion is added practically to the graft pattern in the form of the metal salt. The metal salt used is not particularly limited if it is soluble in a suitable solvent and dissociates to a metal ion and a base (anion), and examples thereof include M(NO), MCl, M(SO), M(PO) (M is an n-valent metal atom), and the like. The metal ion is an ion formed by dissociation of one of the metal salts above. Specific examples thereof include Ag ion, Cu ion, Al ion, Ni ion, Co ion, Fe ion, Pd ion, and the like, and Ag and Pd ions are preferable from the point of catalytic activity.","The method of adding a metal colloid (electroless plating catalyst) or a metal salt (electroless plating precursor) to the graft pattern include a method of dispersing a metal colloid in a suitable dispersion medium or a metal salt in a suitable solvent, thus preparing a solution containing a metal ion dissociated, and applying the solution onto the substrate surface having the graft pattern; and a method of immersing a substrate having a graft pattern in the solution. Contact of the solution containing a metal ion allows adsorption of the metal ion by the interactive group on the interactive region or impregnation of the metal ion into the interactive region due to an ion-ion or dipole-ion interaction. For improving the adsorption or impregnation, the concentration of the metal ion or salt in the contact solution is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 50% by mass and more preferably 0.1 to 30% by mass. In addition, the contact time is preferably about 1 minute to 24 hours and more preferably about 5 minutes to 1 hour.","<<(III) Step of Forming a Metal Layer in the Pattern Form by Electroless Plating>>","Subsequently, a metal layer is formed in the pattern form on the substrate obtained in step (II) by electroless plating. By the electroless plating in this step, a high-density metal layer (metal pattern) is formed on or inside the graft pattern obtained in the former step according to the pattern. The formed metal pattern has an excellent conductivity and adhesiveness.\n\n<Electroless Plating>\n","Electroless plating is an process of depositing a metal in a chemical reaction by using a solution containing the metal ion to be deposited, and the metal deposition leads to increase in conductivity.","The electroless plating in this step is carried out, for example, by removing the electroless plating catalyst (metal) remaining on the substrate having an electroless plating catalyst in the pattern form obtained in step (c) above by water washing and immersing it in an electroless plating bath. Any electroless plating bath commonly known in the art may be used as the electroless plating bath.","When the substrate having an electroless plating catalyst precursor in the pattern form is immersed in an electroless plating bath while the electroless plating catalyst precursor is still adsorbed on or impregnated into graft pattern, the substrate is immersed in an electroless plating bath after it is washed thoroughly with water for removal of undesirable precursors (metal salt or the like). In such a case, reduction of the precursor and the subsequent electroless plating of the substrate proceed continuously in the electroless plating bath. Similarly to above, any electroless plating bath commonly known in the art may be used as the electroless plating bath used here.","Common electroless plating baths have a composition mainly containing 1. a plating metal ion, 2. a reducing agent, and 3. an additive (stabilizer) for stabilization of the metal ion. In addition to above, the plating solution may also contain any known additives such as a stabilizer of the plating solution and the like.","The metals used in the electroless plating bath include copper, tin, lead, nickel, gold, palladium, and rhodium, and among them, copper and gold are particularly preferable from the point of conductivity.","The optimum reducing agent and additives are selected according to the metal. For example, a copper electroless plating bath contains Cu(SO)as copper salt, HCOH as reducing agent, and EDTA (stabilizer for copper ion) and a Rochelle salt (chelating agent) as additives. Alternatively, a plating solution used for electroless plating of CoNiP contains cobalt sulfate and nickel sulfate as the metal salts, sodium hypophosphite as reducing agent, and sodium malonate, sodium malate, sodium succinate as complexing agents. Still alternatively, a palladium electroless plating bath contains (Pd(NH))Clas metal ion, NHand HNNHas reducing agent, and EDTA as stabilizer. These plating solutions may also contain components other than the components above.","The thickness of the metal layer thus formed can be adjusted by controlling the concentration of the metal salt or ion in plating solution, immersion time in plating solution, or the temperature of plating solution, or the like, and is preferably 0.5 \u03bcm or more and more preferably 3 \u03bcm or more from the point of conductivity. The immersion time in the plating solution is preferably about 1 minute to 3 hours and more preferably about 1 minute to 1 hour.","After the metal layer was immersed in the plating bath and the metal pattern was formed, from a viewpoint of increasing adhesiveness, it is preferable to conduct a drying process on the obtained metal pattern. The drying process can use any means such as natural drying, heat drying, reduced pressure drying, and air drying. Among them, the drying process is preferably carried out at or around ordinary temperature in view of preventing deterioration of the polymer layer due to the drying process. More specifically, natural drying of a material having a polymer layer and a metal layer preserved under normal temperature atmosphere, drying under reduced pressure at normal temperature and air-drying at normal temperature are preferably used. In order to remove water contained in the polymer layer as much as possible without heating, these processes are performed for one hour or more, preferably 24 hour or more. The drying condition can suitably be selected taking into account of the adhesiveness required. Specifically, for example, the drying method includes a method for preserving the material having a polymer layer and the metal layer for about 1 to 3 days, about 1 to 3 weeks or about 1 to 3 months under temperatures at about 25\u00b0 C., and a method for preserving it under reduced pressure for about 1 to 3 days or about 1 to 3 weeks.","Although the action in which the drying treatment can improve adhesiveness is not clear enough, it is assumed that sufficient drying can prevent water, which may deteriorate adhesiveness, from being accumulated into a conductive pattern material, and deterioration of adhesiveness with time due to water can be reduced.","SEM observation of the cross section of the metal layer portion of the metal pattern thus obtained revealed that there are a great number of fine particles of electroless plating catalyst and plating metal tightly dispersed in the surface graft layer and an additional layer of relatively larger particles deposited thereon. Because the interface is in a hybrid state of the graft polymer and the fine particles, the adhesiveness is better even when the irregularity of the interface surface between the substrate (organic component) and the inorganic matters (electroless plating catalyst and plating metal) is 500 nm or less, or 100 nm or less of preferable embodiment.","The state of fine particles such as electroless plating catalysts and metals deposited by an electroless deposition in the surface graft polymer layer will be described hereinafter in detail. The particles composed electroless plating catalysts and\/or metals deposited by an electroless plating are dispersed in the polymer layer (graft polymer layer), at a high density toward a substrate from an interface between the polymer layer and the metal layer. In the dispersed state of the fine particles, it is preferable that a region where 25% by volume or more, more preferably 30% by volume, still more preferably 40% by volume or more, most preferably 50% or more of the fine particles exist in the vicinity of the interface in view of exerting adhesive effect of the metal layer. The region where the fine particles exist at a high density in the polymer layer is preferably 0.05 \u03bcm or more, more preferably 0.1 \u03bcm or more, still more preferably 0.2 \u03bcm or more, most preferably 0.3 \u03bcm or more in depth in the direction of the substrate from the interface between the polymer layer and the metal layer.","<<(IV) Electroplating Step>>","The metal pattern forming method according to the invention may have an additional step (IV) for electroplating (electroplating step) after step (III) above. In this step after electroless plating in step (d) above, the metal layer formed in the previous step is electroplated by using the film as an electrode. It allows easier preparation of an additional new metal layer superior in the adhesiveness to substrate with a desirable thickness on the basis of the metal pattern. Addition of this step, which expands the thickness of the patterned metal layer to a desirable value, is advantageous in applying the metal pattern according to the invention to various applications including wire patterning.","Any hitherto known method may be used as the electroplating method in the invention. Metals used in the electroplating in this step include copper, chromium, lead, nickel, gold, silver, tin, zinc, and the like, and copper, gold, and silver are preferable and copper is more preferable from the point of conductivity.","The thickness of the metal layer obtained after electroplating varies according to applications and can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the metal contained in the plating solution, immersion time, electric current density, or the like. The thickness of the common films used, for example, for electric wiring is preferably 0.5 \u03bcm or more and more preferably 3 \u03bcm or more from the point of conductivity.","[Metal Pattern]","The metal pattern according to the invention characteristically has a metal layer formed locally on a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less, preferably 100 nm or less, and the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer is 0.2 kN\/m or more. That is, the metal pattern characteristically has a smooth substrate surface and a superior adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer.","More specifically, the metal pattern according to the invention is a metal pattern locally having a metal layer formed on a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less, preferably 100 nm or less in the pattern form, by connecting a polymer having a functional group that interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof that can chemically bind to the substrate, adding an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof onto the pattern, and then electroless plating the resulting pattern, wherein the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer is 0.2 kN\/m or more.","Such a metal pattern may be prepared in a step similar to the metal pattern forming method, except that a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less is selected as the substrate from the substrates described for the metal pattern forming method.","The surface roughness is a value determined by cutting the formed substrate or the metal pattern in the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface and observing the cross section thereof by SEM.","More specifically, Rz as determined according to JIS B0601, i.e., the \u201cdifference between the average of the Z data of the highest to fifth highest mountains and the average of those of the deepest to fifth deepest valleys on a particular surface\u201d, should be 500 nm or less.","The value of the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer is determined by adhering a copper plate (thickness: 0.1 mm) to the surface of a metal pattern (width: 5 mm) with an epoxy-based adhesive (Araldite, manufactured by Ciba-Geigy Corp.), drying it at 140\u00b0 C. for 4 hours, and then conducting a 90-degree adhesion test according to JISC6481, or after an end of portion of the metal pattern itself is directly removed, and then conducting a 90-degree adhesion test according to JISC6481.","In the invention, the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer as determined by this method is 0.2 kN\/m or more.","With common metal patterns, it is possible to obtain a metal pattern superior in high frequency characteristics by making the roughness of the interface between the substrate and the metal 500 nm or less. However, a method of roughening the substrate surface by various methods and then forming a metal layer thereon has been employed in conventional metal patterning processes, as reduction in substrate surface roughness is often accompanied with decrease in the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer. Therefore, the interface irregularity of the conventional metal patterns was commonly 1,000 nm or more.","However, because the substrate interface is in a hybrid state with the graft polymers directly chemically bonded to the substrate, the metal pattern according to the invention has an excellent adhesiveness constantly.","The metal pattern according to the invention is characteristically formed on a substrate having a surface roughness of 500 nm or less, preferably 300 nm or less, still more preferably 100 nm or less, and particularly preferably 50 nm or less. The lower limit of the surface roughness is not particularly limited, but seems to be about 5 nm from the practical points of easiness of production and others. If the metal pattern according to the invention is used for metal wiring, smaller surface roughness favorably leads to decrease in the roughness of the interface between the metal for wiring and the organic material and thus to smaller electric power loss during high-frequency electric transmission.","If expressed in the O-point-average roughness (Rz) according to the method specified by JIS B0601 described above, the substrate surface roughness is selected in the range of 500 nm or less, preferably 300 nm or less, still more preferably 100 nm or less, and particularly preferably 50 nm or less.","Substrates inherently having a smoother surface such as resin substrates may be used as the substrate, and even if a substrate higher in surface roughness is used, it is possible to control the surface roughness into the preferred range by forming the intermediate layer described above.","Further, the metal pattern according to the invention characteristically has an adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer of 0.2 kN\/m or more, preferably 0.3 kN\/m or more. There is no particular maximum value for the adhesiveness, but the common-sense range is about 0.2 to 2.0 kN\/m.
