{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application is a continuation in part of U.S. Patent Application No. 11\/688,278, filed Mar. 20, 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,584,119 and titled \u201cRESTAURANT SYSTEM\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates generally to restaurant ordering systems and, more particularly, to a restaurant system that incorporates innovative media and advertising components, mixed drink preparation devices, a wireless headset component, and a mobile kiosk system.","Most restaurants share several common goals, such as providing accurate and efficient service as well as providing an enjoyable dining experience. When either goal is not met, the customers may be dissatisfied and may not return to the restaurant with any frequency or, worse yet, may not return at all. Some restaurants are successful with efficiency or with providing a friendly and enjoyable dining experience but few satisfy both goals fully or regularly. Other restaurants, particularly bars and casinos provide bartending with so-called \u201cflair\u201d techniques, e.g. tossing or spinning liquor containers prior to or in the process of preparing mixed drinks.","Various electronic devices have been proposed in the art for either improving the efficiency of ordering or order fulfillment, such as by increasing speed or accuracy or both. Although assumably effective for their intended purposes, the existing devices do not maximize the entertainment value to customers while simultaneously assisting bartenders, kitchen staff, waiters, etc. with accurately and quickly preparing mixed beverages or food items. Another limitation of the prior art is that only a single user may use a kiosk or point of sale device during a dining event, requiring a restaurant to have one such device situated for every customer at the same time. In other words, an electronic device, such as an ordering device, must be located at multiple locations on a bar, at every table, etc.","Therefore, it would be desirable to have a restaurant system having an electronic kiosk that may operate as a napkin dispenser or other condiment dispenser as well as an electronic display device. Further, it would be desirable to have a restaurant system having a database of drink recipes and one or more audio or visual means of communicating the recipes to a bartender. In addition, it would be desirable to have a restaurant system having innovative electronic mixing tins or pour spout devices for entertaining restaurant patrons while mixing beverages. Still further, it would be desirable to have a restaurant system having a mobile kiosk system so that a single kiosk may be slidably moved for use by multiple customers during the same dining experience.","Accordingly, a restaurant system according to the present invention includes an electronic kiosk having generally opposed first and second sides. A first display may be situated on the first side of the kiosk for use by the customer and a second display may be situated on the second side of the kiosk for use by a bartender. The electronic kiosk includes a first input device for use by the customer. A processor is in data communication with the first and second displays and with the first input device to retrieve data from the first input device and to actuate the first and second displays. As the first input device may be a touch screen display interface, a restaurant patron may select from food or drink ordering options, may choose to watch television or other special programming, or just allow advertisements to be displayed. The first input device may also include a card reader for receiving payment.","The kiosk defines a storage area that is configured to contain napkins or condiments. The kiosk may include a second input device for use by a bartender, such as a touch screen. The second display may be in communication with a processor for displaying selected drink recipes. Thus, a user selects a desired drink using the first display, the corresponding drink recipe may be displayed on the second display to aid the bartender in fulfilling the order. In another aspect of the invention, the bartender may wear a headset remote from the processor to which the drink recipe may be transmitted and audibly recited into the bartender's ears to assist in preparing the drink.","The system may also include an innovative electronic mixing tin for providing a bartender with instant access to drink recipes while also increasing the ambiance of the bar and entertainment value of watching a bartender mix drinks. Specifically, the mixing tin may include an LCD screen on its exterior by which to display drink recipes or even advertisements and lighting displays.","Another aspect of the restaurant system includes a pour spout for attachment to liquor bottles that may be lit up with LED's. This component of the system would be especially effective when used with \u201cflair\u201d bartending techniques but also provides enhanced ambiance to any bar environment.","Yet another aspect of the restaurant system described above is to also have a mobile kiosk system that includes a rail having distal and proximate ends and extending therebetween. The electronic kiosk includes a base that extends adjacent the rail. Inductive or conductive electrical components transmit an electrical current to power the processor, input device, and output device of the kiosk. The base is movable only along the rail between the rail distal and proximate ends. In addition, the kiosk may be rotated on the rail or completely removed from the rail.","Therefore, a general object of this invention is to provide a restaurant system for improving order and order fulfillment efficiency as well as improving a restaurant's ambiance and entertainment value.","Another object of this invention is to provide a restaurant system, as aforesaid, that provides an interactive media and ordering component to a restaurant patron and an order fulfillment component to a restaurant employee.","Still another object of this invention is to provide a restaurant system, as aforesaid, in which a napkin or condiment dispenser includes one or more electronic displays.","Yet another object of this invention is to provide a restaurant system, as aforesaid, that includes a remote headset for audibly reciting mixed drink recipe instructions to a bartender.","A further object of this invention is to provide a restaurant system, as aforesaid, having electronic mixing tin and pour spout devices for enhancing the ambiance and entertainment value of a bar or restaurant environment.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a restaurant system, as aforesaid, that provides new and exciting opportunities for options for presenting advertising messages, food\/drink specials, schedules, etc. to patrons of a restaurant.","Another object of this invention is to provide a restaurant system, as aforesaid, in which a kiosk may be mounted on a rail for movement therealong, such that the kiosk may be used by multiple patrons during their dining experience.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein is set forth by way of illustration and example, embodiments of this invention.","A restaurant system  according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to  of the accompanying drawings. More particularly, a restaurant system  (which may also be referred to herein as a bar system) according to the current invention includes an electronic kiosk .","The electronic kiosk  has generally opposed sides , . A display may be on the side for use by a customer, and another display may be on the side for use by a bartender. The electronic kiosk  may include an input device for use by the customer and\/or an input device for use by the bartender ().

Alternately, or additionally, at least one input device , may include a card reader  for receiving payment.","As shown in , the electronic kiosk  may define a storage area  configured to hold napkins or condiments (including such typical condiments as salt, pepper, and ketchup and such bar condiments as limes, olives, and straws, among others). The electronic kiosk  may include a transmitter  and\/or a receiver  (). A processor  may be in data communication with the displays , , the input devices , , the transmitter , and the receiver  (). Means for introducing programming to the processor  may be included, such as a connection (e.g., hard wired or wireless) to a network () or a removable memory device, for example.","Alternatively, the electronic kiosk  may include only a first display for use by the consumer. This embodiment may be adequately explained with reference to  and . The kiosk  would also include the kiosk processor  in communication with the first display for actuating the first display . Preferably, the processor  would include programming enabling the first display to display pictures or descriptions of menu items or other options as will be described later. In this embodiment, the kiosk  also defines a storage area  configured to hold napkins or condiments as described previously. It is understood that a kiosk  with a first display and storage area  for customer use may be used independently or in combination with the other unique elements of a restaurant system as will be described later in greater detail.","The restaurant system  may include a mixing tin  as shown in through . The mixing tin  may include a housing with a double wall construction (i.e., two walls  spaced apart in a waterproof manner) that defines a mixing area . The mixing tin  may include a display  (e.g., a LCD display, etc.), and the display  may be sandwiched between the walls  for durability. If sandwiched between the walls , an outer wall  may include a transparent material so that the display  may be seen from outside the mixing area . The mixing tin  may include at least one light  (e.g., a LED, etc.), and a processor  may be in data communication with the display  and the light(s)  for actuating the display  and the light(s)  (). It is understood that various other lighting options are possible, such as means for continual or periodic \u201cbacklighting\u201d. Means for providing data to the mixing tin processor  may be included. More particularly, the mixing tin  may include a receiver  in data communication with the processor  for receiving data from the kiosk transmitter  (), and\/or the mixing tin  may include a removable memory device , for example. In this regard, data such as drink recipes may be received and displayed on the display so as to aid a bartender in preparing drinks for customers.","As shown in through , the restaurant system  may include a pour spout  for use with a bottle  containing a fluid (e.g., a bottle of alcohol, mixer, cooking oil, etc.). The pour spout  includes a coupling portion  that has a configuration complementary to a configuration of the bottle  so that the coupling portion  may be selectively attached to the bottle . The coupling portion  may fit inside the bottle  similar to a cork, or the bottle may be threaded and the coupling portion  may attach to the bottle threads, for example. An interior portion  of the pour spout  is configured to extend inside the bottle , and the interior portion  and the coupling portion  collectively define a through opening  for dispensing the fluid from inside the bottle . A valve  (e.g., a variable flow valve, etc.) may be in communication with the through opening  to restrict the dispensing of the fluid from inside the bottle .","The interior portion  may include at least one light  (e.g., a LED, etc.) and a battery  in electrical communication with the light(s) . As shown in , a processor  may be in data communication with the light(s)  for selectively actuating the light(s) . The interior portion  may include a translucent material to allow the light(s)  to illuminate an extended area (e.g., an area larger than would otherwise be lit), and the interior portion  may display advertising indicia. More particularly, the interior portion  may include advertising indicia  (e.g., printed thereon, etched thereon, formed therein, etc.), or a transparent sleeve that includes advertising indicia may be positionable about the interior portion . Other backlighting light configurations are also contemplated.","Means for providing data to the pour spout processor  may be included. More particularly, the pour spout  may include a receiver  in data communication with the processor  for receiving data from the kiosk transmitter  (), and\/or the pour spout  may include a removable memory device, for example. Though not shown in the accompanying drawings, the pour spout  may include a display (e.g., a LCD display, etc.) in data communication with the pour spout processor .","The restaurant system  may include a headset  as shown in . The headset  may include a speaker , a receiver  for receiving data from the kiosk transmitter , and a processor  in data communication with the speaker  and the receiver . A microphone  may be in data communication with the headset processor , and a transmitter  may be in data communication with the headset processor  (). The headset  enables drink recipes or the like to be transmitted from the kiosk transmitter  to the headset receiver  and played through the headset speakers , thus assisting the bartender in mixing selected\/ordered drinks (). The headset  is also important in enabling a waiter to be summoned, as described below.","While the transmitters and receivers described herein may utilize active or passive RFID technology, it should be appreciated that other more traditional data transmission systems as well as those employed in the future may also be appropriate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["100","100","1","116","125","2","3","125","122","154","155","152","4","5","125","122","154","155","152","4"],"i":["a ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7"],"b":["100","100","10","116","11","125","116","114","125","114","125","114","12","125","13","14"],"i":["b ","a ","a ","b ","a ","a ","b"]},"At step S, the kiosk processor  actuates the kiosk transmitter  to transmit data about the drink order to the bartender. The data may be received by the mixing tin receiver , and the mixing tin processor  may actuate the mixing tin display  to convey the drink order to the bartender. Alternately, or additionally, the data may be received by the headset receiver , and the headset processor  may actuate the headset speaker  to convey the drink order to the bartender. The method then ends.","At step S, the kiosk processor  actuates the kiosk display to display the recipe of the drink. The method then proceeds to step S. At step S, the kiosk processor  actuates the kiosk transmitter  to transmit data corresponding to the drink recipe. The pour spout receiver  corresponding to the bottle needed to make the drink may receive the recipe data from the kiosk transmitter , and the pour spout processor  may actuate the pour spout light(s)  and\/or the pour spout display. Activation of the pour spout light(s) and\/or the pour spout display may be considered \u201cback-lighting\u201d, though this need not be the case. The method then proceeds to step S. At step S, the kiosk processor  determines if the drink recipe requires a mixing tin. If so, the method proceeds to step S; if not, the method proceeds to step S.","At step S, the kiosk processor  actuates the kiosk transmitter  to transmit drink recipe data to the mixing tin receiver . The mixing tin receiver  may then receive the drink recipe data, and the mixing tin processor  may actuate the mixing tin display  to convey the drink recipe to the bartender. Activation of the mixing tin display  may be considered \u201cback-lighting\u201d, though this need not be the case. The mixing tin processor  may also (or alternately) actuate the mixing tin light(s) . The method then continues to step S.","At step S, the kiosk processor  determines if the bartender has chosen to receive an audio transmission of the drink recipe. If so, the method proceeds to step S; if not, the method proceeds to step S.","At step S, the kiosk processor  actuates the kiosk transmitter  to transmit drink recipe data to the headset receiver . The headset receiver  may then receive the drink recipe data, and the headset processor  may actuate the headset speaker  to convey the drink recipe to the bartender. The method then continues to step S.","At step S, the kiosk processor  may determine if the bartender has used the input device to indicate that the drink order has been filled. If not, the method may stay at step S; if so, the method may continue to step S. At step S, the kiosk processor  may cause the kiosk display to indicate that the drink has been served. If a waiter is using the kiosk  instead of a customer, the kiosk display may indicate to the waiter that the drink is ready to serve.","In yet another exemplary method of using the restaurant system , the bartender may speak into the headset microphone , and the headset processor  may actuate the headset transmitter  to transmit data to the kiosk receiver . The headset processor  may include instructions to recognize the data and proceed accordingly. For example, the bartender may request a recipe for a drink, the headset transmitter  may transmit data corresponding to that request, the kiosk receiver  may receive the request, and the kiosk processor  may understand the request and provide the instructions to the bartender.","Embodiments of the restaurant system  set forth above may further include a mobility apparatus  that interacts with the electronic kiosk  to transport the electronic kiosk  between various locations, forming a mobile kiosk system as shown in . Though described herein primarily in relation to the bar\/restaurant system , it should be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art that the mobility apparatus  and the electronic kiosk  may be useful outside of bar and restaurant settings, and particularly in settings where lining up customers\/people is less desirable than dispersing customers\/people (e.g., along a counter) and then providing services\/attention.","The mobility apparatus  includes a rail  having distal and proximate ends , and extending therebetween (). While the rail  is shown in the accompanying drawings to be generally linear, other configurations may also be appropriate. Further, the rail may be formed as a cavity instead of a protrusion as illustrated. However, it may be preferable for the rail  to extend generally level (i.e., horizontally). It should be appreciated that, in use, the rail  may extend as long as desired and will typically extend much further than is shown in the accompanying drawings. The rail  is shown in  extending along a bar or countertop  having a barmat .","The kiosk  includes a base  that extends adjacent the rail , as shown for example in , and the base  may be separable from the kiosk  () or may be unitary with the kiosk . Means are included for allowing the base  to move only along the rail  between the rail distal and proximate ends , . For example, a coupling member  () may be coupled to (or formed in) the base , and the coupling member  may include a configuration that is complementary to the rail  so as to limit movement of the coupling member  away from the rail  while allowing movement of the base  along the rail  between the ends , . In some embodiments, the coupling member  and\/or the rail  may include multiple portions separated from one another, such as shown in , for example. In addition, one or more rail  that is generally parallel to the rail  and one or more coupling member  that is complementary to rail(s)  may be included to further limit movement of the base  away from the rail . Further, at least one wheel  (), gear, or ball bearing (or any combination of those elements and\/or similar elements) may support at least a portion of the kiosk's weight while allowing movement of the base  along the rail  between the ends , . Supporting some of the weight of the kiosk  may prevent or reduce torque on the mobility apparatus .","In use, then, the kiosk  may be physically pushed or pulled along the rail  between the ends , . Alternately, though not shown in the figures, movement of the kiosk  along the rail  may be mechanized (e.g., through gearing, wheel , belts, etc.). Mechanization of the kiosk along the rail  will be understood by those in the art in light of the description contained herein and is accordingly not addressed further. By being movable, a single kiosk  may serve multiple patrons. This may reduce the installation and maintenance costs of restaurant systems .","Various means may be included for transmitting an electrical current to power the elements of the kiosk  (e.g., the display , the display , the input device , the input device , the card reader , the transmitter , the receiver , the processor , etc.). For example, an inductive connection  () and\/or a conductive connection  () may be used.","For the inductive connection , an inductive electrical transmitter  may be positioned along the rail  at a \u201chome\u201d position, and electrical current may be transmitted to an inductive electrical receiver  from the transmitter  when the receiver  is adjacent the transmitter  (). Current may then be stored in a battery  () for use when the kiosk  (and therefore the receiver ) is not adjacent the home position.","For the conductive connection , a track  () may extend along the rail  and may be coupled to or separate from the rail . A power cord  (e.g., a power cord configured to electrically interact with an electrical outlet) or other appropriate apparatus may couple the track  to a power source. Complementary portions  of the track  () and  of the base  (, , and ), which are movable relative to one another while electricity is being passed therebetween, actually form the conductive connection . As shown in , the conductive connection  may be shielded from inadvertent contact by being located behind the track , and other or additional shielding may be used, as one of skill in the art will appreciate.","Accordingly, whether an inductive connection  () and\/or a conductive connection  () is used, the kiosk  may be powered at the various locations along the rail .","In another embodiment of the conductive connection (not shown), it is understood that the bottom of the kiosk  may include grooves, either extending into the bottom or protruding therefrom. Electrical connectors are positioned in these grooves for electrical communication with the rail  as the kiosk  moves along the rail . In still another embodiment (not shown), at least one rechargeable battery may be installed into a mobile power mat, e.g. in the mat  shown in  that is positioned lowerly adjacent the rail  Power may be transferred from the battery cells to the track  with electrical connections substantially as described above. Preferably, the at least one battery may supply electricity to the track  (through a power cord) for up to 2 days after being charged.","It is understood that while certain forms of this invention have been illustrated and described, it is not limited thereto except insofar as such limitations are included in the following claims and allowable functional equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["b ","b; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["c ","c","c ","b; "],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["b ","a; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"i":["a ","a","a ","b; "],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["b ","a; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 10"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"],"i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 11"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
