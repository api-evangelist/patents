{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to computer system administration. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for monitoring modem use in a networked environment.","Computer and communication technologies continue to advance at a rapid pace. Indeed, computer and communication technologies are involved in many aspects of a person's day. For example, many devices being used today have a small computer inside of the device. These small computers come in varying sizes and degrees of sophistication. Computers commonly used include everything from hand-held computing devices to large multi-processor computer systems.","Computers are used in almost all aspects of business, industry and academic endeavors. More and more homes are using computers as well. The pervasiveness of computers has been accelerated by the increased use of computer networks, including the Internet. Most companies have one or more computer networks and also make extensive use of the Internet. The productivity of employees often requires human and computer interaction. Improvements in computers and software have been a force for bringing about great increases in business and industrial productivity.","Maintaining and supporting computer systems is important to anyone who relies on computers. Whether a computer or computing device is in a home or at a business, at least some maintenance and\/or support is often needed. For example, sometimes there are problems with computer hardware. In addition, computer hardware is often upgraded and replaced with new components. Similarly computer software is also frequently upgraded or replaced. New computer hardware and software is continually being integrated into systems across the world.","Many businesses have policies for computer use on their computer networks. Some of these policies may relate to privacy issues, security issues, productivity, confidentiality, etc. Computer users may cause problems for the business if their activities are not appropriate and\/or approved.","As corporate performance and end-user productivity have become increasingly dependent on computers, computer support personnel are continuously under pressure to ensure the security of the computer network and that computer use policies are being followed. The support personnel are also under pressure to perform tasks as efficiently as possible which may include minimizing effects to existing computer systems and networks or disturbance of computer users.","As shown from the above discussion, there is a need for systems and methods that will improve the ability to manage and support computer systems and to ensure that proper policies are followed by the computer users. Improved systems and methods may enable a person performing computer support to more effectively monitor computer users and the computers on a network. Benefits may be realized by providing increased functionality to assist in computer system administration.","A method for monitoring a computer system for modem use is disclosed. The method starts a background application on the system. A communication port is monitored for communication data. It is determined whether the communication data is a modem instruction. If the communication data is a modem instruction, a notification is prepared to be sent to an administrative system.","In one embodiment, the notification may be sent to the administrative system. The notification may include identification information. The identification information may include a communication identification, an address of the computer system and a user identification.","The background application may be implemented in various ways. For example, the background application may comprise a service and\/or a device driver. In one embodiment the device driver may be a filter driver. Moreover, the background application may comprise a daemon. The background application may also use other components, functionality or services including, but not limited to, a Remote Access Service (RAS), a Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI), and the like.","Monitoring the communication port for communication data may include analyzing the communication data for writes and\/or reads. The monitoring may also include analyzing the communication data for an AT command or analyzing the communication data for a Received Line Signal Detect (RLSD) change.","A computer-readable medium may be used for storing program data. The program data may include executable instructions for implementing a method for monitoring a computer system for modem use. A communication port is monitored for communication data. It is determined whether the communication data is a modem instruction. If the communication data is a modem instruction, a notification is prepared to be sent to an administrative system. The notification is sent to the administrative system. The notification includes identification information.","The executable instructions may comprise a background application. The background application may be embodied in various forms, as disclosed herein and as known by those skilled in the art.","A system for monitoring modem use in a computer system is disclosed.

Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the systems and methods of the present invention, as represented in the Figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of the embodiments of the invention.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used exclusively herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. While the various aspects of the embodiments are presented in drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale unless specifically indicated.","Several aspects of the embodiments described herein will be illustrated as software modules or components stored in a computing device. As used herein, a software module or component may include any type of computer instruction or computer executable code located within a memory device and\/or transmitted as electronic signals over a system bus or network. A software module may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which may be organized as a routine, program, object, component, data structure, etc., that performs one or more tasks or implements particular abstract data types.","In certain embodiments, a particular software module may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations of a memory device, which together implement the described functionality of the module. Indeed, a module may comprise a single instruction, or many instructions, and may be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Some embodiments may be practiced in a distributed computing environment where tasks are performed by a remote processing device linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, software modules may be located in local and\/or remote memory storage devices.","Note that the exemplary embodiment is provided as an exemplar throughout this discussion, however, alternate embodiments may incorporate various aspects without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The order of the steps or actions of the methods described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be changed by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus, any order in the Figures or detailed description is for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to imply a required order unless explicitly stated herein.","Although the embodiments herein are described with reference to multicast jobs, they may be applied to broadcast jobs, point to multipoint, and multipoint to multipoint jobs as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","104"]},"In many contexts, administrators of a computer network  are responsible for ensuring security and privacy, and for ensuring that any rules or procedures of a company for the computer network  are being followed. Administrators may help achieve this by placing a monitor  (also known as the background application ) on a computer system  to monitor certain systems and\/or events.","Many computers today come with built in modems. In addition, users may bring in modems from outside the work place and connect them to their computer at work. Users may introduce security holes by dialing out or by setting up their system to allow others to dial into the system. As a result, security issues may arise without the network administrator's knowledge.","The monitor  may operate to monitor the modem  and\/or communication port  for communications that should be reported to the system administrator. As shown, the monitor  may run on the computer system  and notify administrative software  via the computer network  when an event occurs that should be reported.","The computer system  has an operating system. The monitor may be implemented for many different kinds of operating systems. Those skilled in the art appreciate the different ways in which the systems and methods disclosed herein may be implemented, depending on which particular operating system is used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","203","201"]},"The router  may be connected to three switches: a first switch , a second switch  and a third switch .

When the monitor detects a communication that should be reported, it may send a notification to the administrative system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","301"]},"The background application  monitors  one or more communication ports  and\/or the modem . The monitor  may be configured to watch for certain types of events or communications. For example, it may be configured to watch for any data being sent\/received on one particular comm. port . Alternatively, the monitor  may be configured to watch more than one comm. port . Further, the monitor  may be configured to monitor the modem  in a different way, for example, through use of the modem driver.","The background application or monitor  watches the one or more comm. ports  and\/or the modem  for data that should be reported. If  there is no data to monitor, the background application  may continue to monitor  and watch for any such data. If  there is data to monitor, the background application  may analyze  the data to determine  whether any conditions have been met that would require the administrative system  to be notified. The conditions that should be met may be very broad (e.g., report any data to the administrative system), or they may be more narrow (e.g., only report particular kinds of data to the administrative system).","If  there is no data that should be reported, the background application  may continue to monitor . If  there is data that should be reported, the background application  may notify  the administrative system  and provide any identifying information. If for some reason the notification cannot be sent, the notification or alert may be stored locally until it can be sent.","The notification or alert may be any type of electronic communication. For example, the notification may be an email message, an SNMP trap, a proprietary alert, a broadcast, a packet, a message sent to a pager, a local message box, an audible signal (e.g., a beep), a cellular phone text message, a visual update on a security monitoring program, etc. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the various ways in which a message may be communicated across a computer network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","106","402","404","406","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["508","510","510","508"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["608","609","608","609"]},"Windows 9x and Windows NT, the drivers  may be configured to look for reads and writes to the communication port . On Windows 2000 and XP, the driver  may look for reads and writes to the modem driver  (which shall be considered as an extension of the modem for purposes of illustration). Each of the reads and writes is sent to the service . The service  may parse the data. In one embodiment, the service  parses the read data looking for the modem result codes for connecting and disconnecting. The write data may be parsed looking for a phone number if it is an ATD command sent to the modem.","The service  may also collect system information to include in the identification information , such as Ethernet address, IP address and the currently logged in user name.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["708","710","708"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["813","812","812","813"]},"The monitor  may also use available Application Programming Interfaces  (APIs) in accomplishing its tasks.
