{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENTS REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to data entry devices for digital signal processing, and more specifically to a key having two or more data entry modes to facilitate rapid entry of data.","2. Description of the Related Art","Data entry devices are known in the art. Such data entry devices include numeric keypads, alphanumeric keypads, mouses and joysticks. Each of these data entry devices has been optimized for a specific purpose. For example, a numeric keypad is often found on a telephone, whereas an alphanumeric keypad, a mouse, or a joystick is often found for use with a general or specific purpose processing platform, such as to allow a user to draft documents, select controls from a web page, or control a screen display, respectively.","While such data entry devices are useful, improvements in digital signal processing equipment have resulted in \u201ccrossover\u201d functionality for such data entry devices. For example, it is common for a numeric keypad on a phone to be used to enter alphanumeric data. This is typically done by using a single key to select between three or four alphanumeric characters, such as by depressing the key between one and four times in succession, pressing a first numeric key to identify a sequence of three or four alphanumeric characters and then a second key to indicate a selection of one of the alphanumeric characters, or in other suitable manners. While such crossover functionality facilitates data entry in certain situations, the existing techniques are cumbersome to implement.","A data entry device according to the invention is provided that allows for two or more data entry selections from a single movement of a single key. The data entry device uses two or more toggle zones to allow a user to enter two or more data selections from a single key using a single keystroke. In the disclosed embodiment, the toggle zones can include a four zone arrangement, such as where the user can select a numeric value for a key by depressing the key, or can select an alphanumeric value by pushing the key towards the left, right, top, or bottom. In this manner, an existing telephone keypad with conventional alphanumeric values assigned to each number can be used to enter alphanumeric data with a single keystroke. For example, the number \u201c2\u201d key in a conventional telephone keypad can be associated with the letters \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d and \u201cC.\u201d In this exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides for at least three toggle zones selections, such that a user can enter the number \u201c2\u201d by depressing the key, can enter the letter \u201cA\u201d by pushing the key to the left, can enter the letter \u201cB\u201d by pushing the key up, and can enter the letter \u201cC\u201d by pushing the key to the right. Similar toggle functionality can be provided for other keys of a telephone numeric keypad, keys of other devices, or in other suitable manners.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"Key  includes data entry zones , , ,  and . In one exemplary embodiment, key  can include beveled sides on data entry zones , ,  and , and can have a flat top corresponding to data entry zone . In this manner, when a user places their fingertip on key , they will be able to determine by touch the portions of key  corresponding to each data zone. Key  is further operable to be depressed or actuated in a suitable manner, such that data entry zone  can be activated by depressing key , data entry zone  can be activated by pushing key  in the direction of data entry zone , data entry  can be actuated by pushing key  in the direction of zone , data entry zone  can be activated by pushing key  in the direction of data entry zone , and data entry zone  can be activated by pushing key  in the direction of data entry zone . In this manner, a user can select from one of five discrete data entry states for key  using a single keystroke.","Key  can be configured using suitable actuators. In one exemplary embodiment, a push button switch can be placed under each data entry zone, and mechanical supports and restraints can be placed under key  so that it can toggle in the direction of data entry zones , ,  and , in addition to allowing key  to be depressed downward for actuation of data entry zone . In another exemplary embodiment, key  can have a push button type switch for actuation of data entries for data entry zone , and slider switches in each direction of data entry zones , , , , such that a user can indicate data entry for data entry zone  by sliding switch  to the left, entry of data entry zone  by sliding switch  upward, entry of data entry zone  by sliding switch  to the right, and entry of data entry zone  by sliding switch  downward. In this manner, switch  allows a user to enter one of five data values by using a single keystroke, such as a depressing keystroke, an upwards or downwards keystroke, a left or right keystroke, or other suitable keystrokes.","In another exemplary embodiment, key  can be used to enter additional data based on a sequence of keystroke entries. In this exemplary embodiment, a combination of moving key  in the direction of zone  and zone  can be used to enter data associated with a sixth data value, and additional combinations of selection of zones , , , , and  can be used to enter additional data values. For example, where data entry zones , , , and  are associated with alphabetic data, actuating key  in the direction of one of these data zones without depressing data zone  may indicate an upper case alphabetic data value, whereas actuation of key  in the area of one of these data zones after actuation of zone  can indicate a lower case alphabetic data value. Other suitable conventions that utilize a sequence of keystrokes can likewise be used.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, the data entry zones of the keys can be implemented as LCD panels or other suitable displays that can display of the result when the key is moved into the data entry zone. In this exemplary embodiment, the letter that will be entered when a corresponding data entry zone is selected can be displayed on the screen for that zone. Furthermore, one of the keys can be assigned functions, such as \u201cshift,\u201d \u201call caps,\u201d \u201cnumber lock,\u201d \u201calt,\u201d and \u201cctrl,\u201d such that when a function key is actuated, the corresponding keys on the keypad would be modified. For example, if the \u201call caps\u201d function is selected, the display for each data entry zone can indicate a capital letter. Likewise, a single indicator on a display can be used to indicate that the \u201call caps\u201d control has been activated, or other suitable procedures can be implemented. In another exemplary embodiment, if a menu is displayed on the screen, the key panels can be used to display arrow keys to allow menu navigation.","In operation, key  allows an operator to perform data entry for one of two or more states using a single keystroke of a single key. While a normal key has two states, i.e., on and off, key  adds additional data entry states to expand the data entry capabilities of a single key actuated by a single user action. In this manner, the conventional procedures for entering multiple data values using a single key, such as those requiring multiple keystrokes for each data value, can be avoided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"Key  includes data entry zones , , , , , , and , each of which can be associated with entry of a predetermined or user assignable discrete data value. Unlike a joystick, a TrackPoint\u2122 pointing device available from IBM, or other multi-directional type joystick pointing devices, key  has discrete data values associated with movement in each direction. In this manner, a user is able to select between one of the six available peripheral data values by moving key  in a direction towards each predetermined zone. Likewise, the user can select data zone  by depressing key . Key  can also be used to allow sequential entry of data, such as by pressing key  downwards to actuate zone , and then by moving key  in a direction of one of the peripheral data zones. Suitable actuators, such as those used with key , can also be used in connection with key , such as a mechanical toggle arrangement with switches around the periphery of key , where one switch is associated with each of peripheral data entry zones  through , a push button type actuator associated with zone  with slide actuators for actuation of data entry zones  through , or other suitable configurations.","In one exemplary embodiment, key  can be used in conjunction with other keys to provide alphabetic or alphanumeric data entry. In this exemplary embodiment, three or more keys  can be used to simulate a QWERTY Keyboard, such as by associating data zone  with an alphabetic key of a QWERTY keyboard, such as \u201cS\u201d, and by assigning keys to data zones  through  that would normally occur around the periphery of the alphabetic key, such as \u201cA,\u201d \u201cW,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d \u201cX,\u201d and \u201cZ.\u201d In this manner, a QWERTY keyboard can be simulated with as few as three keys. This arrangement will provide for actuation of twenty one letters, which leaves five letters left over for actuation by a two phase keystroke (such as depressing key  to actuate data zone  and then sliding key  in the direction of one of the remaining five letters). Likewise, other suitable procedures or configurations can be used for entry of such remaining letters.","In operation, key  allows a user to select from one of up to seven data entry states using a single actuation of key . In this manner, key  facilitates the entry of data, and avoids the need for multiple actuations of a key in order to allow the key to be used to enter more than one data state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","316","318","100","200","300","304","306","300","200","300","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502","504","506","500","100","500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","606","608","100","600","600","200","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","702","704","706","702","704","706","706","700","700","700"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802","804","806","808","810","812","800"]},"Key controller system  is coupled to and receives data from keys such as key , key , key , or other suitable keys that provide more than one data state, and converts such key entries into data values. As used herein, the term \u201ccouple\u201d and its cognate terms, such as \u201ccouples\u201d and \u201ccoupled,\u201d can include a physical connection (such as a copper conductor), a virtual connection (such as through randomly assigned memory locations of a data memory device), a logical connection (such as through logical gates of a semiconducting device), other suitable connections, or a suitable combination of such connections. In one exemplary embodiment, systems and components are coupled to other systems and components through intervening systems and components, such as through an operating system of a general purpose computing platform.","In one exemplary embodiment, key controller system  can determine from a standard telephone keypad whether an alphabetic or numeric data value is being entered, and the appropriate alphabetic or numeric data value. For example, key controller system  can include a number of gates associated with each of twelve keys, such that the key being actuated can be determined by the gate receiving the signal. Likewise, key controller system  can receive data signals generated when a key is actuated in a certain manner, such as by being depressed, moved to one side, or in other suitable manners, and can convert the data signal into a corresponding data value. For example, in a twelve key numeric telephone keypad, each key can generate a three digit binary number, the value of which depends on whether the key has been depressed or pushed to a side. Likewise, hexadecimal data values or other suitable signals can be generated by each key depending upon the zone that has been actuated. Key controller system  can convert such signals into the data value associated with each data entry zone based the signal received, the data value received, or other suitable data.","Key identification system  identifies one or more keys based on the physical arrangement of the key, data generated by the key, or other suitable data. In one exemplary embodiment, key identification system  can include an array of gates, where each gate is physically connected to a key. Likewise, key identification system  can determine the identity of a key based on a code associated with that key, such as where each key generates a code specific to that key for each of the data zones associated with that key. Different language characters sets can also be associated with each code, such as to allow the system to be used in different countries or for other suitable purposes. UNICODE can also or alternatively be used.","Zone identification system  identifies one or more zones of a key that has been actuated, such as by determining from a physical connection to a switch associated with each zone that the zone has been actuated, by translating a data value associated with each zone, or by using other suitable zone identification processes. In one exemplary embodiment, each data entry zone of a key can have a hexadecimal value associated with it, where the hexadecimal value for each data entry zone is selected to be different from that for every other zone. In this manner, zone identification system  can map the hexadecimal value for each zone to a corresponding alphabetic data value, numeric data value, or other similar data values.","Sequence identification system  receives key sequence data and determines whether the key sequence data is indicative of additional data fields. In one exemplary embodiment, sequence identification system  can be configured to receive and store data if key entries are received within a predetermined time, such that additional data entry values can be created by selection of two keys simultaneously, by depressing a key and then moving it in a predetermined direction, or in other suitable manners.","Soft key generation system  generates soft key identification data to enable a user to identify data entry zones of a soft key. In this exemplary embodiment, soft key generation system  can allow a user to define data entry zones, to configure data entry zones for that user, and can provide other suitable functionality.","Soft key identification system  receives data from a key and determines the corresponding soft key associated with the data entry zone. In one exemplary embodiment, soft key identification system  can be mapped to a peripheral data generation device, such as a joystick or TrackPoint\u2122 pointing device, and can correlate the movement of a key to a soft key label that has been generated. In this manner, soft key identification system  maps physical data received from a device with the soft key that is currently being generated, so as to allow keys to be used for multiple functions.","In operation, system  allows keys with two or more data entry states to be used for data entry. System  converts the data signals received from such keys into data values associated with user-readable indications, so as to allow a user to readily enter one of two or more data values using a single key actuation. System  also allows a user, a system, or other suitable sources to configure soft keys, and allows users to actuate such soft keys so as to enter one of two or more data values using a single keystroke.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","900","902","904","900","900","900"]},"Because the three keys only provide  data entry zones, other suitable procedures can be used to allow the user to enter one of the excluded alphabetic data values (\u201cQ,\u201d \u201cR,\u201d \u201cU,\u201d \u201cP,\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in this exemplary embodiment). The user can select one of these excluded alphabetic data values by first pressing down on a key, and then sliding the key in the direction of the desired data value (e.g., by pressing down \u201cS\u201d and sliding the key in the direction of \u201cW\u201d to select \u201cQ\u201d). Likewise, pressing the data entry zone adjacent to the excluded alphabetic data value twice, selecting two data entry zones in sequence, or other suitable procedures can be used. An additional data entry key or keys can also or alternatively be provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1002","1004"]},"At , it is determined whether the test indicates that the results are acceptable. If it is determined at  that the test results are not acceptable the method proceeds to  where recommendation data is displayed. In one exemplary embodiment, if the results of the user selection test indicate that the user will have problems selecting between data entry zones, the recommendation can include a suggestion to repeat the test. Likewise, the recommendation can include using soft key definitions that have less data zones, more data zones, or other suitable recommendations. The method then proceeds to , where a user selection is received, such as a selection of number of data zones to be displayed with a soft key. The method then returns to .","If it is determined at  that the test results are acceptable, the method proceeds to  where the user is notified that the test results are acceptable and the user's selectivity control selection is stored. The user can also be provided with the option of trying a different configuration, in which case the method would return to . Furthermore, in another exemplary embodiment, steps  through  can be omitted, such as where user selection of data entry zones is not provided. The method then proceeds to .","At , key option data is received. In one exemplary embodiment, the key option data can include one or more data values for predetermined data zones, data zone definition data for defining the number of data entry zones, or other suitable key option data. The method then proceeds to  where a soft key display is generated having data entry zone definitions based on the key option data received at . The method then proceeds to .","At , soft key data entry zones are allocated to the soft key display. In one exemplary embodiment, if a key has a predetermined number of fixed discrete data entry zone devices, such as binary switches or slide switches, then each discrete data entry zone device is allocated to a soft key. Likewise, where a \u201ccontinuous\u201d actuation mechanism is used, such as a joystick, the zones for such continuous actuation mechanisms can be assigned to soft keys. The method then proceeds to .","At , soft key input data is received. The soft key input data can include the actuation of a switch, selection of a \u201ccontinuous\u201d actuator along a discrete interval, or other suitable input data. The method then proceeds to , where the soft key input data is correlated to a soft key data entry zone. For example, where a four zone soft key is used with a \u201ccontinuous\u201d actuation mechanism, a degree of arc from zero to 90 degrees can be associated with a first soft key data entry zone, a degree of arc from 90 to 180 degrees can be associated with a second soft key data entry zone, a degree of arc from 180 to 270 degrees can be associated with a third soft key data entry zone, and a degree of arc from 270 back to zero degrees can be associated with a fourth soft key data entry zone. Other suitable allocations can also be used, such as where the degrees of arc for each zone are not equivalent. The method then proceeds to .","At  an input data set is generated. For example, a soft key can provide a user with choices to select between software applications, such as a phone book application, a calculator application, or other suitable applications. After the user selects a soft key zone, the command to cause such applications to activate can be generated. Likewise, selections from calling lists, program functions, or other suitable commands can be mapped to soft key data entry zones, such that the input data set generated at  can allow a single user command to replace entry of such command data or other suitable data.","The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention are illustrative and explanatory thereof, and various changes in the size, shape, materials, components, circuit elements, wiring connections and contacts, as well as in the details of the illustrated circuitry and construction and method of operation may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A better understanding of the present invention can be obtained when the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment is considered in conjunction with the following drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
