{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to data processing and, in particular, authorization management.","Networked business applications including enterprise resource planning applications (and other business applications) have become prevalent and, as such, software makers have been forced to provide integrated business solutions via on-demand modules and\/or on-premise. On-demand refers to locally using a business system which includes one or more modules executed in a cloud (e.g., accessing, via a network\/Internet, another physical processor configured to provide the on-demand module(s)). On-premise refers to executing one or more modules of the business system locally. In some instances, the business system may comprise one or more modules (also referred to as components and\/or systems) that are implemented on-premises, while other modules may be implemented on-demand. In any case, the use of on-premises and on-demand makes these business systems more valuable because of extended business functionality but at the same time more complex, which drives up the cost and complexity of ownership of the business systems.","In one aspect there is provided a method. The method may include receiving a request to authorize at least one user to at least one module of a system; mapping the received request to a semantic tag; processing, based on the semantic tag, the request to authorize the at least one user to determine whether to grant the at least one user access to the at least one module; and sending a response to the request to authorize the at least one user, wherein the response is in accordance with the result of the processing.","In some implementations, the above-noted aspects may further include additional features described herein including one or more of the following. The at least one module may be implemented as at least one of an on-premises module and an on-demand module. The mapping may further include determining, based on an identity of the at least one user, a role for the at least one user. The received request may be mapped, based on the determined role, to the semantic tag. The detecting may further include detecting the segregation of duty violation across a plurality of modules including at least one on-premise module and at least one on-demand module. The at least one user access to the at least one module may be authorizes based on the processing and the detecting results,","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive. Further features and\/or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example, the implementations described herein may be directed to various combinations and subcombinations of the disclosed features and\/or combinations and subcombinations of several further features disclosed below in the detailed description.","Like labels are used to refer to same or similar items in the drawings.","The subject matter described herein relates to authorization management in a business system including modules that are on-demand and\/or on-premise. Authorization management refers to maintaining and monitoring authorization to access and\/or use one or more modules of a business system. For example, system administrators may assign and manage the right to access a networked business system, or one or more module(s) therein, for each end-user of the networked business systems. Moreover, authorization management may be used to provide traceability, tracking, and compliance. For example, a networked business system for accounting may segregate the authorization for a first module to a first end user, but restrict authorization to access other modules in order to comply with best practices in accounting (e.g., standards dealing with fraud).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","110","150","180"]},"The user interface  may be implemented as an Internet browser, a thin client, and\/or any other application allowing access to server . The user interface  may be implemented on at least one processor (e.g., a computer, tablet computer, mobile phone, smart phone, and the like) and at least one memory including code which when executed by the at least one processor provides the user interface .","In some implementations, an administrator of a business system, such as an enterprise resource planning system, and the like, may access system  via user interface . The user interface  may also include an authorization manager  to allow management authorizations. For example, the authorization manager  may be used to authorize users to each of the modules of the business system, maintain authorizations for each user of the modules of the business system, monitor authorizations for each user of the modules of the business system, configure the authorizations for each module of the business system, track access to each module of the business system, and the like.","The authorization server  may include a semantic tag service provider A and tag and rules definitions B. The authorization server  may authorize one or more users (or groups of users) based on semantic tags accessible via the semantic tag service provider A. For example, a first system may include an on-premise module B configured to processes invoices, and in the first system authorization is granted to a user based on a role, such as a user being assigned the role of invoice processor. And, a second system may include another module, such as an on-demand module B also configured for invoice processing but in the second system the authorization to access and\/or use the on-demand component B is based on a work-center (e.g., accounting) rather than a specific user's role. In this example, the semantic tagging service provider A may include one or more rules at tags and rules definition B to map the tag \u201cinvoice processor\u201d to the tag \u201caccounting,\u201d so that the authorization server  can determine that an \u201cinvoice processor\u201d in the first system and the \u201caccounting\u201d group of the second system may have same, or similar, authorizations to access and use similar modules. Moreover, the authorization may be provided across systems (e.g., across different systems, such as on-demand module A and on-premise module B).","The tag and rules definition B may include a plurality of rules to map between authorization schemes for different systems. In some implementations, tag and rules definition B may include rules to convert the authorization tags of a system into a common, semantic language, so that processing of authorizations and authorization management takes place in the common, semantic language. Moreover, tag and rules definition B may include additional rules to convert from that common, semantic language into another language scheme in order to provide an output to another system. In any case, the semantic tagging service provider A and tags and rules definition B may reduce, in some implementations, the complexity of authorizing different systems and\/or different modules as the administrator can disregard the differences among the authorization schemes among different systems since the differences are handled by the semantic tagging service provider A and tags and rules definition B using a common, semantic language. In tags and rules definition B, a common set of tags representing business roles may be defined, and the business roles may be defined in the authorization system. An example of defining rules is shown at Table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Invoice processor","Person responsible to","1) create Invoice"]},{"entry":[{},"create, clarify and","2) Compare invoices"]},{"entry":[{},"release invoices","3) Release invoice"]},{"entry":[{},{},"4) reject invoice, etc."]},{"entry":["Sales Representative","Sales representative","1) create\/update\/"]},{"entry":[{},"is a party in the sales","delete contact"]},{"entry":[{},"force automation","2) create\/update"]},{"entry":[{},"process.

In some implementations, the authorization manager  may provide one or more of the following functions: connectivity to the different modules (e.g., on-demand module A, on-premise module B, and\/or any other system, component, and\/or application) directly (e.g., peer-to-peer) or via a directory; determine user identities or an identity of a group of users either directly or via a central identity management system ; obtain users authorizations; generate a default authorization proposal for a user or a user group based on prior authorization in another system (e.g., based on a semantic tag and authorization history in another system); provide segregation of duties for users\/user groups; and\/or monitoring of segregated duties (e.g., using triggers, browsing\/classifying segregation of duty alerts, browsing and presenting authorization histories for traceability and accounting).","The authorization management application manager  receives requests from one or more, if not all, of the connected components of system , such as user interface  and\/or modules A-C. The authorization management application manager  may route a received request to an appropriate service provider, and, in some implementations, the authorization management application manager  may transform, or enrich the received request with additional metadata, before routing the request to another module of system . For example, when authorization server  receives a request to get default authorization proposals, the request is transformed to two requests, which are addressed separately to tags and rules definition B. The results may then be merged by authorization server  and the request is answered with a response.","Table 3 depicts the inputs and outputs of authorization management application manager , such as the name of a user (e.g., In_User) or user group (e.g., In_User_Group), a name identifying a component (e.g., a system, a module, and the like) for which authorization is being managed (e.g., In_Networked_App), and a list of users or groups authorized for the identified component (e.g., Out_Authorizations).

The dispatcher A may include a queue and a buffer to handle calls.","The semantic tagging service provider A may be configured to provide the data and logic for mapping technical authorization entities to a unified semantic authorization entity. The semantic tagging service provider A may also be configured to derive and identify segregation of duty alerts. For example, semantic tag service provider A may be used to define segregation of duty rules. The defined rules may be stored in tag and rules definition B. When segregation of duty rules are defined, the semantic tag used to define authorizations (e.g., business role, business activity, and the like) are referenced. The segregation of duty rule may be defined, for example, on business activity level, such as separation between purchase order create\/update and an inbound-delivery confirmation. As such, when a user is authorized to create or update a purchase order in system A (e.g., on-demand module A), the same user is also authorized to create an in-bound delivery confirmation in system B (e.g., on premise module B) which belongs to the same networked solution. The segregation of duty violation may be detected and a corresponding alert is created, when a segregation of duty violation occurs across systems (e.g., modules A-C and the like). Segregation of duty rules may be also defined on the business roles level such as a purchaser and an in-bound delivery agent. The rules may also be extended to contain, for example, invoice processing and payables management in accounting area.","The semantic tagging service provider A may be implemented to include a model and a service provider. The model may provide tag definitions and tag storage, and may be implemented at tag and rules definition B. A tag definition and its corresponding description may provide an abstraction of the technical authorization entities. A technical authorization entity may be defined based on another technical entity without a direct relationship to a business domain. The tag definition may be created so that it is generic and thus be used as a common, semantic tag (or language) that it can be used across different systems. For example, a first business system may authorize a user's access to a system or a module therein based on the technical authorization entities assigned to the user, while other systems may grant a user authorization based on so-called \u201cwork centers,\u201d which correspond to groups of user interface elements need to execute a specific tasks related to a business position\/role, such as sales representative. To illustrate further, the tag definition would correspond to a generic, semantic tag, which would be mapped to both the user role and work center.","The model of the semantic tagging service provider A may include one or more rules including the storage of rules. Some of the rules may define the mapping between the authorization systems (e.g., Central Authorization-Business Role to work center tags), and some may define segregation of duty rules. For example, a rule may define that authorization for access to a purchase order processing and access to invoice processing may be flagged as prohibited as a possible fraud since these roles are often separate when accounting best practices are followed. The model of the semantic tagging service provider A may also provide an internal service or method, which can be called by authorization management application manager  to check for such segregation of duty alerts. The check may be executed based on rules and tags defined in the model. The semantic tagging service provider A may also include setter and getter methods to define and retrieve semantic tags, rules, and\/or segregation of duty rules.","Table 8 depicts the function\/method used to check if a segregation of duty violation may be caused due to a new assignment of authorizations.
