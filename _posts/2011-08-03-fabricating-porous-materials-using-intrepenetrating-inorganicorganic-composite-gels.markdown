title: Fabricating porous materials using intrepenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels
abstract: Porous materials are fabricated using interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels. A mixture or precursor solution including an inorganic gel precursor, an organic polymer gel precursor, and a solvent is treated to form an inorganic wet gel including the organic polymer gel precursor and the solvent. The inorganic wet gel is then treated to form a composite wet gel including an organic polymer network in the body of the inorganic wet gel, producing an interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gel. The composite wet gel is dried to form a composite material including the organic polymer network and an inorganic network component. The composite material can be treated further to form a porous composite material, a porous polymer or polymer composite, a porous metal oxide, and other porous materials.

No. 61\/371,428, filed on Aug. 6, 2010, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","This work was supported by the Center for Bio-Inspired Solar Fuel Production, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001016. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This application relates to porous materials.","Porous materials find application in modern technologies including thermal insulation, gas storage, active membranes, fuel cells, solar cells, batteries, supercapacitors, drug delivery, bio-implants, sensors, photonics, water purification, and the like, owing to their high surface area and porosity. Examples include porous metal oxides, organic polymers, and carbon, as well as composites thereof.","Nanoporous materials, for example, having a pore distribution in the nanometer range, can be synthesized by a template method or a solvent removal method.","In the template method, sacrificial templates can be mixed into a liquid body of the precursor that polymerizes to form a solid. Then, the templates can be removed to leave pore space in the solid body. The templates can be organic polymers, self-assemblies of surfactants, or other nanoparticulate matter. In some cases, the sacrificial templates can be a pre-formed bulk porous solid. In such cases, the porous body can be infiltrated by the liquid precursor by soaking the body in the liquid. For example, porous carbon can be produced by infiltrating chromatography-grade porous silica with a solution of phenol, formaldehyde, and tetraethylammonium hydroxide; polymerizing the phenol and formaldehyde in the pores of silica; pyrolyzing and carbonizing the polymer; and etching the silica out from the material, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,268, entitled \u201cPreparation of Porous Carbon,\u201d to Knox et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. The tetraethylammonium hydroxide acts as a catalyst for the polymerization of phenol and formaldehyde.","The solvent removal method can start with formation of a wet gel. In a wet gel, the solid component is formed by \u201csol\u201d nanoparticles that are held together loosely but continuously throughout the entire body of the gel. The solvent can be removed, for example, by drying, to leave a porous material. The porosities and the pore morphologies of the resulting materials can be affected by the liquid removal methods such as heating, ambient drying, supercritical drying, cryogenic drying, and the like. The gels can be made of various materials including oxygen-containing metal compounds and organic polymers. Pyrolytic polymer gels can be carbonized to form porous carbon.","In some cases, the wet gel can be an \u201cinterpenetrating\u201d inorganic-organic composite gel. The subsequent pore liquid removal can provide a porous composite material made of different compounds. In certain cases, interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels are prepared by starting with a wet gel that has only one solid network component, inorganic or organic. Through a solvent exchange process, the pore liquid of the wet gel is replaced by another liquid that includes the precursors for the other network component. This method can be time-consuming and can require excessive precursor chemicals.","U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010\/052276 entitled \u201cFabricating porous materials using thixotropic gels,\u201d to D.-K. Seo and A. Volosin, which is incorporated by reference herein, shows that interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels can be prepared by first preparing an inorganic thixotropic gel such as alumina gel. A solution of organic polymer precursors is added to the thixotropic gel, while the gel is sheared and thus becomes liquefied. Upon removing the shear, the material gels again with the organic polymer precursors in the pore liquid.","In other cases, inorganic gel precursors and organic polymer gel precursors are premixed first in a solvent and then an interpenetrating inorganic-organic gel is formed by promoting \u201csimultaneous\u201d gelation of both inorganic gel precursors and organic polymer gel precursors in the solution. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,638, entitled \u201cComposite materials of interpenetrating inorganic and organic polymer networks,\u201d to B. M. Novak et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, interpenetrating networks of silica (or titania) and polymerized alcohols are reported to form through hydrolysis of alkoxides of silicon (or titanium), polycondensation of the hydrolyzed alkoxides and polymerization of alcohols. The hydrolysis, polycondensation, and polymerization occur \u201cconcurrently\u201d in a solution and are catalyzed by a common acid that is added to the solution together with the precursors. The composite gels are then supercritically dried to form composite aerogels. It is noted that these co-gelation methods are different from other procedures for porous inorganic-organic composites that are based on \u201ccopolymerization\u201d between inorganic and organic gel precursors. [See for example, C. Moreno-Castilla and F. J. Maldonado-H\u00f3dar, \u201cSynthesis and surface characteristics of silica- and alumina-carbon composite xerogels\u201d 2000, 2, 4818, which is incorporated herein by reference].","Such co-gelation methods have been reported for metal oxides other than silica or titania in preparation of porous interpenetrating metal oxide-polymer composites. Polymerization of certain organic gel precursors such as resorcinol-formaldehyde pair can be catalyzed by either an acid or a base. Some inorganic salts are acidic in water and thus can act as both an acid catalyst for the organic polymerization and a source for metal oxide in the final product. For example, N. Leventis et al. has shown that CuO\/resorcinol-formaldehyde gels can be prepared by two sol-gel processes running \u201cconcurrently\u201d in a mixture of CuCl.xHO, resorcinol, formaldehyde, and epichlorohydrin in an HO\/DMSO solvent at 80\u00b0 C. for 4 hours. [See N. Leventis et al., \u201cOne-pot synthesis of interpenetrating inorganic\/organic networks of CuO\/resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogels: nanostructured energetic materials\u201d 2009, 131, 4576, which is incorporated by reference herein.] In their work, the CuO precursor, CuCl.xHO, was shown to be acidic (pH\u02dc3) in the HO\/DMSO solvent, and the acid catalyzed the polymerization of the resorcinol and formaldehyde. The CuO\/resorcinol-formaldehyde gels were supercritically dried to provide CuO\/resorcinol-formaldehyde composite aerogels.","In some cases, it is unclear whether or not both the inorganic and the organic components form network structures throughout the solution in \u201cconcurrent gelation\u201d methods. For example, the work by R. Vendamme et al. on preparation of zirconia-polymer composite membranes raises the problem and indicates that their porous membranes may have \u201cpartial\u201d networks of zirconia instead of \u201ccontinuous\u201d networks. [See R. Vendamme et al., \u201cRobust free-standing nanomembranes of organic\/inorganic interpenetrating networks\u201d 2006, 5, 494, which is incorporated herein by reference.]","In some cases, the network structures are used further to fabricate a new porous material by removing either the inorganic or the organic network component. For example, removal of the metal oxide component from a porous interpenetrating metal oxide-carbon composite will provide a porous carbon, and removal of the carbon component from a porous interpenetrating metal oxide-carbon composite will provide a porous metal oxide. If one of the network components is not sufficiently continuous, the porous material from the removal of the other component may not be continuous, either. In addition, a \u201cpartial\u201d or incomplete network component can be harder to etch out when it is fully surrounded by the other network component and thus less easily accessed by an etching agent. Furthermore, if the material is used as an electrical conduction medium, the resulting porous material may be less conductive at least in part because of the partially continuous network structure.","This specification describes technologies relating to fabricating porous materials using interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels and the fabricated porous materials. The inorganic network component may be substantially free from silica or substantially free from silicon-containing compounds. The interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels include an inorganic network component and an organic polymer network component that interpenetrate each other.","In one aspect, preparing a material includes providing a mixture or precursor solution including an inorganic gel precursor, an organic polymer gel precursor, and a solvent. The precursor solution is treated to form an inorganic wet gel including an inorganic metal oxide gel network and a liquid including the organic polymer gel precursor and the solvent. The inorganic wet gel is treated to form an organic polymer network in its body (i.e., in the inorganic wet gel). In some implementations, the organic polymer gel precursor may partially undergo polymerization during the inorganic wet gel formation. The subsequent treatment of the inorganic wet gel may make the polymerization more complete. This provides a composite wet gel that includes both inorganic and organic network components. The inorganic-organic composite wet gel is dried (e.g., the liquid component is removed from the composite wet gel) to form the material. The material is a composite material that may be porous. The material may be treated to remove at least one component, thereby yielding another material (e.g., another porous material).","In another aspect, preparing a material includes treating a mixture or precursor solution including an inorganic gel precursor, an organic polymer gel precursor, and a solvent to form an inorganic wet gel including the organic polymer gel precursor and the solvent. The inorganic wet gel is treated to form a composite wet gel including an organic polymer network in the inorganic wet gel. The composite wet gel is dried to form a composite material including the organic polymer network and an inorganic network component. The composite material may be a porous material.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. In some implementations, the precursor solution includes one or more additives selected from the group consisting of fibers, woven fibers, particles, carbon veils, carbon fibers, viscosity modifiers, polymers, and additional porous materials. The inorganic gel precursor can include one or more additives selected from the group consisting of: compounds including a metal, semimetal, metalloid or semiconductor; inorganic salts; acid scavengers; epoxy-containing compounds; urea; organometallic compounds; and alkoxides of metals, semi-metals, metalloids, and\/or semi-conductors. The organic polymer gel precursor can include one or more additives selected from the group consisting of carbon-containing compounds, resorcinol, formaldehyde, phenol, polymerizable carbon-containing compounds, hydroxyl-substituted benzenes, urea, diamines, sugars, furfuryl alcohol, cellulose, and mesophase pitch. The inorganic wet gel can include one or more additives selected from the group consisting of oxides, hydroxides, alkoxides, oxohydroxides, oxoalkoxides, oxo salts, oxo salt hydrates of a metal, semi-metal, metalloid, or semi-conductor, or hydrated forms of metal oxides that acts as a solid acid catalyst or solid base catalyst for the organic polymer network.","Treating the precursor solution can include heating the precursor solution to a temperature up to about 50\u00b0 C. In some implementations, the organic polymer gel precursors are polymerized to form the organic polymer network in the presence of an acid, a base, an oxidizing agent, a reducing agent, a base, or any combination thereof and\/or wherein the organic polymer gel precursors are polymerized to form the organic polymer network by thermal polymerization, radical polymerization, photocatalytic polymerization, and\/or thermobaric polymerization, and\/or wherein the organic polymer precursors are polymerized to form the organic polymer network with microwave radiation.","Treating the inorganic wet gel can include treating the inorganic wet gel at a temperature higher than the temperature employed for treating the precursor solution and\/or heating the inorganic wet gel to a temperature greater than about 50\u00b0 C.","Drying the composite wet gel can include supercritical drying, cryogenic drying, heating, or the like. The drying may yield a composite xerogel which may have a porosity lower than that expected from supercritical drying or cryogenic drying. In some implementations, the heating can cause dehydration, decomposition, combustion, or pyrolysis of a part of the solid component of the composite wet gel.","In some implementations, preparing a porous and\/or composite material including metal oxide, semi-metal oxide, metalloid oxide, or semi-conductor oxide and an organic polymer includes providing a mixture of one or more inorganic gel precursors, one or more organic polymer gel precursors, and one or more solvents. The mixture is then treated to form a wet gel including a liquid and an inorganic network component. The wet gel is then treated to form an organic polymer gel network in its body, and the liquid component of the wet gel is removed.","In some cases, materials including non-silicate inorganic oxide and an organic polymer are prepared. The method includes providing a mixture of one or more inorganic salts, one or more acid scavengers, one or more organic polymer gel precursors, and one or more solvents. The mixture is treated to form a wet gel including a non-silicate inorganic oxide network component. The wet gel is then treated to form an organic polymer gel network in its body, and the liquid component of the wet gel is removed. At least one among the inorganic salts is chosen to be acidic in water. The acid scavengers can include epoxy-containing organic compounds such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and epichlorohydrin; organic compounds such as urea that become basic upon hydrolysis; inorganic bases such as ammonium hydroxide, or a combination thereof.","The metal oxide network component can be, for example, an oxide, hydroxide, alkoxide, oxohydroxide, oxoalkoxide, oxo salt, oxo salt hydrate of a metal, semi-metal, metalloid, or semi-conductor, or a hydrated form of a metal oxide. In some implementations, the gel can be formed in a sol-gel process. In some cases, the gel can be formed by precipitation from a solution.","In some implementations, the oxygen-containing metal compound may act as a catalyst for the polymerization of the organic polymer gel precursors. In some cases, inorganic gel networks have M-OH hydroxyl groups on the surface which are Br\u00f6nsted acid sites and can promote polymerization.","The composite materials can be treated further. In certain implementations, the composite materials are treated to remove one component and thus to produce a porous (or another porous) material. In some cases, treating the composite material includes heating the composite material in an excess of oxygen to burn off the organic polymer network to form a porous metal oxide substantially free from the organic polymer network. In other cases, treating the composite material includes etching out the inorganic network component to form a porous organic polymer substantially free from the inorganic network component.","In some implementations, the composite materials are heated with a limited amount of oxygen and thus the polymer component is pyrolyzed to produce a porous metal oxide-carbon composite material. In some cases, the metal oxide component undergoes a carbothermal reaction to yield porous carbon embedded with metal particles inside. In some cases, the pyrolysis can be carried out with a sufficient amount of oxygen to produce a porous metal oxide-carbon composite material with a discontinuous carbon network (e.g., a metal oxide network with discrete regions including carbon-containing polymer components). In some cases, the porous metal oxide-carbon composite material is treated further. For example, the porous metal oxide-carbon composite material can be heated with an excess of oxygen to burn off the carbon and form a porous metal oxide. Some implementations include contacting the porous metal oxide-carbon composite with a solvent to etch the metal oxide out and form a porous carbon.","In some cases, the composite material is heated with a sufficient amount of oxygen to remove the organic polymer network or some or all of the carbon, thereby yielding a porous metal oxide (e.g., substantially free from the organic polymer network or substantially free from carbon, respectively). The porous metal oxide can be conducting or semi-conducting. In some cases, the porous metal oxide can be a transparent conducting oxide. The composite material can be heated in a limited oxygen environment to yield a porous composite including a metal oxide and carbon. In certain cases, the porous composite is treated to remove the metal oxide, thereby yielding a porous carbon or porous carbon composite substantially free from the metal oxide. Treating the porous composite may include etching out the metal oxide with an acid or a base, and dissolving or decomposing the metal oxide. The porous composite can be treated to remove some or all of the inorganic network component, thereby yielding a porous polymer or porous polymer composite. Treating the porous composite can include etching out the inorganic network component with an acid or base, and dissolving or decomposing the inorganic network component.","In some implementations, another component can be removed from the composite material to form another porous and\/or composite material. In some cases, the porous and\/or composite materials can be used as a reagent or component to form a new material. In certain cases, the process of preparing the porous and\/or composite material can be applied more than once to the same material to form a heterogeneous composite structure. Examples of the heterogeneous composite structures include a core\/shell structure and a multi-layer structure. The porous and\/or composite materials can be nanoporous, hierarchically porous, or in the form of monoliths, films, plates, coatings, powders, particulates, or any combination thereof. In some cases, the porous and\/or composite materials are conducting or semi-conducting. In certain cases, the porous and\/or composite materials are transparent or semi-transparent.","The details of one or more implementations of the specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the specification will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Methods for fabricating porous materials using interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels are described. As used herein, an \u201cinterpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gel\u201d is a gel that includes an inorganic network component and an organic gel network component that interpenetrate each other. Furthermore, methods for fabricating new porous materials by removing substantially all of the inorganic network component or substantially all the organic network component from the formed interpenetrating inorganic-organic composite gels are described. The inorganic network component can include at least one oxygen-containing metal compound. As used herein, \u201cmetal\u201d generally refers to a metal, semi-metal, metalloid, or semi-conductor. As used herein, \u201coxygen-containing metal compound,\u201d \u201cinorganic network component,\u201d \u201cinorganic oxide network component,\u201d and \u201cmetal oxide network component\u201d generally refer to a metal oxide, metal oxyhydroxide, metal hydroxide, metal alkoxide, or metal oxoalkoxide. The oxygen-containing metal compound, inorganic network component, inorganic oxide network component, or metal oxide network component can be an oxide, hydroxide, alkoxide, oxohydroxide, oxoalkoxide, oxo salt, oxo salt hydrate of a metal, semi-metal, metalloid, or semi-conductor, or a hydrated form of a metal oxide. An organic network component can include an organic polymer or a carbon-containing polymer.","Referring to , a process for preparing porous materials  includes providing a mixture including an inorganic gel precursor, an organic polymer gel precursor, and a solvent, as shown in operation . In some cases, the inorganic gel precursor includes at least one metal element. In certain cases, the inorganic gel precursor includes one or more inorganic salts, organometallic compounds, or alkoxides of metals, semi-metals, metalloids, and\/or semi-conductors such as Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, B, Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, As, Sb, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Tc, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Sc, Y, Lu, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Th, U, Tl, Pb, Bi, or any combination thereof. Exemplary inorganic salts include aluminum chloride hexahydrate, aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, and aluminum hydroxide (gibbsite). The inorganic gel precursor can also be a partially hydrolyzed form of any of the aforementioned organometallic compounds or metal alkoxides, such as siloxanes and aluminoxanes.","The organic gel precursors include carbon and are polymerizable. In some cases, an organic gel precursor includes formaldehyde-resorcinol, formaldehyde plus other hydroxyl-substituted benzenes such as phenol and phloroglucinol, or other systems such as melamine-formaldehyde, urea-formaldehyde, and phenyldiamine-formaldehyde. In some cases, an organic gel precursor includes organic oligomers and\/or macromers. In certain cases, the organic gel precursor is mixed with one or more additional organic compounds, such as sugar, furfuryl alcohol, or mesophase pitch.","In some implementations of process , the mixture of operation  is treated to form an inorganic wet gel in operation . The inorganic wet gel can be a gel formed, for example, by a sol-gel process. In some cases, a gel can be obtained by precipitation from a solution. Gels formed in operation  include an inorganic network component and a liquid including the organic gel precursors and the solvent. In some cases, the inorganic network component is an oxide, hydroxide, alkoxide, oxohydroxide, oxoalkoxide, oxo salt, or oxo salt hydrate of a metal, semi-metal, metalloid, or semi-conductor. In some cases, the inorganic network component is a hydrated form of a metal oxide. In some cases, the metal oxide includes main-group metal oxides, transition metal oxides, rare earth metal oxides, or any combination thereof. Exemplary oxides include alumina, tin oxide, antimony-doped tin oxide, titanium oxide, doped titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, yttria-stabilized zirconia, doped zirconium oxide, zinc oxide, doped zinc oxide, niobium oxide, and tantalum oxide. In some cases, the metal oxides can contain more than two different metal elements. In some cases, the metal oxides can be conducting or semi-conducting. In some cases, the metal oxide can be a transparent conducting oxide. Examples of transparent conducting oxides include tin oxide, indium tin oxide, doped tin oxides, antimony-doped tin oxide, fluorine-doped tin oxide, doped zinc oxides, aluminum-doped zinc oxide, CuAlO, CuGaO, and AgGaO.","In some cases, inorganic salt precursors are acidic in water, and the formation of a metal oxide gel takes place when the pH of the mixture increases due to the presence of an acid scavenger. Acid scavengers include epoxy-containing organic compounds such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and epichlorohydrin; organic compounds such as urea that become basic upon hydrolysis; and inorganic bases such as ammonium hydroxide. For example, alumina gels from hydrates of aluminum chloride or nitrate as an inorganic salt precursor and propylene oxide as an acid scavenger are described by Baumann et al. in \u201cSynthesis of High-surface-Area Alumina Aerogels without the Use of Alkoxide Precursors,\u201d 2005, 17, 395-401, which is incorporated by reference herein.","Gels formed in operation  are then treated to form an organic polymer gel network in the body of the gel in operation . In some cases, the organic polymers can be pyrolytic. In certain cases, the organic polymer gel precursors are organic oligomers and\/or macromers. Treating the gel in operation  may be conducted at a temperature higher than the temperature in operation . In some cases, the organic polymer gel precursor may partially undergo polymerization in operation . Treating the gel in operation  may promote the polymerization for more complete formation of the organic polymer gel network.","In certain cases, gels formed in operation  can catalyze the organic polymerization in operation . Without binding to any theory, some metal oxide gels have M-OH hydroxyl groups on the surface which are Br\u00f6nsted acid sites and can promote polymerization.","Gels treated in operation  are then treated in operation  to remove the liquid component from the wet gel and to form a porous composite material. The liquid is removed to provide a porous inorganic-organic composite material. The liquid component in the composite gel can be removed by a process such as drying, supercritical drying, cryogenic drying, heating, or the like. The drying yields a composite xerogel which can have a porosity lower than expected from supercritical drying or cryogenic drying. In some implementations, the heating can cause dehydration, decomposition, combustion, or pyrolysis of a part of the solid component.","Optional operation  includes processing the product of operation  to remove the inorganic network component or the organic network component to produce a porous material. In an example, the product from operation  is a porous alumina-resorcinol\/formaldehyde polymer composite that is further heated in operation  to burn off the polymer component. This leaves calcined and dehydrated alumina that is porous. Other examples of porous materials from operation  include metal oxides such as tin oxide, antimony-doped tin oxide, titanium oxide, doped titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, yttria-stabilized zirconia, doped zirconium oxide, zinc oxide, doped zinc oxide, niobium oxide, and tantalum oxide. In some cases, the metal oxides can contain more than two different metal elements. In some cases, the metal oxides can be conducting or semi-conducting. In some cases, the metal oxides can be a transparent conducting oxide. Examples of transparent conducting oxides include tin oxide, indium tin oxide, doped tin oxides, antimony-doped tin oxide, fluorine-doped tin oxide, doped zinc oxides, aluminum-doped zinc oxide, CuAlO, CuGaO, and AgGaO. In some cases, the porous materials from operation  can have a heterogeneous structure including more than one metal oxide or a plurality of metal oxides. One example of a heterogeneous structure is a porous network structure embedded with metal oxide nanoparticles inside. In some cases, the heating in operation  results in decomposition of a metal oxide. One example of the metal oxides is AuO. In some cases, the porous materials from operation  have a porous metal oxide structure embedded with metal nanoparticles inside. Alternatively, the product of operation  can be soaked in an etching solution to etch out the inorganic network component to yield a porous polymer material.","Optional operation  includes processing the product of operation  to pyrolyze the polymer component with a limited amount of oxygen to form a porous metal oxide-carbon composite material. Examples of the metal oxide include alumina, tin oxide, antimony-doped tin oxide, titanium oxide, doped titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, yttria-stabilized zirconia, doped zirconium oxide, zinc oxide, doped zinc oxide, niobium oxide, and tantalum oxide. In some cases, the metal oxides can contain more than two different metal elements. In some cases, the metal oxides can be conducting or semi-conducting. In some cases, the metal oxides can be transparent conducting oxides. Examples of transparent conducting oxides include tin oxide, indium tin oxide, doped tin oxides, antimony-doped tin oxide, fluorine-doped tin oxide, doped zinc oxides, aluminum-doped zinc oxide, CuAlO, CuGaO, and AgGaO. Pyrolysis with a limited amount of oxygen may result in partial or incomplete pyrolysis to yield a composite material with discontinuous carbon networks, isolated carbonaceous areas, or a combination thereof in a metal oxide network. In some cases, during the pyrolysis in operation  the metal oxide component undergoes a carbothermal reaction with a sufficient amount of carbon and hence results in porous carbon embedded with metal particles inside. One example is the formation of porous carbon embedded with Sn metal particles inside.","In some cases, the pyrolysis in operation  with a limited amount of oxygen results in decomposition of a metal oxide. One example of the metal oxides is AuO. In some cases, the pyrolysis in operation  with a limited amount of oxygen results in a carbothermal reaction of a metal oxide. One example of carbothermal reaction is the formation of iron metal upon the reaction between iron oxides and the carbon at high temperatures. In some cases, the pyrolysis in operation  with a limited amount of oxygen produces a porous metal oxide structure embedded with discrete carbon and metal nanoparticles inside.","Optional operation  includes processing the product of operation  to remove one of the network components (e.g., metal oxide or carbon). In one example, a porous alumina-carbon composite can be heated with an excess of oxygen to burn off the carbon and thus to produce a porous alumina. In another example, the porous alumina-carbon composite can be soaked in sulfuric acid and heat-treated in a pressurized container to etch out the alumina component and form porous carbon.","In process , shown in , a solution including an inorganic polymer gel precursor, an organic polymer gel precursor, and a solvent is treated in operation  to form an inorganic wet gel including the organic polymer gel precursor and the solvent. The inorganic wet gel is treated in operation  to form a composite wet gel including an organic polymer network throughout the inorganic wet gel. In operation , the composite wet gel is dried to form a composite material including the organic polymer network and an inorganic network component. The composite material may be a porous composite material. The composite material can be further treated in operation  to remove at least one component from the composite material to form a porous (or another porous) material. In optional operation , one or more additional components of the porous material may be removed to yield a new porous material. In optional operation , the porous material formed in operation  or  may be used as a reactant or component to form a new material.","In some cases, process  can be applied more than once on the same material to form a heterogeneous composite structure.

However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments that are disclosed without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.","A precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 7.1 g AlCl.6HO and 1.0 g of resorcinol in 61 ml of a 50\/50 v\/v mixture of water and ethanol. To this solution 1.48 g 37% formaldehyde solution was added and stirred to form a solution of pH 2 to 3. 17.1 g of propylene oxide was added to this precursor solution and mixed thoroughly.
