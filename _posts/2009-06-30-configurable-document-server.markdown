No. 11\/591,446, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,747,761 filed on Oct. 29, 1996, entitled \u201cDelivery Expert System and Method.\u201d","Computer networks generally enable data communications between computing devices (\u201cnetwork nodes\u201d) that are connected to such computer networks. Many such computer networks are interconnected, such as via the Internet, and can have \u201ctransports\u201d that transport documents and other computer files between network nodes. A document is a container for any type of digital content, including facsimiles, voice messages, videos, word processing documents, spreadsheets, and any other type of media, including multimedia.","Conventional transports have various deficiencies. As an example, conventional transports cannot intelligently select a network from multiple available networks based on the type of document that needs to be communicated between computing devices. Instead, they generally use the same network to transport documents without regard as to whether some networks may be better adapted to transport a particular document type. Moreover, document servers may not route documents even though documents may not be correctly converted, received, or transmitted.","The headings provided herein do not necessarily limit the scope of the invention.","Various embodiments of the invention will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these embodiments. One skilled in the art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description of the various embodiments","The terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of specific embodiments of the invention. Some terms may even be emphasized below. However, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.","A configurable document server is described. In some embodiments, the configurable document server can enable administrators to set an option that prevents documents from being routed to users when the configurable document server experiences some types of errors. As an example, an administrator can configure the document server to prevent routing of inbound facsimile messages when those facsimile messages are incomplete because of transmission or reception errors. The configurable document server may determine that an error has occurred when the inbound facsimile was not completely transmitted, when the power fails, when the connection terminates, or other error conditions occur. Alternatively, the configurable document server may determine that documents that could not be converted from one document format to another because of an error should not be routed. When the configurable document server determines that such an error condition exists, it may prevent the routing of the corresponding document. As an example, the configurable document server may instead route the document to an administrator or identify the document to the administrator. By preventing documents causing errors, such as facsimile documents with transmission errors, from being routed, the configurable document server enables administrators to improve the accuracy of document workflow and thereby improve productivity of users.","A configurable queue processor for document servers is described. In some embodiments, the configurable queue processor allocates server resources in an optimal manner such that document servers can process documents efficiently. Server resources include, e.g., processors, disk space, network bandwidth, etc. A document server is a server that handles documents or otherwise processes documents, such as servers that process facsimiles, copies, print jobs, scanning jobs, optical character recognition jobs, voice messages, document transmissions, document conversions, archiving, and indeed any type of document processing request. Document servers may receive multiple documents of various types. The configurable queue processor allocates one or more \u201cdocument flows\u201d to handle the incoming documents. A document flow is a component of a document server that manages the processing of one or more documents or document types. As an example, the configurable queue processor may allocate multiple document flows and configure each document flow to handle different types of documents. The document flows receive documents they are configured to handle from a queue and handle the documents according to each document's type. The document flows can provide the received documents to appropriate document handlers, such as for sending a facsimile, making a copy, printing, optical character recognition, etc.","In various embodiments, the document flows can retrieve documents from a queue or may be provided documents by another component, such as the configurable queue processor.","The configurable queue processor can be configured by a user, such as an administrator, to allocate document flows in an identified manner. As an example, an administrator may determine that facsimile transmissions are to receive higher priority during the day than another type of document processing service the document server provides, but can receive a lower priority at night. Alternatively, the configurable queue processor can allocate document flows dynamically to balance system load. As an example, the configurable queue processor may allocate an identified number of document flows and, as server resources become available or are consumed, can increase or decrease the number of document flows. Alternatively, the configurable queue processor may increase or decrease the number of document flows as the queue of documents waiting to be processed increases or decreases. As an example, the configurable queue processor may increase the number of document flows that handle facsimiles as the number of waiting facsimiles in the queue increases.","In some embodiments, the configurable queue processor may increase the number of queues that hold pending documents.","In various embodiments, the configurable queue processor may allocate document flows across one or more document servers. Alternatively, each document server may have its own configurable queue processor that allocates document flows on that document server.","Thus, by using multiple document flows, the configurable queue processor can tune system performance to manage a document's time in the queue, such as by managing system performance or resources. This permits flexible management of queues in document servers, such as to prevent bottlenecks associated with the processing of multiple document types, events, and network protocols.","Various techniques can be employed to enable communication between the configurable queue processor and allocated document flows. These include shared memory, named pipes, remote procedure calls, application programming interface invocations, etc.","The document flows that the configurable queue processors create communicate with universal Document Transport (\u201cDocTrans\u201d) modules to process documents or forward documents for processing. The DocTrans modules may be adapted for use with document servers for recognizing document requests, interacting with routing rules and workflow requirements, and generally managing document flows between network nodes, including other document servers. The DocTrans module can function with a document server (e.g., a RightFax server) to recognize document requests, interact with document routing rules and workflow requirements, and manage document flows between network nodes or devices. The DocTrans module provides to its operator multiple benefits over conventional transports. Examples include providing a common processing architecture for all message transports rather than requiring individual processing engines for multiple transport types; having common scheduling and queuing support for each transport type; and selecting document- or hardware-specific processing tasks by reference to the type of protocol. This feature is prevalent now given the wide use of multifunction devices such as all-in-one print\/scan\/copy\/fax\/telephone\/answering machine devices, which may be enhanced with audio & video capture, messaging, email, network router & gateway capabilities. It is also a benefit to use DocTrans modules to integrate messaging and workflow operations when using standalone machines that perform these functions on a network.","Various techniques can be employed to enable communication between the configurable document flows and their corresponding DocTrans modules. These include shared memory, named pipes, remote procedure calls, application programming interface invocations, etc.","The DocTrans module provides methods for transporting documents between network devices, such as printers, fax boards, and document servers (e.g., RightFax 9.0 facsimile server by Captaris, Inc. of Bellevue, Wash.) across local and wide-area networks, and permits document transport and routing optimization with other types of communications networks (e.g., messaging services, telephony, and Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) networks). Document servers can handle faxes and other documents, such as for routing purposes. The module can route documents instead of, or in addition to, a board server, such as a fax board server. The DocTrans module routes documents in a manner that is similar to how a board server routes documents, except that the DocTrans module can route documents based on a document type or a transport's type in addition to just phone number, user, group, and so forth. In addition, the DocTrans module exposes an interface that permits other types of document transport mechanisms (e.g., multi-function devices, email, and SMS servers) to operate with various networks systems, and to be extended so that routing operations (such operations as StartTransmission, SendDocument, ReceiveDocument, EndTransmission, or StatusCheck) can be readily used with other network services.","The DocTrans module can be implemented as an independently configurable software module that transports content and related metadata across computer networks. It can function as a communication layer between various computer networks and network servers that perform discrete document creation, storage and transmission tasks. The DocTrans module can operate independently of the originating message service or source of a document to perform operations on documents, such as send, receive, or cache documents and messages, once a task is loaded, and can operate independently to receive items (such as facsimile tasks) for forwarding later. It permits flexible, programmable, and optimized rules-based routing of documents in various message formats and on multiple network types.","Conventional fax products did not provide board servers with loading balancing capabilities or analysis of cost, time, or security rules for routing across multiple types of document and messaging protocols (e.g., MIME, SMS, T.37 fax, T.38 fax). By contrast, the DocTrans module is extensible to perform document transport and load equalization on virtually all document types and network types using those messaging protocols. This feature is prevalent now given the wide use of multifunction devices such as all-in-one print\/scan\/copy\/fax\/telephone\/answering machine devices, which may be enhanced with audio & video capture, messaging, email, network router & gateway capabilities. It is also a benefit to use DocTrans modules to integrate messaging and workflow operations when using standalone machines that perform these functions on a network.","Turning now to the figures,  and the following discussion provide a brief, general description of a suitable computing environment in which aspects of the invention can be implemented. Although not required, aspects and embodiments of the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as routines executed by a general-purpose computer, e.g., a server or personal computer. Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the invention can be practiced with other computer system configurations, including Internet appliances, hand-held devices, wearable computers, cellular or mobile phones, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, set-top boxes, network PCs, mini-computers, wireless network devices, mainframe computers and the like. The invention can be embodied in a special purpose computer or data processor that is specifically programmed, configured or constructed to perform one or more of the computer-executable instructions explained in detail below. Indeed, the term \u201ccomputer\u201d, as used generally herein, refers to any of the above devices, as well as any data processor.","The invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments, where tasks or modules are performed by remote processing devices, which are linked through a communications network, such as a Local Area Network (\u201cLAN\u201d), Wide Area Network (\u201cWAN\u201d) or the Internet. In a distributed computing environment, program modules or sub-routines may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices. Aspects of the invention described below may be stored or distributed on computer-readable media, including magnetic and optically readable and removable computer discs, stored as firmware in chips (e.g., EEPROM chips), as well as distributed electronically over the Internet or over other networks (including wireless networks). Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that portions of the invention may reside on a server computer, while corresponding portions reside on a client computer. Data structures and transmission of data particular to aspects of the invention are also encompassed within the scope of the invention.","Referring to , one embodiment of the invention employs a computer , such as a personal computer or workstation, having one or more processors  coupled to one or more user input devices  and data storage devices . The computer is also coupled to at least one output device such as a display device  and one or more optional additional output devices  (e.g., printer, plotter, speakers, tactile or olfactory output devices, etc.). The computer may be coupled to external computers, such as via an optional network connection , a wireless transceiver , or both.","The input devices  may include a keyboard and\/or a pointing device such as a mouse. Other input devices are possible such as a microphone, joystick, pen, game pad, scanner, digital camera, video camera, and the like. The data storage devices  may include any type of computer-readable media that can store data accessible by the computer , such as magnetic hard and floppy disk drives, optical disk drives, magnetic cassettes, tape drives, flash memory cards, digital video disks (DVDs), Bernoulli cartridges, RAMs, ROMs, smart cards, etc. Indeed, any medium for storing or transmitting computer-readable instructions and data may be employed, including a connection port to or node on a network such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) or the Internet (not shown in ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"202"},"At block , the routine applies dialing or routing rules to the indicated document. The dialing or routing rules determine how the facility is to transport or route a document. As an example, dialing or routing rules may indicate that a document that is to be sent at a specific time or is from a particular user is to be sent using a specific document transport.","At block , the routine selects a target based on the applied dialing or routing rules. As examples, the routine may select a public service telephone network (\u201cPSTN\u201d), another RightFax server, a board server containing one or more communications devices, and so forth. As examples, the DocTrans may select a target based on metadata, type of document, or other attributes relating to the document.","At block , the routine routes the document to the selected target. The selected target may perform additional analyses on the document and route the document to another DocTrans so that the document can be routed appropriately.","At block , the routine returns.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["302","304","310","306","308"]},"Extensibility and Routing Priorities","Since the DocTrans operates independently of network connections, content servers, or network resources providing the document, it can readily be configured to handle multiple document types and route documents to multiple types of network connections. As an example, the addition of email MIME types provides a secure and reliable transport for email from any point on the network. Moreover, the facility can confirm deliverability of the email, verify or certify receipt of contents and attachments; confirm results of operations performed by the DocTrans in routing the document to various network nodes for storage, transmission, and notifications; and so forth. By using rules that employ a TCP\/IP transport between RightFax servers with encryption and secure session protocols (e.g., contrasted with open transmission on telephone lines), the DocTrans can provide secure routing of documents, such as facsimile (\u201cfax\u201d) documents. To secure email messages and attachments, the fax server could provide certified delivery for documents or messages encrypted by the source server. As an example, the fax server could employ independent sender and recipient verifications and notifications for certified delivery.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","408","406","404"]},"Because the system has access to the intranet and Internet, it can verify and certify that emails and any related documents were delivered or that web links contained therein can be accessed. The system can deliver documents via alternate transport mechanisms. For example, if an email with MIME attachments could not be delivered, the system could alternately route the email text as an SMS message and provide the attachments as file pathnames or URL links. Alternatively, the DocTrans system can convert an SMS message into a facsimile, or a facsimile into a Fax-Over-IP (FOIP) document, and send it using one of several facsimile transports (e.g., telephone line, or T.37\/T.38 fax over IP, etc.). The DocTrans system can also confirm the origin, validity, delivery and source of the document as required by using an independent, secure notification and document validation method.","In this manner, the system enables receiving and employing extensions for connecting to various transports, configuring dialing and routing rules for these transports, and handling the routing of message protocols, such as for MIME, SMS, T37 Fax, T38 Fax, and RightFax server. The system also enables extensions for specific facsimile hardware, such as Eicon and Brooktrout. Third party vendors that use RightFax (\u201cRF\u201d) server for their document transport can enhance their capabilities by using DocTrans.","Least-Cost Routing","Least-cost routing rules enable transmission of facsimile documents over TCP\/IP connections to other RightFax servers or to local multifunction printer devices, where the document may be printed, sent at local telephone rates rather than long distance rates, or transmitted over an available TCP\/IP connection. In particular, using server-to-server IP network transmission of faxes enables managing the long-distance calling costs of sending faxes on telephone networks. Moreover, the facility can then employ local storage to replicate documents. The ability to store-and-forward documents in local networks (e.g., in RightFax servers or client inboxes) with logging for verification of receipt and retention of copies, enables re-transmission to be accomplished locally should the printed document or original email attachment be lost or inadvertently deleted.  is a block diagram illustrating rules for least-cost-routing and for store-and-forward document transport in some embodiments. According to the illustrated embodiment, rules for least-cost-routing and for store-and-forward document transport on the network can be applied by the queuing and routing system. The correct routing for a document can be determined with reference to the document type, transport protocol, availability of communications channels, availability of and load on network resources, and so forth.","A document  with metadata (e.g., metadata that contains information pertaining to a sender) enters a server queue  of a DocTrans. After routing rules  are applied to the document (e.g., based on the metadata) the document is scheduled on one of DocTrans's queues . These queues allow the DocTrans to treat all document types in a similar fashion. As an example, all Transport Mechanisms (\u201ctransports\u201d)  can implement the same or a similar application program interface (API) to interact with these queues and receive documents for transmission. DocTrans is also able to identify documents based on document type (e.g., SMS, email, or RightFax) or transmission type (e.g., fax board transmission, T.37 transmission, or T.38 transmission). The transports act as plug-ins to the DocTrans (e.g., all have identical or similar interfaces, such as for various operations including StartTransmission, SendDocument, ReceiveDocument, EndTransmission, etc.) and new libraries supporting these operations can extend transmission capabilities in the DocTrans to add a new protocol. Also, in some embodiments, a queue will be serviced if a transport that services that type of queue has been configured on the DocTrans. In some embodiments, the document may be enqueued when () a transport associated with a queue is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","604","606","608","610","612","608","610","612","604"]},"Upon receiving a document, the DocTrans module delivers the document  to the RightFax Server. The DocTrans module may also send notifications to the RightFax Server upon receipt of a document .","Load Balancing","Load balancing is a factor that DocTrans modules use to determine whether a document is to be processed or forwarded to another DocTrans module. All DocTrans modules can perform load equalization based on a comparison of its load with other DocTrans modules in the network. Rules based on such formulae may be applied using cost parameters, transmission times, schedule times, security or priority parameters, and routing and destination information. Similarly, a DocTrans module can be used in conjunction with a workflow application or simulation engine to estimate and to optimize such rules before or during their application to a document transmission task. As an example, DocTrans modules may perform load balancing based on the following formula: (total of X pages from Y Documents)\/(number of send channels).","Another method varies the load calculation by channel and content type, such as by using the following formula:\n\n(Waiting Pages Of This Type*Expected Transport Time Per Page Of This Document Type)\/Number # of Channels Sending This Document Type.\n","These formulae may be evaluated for each document type. For example, if e-mail can be sent in 3 seconds and a fax can be sent 1 minute, there are 60 one \u201cpage\u201d e-mails queued, 50 one page faxes queued, and there are 2 e-mail channels, and 24 fax channels, the e-mail load would be:\n\n60*3\/2=90\n\nand the fax load would be:\n\n50*60\/24=125\n\nManaging Network Connections\n","If a resource is unavailable, such as because of a server outage, it may not be considered for load balancing for a period of time (e.g., 40 minutes) to permit the resource to be restored or reconfigured. This applies to DocTrans, PSTN, Board Servers, and RightFax servers. In some cases, the system may use the local DocTrans to PSTN connection to transmit documents, even if that is not the preferred configuration or least-cost routing for the document, such as when other network resources are unavailable.","Grouping Using DocTrans","Conventional facsimile transmission has costs associated relating to connections, such as call initiation and duration. The process of grouping avoids contention for connection resources or accrual of connection initiation charges when multiple documents are directed to the same destination. Grouping can prevent tasks from waiting on a \u201cbusy\u201d line while other tasks to the same destination are sending documents.","The grouping process can be implemented as follows: set the number of pages or length of the transmission (to prevent unlimited send time on the channel), identify and cache queued documents with the same destination identifier, open connections on the transport, and send the documents with the same destination identifier over the open connection.","The group send feature may update its cache of queued documents with documents that enter the queue during transmission of a group, so long as the new documents share the same destination identifier.","Implementation of DocTrans in Various Embodiments:","In various embodiments, a framework for accepting a plug-in style implementation DLL for each transport type (or group of types) is provided. Each DLL implements a predefined set of entry points that enable support of various transport types.","Each entry point takes a resizable context structure that supports all information transferred between the DocTrans and the DLL. The document transports tolerate changes in the context structures' sizes, and each document transport independently supports operations such as store & forward, task scheduling, sender or recipient intervention, least-cost routing rules, document or task lifespan, and deliver-or-delete options without breaking the document task.","Configurable Queue Processor:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","704","706","702","704","704","706","704","708"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["802","804","806","807","808","810","810","810","810","810"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"902"},"At block , the routine retrieves the document.
