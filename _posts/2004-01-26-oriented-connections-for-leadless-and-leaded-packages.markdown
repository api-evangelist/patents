title: Oriented connections for leadless and leaded packages
abstract: The invention discloses design concepts and means and methods that can be used for enhancing the reliability and extending the operating life of electronic devices, and assemblies incorporating such devices, and substrates and/or PCBs, especially if such assemblies are exposed to severe environments such as thermal cycling or power cycling. The main thrust of the invention is to provide flexible joints, such as columns, between the attached components, and preferably to orient such joints, so that they would present their softest bending direction towards the thermal center or fixation point of the assemblies. Joints with rectangular or elongated cross-section are preferred, and they should be oriented so that the wide face of each joint would be facing the thermal center, perpendicular to the thermal deformation ray emanating from the thermal center towards the center of each respective joint. The concepts apply equally to leadless packages as well as to leaded packages.

Diaz; Assignee: Raychem Corp., Menlo Park, Calif.","Not Applicable","Not Applicable","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to means and methods for attaching devices to each other, more particularly to attaching electronic devices and packages on to each other, or on to substrates or Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), etc. The invention relates to both leadless packages, such as BGAs or LCCCs, as well as to leaded packages, such as DIPs.","The invention further relates to the reliability and long operating life of assemblies incorporating such devices, and more specifically, when such assemblies are exposed to harsh operating or environmental conditions, such as power cycling or thermal cycling, and more specifically yet, when the different components of such assemblies have different Thermal Coefficients of Expansion (TCEs), what is referred to TCE Mismatch.","Furthermore, the invention relates to the connecting means, such as leads, legs, solder joints and the like, both for the leadless as well as the leaded devices, and the shape and orientation\/positioning of these connecting means, especially as to how all this would affect the reliability and long operating life of such assemblies, especially when exposed to the above mentioned operating conditions.","The products covered by this present application can be divided into two groups. The first group includes any leadless devices, such as Ball Grid Array Packages (BGAs), Leadless Ceramic Chip Carriers (LCCCs) or any other leadless packages. The second group includes any leaded devices, such as Dual-In-Line Packages (DIPs), or any other leaded packages.","I will first provide a general introduction and background applicable to both groups of products, and then another one, more expanded, applicable to each of the two groups of products separately.","Note: The examiner may decide that both groups of products are so related, that they can be processed as one application. However, if the examiner decides that they should be divided into two separate applications, then I would abide by that decision. Please advise.","2. Prior Art","In my opinion, there is nothing in the Prior Art that resembles the concepts covered by this present invention.","The only thing that could be considered prior art is what has been covered in my prior applications, i.e. in Ref1 through Ref6, which were cited\/listed in the cross-reference section at the beginning of the application. However, this present application is either a continuation or a continuation-in-part to those references.","The main object of this invention is to improve and enhance the reliability and long operating life of assemblies incorporating leadless and\/or leaded devices, especially when such devices are mounted on or attached to each other or to substrates or Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), and more specifically, when such assemblies are exposed to harsh operating or environmental conditions, such as power cycling or thermal cycling and more specifically yet, when the different components of such assemblies have different Thermal Coefficients of Expansion (TCEs) [TCE mismatch].","The reliability issues can be divided into several different groups. The most talked about issue is with surface to surface interconnections\/mounting, and is the fact that the solder joints may crack and\/or delaminate from the solder pads and end up with open circuits.","There are however, a number of other problems that impair the reliability.","One new reliability issue is related to the new \u201clead-free\u201d solders that are being mandated to be used soon, to avoid problems related to solders containing lead (Pb). A new fact is starting to get heard about these new lead-free solders. It seems that there may be problems with the copper solder pads delaminating from the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) during the reflow\/mounting process, or at least getting weaker. See Ref13 above.","So, if this is true, then the concepts presented in this present invention will improve the reliability of such assemblies as well, because they will reduce the stresses on the pads, and hence less chance for them to delaminate or to fail prematurely.","It has been known in the industry that when two bodies are attached together, like in the case of a leadless electronic package mounted to a PCB, and the assembly is exposed to harsh environmental conditions, such as power cycling or thermal cycling, the joints between the two bodies can get overstressed and may fail prematurely. It has also been know\/shown that if the joints are elongated, like columns or leads or legs, instead of being wide, short, or stubby connections, then the life expectancy of such assemblies gets extended.","Furthermore, it was mentioned in the previous referenced applications, especially in Ref3, as well as in Ref5, that \u201cOriented Leads\u201d or \u201cColumns\u201d can improve the life and reliability of assemblies incorporating packages and substrates, especially if the components have some TCE mismatch, and if they are exposed to temperature fluctuations. I have also provided some sketches and drawings illustrating what I mean, as listed in Table 2 above.","Ref3, and especially Ref5, include a lot of descriptions and explanations about \u201corienting\u201d the leads, so that they would face the thermal center or thermal fixation point of the packages, or rather of the assemblies. I will refer to the explanations given in those cited references and will not repeat the explanations here.","I had also shown, in those references, a number of ways to achieve the desired designs and goals.","One method was to use a flat leadframe with the leg blanks oriented and radiating out directly from the plastic body, i.e. coming out of the plastic body, not in a direction that is perpendicular to the sides of the body, but at an angle in the correct, more desirable radial direction. The drawings were small and may have not been able to convey many of the details. I will show here in this specification some drawings that will clarify that embodiment.","However, I have shown in Ref6, another way of achieving the same end goal, but where the individual legs or leg blanks would first protrude out from the package body in an orthogonal direction, i.e. similar to the present \u201cconventional\u201d way, and then each \u201cleg blank\u201d would curve, while still flat, a certain part of a circle and then end up in a special desired direction for each specific leg, as will be explained in the following specifications","In the following pages, I will include and describe some additional examples of how we can capitalize on this theory; i.e. using oriented leads or columns.","The invention can basically be described simply by saying that it proposes to observe two specific things when attaching two bodies or components together, especially when the bodies are expected to be exposed to harsh environmental conditions.","1. Make the connecting elements, which will join the two bodies together, to have some flexibility, to allow and\/or compensate for dimensional variations between the two bodies, e.g. from thermal expansion or contraction. One example is to make the joints like tall columns, i.e. slender, elongated, and possibly curvilinear, elements, ideally situated at a generally perpendicular angle to the general surface of the bodies. We would refer to them as \u201ccolumns\u201d. The columns would act as \u201cflexible joints\u201d, and will provide for a way to compensate for the deformation of the bodies under the prevailing conditions. Note: If the dimensional variations are expected to be in more than one direction, then the flex joints should be able to compensate for these variations in all their directions. Hence the flex joints should be able to flex in all the respective directions. This is why these joints could be curvilinear, to have more than one degree of freedom, yet to be strong enough to still retain the bodies together as required.","2. If the cross-section of these columns is not round or square, then orient the columns, so that they would provide the least resistance to flexing. For example, if the columns would have an oblong or elongated or rectangular cross-section that is generally longer than its width, or in other words, has a long axis and a short axis, then these columns would be oriented so that their wider surfaces would be facing generally in the direction toward the thermal center or the fixation point of the package or the assembly. We can also rephrase that by saying that each column would be oriented such that the short axis of its cross-section would be in a direction of its respective thermal deformation ray, which would be emanating from the thermal center of the package, or from the fixation point of the package, and going to the center of the cross-section of each column.","In addition, some variations in the shape and construction of the columns are covered by the present invention, as will be described below, together with some additional features.","The main object of the invention is to mount such devices, especially electronic packages, on their substrates, using special connecting means, hereinafter referred to as Oriented Connections, so as to improve the performance life and\/or reliability of such assemblies, especially with respect of Power Cycling, Thermal Cycling (columns) and\/or Shock and Vibration (columns & anchor).","The connecting means would generally be situated between the device and the substrate. They would be situated with the general axis of their elongated body to be generally perpendicular to the general surfaces of the device and the substrate. The connecting means would also have their cross-section, normal to their body axis, such that the cross-section would be elongated, or oblong, or rectangular.","Oriented Connections are connecting means, which have an elongated cross-section, whether rectangular, or oblong or any other shape, where the cross-section has one large dimension or length and a shorter dimension, generally perpendicular to the first one, or width. Consequently, we can say that the cross-section would have one long axis and one short axis perpendicular to the long axis.","These connecting means would be oriented such that the short axis of the cross-section would be in line with, or approximately in line with, a thermal deformation ray, which emanates from the thermal center, or fixation point of the device, and which radiate towards the center or near the center of the cross-section of the connecting means.","The invention will also show at least two or more ways of shaping the legs\/leg blanks of leaded packages in a certain specific way for each individual leg of these packages. This can be accomplished by twisting the legs or by shaping the leg blank in such a way that a simple folding operation would accomplish the same end result.","In the case of leaded packages, most of the legs, in Ref3 and Ref5, were twisted to orient them as desired. In a few cases, the legs were not twisted, but were \u201cfolded\u201d. See Ref5, FIGS. 20 through 22, FIGS. 25 and 26, and FIGS. 32 through 40, as well as in Ref3, pages PP-D-5 and 6, 82 through 87, 99 and 100, and pages PP-AD-45 and 46. This Invention will provide more examples of leaded plastic packages with \u201coriented\u201d legs, without twisting the legs. It will also give more examples of solder pads, which could accept both the conventional package legs as well as the new proposed package legs, which were shown in Ref3, pages PP-D-104 and 105, as well as in Ref5, FIGS. 23 and 24.","In the case of leadless packages, the invention will expand on the concepts shown in Ref3, pages PP-D-1, 42, and PP-AD-66, as well as many of the concepts described in Ref5, under the group of \u201cleaded\u201d packages.","The Invention provides means and methods of accomplishing the above goals and objectives.","As mentioned above, the application covers two groups of devices, the leadless and the leaded devices.","I will first describe the embodiments for the leadless devices and then those of the leaded devices.","Definitions","Vertical, Horizontal, etc.","When we talk about packages or the like being mounted on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or substrates or the like, we most of the time, visualize that the PCB is laying on a horizontal table, and that the package is being mounted to it, where the body of the package is parallel to the PCB. Hence, we say the PCG and the package are horizontal. If the package is leaded, we then say that the legs of the package are vertical. If the package is leadless, but we want to provide columns between the package and the PCB, then we say that the columns will be vertical, figuring that they will be perpendicular to the general package body direction and\/or to the PCB general position.","Usually, the legs of leaded packages are made of flat sheet metal, blanked and formed, etc. The legs are vertical, and the legs axes are also vertical. We kind of ignore the part of the legs that is close to the package body and that is still horizontal.","Usually the legs cross section is rectangular, where the width of the rectangle is the thickness of the sheet metal and the length of the rectangular is several times larger than its width.","We also talk about the face of the leg, or the wide face of the leg, which is the side of the leg formed by the length of the cross section rectangle. I will refer to this face of the leg and state that it should face the thermal center of the package or of the assembly. It is as if a person is standing inside the leg, and facing in that direction.","Thermal Deformation:","When a body is at room temperature or at any initial temperature, and then it gets heated or cooled, it expands or contracts respectively. The changes in its dimensions correspond to the amount of temperature change and to the dimensions of the body. They also correspond to the Thermal Coefficient of Expansion (TCE) of the body's material. These changes in dimensions will be referred to hereinafter as \u201cThermal Deformation\u201d.","Thermal Center","FIGS. 4 and 5 in Ref5, drawings sheets 4\/72 and 5\/72, illustrate the concept of the \u201cthermal center\u201d. If a package is heated or cooled, then the body of the package will expand or contract, and every point on\/in the body will move along a certain line or \u201cray\u201d, in a direction of the lines shown in the figures. Each of these lines or rays has 2 ends, obviously. One end is at the individual point of the body being considered, and the other end is at some fixed point in the body. If the point of the body is fixed or anchored at a certain point in space, then this fixation point will be the other end of that line or ray. I will refer to such lines, as the \u201cthermal deformation rays\u201d, or simply \u201crays\u201d. I will refer to that fixed point as the \u201cthermal fixation point or center\u201d.","If, on the other hand, the package is not fixed at any specific point, but is simply attached to another body via the leads, legs or solder joints, which are evenly distributed along the body, then we can say that the package is \u201cfloating\u201d. In this case, we can consider that the geometric center of the package is its \u201cthermal center\u201d. This of course assumes that the package is homogeneous, and that all its elements are equal and symmetrical and balanced. It also assumes that all the joints are approximately equally strong or stiff and equally distributed around on the package. So, in such as case, all the thermal deformation rays will start at the geometrical center of the package, which will be considered to be its \u201cthermal center\u201d as well, and the rays will emanate from that center and go in a direction towards any specific point under consideration.","There will be other definitions that will be introduced during the course of describing the invention. In most cases, I will try to highlight the fact that these are new definitions.","While the invention is susceptible of various modifications and alternative constructions, certain illustrated embodiments thereof have been shown in the drawings and will be described below in detail.

I will also include a number of examples in this section, which should be considered as part of the embodiments for the purpose of this application as well.","This description covers more than one invention.

However, if Examiner desires, I could very easily include either all or a few of those figures here in this specification as well.","Please advise.","Review of Some \u201cNatural Phenomena\u201d","Basically, most of the information in this section could be considered as part of \u201cMaterial Science\u201d or \u201cMetallurgy\u201d or \u201cPhysics\u201d. Probably no new information for most of the readers.

Their dimensions are usually covered by JEDEC Standards or the like.","So far, all such packages have been either square or rectangular, where their two main central axes are orthogonal, i.e. perpendicular to each other, and the sides of the packages are straight and parallel to the central axes. The solder pads also have always been ORTHOGONAL in their location and\/or shape, as well. By this I mean that the solder pads are laid out along rows and columns that are orthogonal and parallel to the central axes and sides of the package body. Examples of such packages are the BGAs and LCCCs mentioned above. It is also important to notice that when the pads are not round, i.e. when they are square or rectangular, then the pads sides also are orthogonal and parallel to the sides and central axes of the package.","How the Shape of the Solder Pad Affects the Shape of the Solder Joint","Another basis for the proposals in this invention is the fact that in general a solder joint usually follows or imitates the shape of the solder pad, which it is attached to. Another thing is that the distance between the two pads that are being attached together, most of the time, one pad on top of the other, and the amount of solder present at the joint to start with, also affect the shape of the solder joint.","I will first explain what I mean by that and then show how we can take advantage of this phenomenon to create the kind of solder joints that would work best for us.","To do that, I will use two cases. Case 1 is where we have one solder pad, with some solder molten and reflown on top of this pad. Then, Case 2 is where we have two solder pads being joined together with a certain amount of solder between them and with a certain distance between the pads.","Note to the reader: Most of the text in this section had been included in Ref6. Ref6 has also a number of figures that go along with this text. I will not duplicate those figures here in this application. I would rather like to refer the reader to those figures in Ref6.","CASE 1: One Solder Pad with Solder on Top of it.","First, the effect of the shape of the solder pad.","Solder is well known for its high surface tension and its strong capillary characteristic and its affinity to wet to surfaces of materials that are wettable to it. Of course, this happens when the solder is molten and is free to move around, and when the wettable surfaces are also hot enough and clean as well, so that the solder would not freeze and would adhere to those surfaces. As a result, when we have a proper amount of solder and reflow it on top of a pad made of solder wettable material, like copper, then the molten solder will spread on the surface of the pad and create a layer of solder on the surface of the pad. Of course the solder pad itself should also be hot enough and up to the proper temperature, and should be clean as well.","Second, the available amount of solder will affect the shape of the solder on top of the pad.","If the amount of solder is enough, then the solder will cover the whole surface of the pad. If there is still enough solder, then we will see a \u201cpillow\u201d of solder, with the pad as its base and a \u201cdome\u201d formed on top of the pad. The height of the dome will depend on the available amount of solder. The edges of the dome will be touching the edges of the pad. If the pad is round, then the pillow will have a round base, too. If the pad is rectangular, then the pillow's base will be rectangular exactly like the pad (see Ref6, FIG. B-6, sketch #9, (Not Shown), which I will talk more about later), and if the pad is irregular in shape, then the base of the pillow will have a corresponding irregular shape similar to that of the pad (as in Ref6, FIG. B-7, sketch #G. (Not Shown), which I will talk more about later also).","Example, or case in point.","Ref11, which is the Article that was attached as part of Ref6, pages OC-A-06 through -11, \u201cZero Clearance . . . , showed in its FIG. 4, page OC-A-09, some solder pads that are covered with solder masks. The mask in the Left Hand Side (LHS) picture does not completely cover the \u201cneck\u201d or \u201ctail\u201d of the solder pads, which is the part of the copper trace that connects the different pads together. The picture on the Right Hand Side (RHS) shows the better solder mask, which does not leave any part of the neck exposed. The article is touting this new solder mask technique for other reasons, but this new technique (RHS) has another advantage. It produces a \u201cbalanced\u201d solder joint.","One of my business associates, and let's call him Bill, was telling me about a problem they had when they solder reflowed their BGAs on their Substrates. Some of the solder pads had \u201cnecks\u201d as shown in the RHS picture of the above article. Bill was saying that the solder joints that had these necks were distorted in shape. They were not round as they were supposed to, but had a shape that followed roughly the shape of the pad with the neck. And the joints were \u201cpulling\u201d sideways. So in order to compensate for that, Bill put an additional (fake or idle) neck on the opposite side of the existing neck, to balance out the solder joint. This gave me one hint for my proposed designs here.","My Ref6, FIGS. A-1 through A-4, (Not Shown), illustrate the concept in some more detail. Ref6, FIG. A-1 shows three solder pads connected together by \u201cnecks\u201d, as in the figures of the article mentioned above. I have drawn on one of the pads a solder joint, roughly as Bill had described it to me. Ref6, FIG. A-2 shows an illustration of a board with two solder pads, with a neck connecting them. A solder mask covers the board, leaving an opening around each of the solder pads. The open circle in the mask is too large and leaves a certain portion of the neck exposed, as seen in the figure. Ref6, FIG. A-3 shows the shape of the solder joint, connecting two boards or two components, having solder pads with similar necks, e.g. a BGA on top of a board. Here I am not showing the top pad. (I will talk more about joining two components, further down below). The joint here would have a protrusion, which I will refer to as the \u201cneck knob\u201d. Ref6, FIG. A-4 shows the cross section of the solder joint at different elevations. The top and bottom sketch shows the cross section near the pads, while the middle sketch shows the cross section near the middle of the height of the joint. You can see that the middle section is more rounded and the neck knob is not as pronounced, not as \u201cangular\u201d, as in the two other cross sections. The top and bottom sections are influenced heavily by the shape of the pads, while the middle section is less influenced by them and so the high surface tension of the solder takes over and tries to smoothen out the shape of the column and to make the cross section more uniform and more round.","Second, the Amount of Solder.","If we keep increasing the amount of solder, that will be reflown over the pad, then we will notice the following progression of events.","First, with just barely enough solder to cover the surface of the pad, and assuming that there is enough to cover the whole surface of the pad, then the solder pillow will be very thin and not tall at all. The edges of the pillow will show a slight small wetting angle, that is the angle between the surface of the pad and the outer upper surface of the pillow will be only a few degrees, say 5 degrees for argument's sake.","Then, if we add more solder to the pillow and while the solder is still molten, then the pillow will increase in height or thickness. We will also notice that the wetting angle will increase. It can become 15 degrees.","By adding more solder and keeping it molten, then the pillow will become fatter and higher, but its edges of its base, which is touching the pad, will still be confined to the shape of the pad. The wetting angle will become larger, until it would reach a 90 degrees angle. Here we can say that the pillow's edges are vertical and stay vertical for a certain height and then taper down inwards to the center of the pillow so that at the center the surface of the pillow is horizontal again, as expected. Assuming that the pad is horizontal.","If we add more solder yet, then the wetting angle would be larger than 90 degrees. This means that the solder pillow will become larger than its base. The base of the pillow will still have the same shape of the pad, but the pillow will have a \u201cbelly\u201d that bulges out beyond the pad. We can say that its \u201cfootprint\u201d has become larger than its base.","If we keep adding more solder, then we may reach a point where the solder may form a solder ball. The ball may still have a base that resembles the shape of the pad, but gradually the ball would become more like a sphere.","If the pad is round, then the solder ball will keep its true spherical shape or pretty close to it. If the pad had a different shape, other than round, say like a rectangle, then the solder pillow will start as a rectangular base, and then when it reaches the proportions of a ball, then the ball would be more oblong, like a watermelon say.","CASE 2: Two Solder Pads, Being Joined Together, (One on Top of the Other), See Ref6, FIGS. B-1 through B-7.","First, the Shape of the Pads.","We can start by having both pads having the same shape. The solder, when molten, will wet the bottom pad and try to cover its whole surface. When that is accomplished and if the amount of solder is appropriate and if the solder had already reached and touched the top pad, then it will wet to the top pad as well and will try to have the shape of the top pad as well.","If the volume of solder is correct, then the solder joint between the two pads will have its edge walls almost vertical and straight. If both pads were round, then the solder joint would look like a perfect uniform round disk. See Ref6, FIG. B-1. If the pads were square, then the solder joint would look like a perfect square block. See Ref6, FIG. B-2. If the pads were rectangular, then the solder joint would be like a perfect prism or parallelepiped. See Ref6, FIG. B-3.","Second, the Distance or Gap between the Two Pads.","The height of the solder joint will be affected by a number of factors. If the vertical distance between the pads is controlled by some external means, e.g. a mechanical fixture or a solid metal ball placed between the two components to act as a spacer, then the volume of the solder joint should correspond to the space between the two pads, which would be proscribed by (equal to) the surface areas of any of the two pads times the distance between the two pads.","If on the other hand, there is no mechanical fixturing holding the space fixed and constant, then probably the weight of the top component will affect the final distance between the pads. There will be a balance between the weight (pushing downwards) and the surface tension of the molten solder (trying to keep the solder shape more as a ball, thus pushing upwards) to come up with some case of equilibrium. The result could be that, even for the ideal volume of solder, we would get a shorter joint which would bulge out more or less depending on the magnitude of the top weight pushing downwards on top of the solder joint.","Let us dream here for a moment.","Suppose again that we are starting with the ideal volume of solder, and that we are using a fixture to control the space between the two pads. When the solder is molten and the solder has wetted both bottom and top pads, then we move and adjust the distance between the top pad with respect to the lower one. If the distance between the pads is correct and just right, then the edge walls of the solder joint will be fairly vertical and the solder joint would be \u201cuniform\u201d in cross section. Now suppose that the fixture moves and brings the top pad down a small amount. We would see that the solder joint would bulge out as described above. The cross section at the belly will be larger than at either top or bottom pad. Of course this has to happen while the solder is still molten and has to be done very carefully so as not to disturb the joint too badly and break it open. Now suppose we do the opposite. We let the fixture raise\/lift the top pad away from the bottom pad. Once we go above and beyond the \u201ccorrect\/ideal\u201d height, then we would notice that the solder joint would become thinner at the middle of its height. I suppose that it is relatively clear to the reader that by controlling the height or distance between the top and the bottom pad, we can control the shape of the solder joint. The larger the distance between the pads, the slimmer the joint. The size of the cross section near the middle of the solder height would vary inversely with the distance between the pads. That is of course assuming that we do not change the original volume of the solder at the joint, and assuming of course that all this is done while the solder is still molten and it is all done very carefully and without too much shaking and without disturbing the solder so much as to break the joint.","I believe that the reader can visualize all this, and that this whole thing is feasible.","Starved Solder Columns","The following set\/group of figures\/drawings marked B show various sets of pads and each set consists of a pair of such pads but at a different distance for each pair. The amount\/volume of solder in each case is supposed to be the same and constant. The idea here is to show how we could control the shape of the solder \u201ccolumn\u201d so as to achieve certain goals.","I will show how we could obtain solder columns that are more flexible under bending and that would enhance the operating life of the assembly, as compared to the conventional Solder Balls that are popular in the market nowadays.","Now, Let's go to the Group of Drawings Marked B.","Ref6, FIG. B-1, (Not Shown), shows three pairs of round solder pads, each pair consisting of one pad on top of another, with a certain distance (gap) between the two pads. I have marked the pairs as #4, 5 and 6. The distance (gap) between the pads in sketch #4 is small, the distance in sketch #5 is larger and the distance in sketch #6 is still larger yet. Assuming that we do not change the volume of solder between the pads, then it is clear that the joint will be skinnier (smaller diameter at the belly) the higher the distance (gap) between the pads.","Ref6, FIG. B-2 shows a similar arrangement, but with square pads. Again, the sketches try to illustrate that the solder joints will be skinnier when we increase the distance (gap) between the pads.","Ref6, FIG. B-3 again shows a similar arrangement, but with rectangular pads. Again, the sketches try to illustrate the same fact, that if the pads are pulled out away from each other, the joint will become skinnier the larger the distance (gap) between the pads.","Here I am also showing the area and shape of the cross section of the solder joint at about the middle of its height, which I will refer to as the \u201cwaist of the joint\u201d or simply the \u201cwaist\u201d. Sketch #4 shows the situation where the distance (gap) between the pads is small and the waist is still relatively fat. Sketch #5 shows the pads pulled apart more than in sketch #4 and the waist is slightly smaller than at the base\/pads, as shown in the top view. Sketch #6 shows that the pads have been pulled still further more apart, and the waist is still skinnier yet.","Ref6, FIG. B-4 shows the three cross sections superimposed on top of each other.","Ref6, FIG. B-5 shows a series of pad pairs, with the distance (gap) between the pads in each pair increasing progressively as the pairs go from left to right. It also shows how the solder joint would look like when the gap between the pads gets higher and higher or larger and larger. The pairs #4, 5 and 6 were shown in Ref6, FIG. B-3 earlier. Here we can see that the pair #7 and 8 may still be OK, and the waist there is getting still smaller and smaller or skinnier and skinnier. When we reach a certain large gap, like the one with pair #9, the solder joint would break and be interrupted. The solder will separate into two portions. The portion still hanging on to the top pad would look more like a pillow hanging down from the top pad and may try to look like a tear drop except that the shape of the pad, rectangular in this case, and the surface tension of the solder material would influence the shape of the solder pillow. The portion of solder material remaining on the bottom pad would look like another pillow, whose shape would depend on the volume of solder available there. See my above discussion about this.","Ref6, FIG. B-6 shows an enlarged view of pair # 7 & 9.","Ref6, FIG. B-7 shows a variety of sketches related to what I have discussed earlier above. Sketch #G is particularly interesting. It illustrates the fact that the solder joint would adopt the shape of the pad that it is attached to, and then when the solder gets farther away from the pad, then the solder gets away from the influence of the pad shape and gets more under the influence of its high surface tension. The latter tries to force the solder to become more like a ball or a cylinder. This would be the basis for our attempt to manipulate the shape of the joint and its cross section so that we would obtain solder joints that have ideal cross section shapes so as in turn we would optimize the operating life of our assemblies. For example, by adding the four protrusions, which I refer to as \u201cMickey Mouse Ears\u201d, at the corners of the rectangular pad as shown, we could force the solder joint to have a waist cross section that would be more \u201crectangular\u201d, i.e. with sharper square corner instead of rounded fillets, in contrast with the waist shown in Ref6, FIG. B-3 and B-4. We could also refer to this pad shape as the \u201cdog-bone\u201d-shaped pad.","Now, we will take all the above and go to the next step and apply it to create the proposed solutions as per the invention.","The invention discloses design concepts and means and methods that can be used for enhancing the reliability and extending the operating life of electronic devices, and assemblies incorporating such devices, and substrates and\/or PCBs, especially if such assemblies are exposed to severe environments such as thermal cycling or power cycling. The main thrust of the invention is to provide flexible joints, such as columns, between the attached components, and preferably to orient such joints, so that they would present their softest bending direction towards the thermal center or fixation point of the assemblies. Joints with rectangular or elongated cross-section are preferred, and they should be oriented so that the wide face of each joint would be facing the thermal center, perpendicular to the thermal deformation ray emanating from the thermal center towards the center of each respective joint. The concepts apply equally to leadless packages as well as to leaded packages.","The same applies to other packages, such as BGAs, where the pads are located on multiple rows or on a matrix, not only along one row near the periphery of the package.","Proposed Designs and Solutions & their Purpose:","In Ref5, I have proposed to have the legs of packages to be oriented, such that their wide surfaces would be facing the thermal center of the package and\/or the assembly. I have described that in Ref5, so I don't think I need to repeat the explanations and\/or the reasons in this present application again. See particularly FIGS. 4 and 5 in Ref5.","The purpose, summary and gist of the idea in this application here is two-fold:","It is preferred to use columns as the interconnecting elements, to join chips, packages, etc. to substrates or boards, instead of short, stubby joints. Such short joints usually undergo mostly \u201cshear stresses\u201d. I prefer to have tall joints, which would act like columns and would undergo mostly \u201cbending stresses\u201d. The reason is that such columns would act as \u201cflex joints\u201d between the two components and would absorb the dimensional differences when such an assembly would be exposed to temperature fluctuations. These flex joints would then be under bending stresses, compared with the short stubby joints, which would be under shear stresses. And by selecting the proper dimensions for the columns, we can get the bending stresses down to a level that would not reduce the life expectancy of these joints, but would extend it to an acceptable operating life. PS: Since solder relaxes, it is not usually proper to talk about endurance limit, like with steel. With solder alloys and the like, the S-N curve keeps dropping down almost indefinitely. But we can specify a maximum bending stress, which would give us a \u201cgood\/long\u201d or acceptable life expectancy, or in other words, the cross section's short axis would be in line with, or approximately in line with, the thermal deformation ray from the thermal center of the device to the point under consideration.","2. It was also explained that if such columns have a cross section that is rectangular or elongated in shape, then it would be beneficial to orient the column and its cross section such that the wider face of the column would be facing toward the thermal center of the package or of the assembly.","Based on the above, I am proposing to create solder joints, to be tall, almost like columns, and where the columns would have cross-sections that are more elongated than circular, and that are oriented such that their wider surface of the columns would be facing the thermal center (TC) of the package or of the (anticipated) assembly, or the short axis of the cross-section in line with the thermal deformation rays.","Objectives:","My goal is three-folds.","First, I want that the joints between two devices attached together to allow for dimensional changes, without getting overstressed and without failing prematurely. I propose to make such joints as \u201ctall\u201d elements, such as columns, with their column axes generally perpendicular to the general surfaces of the devices. This applies to solder joints or any other legs or leads or elements joining two devices as such.","Second, I want to make the solder joints, so that the joints would have a rectangular or elongated cross section, if not round or square shape or any other symmetrical shape, and","Third, I want that the wide side of each joint would be oriented, so as to face the thermal center or fixation point, or in other words, the short axis of the joint cross-section would be approximately in line with its respective thermal deformation ray.","Benefits:","The detrimental effects of Thermal Expansion and Contraction on the joints, between the components, e.g. the package and the substrate, will be minimized.","As a side effect of the above, the resistance to shock and vibration will be enhanced, for two reasons. First, the fact that the leads\/beams are shaped to have their flat faces oriented to the thermal center or the thermal fixation point, makes it that some of the leads will almost always be present to withstand shock forces coming from different angle to the package. Second, we can calculate the natural frequency of the joints or leads based on their length and geometry, or we can empirically generate a relation between their length\/height and their frequency. Then, by knowing what vibration range or vibration spectrum we want the package to withstand, we can then select the most appropriate joint or lead dimensions to suit the specific individual case.","Some Additional Details","Some Embodiment Examples of Our Proposed Solution:","Group One: Attaching the leads\/legs to the periphery of the package:","Items 2, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 in Table 2 above show examples of such legs, i.e. attached to the periphery of the package. I will not elaborate much more here on these legs, because I think the idea is already clear enough, and covered enough in Ref3 and Ref5.","Group Two: Attaching the leads\/legs to the of the surface of the package facing the other component:","Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13 and 19 in Table 2 above show legs that are attached to the surface of the packages, i.e. the surface facing the other component to which the package will be connected. We can call them surface mounted.","This kind of \u201csurface mounted\u201d leads\/legs\/joints will be the main topic of the first group of products in this application, while \u201cleaded\u201d packages will be in the second group.","It can be visualized that there could be the following variations for such surface mounted leads.","A. Discrete leads, such as those shown in items 4, 5, 6, 7 and 13. These could be preformed and could be soldered at both ends, i.e. one end to be soldered to the package, while the other end to be soldered to the substrate. We could also envision that we could use an appropriate (conductive) adhesive, instead of solder, to attach the leads at either end. The leads would be \u201coriented\u201d during the attachment process, as shown in item 4, 7, and 13, as per this invention.","B. Discrete tape-bonded leads. These would be tape\/ribbon bonded, as shown in item 20, at one end to one of the components, preferably the package. The other end of the lead would be soldered or attached by some means, e.g. conductive adhesive, to the substrate. Again, the leads would be oriented, preferably during the bonding operation, so as to face the thermal center or the thermal fixation point, see definitions, of the assembly, as per this invention.","C. Discrete Solder Columns: Here again, we can have a number of variations and sub-variations. I will describe some of them briefly here and then will elaborate on a few of them further down below.","C-1. The discrete solder columns can be formed right on the spot, starting out with a solder ball and then shaping it during the reflow process to the desired shape of the flat, with elongated cross-section, oriented column. (See further below).","C-2. We could also preform the solder column as a generally flattened, with elongated cross-section, column and hold it in the proper orientation by a carrier wafer or a fixture and then attach it to the package first, and then to the substrate next. An example would be to take the CCMD solder columns, flatten them under a press or the like, so that each would have an oblong or elongated cross-section, but with the correct length, then insert each flattened column into a carrier wafer, such that each column would face the central thermal center of the package\/assembly. (See also Ref5).","C-3. We could also attach such flattened oriented solder columns, with elongated cross-section, to both the package and substrate in one operation, if we use something like the soluble\/disappearing carrier wafer. (See also Ref3 & Ref5).","C4. We could also use an appropriate (conductive) adhesive, instead of the solder, to attach the flattened oriented columns to the package and then to the substrate. Again, this can be done in two steps, or in one step, as explained above.","C-5. We could \u201cgrow\u201d the solder columns on the chip (or the package), by any of the various methods known in the industry. We just have to make sure that the cross section of the columns is flattened, with oblong or elongated cross-section, and that the columns are oriented so that the wide surface of the columns faces the thermal center, or the short axis of the column cross-section is in line with the respective thermal deformation ray, as per this invention.","Embodiments for Leadless Devices","Conventional Solder Pads (Prior Art):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0208","num":"0207"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0208"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0209"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Proposed Oriented Solder Pads an Solder Columns",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0212","num":"0211"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},"If we have a point of the package, \u201cfixed\u201d in space, then that point will act as the anchor, and all the thermal deformations will start or originate from that point. Hence, we can say that this \u201cfixation point\u201d is acting also as the new\/effective \u201cthermal fixation point\u201d, which would be equivalent to the \u201cthermal center\u201d. In such a case, all the thermal deformation rays will then be emanating from this \u201cfixation point\u201d. Again, this is in accordance with the earlier definitions.","According to this present invention, all the leads\/legs\/joints will have to be facing this thermal center or the thermal fixation point.","I have added another line inside each of the solder pads. This is a line that is perpendicular to each thermal deformation ray, which starts at the thermal center or the thermal fixation center of the package and proceeds to each individual pad. This new line would give us the preferred direction of bending axis of each respective solder column (or leg or lead), if we want to minimize the (bending) stresses on that column during the thermal expansion and contraction of the assembly. We will refer to this line as the \u201cpreferred bending line\u201d, or simply the \u201cbending line\u201d \u201cfor its respective pad\u201d. [DEFINITION].

The size of the core and the amount of meltable solder on top of the core, have to be calculated, so as to accomplish the desired end results, as explained below. The size of the core will be such that it will provide the proper height of the resulting end solder joint, and the size of the ball will be chosen, such that the amount of solder will not be enough to create a fat solder joint. It would rather give us the desired starved joint.","The end result is that when we place the mating package on top of another package or substrate, as in , and reflow, then the solder would melt and will start to wet both the top and bottom pads. The non-meltable core would either float in the middle of the joint, or fall to the bottom, or even may rise to the top, depending on its specific gravity and that of the molten solder.","The solder will wet the pads.

(See Top Figures of )","Let's first see what would happen, if we reflow the solder preform, without having the stand-offs.","Let's say we have the preform attached to the top device pads, and let's say that it is a BGA package. Sometimes, such a package with columns sticking out from its bottom is referred to as a \u201cdead roach\u201d or simply a \u201croach\u201d. It will also look very much like a Pin Grid Array Package (PGAP), except that the legs will be made out of those solder preforms.","Let's also say that the bottom device is another package or a substrate or rather, a PCB.","We place the roached BGA on the PCB, as in  or -B. I am showing only one preform and one stand-off here, just for clarity.","At this point in time, i.e. before the reflow process, the distance between the BGA and the PCB pads will be practically equal to the height of the preforms, plus whatever non-planarity that may beat the tips of the preforms. The pads themselves have their own thickness, which will add to the total gap between the bodies of the BGA and the PCB.","When we start the reflow process, the solder preforms will soften and start to melt. The bottom tips of the tallest preforms would be sitting on top of the PCB pads. If some preforms are slightly shorter, due to manufacturing tolerances, they will not be touching their respective PCB pads. In order to enhance the wetting, we can apply some flux on the PCB pads, or even some solder paste. This would help in connecting the preform to the pads and to transfer heat, and in keeping the surfaces of the pads clean, etc.","Once the taller preforms start to melt and the top BGA starts to move downwards, due to its own weight or due to some external forces, then these shorter preforms will reach their respective PCB pads and touch and wet.","I figured that one good way to explain the concept is to use some concrete dimensions, as in the example shown in . I will use these abbreviations for the various dimensions, which I have selected for this example:\n\n","Since we can easily assume that the volume of solder, not solder paste, will not change, and since we have decided and determined that the volume of the end resulting Starved columns VS is=2.96E-06 inch cube, then all the other volumes, i.e. VP, VC and VR, will also equal that same volume. We will use this knowledge\/assumption\/fact to determine the three remaining unknown values, i.e. HC, HR and HP. For these calculations here, we will assume that there are no solder fillets to affect our calculations.","We will now proceed with the case, where there are no stand-offs in this case.","In , we will also assume that the pads are Circular, and have a diameter DC of 0.025 inch, hence a surface area of 4.91E-04 inch square.","When the preforms will melt, each preform will try to wet all the surface of its respective pads and still tries to stay as one single \u201clump\u201d of solder. The top BGA will drop and will create solder joints, connecting each BGA pad to its corresponding PCB pad. These solder joints would have a similar shape as the pads, but they would have a much shorter height (HC), than the preform's original height (BP).","It is easy to calculate the joint height HC in this case, using simple mathematics.","The volume of the solder in the solder joint VC is=2.96E-06 inch cube, as discussed above. The area of its circular pad AC is=4.91E-04 inch square. Hence, the height  of this solder joint is=VC\/AC=0.0060 inch.","Note that we are assuming that the circular solder joint will have straight vertical wall, i.e. the joint is not fat or skinny, and that there will be no fillets effect.","This means that, for the same amount of solder that we need to create the 0.025 inch tall Starved column on a Rectangular pad that is 0.025 long by 0.010 wide, we would get a solder joint height of only 0.006 inch, if we had used a circular pad of 0.025 inch diameter.","In , we will again assume that the pads are Rectangular, and have a length LR of 0.025 inch and a width WR of 0.010 inch.","When the preforms will melt, again each preform will try to wet all the surface of its respective pads and still tries to stay as one single \u201clump\u201d of solder. The top BGA will drop and will create solder joints, connecting each BGA pad to its corresponding PCB pad. These solder joints would have a similar shape as the pads, but their height HR will be different.","Again, it is easy to calculate the joint height HR in this case, using similar mathematics, as above.","The volume of the solder joint VR is still=2.96E-06 inch cube, as discussed above. The area of its Rectangular pad AR is=2.50E-04 inch square. Hence, the height HR of this solder joint is=VR\/AR=0.0118 inch.","Note that we are again assuming that the Rectangular solder joint will have straight vertical wall, i.e. the joint is not fat or skinny, and again there is no fillets effect.","b) Reflow with Stand-Offs. (See Bottom Figures in )","Now, we will compare the above case with a case where we do use \u201cstand-offs\u201d or \u201cstops\u201d.","We will arrange to have the height of the stand-offs to be equal to the height of the Starved columns, plus the thickness of the solder pads on the BGA and the PCB. This is because the stand-off will not be placed between the pads themselves, but between the body of the BGA and the general surface of the PCB. If we assume that both groups of pads are 0.005 inch thick, then the height of the stand-offs should be HS+0.005+0.005=0.035 inch.","We have also decided to make the Preform with a diameter DP of 0.010 inch, hence its cross-section area AP is=7.85E-05 inch square.","And since we know that the volume VP of the Preform is equal to the volume VS of the Starved column, which is=2.96E-06 inch cube, we can now calculate the height HP of the Preform. HP will be=VP\/AP=0.377 inch.","This is the height of the Preform between the pads.","This means that the distance between the body of the BGA and the general body of the PCB would be=0.0377+0.005+0.005=0.0477 inch. This gives us the height of the Stand-Off, which then should be=0.0477 inch.","According to all the above calculations, we can see that, during the reflow process, the Preforms will collapse through a distance=0.0377-0.0250=0.0127 inch.","Other Preform Shapes","A similar situation would occur if the preforms were made of different shapes, but still with the same volume. For example, the preforms can have a conical shape as in  or E. As long as the volume is still equal to VP, i.e. the volume of the cylindrical preform described above, and all other parameters stay the same, then we should end up with the same height for the solder joints. Conical preforms can be cast directly on the BGA, more easily than if we would want to attach cylindrical preforms to the same package.","3-Use Solder Paste and Stand-Offs","A variation to the above method is to start with solder paste, that we would apply to one device, or to both. Ideally, the paste would be shaped as a \u201ccone\u201d, so that the volume\/amount of solder would be limited. We would have \u201cstops\u201d or \u201cstand-offs\u201d, as in . This leads us in a way into the next alternative. See Alternative 3, for the reason of having cones, i.e. tall shapes but with limited volume.","Special Embodiments","The above examples, using the preforms and the standoffs on circular pads, or even on square pads, i.e. on standard conventional packages and pads, can also be used in the industry, simply to provide the assemblies with \u201cflexjoints\u201d, and thus enhance their reliability and extend their operating life, compared with the normal cases of having short stubby solder joints.","We could extend this same thinking and apply it to other shapes of pads. For example the pads could be rectangular, or elliptical or oblong or elongated in any desirable fashion.","Then, the pads could also be \u201coriented\u201d as per the present invention, to take advantage of the additional expected benefits.","4-Shape Memory Method","We can also use shape memory materials, e.g. shape memory plastic like the one used by Raychem Corporation, now TYCO, to make their heat shrink tubing. We could also use shape memory metals, again used by Raychem. These metals include Tinel, which is a trade name for an alloy of Titanium Nickel, or Betalloy, which is a trade name for a shape memory Copper Alloy. Betalloy is also used to make eyeglasses frames, which can be deformed at will and when they get placed under a hot water faucet and the hot water hits them, they jump back to their original shape.","We can use such shape memory materials, plastics or metals, to create the \u201clifting\u201d devices\/means, to increase the distance between the mating pads and to stretch the solder joints\/columns.","So,  give examples of such a lifting device. They show a frame of some sort, which would have the desired \u201clifting\u201d features. These could have a sort of a \u201clip\u201d that would lodge between the package and the substrate. The lip would have been made originally with a certain thickness\/height. Then it would be cross-linked to keep its original manufactured shape in memory. Then it would be compressed cold, to make it thinner at room temperature. Then it would be place between the substrate and the package. When the stack gets in the oven to reflow the solder, the solder would melt and attach to both the substrate and the package, and then at the right time and\/or temperature, the lip would activate and remember its original shape and thickness, so it would lift the package increasing the gap between the package and the substrate, thus stretching the solder columns to their desired shape.","5-Selective Heating Method","We could also activate the memory of the lifting elements by other means. For example, using selective frequency lasers. We could use a laser with the proper frequency to melt and reflow the solder while the lifting elements are still dormant. When we know that the solder has molten and is attached to both the package and the substrate, then we activate the laser with a different frequency which would then wake up the memory of the lift elements so that they would lift the package and increase the gap and thus stretch the columns to the desired height and shape.","The frame with the lift elements can be made to be removed after the soldering operation is completed. It could be made with some breakaway tabs to facilitate its removal. It could also be made out a material that could be dissolved and removed this way, e.g. like the carrying wafer that was used with the CCMD. See Ref14, U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,382, invented by Geoffrey B. Wong, et al., and who were members of the effort on that project. In this case, we could have the lifting elements inserted in a similar dissolvable carrying wafer.","The lift elements could be made out of Betalloy or Tinel as mentioned above, and could be incorporated in the frame or in any other contraption that is suitable.","The lifting could be done also by other means, such as fixturing of any suitable shape or form, as desired by the particular user or manufacturer.","6-Lifting Element with Large TCE","Instead of using devices made of shape memory material to lift the top package, say the BGA, and to increase the gap between it and the lower PCB, we can use a lifting elements made out of a material that has a relatively large TCE. We could for example use a foam material, possibly closed cell foam, which would expand at a considerably larger rate than the other components in the assembly. We would place such a lifting means, let's just call it the foam, between the BGA and the PCB, where the foam would be much thinner than the height \u201cH2\u201d. During the reflow, the foam would expand but would still be smaller than the height \u201cH2\u201d, up to a certain point or rather up to a certain temperature. When the temperature reaches the liquidus temperature of the solder and the solder would melt totally, then the thickness of the foam will be just about equal to the height \u201cH2\u201d, just a little thinner. So, up to this temperature, the foam has not done any lifting. Then when the temp exceed the melting temp of the solder, and is in the reflow holding zone, the foam will expand to a larger size and will lift the BGA and increase the gap to H2 and then to goes beyond to H3, as required.","Other Embodiments of Oriented and Starved Solder Columns","A. Tall Preforms \u201cFall\u201d on the Stops and Package Rests on the \u201cStops\u201d (Devices and Methods):","Fill the solder with copper particle, so that we can shape it into the required preform shapes, like the \u201cLONG CONES\u201d, or the \u201c\u00bd TAPERED AND REST CYLINDRICAL COMPOSITE CONES\u201d, etc.","Preforms will be TALL AND SLENDER, Taller than the end-height of the finished column. The volume of the preform will be the same as the volume of the finished column. But since the finished column will be large at the base of the BGA and of the PCB, and May West at the center, then for the same volume, the height will be shorter.","During reflow of the tall slender preforms, the BGA will \u201cfall\u201d or \u201cdrop\u201d down, until its stops at the correct height, sitting on the \u201cstops\u201d, which will control the ultimate height of the solder columns.","B. Regular Solder Balls, \u201cLifted\u201d by \u201cMagic\u201d (Devices and Methods):","The solder balls are of regular, spherical shapes, or truncated spherical shapes.","The BGA is placed on the PCB and the solder is reflowed the normal way.","The BGA is lifted while the solder is molten, so that the solder joint gets stretched.","The molten solder will stay sticking to the solder pads on the PCB as well as on the BGA and will have a cross section that will match pretty closely the shape of the respective contact pads at each end of the solder joint.","The center portion, between the two pads, will get thinner and will form an hour glass shape, or a \u201cMay West\u201d waist shape.","By controlling the volume of the original solder ball and the areas of the contact pads of the PCB and of the BGA, and also the ultimate height of the \u201cstretched\u201d solder column, we can calculate pretty close enough, the new height of the solder joint. We will call this \u201cstretched or starved\u201d solder column.","C. The \u201cMagic\u201d that will \u201cLift\u201d the BGA","We can have an element placed between the BGA and the PCB, which would expand in its height so that the BGA gets lifter, AFTER THE SOLDER HAS MOLTEN AND HAS ATTACHED ITSELF TO THE CONTACT PADS OF BOTH THE BGA AND THE PCB.","The element can be made of expandable plastic, either using SHAPE MEMORY Features or using a foam plastic with certain \u201cair\u201d or other material.","The solder used for these assemblies could also be \u201cfilled solder\u201d, e.g. solder mixed with particles of copper or the like, to make it stick together and hold its shape better and longer than regular (unfilled) solder. Such filled solder is already in the prior art, and I have known it and encountered it since 1980 when I was working on my CCMD. However, I could not find it, when I did a patent search recently.","We could also use \u201cconductive adhesives\u201d to create and\/or to attach these oriented rectangular columns or starved columns, with or without solder, or with or without filled solder.","We could also start with the same preform material (column wire stock) that I had used for the CCMD, flatten it and insert it into carrier wafer, which have \u201coriented\u201d holes and where the flattened columns will be properly oriented, and then use that to mount packages on substrates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0331","num":"0346"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},"The left bottom figure\/sketch in  shows one way to \u201cgrow\u201d a uniform rectangular solder column, using for example the masking and deposition techniques used for the manufacturing of chips or multilayer boards, or simply using solder masks and the like.","We can also envision, that by using multiple, repeated steps of masking and deposition, we can shape the solder columns to have, already from the start, the desired end-shape of the hour-glass or the Mae West form, or a shape approximately close enough to it. This can easily be accomplished, say, by starting a first masking and deposition step, where the lower one third of the column would be large, then we would repeat the masking and deposition step, but with a narrower cross-section for the solder column, and then finally the third masking and deposition step would have again a large cross-section for the solder column. This would produce a solder column that has three sizes of cross-sections, step-wise, or step-shape profile. During the reflow, the shape will change from a step-shape profile, to a rather smooth-curve profile, due to the high surface tension of the solder. More than three steps could be used if necessary.","The right bottom figure shows a cross section of the figure on the left, but shows also the package sitting on top of the \u201cgrown solder column\u201d and also we could add some solder cream that could screen printed, so as to facilitate the wetting of the solder column to the pads on the substrate and\/or package.","Oriented Sockets & Universal Sockets","Once these packages and substrates with oriented pads become popular and used on the market, then we will need sockets that can handle such packages and can sit and be mounted on such substrates. It is easy to make such sockets and connectors. Simply install the contact springs in a way that would match the orientation of the pads, \u201cet voila!\u201d. Such sockets and connectors are part of this invention as well and I would like to claim them as well.","Other Quick Thoughts:","Based on the above, I am proposing to create solder columns that have a cross-section that is more elongated than circular, and where the columns are oriented such that their wider surface would be facing the thermal center of the package or of the anticipated assembly.","Another basis for this invention is the fact that a solder joint in general usually follow the shape of the solder pads it is attached to.","For that reason, I propose to shape the solder pads so as to be conducive to creating such solder joints.","So, the solder pads should be shaped to fit\/suit the desired ultimate shape of the column.","For example, if the column is desired to have a roughly rectangular cross-section, then the solder pad should also have roughly a rectangular shape.","The effect of the shape of the solder pad on the shape of the column cross-section does fade away as we move away farther from the pad along the solder column length\/height.","For example, if we start with square solder pads on both the package and the substrate, which will be joined together by a solder joint, then the following would be expected.","If the space between the two pads is very narrow (short height, or short gap or space between the pads), then the solder joint will have practically the same shape as the two solder pads, i.e. square, assuming the proper volume of solder is used.","If the solder volume is too large for the space available, the n the solder would bulge out and may even overflow. If allowed to float, then the joint may become higher\/taller as well.","If the volume is too small, and if the height\/space is allowed to float, then the thickness\/height of the joint would be smaller.","If the proper volume is provided, and if the two pads were pulled apart a certain distance, then we would be forming a \u201ccolumn\u201d. The shape of the column would depend on the ratio of H\/S, where H is the Height and S is the Side of the square.","For a small H\/S, the cross-section of the column would be relatively uniform as a square throughout its whole height or length of the column.","If H\/S get larger, then the column cross-section, near the pads, would still be square, and then the further away we go, away from the pads towards the mid-height of the column, the cross-section of the column will start to get more rounded at the corners, or rather filleted, until at a certain point or height, it may reach a circular shape, rather than a square.","Another similar example is when we start with rectangular pads.","The same thing would happen, but starting with a rectangular basis.","If the solder joint is short, then the joint is exactly rectangular.","If we increase the height to a relatively small\/medium height, then the joint will be exactly rectangular at base (pads), and the farther we get away from the pads the more rounded (filleted) the corners of the rectangle, and when the column gets pretty tall, then at the center of the column, close to its mid-height, i.e. at mid-distance between the pads, we would get an ellipse, and for even taller columns yet, we may even get a circular cross-section at the mid-height of the column.","Separation and the Use of Supported or Filled Solder","All the above is assuming that the solder would not separate and cut-off into two separate individual portions, where one portion would stick\/adhere to the lower pad and the other portion would stick\/adhere to the upper pad, or it may even separate totally from the top pad and the whole amount of solder would sit on top of the lower pad.","I had solved this problem as seen in two of my previous inventions. Please see Ref15. U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,309, dated May 12, 1987, entitled \u201cCHIP MOUNTING DEVICE\u201d; and Ref16. U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,205, dated Nov. 10, 1987, entitled \u201cCHIP CARRIER MOUNTING DEVICE\u201d. There, I have \u201csupported\u201d the solder, by wrapping a thin narrow band (ribbon) of copper tape around the solder column, to keep its columnar shape.","If we find it necessary in certain cases here, then we can use a similar approach for this present invention.","There is a difference, however. In the CCMD case, the height of the columns were staying practically constant. In this present invention, the columns change their height as described herein.","We can absorb the difference, i.e. the change in height of the columns, by using a thin wire to wrap around the solder column, in such a way that the wire would be more flexible than the ribbon tape. The thin wire, preferably with a round cross-section, instead of the rectangular cross-section of the ribbon, would be more flexible and more receptive to allowing the column to compress or to stretch.","Another change that we can introduce, over the CCMD, is to flatten the CCMD columns. The CCMD columns were made in a continuous shape, like a continuous wire. We called it the \u201ccolumns wire stock\u201d or simply the \u201cwire stock\u201d. The wire stock was then cut to the proper length, to create the \u201cpreforms\u201d, and then the preforms were inserted into fixtures, sometimes we used dissolvable carrying wafer, to be used for the assembly process.","We can do the same thing here, except for two additional steps.","First, we need to \u201cflatten\u201d the wire stock. After the wire stock is formed, using the thin wire instead of the ribbon, we can run the wire stock between two rolls under pressure, to \u201cflatten\u201d the wire stock.","Second, when the wire stock is cut to the proper length of the individual preforms, each preform would be oriented, as per the present invention, when it is inserted into the carrying fixture or the carrying wafer, or when it is attached to the packages, regardless of the method of attachment.","Another alternative is to use \u201cfiled\u201d solder.","The term filled solder had been used in an old patent, that I encountered around 1980-84, when I was working on the CCMD. That patent has included some copper particles into the solder, homogeneously dispersed in the solder. I had wanted to use that approach myself as an alternate method of maintaining the shape of the solder columns, but because of that prior art. I was told that I could not claim myself anymore. That prior art patent wanted to use that filled solder to close large gaps between copper plates or the like. Because of the copper filler, the solder was supposed to maintain the shape given to it, overcoming the high surface tension of the solder.","I did a patent search on filled solder, but I could not find that old prior art patent.","Regardless, that patent is now in the public domain, since it has been over 17\/20 years since the time I encountered it.","So, if we make oriented starved columns as per present invention, and encounter cases, where the regular solder does separate, then we can use \u201cfilled solder\u201d as described above, to reduce or eliminate the separations. Filled solder would allow us to have taller starved columns, without separation, than if we were to use regular, i.e. unfilled, solder. Hence, taller columns without separation.","Double Wires",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0371","num":"0386"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},"Solder Bumping",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0373","num":"0388"},"figref":["FIG. 35","FIG. 34-A"]},"All these methods are well know in the industry and are not novel.","The novelty here is two-fold.","First, that the solder bump would have a rectangular or elongated cross-section, as implied by the rectangular opening in the mask shown in .  shows a mask that could be used to create such a solder column\/bump, with a rectangular or elongated cross-section, where the opening or aperture in the mask is rectangular or elongated as needed.","Second, the fact that these solder bumps would be \u201coriented\u201d as per the present invention. This means that the flat face of each solder bump, or column for that matter, would be facing the thermal center of the package or of the assembly, or in other words, the short axis of the solder bump cross-section would be in the direction of the thermal deformation ray to that specific bump. Hence, each opening or aperture in the mask should be oriented, as needed, to satisfy the requirements, as per present invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This section of the specification relates to and covers the second group of products, which includes LEADED packages.","Please refer also the \u201cGENERAL BACKGROUND\u201d section at the top of the present specification, for additional remarks.","2. Prior Art","Please refer to Ref5 for any known prior art.","I have not found any additional information in these regards.","I had mentioned in my previous applications, especially in Ref3, as well as in Ref5, that \u201cOriented Leads or Columns\u201d can improve the life and reliability of plastic packages.","I had also shown a number of ways to achieve the desired designs and goals, mostly grouped under two methods.","A-Two-Step Method-Twist and Fold","In the two-step operation, the leg blanks exit in an \u201corthogonal\u201d direction from the package body, i.e. in a direction that is \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cperpendicular\u201d to the body sides and\/or axed. So, if we simply fold the leg blanks, then the vertical parts of the legs will also be \u201corthogonal\u201d, hence not oriented as per invention. In order to get them \u201coriented\u201d as required, we have to add a \u201ctwisting\u201d operation. This was all described at length in Ref3 and Ref5.","B-One-Step Method-Oriented Leg Blank with Fold Only","The other method was to use a flat leadframe with the leg blanks already oriented and radiating directly from the plastic body already in the proper direction, i.e. exiting already on an angle from the package body, i.e. on an angle to the package sides and axes. This allowed us to be able to simply \u201cfold\u201d the leg blanks and through this one single operation, we were able to get the vertical part of the legs to be \u201coriented\u201d as per recommendations of the invention.","This \u201cone single step\u201d folding operation compares favorably against the other alternative, i.e. the \u201cfold and twist\u201d method. The reasons are that it is a one-step operation only instead of a \u201ctwo-step\u201d operation, and where we need to also \u201ctwist\u201d the legs to get them into the proper \u201corientation\u201d. The second reason is that twisting, if not done properly and carefully, can overstress the plastic body or even the legs material itself.","In Ref3 and Ref5, I had mentioned and described the \u201cone-step\u201d method, and have shown some figures illustrating the proposed method. Many of those figures were pretty small and it may have been too difficult to recognize the fine details of the concept.","So, in this present application, I will show some figures, with more details, to make sure that the concept is well understood.","I will also show another \u201cone-step\u201d method, which could be considered a compromise between method A and B. I will call this method, method C, the \u201cNormal-Oriented\u201d or \u201cOrthogonal-Oriented\u201d Leg Blank with Fold Only\u201d method. I will briefly describe it here, but I will, further below, show some figures to describe this method more filly in the section on \u201cDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\u2014LEADED PRODUCTS\u201d.","C-One-Step Method-\u201cOrthogonal-Oriented\u201d Leg Blank with Fold only\u201d Method.","In the two drawings attached to Ref6, FIGS. 1 & 2, I showed a proposed way to create oriented leads out a flat leadframe. I will call this method, method C, the \u201cOrthogonal-Oriented\u201d or \u201cNormal-Oriented\u201d Leg Blank with Fold Only\u201d method. Compare this with the two other methods, mentioned earlier above.","Here the portion of the leadframe that would generate each individual leg of the package, hereinafter referred to as \u201cleg blank\u201d, would be coming out of, or protruding from, or exiting from, the plastic body will be orthogonal, i.e. perpendicular to the body's sides and centerlines, the same way like the present conventional leadframes are made today in the industry. However, the leg blanks would then be formed, or rather blanked, to radiate out in the proper desired oriented direction, while they are still flat, as shown in the two figures. The big difference is that the portion of the leg blanks coming out of the plastic body would be orthogonal instead of on an angle. This makes it easier to provide the \u201cdams\u201d that are necessary for the encapsulation or molding process and then later to cut-off or trim the dams after the encapsulation or molding process is finished.","Objectives","To enhance the reliability and to prolong the operating life of leaded packages by reducing the stresses on the packages body; and also by reducing the stresses on the assemblies' solder joints and solder pads between the tips of the gull-wing legs of the packages and the substrates, on which the packages are mounted.","In this present invention, I will describe the third method of forming the legs of leaded packages, i.e. Method C, the \u201cNormal-Oriented\u201d Leg Blank with Fold Only\u201d method.","I will also show some more examples of the second method, which was described in Ref3 and Ref5, i.e. Method B-One-Step Method-Oriented Leg Blank with Fold Only.","I will also show more figures describing the solder Dads that would accept the proposed oriented leads, especially the \u201ccombination\u201d pads. These solder pads were also described in Ref3 and Ref5, but the present figures will give more details.","Review of Earlier Applications","First, let's refer to Ref5.","I will briefly review the drawings in that Ref5, which have some special relevance to the present specification.","Ref5, FIGS. 41 and 42 illustrate my definitions of \u201cFold\u201d and \u201cTwist\u201d. Ref5, FIG. 41-B shows a \u201cTwist\u201d in a strip of sheet metal, which started \u201cFlat\u201d, and Ref5 FIG. 41-C shows a \u201cFold\u201d in a similar strip of sheet metal. Ref5, FIG. 42-D shows a progression from \u201cFlat\u201d to \u201cTwist\u201d and then to \u201cFold\u201d. Ref5, FIG. 42-E reverses the order and shows a progression from \u201cFlat\u201d to \u201cFold\u201d to \u201cTwist\u201d.","Ref5, FIGS. 2 and 3 show a (Prior Art) package with standard conventional legs. The leg blanks exit, or protrude from, the package body in a perpendicular direction to the sides and to the centerlines of the package. I refer to this condition as an \u201corthogonal\u201d direction or sometimes as a \u201cnormal\u201d direction. The leg blanks are later folded, to create the vertical parts of the legs, or \u201cleg columns\u201d. No twisting of the leg material is involved here.","Ref5, FIGS. 12 and 13 show an example of standard, conventional flat leadframe. They also show the leg blanks are laid-out to be orthogonal, i.e. perpendicular to the sides and centerlines of the expected body of the package.","Ref5, FIGS. 20 and 21 appear to have their leg blanks in an orthogonal direction as well. The two external leg blanks, at either side of the central one, are then folded at some angle, to create the oriented legs as shown.","Ref5, FIG. 22-A shows the legs, orthogonal and folded, but FIG. 22-B shows the leg blanks oriented and folded.","Ref5, FIG. 23-C shows solder pads that are rectangular and oriented, in line with the thermal deformation rays. I will refer to such pads as \u201cdedicated\u201d solder pads. See more explanation later below.","Ref5, FIG. 23-D shows solder pads that can accept both conventional gull-wing legs as well as oriented legs. I will refer to such pads as \u201ccombination\u201d solder pads or simply \u201ccombo pads\u201d. See more explanation later below.","Ref5, FIG. 25, top view shows the legs protruding from the body in an orthogonal direction, but bottom view shows them in a radial or rather oriented direction.","Ref5, FIG. 26 at first glance may look like Ref5, FIG. 21, but there is a difference. Here the two external leg blanks seem to exit already on an angle to the side of the package body. We can say that they are oriented already. The fold is orthogonal with the leg blank and at an angle to the package body.","Ref5, FIGS. 32 through 40 show oriented leg blanks. Such leadframes will be referred to as \u201cradial\u201d or rather \u201coriented\u201d leadframes. We only need to \u201cfold\u201d each leg blank orthogonally to the direction of the leg blank itself and we would then get the vertical part of each leg column oriented properly, as per present invention. We do not need to \u201ctwist\u201d anything.","Ref5, FIGS. 32, 33, 35, 67 and 39 show the leadframe in its flat condition. Ref5, FIGS. 34, 36, 38 and 40 after the leg blanks had been folded and automatically oriented.","Now, we'll review Ref6.","Ref6, FIG. 1 shows a flat leadframe, where the leg blanks exit or protrude orthogonally, but then they curve around, while still in the flat leadframe condition, so that the following part of the leg blank, which would generate the vertical part of the legs, becomes oriented as required by the present invention. I will refer to that portion of the leg blank that curves around as the \u201cneck\u201d of the leg blank. The included angle of each neck is different for each leg.","When we \u201cfold\u201d the leg blank, orthogonally, at the outer end of the neck, then the resulting vertical portion of the legs will automatically be oriented properly, as per present invention.","Since each leg is supposed to be oriented at some respective proper angle, at its own respective angle with respect to the body's sides or centerlines, then the included angle of each neck will also be different for the different legs, to suit the requirements, as per present invention.","Ref6, FIG. 2 shows the leg blanks shown in Ref6, FIG. 1, but after they have been \u201cfolded\u201d, after each individual neck. We can see that the vertical part of each leg is oriented properly, as per present invention.","Now, I will show and describe the new drawings.","I have used a standard, conventional package as a model for my example. It is a \u201cTSSOP\u201d package. JEDEC (Joint Electronic Device Engineering Industry Development Association) defines TSSOP as \u201cThin Shrink Small Outline Package\u201d.

The one used in this group of figures, , is what I refer to as the \u201cOrthogonal-Oriented\u201d leadframe. The difference is the way the leg blanks exit from the package body. In the \u201cOriented\u201d leadframe, the leg blank exit on some angle to the body sides or centerlines, while in the \u201cOrthogonal-Oriented\u201d leadframe, the leg blank first exit in a perpendicular direction to the body sides or centerlines, and then the leg blanks have a \u201cneck\u201d that curves and ends up in a direction that is \u201coriented\u201d as required by the present invention. So, both leadframes end up with \u201coriented\u201d legs, but in one leadframe, the leg blanks emerge from the body in the \u201coriented\u201d direction, and in the other leadframe, the legs start at a normal angle and then become oriented later.","Please note that a combination of the two leadframes directions is part of this invention too. In other words, the \u201corthogonal-oriented\u201d version, can have the leg blanks emerge from the body at some angle, which is neither the ultimate oriented angle, nor the normal, perpendicular direction, but something in between, and then the neck would curve properly to end up with the legs oriented properly at the end.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIGS. 82 and 83"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIGS. 84 and 85"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIGS. 86 through 90"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 91"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 92"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
