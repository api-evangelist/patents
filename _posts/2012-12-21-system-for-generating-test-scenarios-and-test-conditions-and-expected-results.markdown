title: System for generating test scenarios and test conditions and expected results
abstract: A requirements testing system facilitates the review and analysis of requirement statements for software applications. The requirements testing system automatically generates test artifacts from the requirement statements, including test scenarios, test conditions, test hints, and expected results. These test artifacts characterize the requirements statements to provide valuable analysis information that aids understanding what the intentions of the requirement statements are. The automation of the generation of these test artifacts produces numerous benefits, including fewer errors, objectivity, and no dependency on the skills and experience of a creator.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","Related Applications","TECHNICAL FIELD","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","APPENDIX A","1 Examples of Entity Extractor","2 Examples of Test Scenarios, Test Conditions and Expected Results"],"p":["This application claims priority to Indian provisional patent application No. 122\/CHE\/2012, filed Jan. 12, 2012, and to the corresponding Indian non-provisional patent application, given the same serial number by the Indian Patent Office as the provisional patent application, No. 122\/CHE\/2012, and that was received at the Indian Patent Office on Dec. 13, 2012. Both applications are entirely incorporated by reference.","This disclosure relates to test scenarios, and test conditions and expected results (TCERs). More specifically, this disclosure relates to systems and methods (generally referred to as systems) for generating test scenarios and TCERs from natural language (e.g., English language) specification documents.","The present systems and methods described herein may be embodied in a number of different forms. Not all of the depicted components may be required, however, and some implementations may include additional, different, or fewer components from those expressly described in this disclosure. Variations in the arrangement and type of the components may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims as set forth herein.","It is noted that this description discusses document analysis. The analysis operates on units of information in the document. The units of information, as examples, may include full sentences, sentence fragments, phrases, or any other sequence of one or more words. In some examples given below, the units of information are statements, such as requirements statements in a requirements specification. The statements may or may not be full sentences. Thus, while some examples may refer specifically to sentence analysis or statement analysis, the techniques described below are not limited to sentences or statements, but may be applied to other units of information present in a document. For instance, the document analysis methods described in this description may be applied to both requirements statements and requirements sentences in a same or similar way.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["4000","4000","4000","4000","104","106","4000","104","108","108","110","104"]},"The network  may follow any of a wide variety of network topologies and technologies. As examples, the network  may include Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), Internet connections, Ethernet networks, or Fiber Distributed Data Interconnect (FDDI) packet switched networks that may communicate Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) packets, or any data following any other communication protocol. The network  provides a transport mechanism or interconnection of multiple transport mechanisms supporting data exchange between the system  and any source of documents to analyze, including the requirements document .","A processor  in the system  may analyze the requirement statements to determine the test artifacts. A requirement statement may, for example, be implemented as a single sentence or other sequence of one or more words. The requirement statement may, for example, be in unconstrained natural language, structured formats, or model based formats. An example of a requirement statement in a structured format may be a requirement statement limited to subject, action and object. Such a restriction may exclude requirement statements with multiple objects, or requirement statements with nouns which are neither subjects nor objects. Other examples are possible.","In some instances, the requirement statements may include data that is not intended for processing. Such data may be marked (e.g., the data not intended for processing may be enclosed in brackets). The requirement statements may first be processed by the preprocessor  as described in more detail below. Among other things, the preprocessor  may remove data enclosed in brackets as well as the brackets themselves. The processor  may generate, (e.g., on the display ), an analysis report . The analysis report  may specify the artifacts, test artifacts or any other analysis details that the system  determines.","An artifact may be a tangible by-product produced during the development of software (e.g., a use case or a class diagram). Artifacts of a software project may be or resemble deliverables of the software project, though the software itself (i.e., the released end-product) may not be an artifact. A test artifact may be a tangible by-product produced during software testing. Test artifacts may relate to a characteristic of a requirement statement. Examples of test artifacts may include an indication of one or more of the following: requirement testability, requirement intent, test scenario, test conditions, expected results, requirement category, requirement data and requirement ambiguity. Testability artifacts, intent artifacts, category artifacts, and data artifacts may be examples of test artifacts, as well as or alternatively an ambiguous phrase identified in a requirement statement. For example, the test artifacts may include: Testability, specifying, for example, whether the requirement statement is testable; Intent, specifying, for example, the intent or purpose of the requirement statement; Category, specifying, for example, what type of requirement the requirement statement establishes; Data, specifying, for example, the data that the requirement statement operates on; and Ambiguity, specifying whether all or parts of a requirement statement are ambiguous with regard to its testability; The test scenarios, the test conditions and the expected results. The system  may determine additional, fewer, or different artifacts, including grammatical correctness of the requirement statement in whole or in part.","In some requirements testing systems and methods, a requirement statement is obtained and stored in a memory. The requirement statement is submitted to a grammatical parser executed by a processor to obtain parser outputs characterizing the requirement statement. A test artifact ruleset is applied with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact applicable to the requirement statement.","These and other requirements testing systems and methods allow for developers to check for testability and various features of statements and documents. Another benefit of the requirements testing system is that it facilitates creation of test artifacts from requirement statements. The test artifacts reduce testing cycle time, effort, and expense, and improve test quality. As a result, the resulting software application is more reliable, less expensive, and is more timely delivered. This allows developers to implement complex statements and documents in less time and with fewer mistakes or ambiguities, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the requirements statements. Requirements testing systems also result in various other advantages and effects.","In some instances, it may be beneficial to identify and review one or more test artifacts, such as one or more Test Scenarios, Test Conditions and Expected Results and\/or the Test Hints, each of which is explained in more detail below. However, there are significant technical challenges involved with generating these test artifacts in a consistent, accurate, and reliable way. The technical implementation of the requirement testing system addresses these technical challenges. The resulting requirement testing system is less error prone, may in some instances provide a guarantee on completeness, may be very efficient and objective (and not time consuming or subjective), and\/or may not require any extra effort to build traceability and audit compliance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["4000","106","104","4000","4000","4000","4000"]},"The requirement testing system  may include a communication interface , processor , memory , and\/or display ,","The memory  may also or alternatively include pre-processor logic , an entity extractor , scenario generation module , and\/or test condition logic . The entity extractor  may be configured to extract proper nouns from a requirements sentence , as discussed later. The scenario generation module  may be configured to generate one or more test scenarios for the requirements sentence , as discussed later. The test condition logic  may be configured to generate one or more positive or negative test conditions, test hints, and\/or expected results for the requirements sentence , as discussed later. While shown as separate modules or logic, one or more of the entity extractor , scenario generation module , test condition logic , may be combined, incorporated, or part of one module or logic, such as one analysis logic component. Other implementations are possible.","A \u201cTest Scenario\u201d (also referred to as a \u201cscenario description\u201d or a \u201ctest scenario description\u201d) may be a short description of the test being conducted to verify a requirement. A \u201cTest Condition\u201d may be the particular condition which is being tested. \u201cTest Hints\u201d may be the ordered sequence of steps a tester would have to execute to perform the test. The corresponding output from a correctly implemented system may be an \u201cExpected Result\u201d. The combination of a Test Condition and the Expected Result is referred to as a TCER.","The requirements testing system  may also or alternatively determine the categorization of a requirements sentence  and\/or identify ambiguous phrases in the requirements sentence . In some embodiments, no restriction on the structure of the requirements sentence  is imposed, and the requirement testing system  may work on each single requirements sentence  and generate one or more test conditions and associated test hints and expected results. The requirement testing system  may be configured or operable to analyze a single sentence or requirement statement (or as many as desired), and need not maintain state across multiple statements or sentences within statements.","The requirement sentences are parsed using Link Grammar parser (abbreviated as LG). LG provides information on the syntax of a grammatically correct English sentence by connecting pairs of words through labeled links ( shows the parsed output of a sentence). The links between pairs of words are labeled and each label provides specific information about the connecting pair. For example, the Subject of a sentence is indicated by a link having a label \u201cS\u201d. LG also provides the Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, etc. through a constituent tree output (). The links are created through a Grammar maintained in a dictionary file. The interpretation of the parsed output through the label of the links, the structure of the sentence and the constituent tree helps us decipher the following information\u2014the sentence structure (antecedent and consequent), quantity (singular and plural), Parts-of-Speech (Noun, Verb, Verb in past tense, etc.) and grammar (Subject, Object, etc.). We interpret and exploit this information to extract entities and generate the Test Cases","The pre-processor logic  includes preprocessing rulesets (e.g., the preprocessing rulesets  and ). The preprocessing rulesets cause the pre-processor logic  to perform analysis, modification, or other actions on requirement statements. Table 1 and Table 2 give examples of the pre-processing rulesets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Preprocessor Ruleset"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Rule 1: Prune ending punctuation marks."},{"entry":"Rule 2: Convert Unicode text to ASCII text"},{"entry":"Rule 3: Convert URLs in text into an Acronym"},{"entry":"Rule 4: Replace quoted words into Acronyms.

The requirements sentence  may be a statement randomly selected from a document, may be selected in a sequential order, may be selected according to one or more algorithms, or may be selected in various other ways. Other examples are possible.","The logic  applies pre-processing (), e.g., prior to applying the entity extractor (). The pre-processing may be applied () by the pre-processor  according to any one of the methods described throughout this disclosure.","The logic  applies the entity extractor  () to analyze the requirements sentence . While the entity extractor  is shown as being applied to each requirements sentence  individually before each requirements sentence  is analyzed, in some systems, the logic  may apply the entity extractor  to an entire requirements document  prior to any parsing or analysis of the requirements document  or requirements sentence  within the document. For example, the entity extractor  may be used before any parsing or analysis of the requirements document , to ensure that link grammar parser logic  correctly identifies all nouns in each requirements sentence  when the requirements sentence  is parsed. Other variations are possible.","The role of the entity extractor  may be to pick up some or all Noun-Phrases in a requirements sentence . The entity extractor  may determine which nouns should be identified in a given requirements sentence in various ways. For example, the logic  may cause the requirements testing system  to identify noun phrases in a requirements sentence  with or using link grammar parser logic , as shown in (). The logic  may also cause the requirements testing system  to run the link grammar parser in a \u201cBatch\u201d mode on the entire requirements document . The entity extractor  may identify or otherwise pick up Noun-Phrases from the links generated by the parser. The Noun-Phrases may include acronyms (such as \u201cACBG\u201d), proper nouns (such as \u201cPeru\u201d), common nouns (such as \u201cOrder Processing System\u201d) and\/or phrases included in parentheses. Additionally or alternatively, if the requirements document  contains a \u201cGlossary\u201d section, such as an entity glossary , the corresponding terms in the entity glossary  may also be considered and used by the entity extractor  in gathering nouns (). In some instances, the automatically identified nouns or entities gathered by the entity extractor  may be presented to the user for verification (). In these cases, the user may have the option to either accept or modify the selected entities, and\/or may add new ones. The entity extractor  may, in some instances, be used to extract nouns from requirements sentences that even fail to link.

For example, some requirements sentence  may use verbs as nouns. As an example of a requirements sentence that uses a verb as a noun, consider this requirements sentence:\n\n","In the requirements sentence (1), the word \u201cOrder,\u201d which is normally a verb, is used as a noun in the requirements sentence. In such cases, without applying the entity extractor , link grammar parser logic  may interpret \u201cOrder\u201d to be a verb and may produce a wrong set of linkages (treating Verbs as Verbs) which may lead to a wrong set of TCERs.","In the example of the requirements sentence (1), the entity extractor  may automatically highlight\u2014\u201cOrder Processing System\u201d, \u201cACBG reports\u201d and \u201cPeru\u201d because they are nouns. The entity extractor  may also suggest entities from requirements sentences where the link grammar parser logic  fails to completely link the sentence. When such words are forcibly treated as a noun, the linkage by the link grammar parser logic  may succeed. As noted, in some instances, the requirements testing system  may show selected entities identified by the entity extractor  to the user for verification (), and the user may modify the selected entities.","The entity extractor  may help increase the accuracy of the requirements testing system . In other systems, the entity extractor  may not be needed or included in the requirements testing system , and the user may generate test artifacts without running the entity extractor .","In some systems, once the selected entities are accepted by the user, the logic  may re-run the link grammar parser logic  (), making sure the entities are treated as nouns. The link grammar parser logic  may also obtain syntactic and lexical information about the requirements sentence  when re-running the link grammar parser logic  ().","Once the requirements testing system  has applied the entity extractor  (as in ) and each requirements sentence  has been again parsed by the link grammar parser logic , as in () and (), to obtain syntactic and lexical information, the logic  may cause the requirements testing system  to determine if the requirements sentence  is testable (). Upon parsing, if the requirements sentence  is unable to be linked by the parser, the requirements testing system  may report the requirements sentence  as \u201cfailed to analyze\u201d and the requirements testing system  may move onto the next requirements sentence . The requirements testing system  may quantify input requirements sentence  that are successfully linked by the parser as either \u2018testable\u2019 or \u2018non-testable\u2019. The requirements testing system  may analyze the link grammar parser logic  output of a sentence to identify a particular set of contiguous links which imply testability.

For example, the requirement statement may be determined to be testable based on the presence of contiguous links, (e.g., S-I-O (rule ID T.1)).

In some instances, by breaking the sentence into two, the number agreement between the noun and the verb may be broken (i.e., Noun\u2014\u201cAdministrator\u201d and Verb\u2014\u201care\u201d). In these instances, the plural verbs may be converted by the requirements testing system  into singular through the method of Stemming. The plural verb in the compound sentence and the corresponding singular verb in the simple sentences are underlined in sentences (3) and (4) respectively.

These structures correspond to the rules provided in the table above. A causal sentence has an \u201cif-then-else\u201d type of structure and corresponds to rule ID S.1 in the table above.

As an example, a Parts-Of-Speech tagger has its atomic unit as a word. A test intent may be the smallest contiguous set of words (i.e., a phrase) that carries sufficient meaning. A single requirements sentence  or simple sentence may generate multiple test intents. These test intents, when collated into a test condition and test sequence, may correspond to the high level execution steps which a tester must perform.","The analysis logic  may generate test intents for a sentence that has been simplified from or using the parsed output of link grammar parser logic . A test intent may be a set of words along a path of a link starting from the Subject of the sentence and bounded by noun phrases. The Subject of the sentence may, in some instances, tend to be the start of the sentence. An example of a generation of a test intent is shown below and in :\n\n","Referring to , the analysis logic  may determine that the first test intent  begins from the subject\u2014\u201cthe PRTS system\u201d and concludes at the occurrence of the noun phrase\u2014\u201cthe reports\u201d. The second test intent  begins from this point and proceeds till the next noun phrase is encountered\u2014\u201cthe user\u201d. There are two paths that can be traversed from the verb \u201cselected\u201d. The second path from the noun phrase\u2014\u201cthe reports\u201d till \u201cthe touch-screen\u201d may form the third test intent . The breaking of the sentence bounded by Noun-Phrases may create a simple or the simplest form of English sentences\u2014sentences that have a Subject, an Action and an Object (or SAO). The structure of these SAO patterns may be identified in terms of the linkages created by the link grammar parser logic . The requirements testing system  may insert static text at precise points in the phrase to bring meaning from a testing perspective. An example set of rules and the corresponding templates are shown Table 5a above.","The test intents corresponding to  are:\n\n","The text inserted through the template is shown in italics.","Referring to statement (16), the analysis logic  or another component of the requirements testing system  may generate Test Intent-1 due to Rule I.1 (see, e.g., Table 5a). The S-I-O structure of Rule I.1 is shown in . This intent may be referred to as \u201cPrimary\u201d since it includes the Subject of the sentence (link grammar parser logic  may indicate an \u2018S\u2019 indicating that the subject is \u201cthe PRTS system\u201d). Test Intent-2 and Test Intent-3 may be generated through Rule I.1.2 of Table 5a. The requirements testing system may incorporate the tense and the number for the test intents through \u201cwere\u201d. The requirements testing system  may identify these through the labels of the links (\u201cMv\u201d and \u201cOp\u201d respectively). The requirements testing system  may refer to test intents that do not include the subject as \u201cSecondary\u201d.","Breaking a sentence into the individual components may remove structural ambiguity.

The requirements testing system  may number every node of the tree and may create one or more TCER objects at each node. The requirements testing system  may denote the TCER object as Obj. The TCER object may have three attributes\u2014the Test Condition, the Test Hints and the Expected Results. These may be denoted as TC, TS and ER respectively. The operator \u2018&\u2019 may, in some instances, combine the operands only if they are distinct\u2014i.e., the operation (a & b)=(ab) only if a\u2260b.","When executing the logic for generating the positive TCERs and test sequences, the requirements testing system  may operate as follows. Initially, if the given requirements sentence  is simple and thus the tree representation has a single node, Line 4 of the positive TCERs and Test Hints logic shows the population of the Test Condition. The process of the creation of Test Condition is shown later. The Test Hints may be created using the Create_Test_Hints function (see line 5). The Create_Test_Hints function is explained later. The Expected Results may be created using the Create_Expected_Results function. (see line 6). This function is explained later in this disclosure.","The requirements testing system , when executing the above logic, may generate Pre-Conditions by identifying \u201cdata\u201d and associated \u201cconditions\u201d in sentences. Data may include numerals, numbers written in text (like \u2018four\u2019), Boolean conditions (like, ON, TRUE) and date & time. By conjoining data with the conditions (like \u2018<=\u2019, \u2018before\u2019), the requirements testing system  may generate positive and negative conditions.","For requirements sentences  which are compound in nature, the simplification may result in a tree with at least 3 nodes (and at least a depth of 2). The requirements testing system  may begin the analysis, then, at the level above the leaves (i.e., if depth of the tree is D, the analysis starts at level D-1 as shown in line 10). When the sentence is broken due to dependency structure (if-then), the requirements testing system  may put test intents corresponding to the \u201cif\u201d part of the sentence into the Test Conditions (see line 16). The order in which a compound sentence is broken may ensure that the first child of the node is the \u2018if\u2019 part of the sentence and the second child is the \u2018then\u2019 part. The requirements testing system  may then identify the Test Hints as the test intents of the \u201cthen\u201d part (line 17). The requirements testing system  may then identify the expected result from the complete simplified sentence. (line 18).","Certain sentences or statements may semantically imply an opposite of \u201cif-then\u201d even though they carry the same syntactic structure. An example of such a sentence is:\n\n","Here, the sentence (22) implies: if the user is a Guest, verify for \u201cnot editable\u201d. This semantic understanding may be achieved by negating the action of the test intents (lines 24, 25). The Negation may work by introducing a \u201cnot\u201d before the Verb of the sentence.","For a compound sentence that has been broken due to the conjunction \u201cand\u201d, the requirements testing system  may identify the TCER as a combination of the test conditions and expected results of both the simple sentences. This may be similar to checking for both simple sentence 1 and simple sentence 2 together. The requirements testing system  may merge the test intents (shown by the operator \u2018&\u2019). Some test intents may be an exact duplicate because of the way a compound sentence may be broken up. The duplication may arise because the simple sentences may be lexically common and the test intents are created from the common text. In such a case, the merge operation performed by the requirements testing system  when executing the logic may drop one of the duplicate test intent without any loss of information. The requirements testing system  may identify the Test Condition in such a case as the merging of the Test Conditions (line 31). The requirements testing system  may identify the Test Hints as the merge of the Test Hints of the simplified sentences (line 33). Similarly, the expected result may be the merge of the Expected Results of the simplified sentences. (line 34).","A compound sentence with conjunction \u201cor\u201d may create individual TCERs, each corresponding to the simple sentence created. This may be similar to having a tester check, individually, for each of the options specified through \u201cor\u201d. The requirements testing system  may represent the operation as in lines 39-41 of the positive TCERs and Test Hints logic.","Having created Objects of TCERs using test intents, the requirements testing system  may merge the objects according to the way the sentence has been broken (based on conjunctions\u2014\u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d). The requirements testing system , when executing the positive TCERs and Test Hints logic, may proceed to move from the depth above the leaves to the root (line 51). At this point, all nodes may have one or more TCER objects created. The requirements testing system  may again merge the nodes according to the logic of \u201cand\u201d or \u201cor\u201d. Because of the order in which a compound sentence is broken, \u201cif-then\u201d type of sentences may, in some systems, always occur at the last level and not appear at the current level of analysis. Finally, the requirements testing system  may display the TCER objects created at the root.","The Test Conditions generated at this point and with this logic may correspond to positive test conditions\u2014i.e., cases which verify the positive action of\/on the Subject.","The Create_Test_Condition logic is explained here. The test condition is obtained by the concatenation of the first test intent of the simplified sentence and subsequent intents provided certain conditions hold between the first and subsequent intents.

The test condition logic  may look to generate TCERs at the given data value (i.e., =data), TCERs below the data value (i.e., <data) and TCERs above the data value (i.e., >data). For example, if the data in the requirement sentence is \u201c<10\u201d, boundary value analysis may create TCERs for \u201c=10\u201d and \u201c>10\u201d.","The negation of the action specified in a sentence by the requirements testing system  may also be useful or needed for the generation of TCERs. The requirements testing system  may achieve the negation in a three step process. The first option is to negate any roles present in the sentence. Currently \u2018admin\u2019 and \u2018administrator\u2019 are considered roles. If such words occur, then they are negated into \u2018non-admin\u2019 and \u2018non-administrator\u2019 respectively. If no roles are present, then the presence of permissions is checked in the sentence. Permission includes words like \u2018having\u2019, \u2018using\u2019 and \u2018with\u2019. If any of these prepositions occur, the negation is achieved by inserting a \u2018not\u2019 before the preposition. If no permissions can be found in the sentence, then negation is achieved by inverting the verb associated with the subject. If there are two contiguous verbs between the subject and the object, the requirements testing system  may insert a \u201cnot\u201d between them. The requirements testing system  may identify the verb by passing the given sentence (or sentence fragment) into the link grammar parser logic  and checking the constituent tree output (see ,  and ,  for examples of constituent tree output). For example, the below sentence has two verbs:\n\n","By inserting a \u201cnot\u201d between the verbs, the sentence is negated:\n\n","In cases where there is a single verb and the verb is \u201cis\u201d, \u201care\u201d, \u201cwere\u201d, etc., the requirements testing system  may replace the verb with \u201cis not\u201d, \u201care not\u201d, \u201cwere not\u201d, etc. This list of verbs may be limited and not endless, and may be maintained as a semantic list. For other cases of single verbs, the requirements testing system  may convert the verb to singular using stemming (a heuristic based approach which looks at the last few characters of words and replaces them to convert the word into singular). The singular verb may then be pre-pended with \u201cdoes not\u201d. See for example:\n\n","Table 15 offers example rules to negate a sentence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0184"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 15"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Number of contiguous Verb",{}]},{"entry":["Phrases in Constituent Tree","Action"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","If Verb Phrase is \u201cis\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, \u201cwas\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cwere\u201d, put the phrase \u201cnot\u201d after"]},{"entry":[{},"the Verb Phrase."]},{"entry":[{},"Else convert Verb Phrase to singular"]},{"entry":[{},"using Stemming and put"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cdoes not\u201d before the singular"]},{"entry":[{},"verb"]},{"entry":[">1","If the first Verb Phrase contains"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cnot\u201d, remove it (\u201cnot\u201d)."]},{"entry":[{},"Else put \u201cnot\u201d after the first verb"]},{"entry":[{},"phrase."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The requirements testing system  may generate the negative TCERs for TCERs identified as negative using Boundary Value Analysis and other non-data TCERs with Test Conditions populated from causal sentences.

The TCER object may contain the Test Conditions from the Create_Test_Condition module and is shown in line 7 of the negative TCERs and Test Hints logic. The Test Hints is similarly generated from the Create_Test_Hints function. For a compound sentence of type dependency (\u201cif-then\u201d, etc.), the test condition logic  may designate or determine the Test Conditions as in the case of the Positive TCER. Similarly, for sentences of type \u201cuntil-then\u201d, etc., the test condition logic may not negate the Test Conditions (unlike the case in the Positive TCER). The requirements testing system  may identify the test hints as the entire test intents (lines 14).","The test condition logic  may reverse the functioning of conjunctions \u2018or\u2019 and \u2018and\u2019 from that in the case of Positive TCERs. Here, for the case of \u2018or\u2019, the test condition logic  may join test intents (lines 19-20). For the case of \u2018and\u2019 or \u2018,\u2019, the test condition logic  may keep the test intents distinct (lines 25-34). Once the TCER Objects are created at the level of \u201cLeaf-1\u201d, the test condition logic  may collate along the tree representation of the sentence. The collation may be similar to the case of the Positive TCER with the difference being that the collation for \u2018or\u2019 and \u2018and\u2019 are reversed. For example, for a conjunction \u2018and\u2019, the test condition logic  may keep the TCER objects distinct and may merge the objects for the case of \u2018or\u2019. This is shown in lines 113-149.","The operation when data is present is shown from lines 48-101. The logic for the various data conditions may be implemented which will give the negative test coverage. In cases where the test intent does not contain data, the test condition logic may perform the negation of the Test Condition and the associated Test Hints and Expected Result (lines 105-109). A set of examples depicting the various aspects of this logic are provided in the Appendix A.","After the negative test conditions and associated test hints and expected result are generated (), the requirements testing system  may publish or otherwise display the TCERs generated for the given requirements sentence  in a report (). For example, the requirements testing system  may publish the TCERs generated in an excel sheet. The requirements testing system  may, in some instances, largely be based on the syntax of the sentence. Semantics may be needed at specific places, such as: a) the User defined Entities (although optional), b) the semantics of sub-ordinate conjunctions (\u201cif-then\u201d, \u201cunless\u201d, etc.), c) the semantics of conjunctions (\u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d) and d) the semantics of conditions associated with data (\u201c<\u201d, \u201cafter\u201d, etc.). The identification of the words that need semantic interpretation may be performed by the requirements testing system  using the link grammar parser logic  dictionary. For example, having determined that the semantics of \u201cbefore\u201d is to be created, the requirements testing system  may identify all other words similar to \u201cbefore\u201d in structure by looking at the category in link grammar parser's dictionary. The category may contain all other words including \u201cafter\u201d, \u201cby\u201d, etc. Other examples are possible.","Returning to where the method illustrated in  may break down compound requirements sentence  into simple sentences or statements (), along with performing the processes (-), the method may also or alternatively proceed to (and\/or the requirements testing system  may perform the function in) () in parallel or at any time before, during, or after any of the processes (-). The requirements testing system  may identify ambiguous phrases in the requirements sentence  ().","The identification of ambiguous phrases by the requirements testing system  may be driven by a semantic list of phrases and a set of Links. When the words occurring with this given set of Links is not present in the list of phrases, the requirements testing system  may mark a word as ambiguous. Ambiguous phrases may often occur as adjectives or adverbs, though not all adjectives or adverbs may be ambiguous. In some systems, a set of words have been developed whose occurrence does not imply ambiguity.
