Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to photosensitive compositions, curable compositions, curable compositions for color filters, color filters, and methods for production thereof. The invention also relates to novel oxime compounds, photopolymerizable compositions, photopolymerizable compositions for color filters, color filters and methods for production thereof, solid-state imaging devices, and planographic printing plate precursors.","2. Description of Related Art","Photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions may include, for example, an ethylenic unsaturated bond-containing polymerizable compound and a photopolymerization initiator. Such photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions polymerize and cure when they are irradiated with light, and are therefore used for, for example, photosetting inks, photosensitive printing plates, color filters, and a variety of photoresists.","In other types of photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions, for example, an acid is generated upon application of light, and the acid serves as a catalyst. Specifically, such compositions may be used in materials for image formation, anti-counterfeiting or detection of energy-ray dose, in which a color reaction of a pigment precursor in the presence of the generated acid serving as a catalyst is used, or may be used for positive resists for use in manufacture of semiconductors, TFTs, color filters, micromachine components, and the like, in which a decomposition reaction in the presence of the generated acid serving as a catalyst is used.","In recent years, photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions sensitive to shorter wavelength (365 nm or 405 nm) light sources have been demanded in various applications, and demands for such compounds (e.g. photopolymerizable initiators) capable of exhibiting high sensitivity to such short wavelength light sources have been increasing. However, highly sensitive photopolymerization initiators are generally poor in stability. Therefore, there is a demand for photopolymerization initiators having both of improved sensitivity and stability over time.","Under the circumstances, it is proposed to use oxime ester derivatives as photopolymerization initiators for photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,255,513 and 4,590,145 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 2000-80068 and 2001-233842. However, these known oxime ester compounds have low absorbance at a wavelength of 365 nm or 405 nm and are not satisfactory in terms of sensitivity.","At present, there have been a demand for photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions having not only high stability over time but also high sensitivity to light with a short wavelength such as 365 nm or 405 nm.","For example, JP-A No. 2006-195425 discloses a colored radiation-sensitive composition for color filters that contains an oxime compound. However, the stability over time and short-wavelength sensitivity of such a composition is still insufficient. There have also been a demand for colored radiation-sensitive compositions having improved reproducibility of hue after pattern formation, and suppression of change in coloring property over time has been strongly demanded.","On the other hand, there have been a demand for color filters for image sensors having high color concentrations and small thicknesses, in order to enhance the light-gathering power of solid-state imaging devices such as CCDs and in order to improve the image quality by improving color-separation properties. If a large amount of a coloring material is added to achieve a high color concentration, the sensitivity may be insufficient for faithful reproduction of the shape of a fine image pattern of 2.5 \u03bcm or less, so that pattern defects can frequently occur over the product. In order to avoid such defects, photo-irradiation has to be performed with higher energy, which requires a long exposure time and leads to a significant reduction in manufacturing yield. Under the circumstances, there have been a demand for colored radiation-sensitive compositions for color filters having a high content of a coloring material (colorant) and also having high sensitivity in order to achieve excellent pattern forming property.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a photosensitive composition and a curable composition having high sensitivity to light with a wavelength of 365 nm or 405 nm and having high stability over time.","It is another object of the invention to provide a curable composition for a color filter, wherein the curable composition has high stability over time and excellent pattern forming property, can be cured with high sensitivity, and can form a colored pattern with excellent adhesion to a support.","It is still another object of the invention to provide a color filter that is produced by using the curable composition for a color filter, has an excellent pattern shape and includes a colored pattern with excellent adhesion to a support, and to provide a method capable of producing such a color filter with high productivity.","As a result of investigations, the inventor has found that the use of a specific oxime compound is effective in achieving high absorbance of light with a wavelength of 365 nm or 405 nm and in providing high stability over time.","A curable composition according to the invention includes a compound represented by the following Formula (I).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"16.17mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08728686-20140520-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula (I), R, Rand Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a monovalent substituent.","The compound represented by Formula (I) preferably has a molar absorption coefficient of 20,000 or more at 365 nm or 405 nm.","In the photosensitive composition of the invention, the compound represented by Formula (I) is preferably a compound represented by the following Formula (I-I).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"24.55mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08728686-20140520-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula (I-I), Rand Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a monovalent substituent, M represents a divalent linking group, and Rand Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a monovalent substituent.

If the ratio is higher than 150\/100, the dominant wavelength can be shifted to the longer wavelength side, so that a relatively large deviation from the NTSC target hue can be observed in some cases. In particular, the mass ratio is preferably in the range of from 30\/100 to 120\/100.","A blue pigment of a phthalocyanine pigment may be used alone or in a form of a mixture with a dioxazine violet pigment.

In order to increase the strength of the cured film, tri- or higher-functional structures are preferred. A method of using a combination of compounds having different numbers of functional groups and\/or different types of polymerizable group (for example, compounds selected from an acrylic ester, a methacrylic ester, a styrene compound, a vinyl ether compound) is also effective for controlling both of sensitivity and strength.","How to select and use the addition-polymerizable compound is also an important factor for the compatibility with or dispersibility to other components of the photopolymerizable composition (such as a photopolymerization initiator, a colorant (a pigment and\/or a dye) and a binder polymer).

One of, or a mixture of two or more of, various known conventional dyes and pigments may be used, which may be appropriately selected depending on the use of the photopolymerizable composition. When the colored photopolymerizable composition of the invention is used for the production of color filters, either of a colorant of a chromatic color such as R, G and B for forming color pixels of the color filter or a black colorant generally used for forming black matrices may be employed.","The description of the colorant for use in the above-mentioned curable composition applies, in its entirety, to the colorant for use in the photopolymerizable composition (1).","When the photopolymerizable composition (1) is used to form black films such as black matrices, the colorant to be used may be black (black colorant).","In the invention, a variety of known black colorants such as black pigments and black dyes may be used.

For example, they may be selected from the following viewpoints. In view of photosensitive speed, a structure having a higher content of unsaturated group per molecule is preferable, and di- or higher-functional structures are preferred in many cases. In order to increase the strength of the image portion, namely the cured film, tri- or higher-functional structures are preferred. A method of using a combination of compounds having different numbers of functional groups and\/or different types of polymerizable groups (for example, compounds selected from an acrylic ester, a methacrylic ester, a styrene compound, a vinyl ether compound) is also effective for controlling both of photosensitivity and strength. High-molecular-weight compounds or highly hydrophobic compounds can have high sensitive speed or form high-strength films but are not preferred in some cases in view of development speed or precipitation in a liquid developer.","How to select and use the addition-polymerizable compound is also an important factor for the compatibility with or dispersibility to other components of the photosensitive layer (such as the binder polymer, the initiator and the colorant). For example, in some cases, the compatibility may be improved by using a low-purity compound or by using a combination of two or more compounds. A particular structure may also be selected in order to improve adhesion to a support, an overcoat layer or the like. A higher content of the addition-polymerizable compound in the photosensitive layer is advantageous in terms of sensitivity. If the content is too high, however, undesirable phase separation, manufacturing process problems due to the tackiness of the photosensitive layer (such as manufacturing failures resulting from transfer or adhesion of the photosensitive material components), precipitation from a liquid developer, and the like may occur.","Form these points of view, the content of the addition-polymerizable compound is preferably from 5 to 80% by mass, more preferably from 25 to 75% by mass, base on the mass of the total solids of the photopolymerizable composition (2).","Only a single addition-polymerizable compound may be used, or two or more addition-polymerizable compounds may be used in combination. Concerning how to use the addition-polymerizable compounds, an appropriate structure, composition or content may also be freely selected in consideration of the degree of inhibition of polymerization caused by oxygen, resolution, fogging properties, changes in refractive index, surface stickiness, or other points of view. In some cases, a layered structure or coating method using an undercoat or an overcoat may also be performed.","(2)-(C) Binder Polymer","The photopolymerizable composition (2) preferably contains a binder polymer.

Any binder polymer having the function of improving film characteristics may be used.","A linear organic high-molecular weight polymer is preferably contained as the binder polymer. Such a linear organic high-molecular-weight polymer to be used is not particularly limited, and may be any linear organic polymer. In order to enable development with water or a weakly alkaline aqueous solution, a linear organic high-molecular-weight polymer soluble or swellable in water or a weakly alkaline aqueous solution is preferably selected. The linear organic high-molecular-weight polymer may be selected and used not only as a film-forming agent for the photopolymerizable composition but also in consideration of the specifications of the developer such as water, a weakly alkaline aqueous solution or an organic solvent. For example, water development can be performed when a water-soluble organic high-molecular-weight polymer is used. Examples of such a linear organic high-molecular-weight polymer include addition polymerization products having a carboxylic acid group in a side chain, such as those described in JP-A No. 59-44615, JP-B Nos. 54-34327, 58-12577 and 54-25957, and JP-A Nos. 54-92723, 59-53836 and 59-71048, specifically, methacrylic acid copolymers, acrylic acid copolymers, itaconic acid copolymers, crotonic acid copolymers, maleic acid copolymers, and partially-esterified maleic acid copolymers.","Examples also include acidic cellulose derivatives having a carboxylic acid group in a side chain.

In order to enable development with water or a weakly alkaline aqueous solution, an amide bond- or urethane bond-containing linear high-molecular-weight organic polymer soluble or swellable in water or a weakly alkaline aqueous solution is preferably selected. The amide bond- or urethane bond-containing linear organic high-molecular-weight polymer may be selected and used depending on applications not only as a film-forming agent but also in consideration of the developer such as water, a weakly alkaline aqueous solution or an organic solvent. For example, water development can be performed when a water-soluble high-molecular-weight organic polymer is used. The amide group-containing binder described in JP-A No. 11-171907 is preferably used as the amide bond- or urethane bond-containing linear organic high-molecular-weight polymer, because it has both excellent developability and high film strength.","The acid group-containing urethane binder polymers described in JP-B Nos. 07-120040, 07-120041, 07-120042, and 08-12424, JP-A Nos. 63-287944, 63-287947 and 01-271741, and Japanese Patent Application No. 10-116232 are advantageous in terms of printing durability or low exposure properties, because they have very high strength. The amide group-containing binder described in JP-A No. 11-171907 is also preferred, because it has both excellent developability and high film strength.","Useful water-soluble linear organic high-molecular-weight polymers also include polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyethylene oxide.

In view of image strength or the like, the content of the binder polymer is preferably from 30 to 85% by mass, base on the mass of the total solids content of the photosensitive layer. The mass ratio of the addition-polymerizable compound to the binder polymer is preferably in the range of from 1\/9 to 7\/3.","In a preferred exemplary embodiment, the binder polymer to be used is substantially water-insoluble but alkali-soluble. This can eliminate the use of an environmentally-unfriendly organic solvent for a developer or limit the used amount to a very low level. In such a method of use, the acid value (the acid content per g of polymer expressed in chemical equivalent members) and the molecular weight of the binder polymer may be appropriately selected in consideration of image strength and developability. The acid value is preferably from 0.4 to 3.0 meq\/g, more preferably from 0.6 to 2.0 meq\/g, and the molecular weight is preferably from 3,000 to 500,000, more preferably from 10,000 to 300,000.","(2)-(D) Sensitizer","The photopolymerizable composition (2) preferably contains a sensitizer together with the novel oxime compound or the like as a polymerization initiator.

The development is generally performed at a temperature of 20\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C. for a time period of 20 to 90 seconds.","Examples of the alkali for use in the liquid developer include ammonia water and organic alkaline compounds such as ethylamine, diethylamine, dimethylethanolamine, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, choline, pyrrole, piperidine, and 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5,4,0]-7-undecene. An aqueous alkaline solution prepared by diluting the alkali with pure water to a concentration of 0.001 to 10% by mass, preferably of 0.01 to 1% by mass may be used. When a liquid developer comprising such an aqueous alkaline solution is used, washing (rinsing) with pure water is generally performed after the development.","If necessary, the method of the invention for producing a color filter may further include the step of curing the colored pattern by heating and\/or exposure to light after the photopolymerizable composition layer-forming step, the exposure step and the development step have been conducted.","The colored photopolymerizable composition layer-forming step, the exposure step and the development step (and optionally the curing step) may be repeated for the number of times corresponding to the number of the desired hues, whereby a color filter of the desired hues may be produced.","While the method of the invention for producing a color filter has been described based on an exemplary embodiment where the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention is used in a process of forming a colored pattern of a color filter, such an exemplary embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. For example, the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention may also be used to form black matrices for separating colored patterns (pixels) in a color filter.","The colored photopolymerizable composition layer-forming step, the exposure step and the development step (and optionally the curing step) of the color filter production method of the invention may also be used in a process of forming a black matrix on a substrate. Specifically, the colored photopolymerizable composition layer-forming step, the exposure step and the development step (and optionally the curing step) are performed as described above using the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention containing a black colorant such as carbon black or black titanium oxide, so that a black matrix (black pattern) is formed on the substrate.","The color filter of the invention is produced with the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention. In the color filter, therefore, the colored pattern exhibits excellent adhesion to the supporting substrate, and the cured composition has excellent resistance to development. Therefore, the exposure sensitivity is high, the adhesion to the substrate of the exposed portion is excellent, and a high-resolution pattern having a desired cross-sectional shape can be formed. Therefore, the color filter of the invention is suitable for use in liquid crystal displays and solid-state imaging devices such as CCDs and particularly suitable for use in high-resolution CCD devices or CMOS devices having more than a million pixels. Specifically, the color filter of the invention is preferably used for solid-state imaging devices.","For example, the color filter of the invention may be placed between the light-receiving part of each pixel of a CCD and a converging microlens.","<Planographic Printing Plate Precursor>","A description is given below of the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention.","The planographic printing plate precursor includes a support and a photosensitive layer that is placed on the support and contains the photopolymerizable composition of the invention.","If necessary, the planographic printing plate precursor may further include any other layer such as a protective layer and an intermediate layer. Since the planographic printing plate precursor contains the photopolymerizable composition of the invention in the photosensitive layer and thus have a high sensitivity, stability over time and printing durability. Each element of the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention is described below.","Photosensitive Layer","The photosensitive layer is a layer containing the photopolymerizable composition of the invention. Specifically, the photosensitive layer may be formed by a process that includes using the photopolymerizable composition (2) (a preferred example of the photopolymerizable composition of the invention) as a composition for forming a photosensitive layer (hereinafter also referred to as \u201cthe photosensitive layer-forming composition\u201d), applying a coating liquid containing the composition to a support and dying the coating to form a photosensitive layer.","For the application of the photosensitive layer-forming composition to the support, the respective components to be contained in the composition may be used in the form of solutions in various organic solvents. Examples of solvents that may be used in this process include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, ethylene dichloride, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, acetyl acetone, cyclohexanone, diacetone alcohol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, 3-methoxypropanol, methoxymethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, 3-methoxypropyl acetate, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, \u03b3-butyrolactone, methyl lactate, and ethyl lactate. Only a single solvent may be used, or a mixture of two or more solvents may be used. The coating solution appropriately has a solids content of 2 to 50% by mass.","The coating amount of the photosensitive layer on the support is preferably selected as appropriate depending on applications, because it may have effects on the sensitivity and\/or developability of the photosensitive layer and on the strength and\/or printing durability of the exposed film. If the coating amount is too small, the printing durability may be insufficient. If the coating amount is too large, the sensitivity may be reduced so that the necessary exposure time may increase, and the development time may also undesirably increase. For a main object of the invention, namely for a planographic printing plate for scanning exposure, the coating amount in terms of the mass after drying may be appropriately from 0.1 g\/mto 10 g\/m, more preferably from 0.5 g\/mto 5 g\/m.","Support","In the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention, the support preferably has a hydrophilic surface. The hydrophilic support may be selected from known conventional hydrophilic supports used for planographic printing plates, without particular limitations.","The support is preferably a dimensionally stable plate-shaped material, examples of which include paper, paper laminated with plastic (such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or polystyrene), a metal plate (such as of an aluminum, zinc or copper plate), a plastic film (such as a film of cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose nitrate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, or polyvinyl acetal), and paper or a plastic film on which metal such as those listed above is laminated or vapor-deposited. If necessary, the surface of these materials may be subjected to an appropriate known physical and\/or chemical treatment for the purpose of imparting hydrophilicity, improving strength or the like.","Paper, a polyester film or an aluminum plate is preferred as the support. The aluminum plate is particularly preferred, because it has excellent dimensional stability, is relatively inexpensive and can provide a highly hydrophilic or strong surface by being subjected to surface treatment that may be conducted as necessary. A composite sheet comprising a polyethylene terephthalate film and an aluminum sheet bonded thereto as described in JP-B No. 48-18327 is also preferable.","Preferred examples of the aluminum plate include a pure aluminum plate and a plate of an aluminum alloy comprising aluminum as the main component and a small amount of other elements. A plastic film on which aluminum is laminated or vapor-deposited may also be used. Examples of such other elements to be contained in aluminum alloys include silicon, iron, manganese, copper, magnesium, chromium, zinc, bismuth, nickel, and titanium. The content of foreign elements in the alloy is at most 10% by mass or less. In the invention, pure aluminum is particularly preferred. However, it is difficult to produce completely pure aluminum in terms of refinement technology, and therefore, trace amounts of other elements may be contained. The aluminum plate for use in the invention is not limited to have a particular composition, and may be appropriately selected from aluminum plates of any known conventional material. The aluminum plate for use in the invention preferably may have a thickness of about 0.1 mm to about 0.6 mm, preferably of 0.15 mm to 0.4 mm, particularly preferably of 0.2 mm to 0.3 mm.","When the support has a metallic surface, specifically an aluminum surface, it preferably has undergone surface treatment such as surface roughening (graining), immersion into an aqueous solution of sodium silicate, potassium fluorozirconate, phosphate, or the like, or anodic oxidation.","Surface roughening of the aluminum plate may be performed by various methods such as methods of mechanically roughening the surface, methods of electrochemically dissolving and roughening the surface, and methods of chemically and selectively dissolving the surface. The mechanical roughening may be a known mechanical method such as ball polishing, brush polishing, blast polishing, and buff polishing. Electrochemical surface roughening methods may be performed in an electrolytic solution of hydrochloric acid, nitric acid or the like under alternating or direct current. A combination of both methods may also be used in combination as disclose in JP-A No.54-63902. Prior to roughening of the surface of the aluminum plate, if necessary, degreasing with a surfactant, an organic solvent or an aqueous alkaline solution may be performed to remove rolling oil from the surface.","An aluminum plate that has undergone immersion in an aqueous sodium silicate solution after surface roughening is preferably used. An aluminum plate that has undergone the processes of anodic oxidation of the aluminum plate and immersion in an aqueous alkali metal silicate solution as described in JP-B No. 47-5125 may also preferably be used. For example, the anodic oxidation may be performed by allowing a current to flow through the aluminum plate serving as an anode in an electrolyte solution containing one or more of aqueous or nonaqueous solutions of inorganic acids such as phosphoric acid, chromic acid, sulfuric acid, and boric acid, organic acids such as oxalic acid and sulfamic acid, or salts thereof.","The silicate electrodeposition described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,658,662 is also effective.","The surface treatment disclosed in JP-B No. 46-27481 and JP-A Nos. 52-58602 and 52-30503 is also useful which uses an electrolytically grained support in combination with the anodic oxidation and sodium silicate treatment.","In a preferred treatment, mechanical surface roughening, chemical etching, electrolytic graining, anodic oxidation, and sodium silicate treatment are sequentially performed as described in JP-A No. 56-28893.","After these treatments, undercoating may be preferably performed. The undercoating may include a water-soluble resin such as polyvinyl phosphonic acid, a polymer or copolymer having a sulfonic acid group in a side chain, or polyacrylic acid; a water-soluble metal salt (such as zinc borate); a yellow dye; or an amine salt.","A sol-gel-treated substrate is also preferably used in which a functional group capable of undergoing a radical addition reaction is covalently bonded as disclosed in JP-A No. 07-154983.","In another preferred example, a water-resistant hydrophilic layer may be formed as a surface layer on an arbitrary support. Examples of such a surface layer include a layer comprising an inorganic pigment and a binding agent as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,055,295 and JP-A No. 56-13168, a hydrophilic swelling layer as described in JP-A No. 09-80744, and a sol-gel film of titanium oxide, polyvinyl alcohol or silicates as described in Japanese Patent Application National Publication (Laid-Open) No. 08-507727.","These hydrophilizing treatments may be performed not only to hydrophilize the surface of the support but also to prevent an undesirable reaction of the photopolymerizable composition to be provided thereon and to improve adhesion of the photosensitive layer.","Protective Layer","The planographic printing plate precursor of the invention preferably further includes a protective layer on the photosensitive layer. The protective layer can prevent low-molecular compounds such as basic substances or oxygen in the air, which inhibits image-forming reaction in the photosensitive layer caused by exposure to light, from entering the photosensitive layer, and enables exposure in the air. Therefore, the protective layer preferably has such characteristics that the protective layer is less permeable to low-molecular compounds such oxygen, does not substantially inhibit transmission of light for exposure, is excellent in adhesion property to the photosensitive layer, and is easily removable by a development process after exposure.","Improvements of the protective layer have been made as described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 3,458,311 and JP-A No.55-49729. For example, water-soluble polymer compounds having relatively high crystallinity may be preferably used for the protective layer. Examples of such materials include water-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, acidic celluloses, gelatin, gum arabic, and polyacrylic acid. In particular, the best result in terms of basic characteristics such as oxygen barrier characteristics and removability by development can be obtained using polyvinyl alcohol as a main component.","Polyvinyl alcohol for use in the protective layer may be partially substituted by at least one of an ester, an ether and an acetal, as long as it has an unsubstituted vinyl alcohol unit for imparting necessary oxygen barrier characteristics and water solubility. The polyvinyl alcohol may partially have at least one other copolymerization component. Specifically, the polyvinyl alcohol may be hydrolyzed to a degree of 71 to 100 mol % and may have a mass average molecular weight in the range of 300 to 2400. Examples of the polyvinyl alcohol include PVA-105, PVA-110, PVA-117, PVA-117H, PVA-120, PVA-124, PVA-124H, PVA-CS, PVA-CST, PVA-HC, PVA-203, PVA-204, PVA-205, PVA-210, PVA-217, PVA-220, PVA-224, PVA-217EE, PVA-217E, PVA-220E, PVA-224E, PVA-405, PVA-420, PVA-613, and L-8 manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd.","The components (choice of PVAs, use of additives and the like), the coating amount and the like of the protective layer may be selected in consideration of on oxygen barrier characteristics, removability by development, fogging, adhesion property, or scratch resistance. In general, a higher rate of hydrolysis of the PVA to be used (a higher content of unsubstituted vinyl alcohol units in the protective layer) or a larger thickness of the film leads to a higher level of oxygen barrier characteristics, which is advantageous in terms of sensitivity. When oxygen barrier characteristics are increased excessively, problems may occur such as unnecessary polymerization reactions during manufacture or storage and unnecessary fogging or thickening of image lines during imagewise exposure. The adhesion to the image portion and the scratch resistance are also very important for the handleability of the printing plate. Methods for applying the protective layer are described in detail in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,458,313 and JP-A No. 55-49729.","The protective layer may also have another function. For example, a colorant (such as a water-soluble dye) capable of efficiently transmitting light in the range of 350 nm to 450 nm to be used for exposure and efficiently absorbing light at 500 nm or more may be added to the protective layer so that safe light suitability can be further improved without a reduction in sensitivity.","Other Layers","Other layers such as layers for improving adhesion between the photosensitive layer and the support and layers for improving the removability of the unexposed photosensitive layer by development may also be provided. For example, the adhesion or the printing durability may be improved by adding a diazonium structure-containing compound or a compound capable of relatively strongly interacting with the substrate, such as phosphonic compounds or by providing an undercoat layer of such a compound. On the other hand, the developability of the non-image portion or the antifouling properties may be improved by adding a hydrophilic polymer such as polyacrylic acid or polysulfonic acid or by providing an undercoat layer of such a polymer.","Plate Making","In general, the planographic printing plate precursor is imagewise exposed to light and then the unexposed portion is removed by using a liquid developer to form an image.","Any known light exposure method may be applied to the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention, without limitations. The wavelength of the light source is preferably from 350 nm to 450 nm, and specifically InGaN semiconductor lasers are preferred. The exposure mechanism may be of any system such as an internal drum system, an external drum system or a flathead system. A highly water-soluble component may be used for the photosensitive layer so that the layer can dissolved in neutral water or weakly alkaline water. The planographic printing plate having such a constitution may be subjected to on-press exposure and development after mounted on a printing machine.","Available laser light sources in the range of 350 nm to 450 nm include the lasers described below.","Gas lasers include Ar ion lasers (364 nm, 351 nm, 10 mW to 1 W), Kr ion lasers (356 nm, 351 nm, 10 mW to 1 W) and He\u2014Cd lasers (441 nm, 325 nm, 1 to 100 mW); Solid-state lasers include a combination of Nd:YAG (YVO) and SHG crystal (twice) (355 nm, 5 mW to 1 W) and a combination of Cr:LiSAF and SHG crystal (430 nm, 10 mW); Semiconductor lasers include KNbOring resonators (430 nm, 30 mW), a combination of a waveguide type wavelength converting device and an AlGaAs or InGaAs semiconductor (380 to 450 nm, 5 to 100 mW), a combination of a waveguide type wavelength converting device and an AlGaInP or AlGaAs semiconductor (300 to 350 nm, 5 to 100 mW), and AlGaInN lasers (350 to 450 nm, 5 to 30 mW); Other lasers include pulsed lasers such as Nlasers (337 nm, 0.1 to 10 mJ pulse) and XeF lasers (351 nm, 10 to 250 mJ pulse).","Above all, AlGaInN semiconductor lasers (commercially available InGaN semiconductor lasers (400 to 410 nm, 5 to 30 mW) are particularly preferred in view of wavelength characteristics and cost.","For scanning exposure type planographic printing plate exposure systems, internal drum, external drum, or flathead systems may be used as exposure mechanisms, and all of the light sources describe above, except for pulsed lasers, may be used as light sources. Practically, the exposure systems described below are particularly preferred in view of the relationship between the sensitivity of the material and plate making time.","A single-beam exposure system of an internal drum system using a single gas or solid-state laser source;","A multi-beam exposure system of a flathead system using a number of (ten or more) semiconductor lasers; and","A multi-beam exposure system of an external drum system using a number of (ten or more) semiconductor lasers.","For laser direct drawing type planographic printing plates as described above, the equation (eq1): X\u00b7S=n\u00b7q\u00b7t is generally established, wherein X(J\/cm) is the sensitivity of the photosensitive material, S(cm) is the exposed area of the photosensitive material, q(W) is the power of one laser light source, n is the number of the laser light sources, and t(s) is the total exposure time.","In the case of (i) the internal drum system (single beam), the equation (eq2): f\u00b7Z\u00b7t=Lx is generally established, wherein f(radian\/s) is the rotational frequency of the laser, Lx(cm) is the sub-scanning length of the photosensitive material, Z(dots\/cm) is the resolution, and t(s) is the total exposure time.","In the case of (ii) the external drum system (multi-beam), the equation (eq3): F\u00b7Z\u00b7n\u00b7t=Lx is generally established, wherein F (radian\/s) is the rotational frequency of the drum, Lx(cm) is the sub-scanning length of the photosensitive material, Z(dots\/cm) is the resolution, t(s) is the total exposure time, and n is the number of the beams.","In the case of (iii) the flathead system (multi-beam), the equation (eq4): H\u00b7Z\u00b7n\u00b7t=Lx is generally established, wherein H(radian\/s) is the rotational frequency of the polygon mirror, Lx(cm) is the sub-scanning length of the photosensitive material, Z(dots\/cm) is the resolution, t(s) is the total exposure time, and n is the number of the beams.","Substitution of the resolution (2560 dpi) required of a practical printing plate, the size of the plate (A1\/B1, 42 inches in sub-scanning length), the exposure condition of about 20 sheets per hour, and the photosensitive characteristics of the photopolymerizable composition of the invention (the photosensitive wavelength, and a sensitivity of about 0.1 mJ\/cm) into the equations suggests that the photosensitive material of the invention should preferably be used in combination with a semiconductor laser of a multi-beam exposure type. Also taking handleability and cost into account, it is suggested that the photosensitive material of the invention is most preferably used in combination with a semiconductor laser, multi-beam exposure system of an external drum system.","Other examples of light sources that may be used for exposure include any of ultra-high pressure, high pressure, medium pressure, and low pressure mercury lamps, chemical lamps, carbon arc lamps, xenon lamps, metal halide lamps, a variety of visible and ultraviolet laser lamps, fluorescent lamps, tungsten lamps, and sunlight.","Liquid developers suitable for the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention include the developers described in JP-B No. 57-7427. Appropriate developers include aqueous solutions of inorganic alkaline agents such as sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium tertiary phosphate, sodium secondary phosphate, ammonium tertiary phosphate, ammonium secondary phosphate, sodium metasilicate, sodium bicarbonate, and ammonia water, and aqueous solutions of organic alkaline agents such as monoethanolamine and diethanolamine. The alkaline agent may be added such that the alkaline solution may have a concentration of 0.1 to 10% by mass, preferably of 0.5 to 5% by mass.","If necessary, the alkaline aqueous solution may contain a small amount of a surfactant or an organic solvent such as benzyl alcohol, 2-phenoxyethanol, or 2-butoxyethanol. Examples of such additives include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,375,171 and 3,615,480.","The liquid developers described in JP-A Nos. 50-26601 and 58-54341 and JP-B Nos. 56-39464 and 56-42860 are also excellent.","The liquid developer described in JP-A No. 2002-202616 is particularly preferred which contains a nonionic compound represented by Formula (VIII) and has a pH of 11.5 to 12.8 and a conductivity of 3 to 30 mS\/cm.\n\nA\u2212W \u2003\u2003Formula (VIII)\n","In Formula (VIII), A represents such a hydrophobic organic group that A\u2212H has a log P of 1.5 or more, and W represents such a nonionic hydrophilic organic group that W\u2212H has a log P of less than 1.0.","The components of the liquid developer are described in detail in Paragraphs [0024] to [0067] of JP-A No. 2002-202616.","It is effective to add the nonionic compound represented by Formula (VIII) such that its concentration in the liquid developer becomes 0.1 to 15% by mass, preferably of 1.0 to 8.0% by mass.","If necessary, the process of making a printing plate from the planographic printing plate precursor may further include heating the whole surface before or during exposure or between exposure and development. Such heating can facilitate the image forming reaction in the photosensitive layer so that advantages such as an increase in sensitivity or printing durability and stabilization of sensitivity can be achieved. In addition, whole surface exposure or whole surface post heating may be effectively performed on the image after the development in order to improve the strength or printing durability of the image. In general, heating before the development is preferably performed under mild conditions at 150\u00b0 C. or lower. At 150\u00b0 C. or lower, the non-image portion can be free of the problem of fogging. Very strong conditions should be used for heating after the development. Such conditions are generally in the range of 200 to 500\u00b0 C. At 200\u00b0 C. or higher, the image strengthening effect can be sufficiently obtained. At 500\u00b0 C. or lower, problems such as deterioration of the support and thermal decomposition of the image portion do not occur.","The present invention is more specifically described using examples below. However, the present invention is not limited to the examples. Many alternatives, variations and modifications are possible without departing from the gist of the invention.","Tables 1 and 2 below show details of the specific oxime compounds (Compounds 1 to 8)

Evaluation of Storage Stability of Colored Curable Composition B-1 (Coating Liquid)","After the colored curable composition B-1 was stored at room temperature for 1 month, the degree of precipitation of matters was visually evaluated according to the criteria below. The results are shown in Table 5.\n\n","5. Preparation of Color Filter by Using Colored Curable Composition B-1 and Evaluation Thereof","The colored curable composition B-1 prepared in the section 3. was applied to the undercoat layer of the silicon wafer substrate having an undercoat layer obtained in the section 2. so that a photosetting coating film was formed. The coating film was then heated (pre-baked) with a hot plate at 100\u00b0 C. for 120 seconds so as to provide a dry thickness of 0.9 \u03bcm.","The film was then exposed to light with a wavelength of 365 nm through a mask having a 2 \u03bcm square island pattern at exposure amounts in the range of 10 to 1,600 mJ\/cmusing an i-line stepper exposure system (trade name: FPA-3000i5+, manufactured by Cannon Inc.).","The silicon wafer substrate having the irradiated coating film was then mounted on a horizontal rotary table of a spin-shower developing machine (trade name: Model DW-30, manufactured by Chemitronics Co., Ltd.) and subjected to a paddle development process at 23\u00b0 C. for 60 seconds with CD-2000 (manufactured by Fuji Film Electronics Materials Co., Ltd.) so that a colored pattern was formed on the silicon wafer substrate).","The silicon wafer substrate having the colored pattern was fixed on the horizontal rotary table by vacuum chucking. The colored pattern was rinsed with a shower of pure water supplied from above the rotation center by using a spray nozzle, while the silicon wafer substrate was rotated at a rotation number of 50 rpm by means of a rotator, and then the colored pattern was spray-dried.","As a result, a color filter comprising the substrate and the colored pattern formed thereon was obtained.","<Exposure Sensitivity and Size of Pattern>","The minimum exposure amount at which the post-development thickness of the region that was irradiated with light in the exposure step became 95% or more of the thickness (100%) of the film before the exposure was evaluated as the exposure requirement amount. A smaller exposure requirement amount indicates a higher sensitivity.","In this process, the size of the colored pattern was measured using a length measuring SEM (trade name: S-9260A, manufactured by Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation). A pattern size that is closer to 2 \u03bcm indicates sufficient curing, and higher sensitivity.","The results are shown in Table 5.","Developability, Adhesion to Substrate, and Cross-Sectional Shape of Pattern","Developability, adhesion to the substrate and the cross-sectional shape of the pattern were evaluated according to the methods and the criteria used in Example 2-1.

The coating film was then heated (pre-baked) with a hot plate at 100\u00b0 C. for 120 seconds so as to provide a dry thickness of 0.9 \u03b7m.","The film was then exposed to light with a wavelength of 365 nm through a mask having a 2 \u03bcm square island pattern at exposure amounts in the range of 10 to 1,600 mJ\/cmusing an i-line stepper exposure system (trade name: FPA-3000i5+, manufactured by Cannon Inc.).","The silicon wafer substrate having the irradiated coating film was then mounted on a horizontal rotary table of a spin-shower developing machine (trade name: Model DW-30, manufactured by Chemitronics Co., Ltd.) and subjected to a paddle development process at 23\u00b0 C. for 60 seconds with CD-2000 (manufactured by Fuji Film Electronics Materials Co., Ltd.) so that a colored pattern was formed on the silicon wafer substrate.","The silicon wafer substrate having the colored pattern formed thereon was fixed on the horizontal rotary table by vacuum chucking. The colored pattern was rinsed with a shower of pure water supplied from above the rotation center with a spray nozzle, while the silicon wafer substrate was rotated at a rotation number of 50 r.p.m by means of a rotator, and then the colored pattern was spray-dried.","As a result, a color filter comprising the substrate and the colored pattern formed thereon was obtained.","Exposure Sensitivity and Size of Pattern","The minimum exposure amount at which the post-development thickness of the region that was irradiated with light in the exposure step became 95% or more of the thickness (100%) of the film before the exposure was evaluated as the exposure requirement amount. A smaller exposure requirement amount indicates a higher sensitivity.","In this process, the size of the colored pattern was measured using a length measuring SEM (trade name: S-9260A, manufactured by Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation). A pattern size that is closer to 2 \u03bcm indicates sufficient curing and higher sensitivity.","The results are shown in Table 11.","Developability, Coloration by Heat Aging, Adhesion to Substrate, and Cross-Sectional Shape of Pattern","Developability, coloration by heat aging, adhesion to the substrate, and the cross-sectional shape of the pattern were evaluated according to the methods and the criteria employed in Example 5-1.

The surface of the aluminum plate was then electrolytically roughened in an aqueous solution of 1% nitric acid aqueous solution at VA=12.7 V under the application of a sinusoidal alternating current with an anodic electric quantity of 300 C\/dm. The resulting surface roughness was measured to be 0.45 \u03bcm (in terms of Ra). Subsequently, the aluminum plate was immersed in an aqueous solution of 30% HSOat 55\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes for desmutting. The aluminum plate was then anodized in an aqueous solution of 20% HSOat 33\u00b0 C. for 50 seconds at a current density of 5 A\/dmwith a cathode placed on the grained surface so that an anodized layer having a thickness of 2.7 g\/mwas formed.","As a result, a support for a planographic printing plate precursor was obtained.","Formation of Photosensitive Layer","A photosensitive layer coating liquid with the composition described below was applied to the resulting support so as to provide a dry coating amount of 1.4 g\/mand dried at 95\u00b0 C. so that a photosensitive layer was formed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0865","num":"0900"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00023","num":"00023"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Photosensitive Layer Coating Liquid Composition"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Addition-polymerizable compound (the","0.80","parts by mass"]},{"entry":"compound shown in Table 14 below)"},{"entry":["Binder polymer (the compound shown","0.90","parts by mass"]},{"entry":"in Table 14)"},{"entry":["Sensitizer (the compound shown in","absent or 0.10","parts by mass"]},{"entry":"Table 14)"},{"entry":["Specific Oxime Compound or","0.05","parts by mass"]},{"entry":"Comparative Compound (the compound"},{"entry":"shown in Table 14)"},{"entry":["Co-sensitizer (the compound shown","absent or 0.25","parts by mass"]},{"entry":"in Table 14)"},{"entry":["Fluorosurfactant","0.02","parts by mass"]},{"entry":"(Magafac F-177 (trade name)"},{"entry":"manufactured by Dainippon Ink and"},{"entry":"Chemicals, Incorporated)"},{"entry":["Thermal polymerization inhibitor","0.03","parts by mass"]},{"entry":"(N-nitrosohydroxylamine aluminum"},{"entry":"salt)"},{"entry":["\u03b5 type copper phthalocyanine dispersion","0.2","parts by mass"]},{"entry":["Methyl ethyl ketone","16.0","parts by mass"]},{"entry":["Propylene glycol monomethyl ether","16.0","parts by mass"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Formation of Protective Layer","An aqueous solution of 3% by mass of polyvinyl alcohol (98% by mole in saponification degree and 550 in polymerization degree) was applied to the resulting photosensitive layer so as to provide a dry coating mass of 2 g\/mand dried at 100\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes so that a protective layer was formed.","As a result of the process described above, planographic printing plate precursors of Examples and Comparative Examples were obtained, respectively.","Plate Making","Each planographic printing plate precursor was subjected to the exposure process and the development process described below.","Exposure","The planographic printing plate precursor was subjected to scanning exposure with a 405 nm (wavelength) violet LD (trade name: Violet Boxer, manufactured by FFEI Ltd.) at a exposure amount of 50 \u03bcJ\/cmunder the conditions of 4,000 dpi and 175 lines\/inch with respect to a solid image and a 1-99% dot image (at intervals of 1%).","Development","An automatic processor (trade name: LP-850P2, manufactured by FUJIFILM Corporation) into which Developer 1 shown below and a finishing gum liquid (trade name: FP-2W, manufactured by FUJIFILM Corporation) was loaded was used to perform a standard process.
