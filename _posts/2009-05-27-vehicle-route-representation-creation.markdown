{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Vehicle route planning typically relies on representation of roadway networks. Roadway networks can be represented electronically, such as digital maps displayed on computing devices. User often access digital maps on computers, smart phones, and vehicle computer navigation systems, for example, to plan travel routes and\/or identify a present location of their vehicle. Accuracy of maps, such as electronic maps, is needed for proper route planning, and roadways and other vehicular travel routes can often change due to construction, new roads, or other conditions, for example.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A representation of a roadway network should be accurate in terms of the connectivity and directionality of road segments. Where digital maps are used in computer-based route planning, for example, accuracy is important for basic route planning algorithms that are often used to identify routes. Further, a representation should also be geometrically accurate in order to display routes and give clear instructions about how far to drive between turns, such as in vehicle navigation systems.","Traditionally, digital representations of the road network have been derived from data that comes from specialized vehicles roaming a road network, operated by skilled data gathers. This type of data collection can be expensive and is limited by a number of specialized vehicles utilized. Another current approach to building a representation of the road network utilizes a combination of global positioning satellite (GPS) traces (e.g., collections of data points connected by edges) and satellite images as input to a manually edited road map. While this approach has more scalability potential than prior methods, it still depends on manual editing.","Techniques and systems are disclosed for creating an accurate representation of a roadway network positioning data using non-traditional mapping vehicles. For example, public vehicles, taxis, delivery vehicles and other may be fitted with GPS tracking units to collect traces as the vehicles travel their typical routes.","In one embodiment, raw positioning data (e.g., GPS data points) can be collected, such as from a plurality of vehicles, which mark traces of vehicular travel. In this embodiment, a location of the traces can be clarified, such as into more coherent groups, using adjustment forces that are related to the traces. From these groups of clarified traces, a graph line can be created by merging the traces, for example, into graph of nodes and edges representing the road network. In this embodiment, the graph may be suitable for planning vehicle travel routes.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised that allows for creation of a digital vehicular travel route, for example, such as an electronic map that can be used to determine travel routes for automobiles.  is a flow chart diagram of an exemplary method  for generating graph-line maps of vehicular routes. The exemplary method  begins at  and involves obtaining a plurality of positioning data that marks traces of vehicular travel, at . In one embodiment, the positioning data comprises global positioning satellite (GPS) data that traces automobiles traveling on roadways. In this embodiment, for example, GPS tracking devices can be installed on a plurality of vehicles that regularly travel on roadways, such as taxis, delivery vehicles, buses, public services vehicles, and other public and private vehicles.","In one embodiment the data is collected and compiled into a plurality of traces of vehicular traffic, such as shown in the illustration  of . The exemplary illustration of traces  shows a plurality of traces that represent a plurality of automobiles traveling over a segment of roadway.  represents a large number of traces traveling over a same section of the road in a same general location; whereas  shows some individual traces that represents vehicles that may have traveled over a portion of the road that is not commonly used.","Returning to , at , a location of a trace is clarified using adjustment forces that are related to the trace. As seen in , the traces  and  appear to cover a multitude of travel location for vehicles that provide the positioning data. The variety of trace location can be attributed to many factors, such as GPS data error, signal noise, interference, automobiles traveling in an irregular pattern, etc. In one embodiment, in order to provide for a more accurate vehicular route, such as a digital map, the traces can be clarified to identify a more accurate location for the traces, and help account for some of the potential errors attributed to the traces.","A trace can comprise a plurality of location nodes, such as location data points from GPS data, and a plurality of edges between the respective nodes. In this way, for example, a trace can be formed by drawing a line between a series of points marking where a vehicle has traveled. Adjustment forces related to the trace can be used to clarify a location for the trace, for example, adjusting the locations to form more accurate routes.  is an illustration  of exemplary vehicle travel segment where traces have been clarified using adjustment forces. In this illustration , the traces have been separated into lanes traveling in opposite directions  and , for example, as on a highway or freeway. Further, the traces have been grouped together to further define lane and roadway locations traveled by the traced vehicles. Some traces, such as , may remain outside some of the main group of traces grouped together. In one embodiment, these traces can be removed after the clarification process.","Returning to , at , related traces are merged into a graph line. In one embodiment, the traces that are grouped together, such as  in , are merged into a single graph line, which may represent a roadway for vehicle travel, for example.  is an illustration  of a segment of a roadway where clarified traces that are related have been merged into graph lines. In this example, the graph line  and  can represent opposite lanes of a roadway, where vehicles travel in opposite directions. In this example, the groups of related traces, such as  and  in , were merged into the respective graph lines  and . Further, an intersection  of graph lines can be created where the graph lines come together. In one embodiment, the intersection  may represent a point from\/to which vehicle travel calculations can be determined (e.g., when determining a travel route, time, distance, etc. from an electronic map).","In one embodiment, time-related data may be obtained for respective positioning data (e.g., GPS data points), represented by nodes of a trace. This time-related data may be utilized to identify directionality for the nodes and related portions of the trace. For example, where respective nodes are collected at subsequent times, the times may be used to identify a direction in which the vehicle was traveling when collecting GPS data points.","Having merged the related traces into a graph line, the exemplary method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","503","504","506"]},"In this embodiment , at , a directionality difference is determined for the node between respective one or more neighboring traces. For example, the traces  in  appear to be closely grouped together. Because we can determine a direction of a trace by the time-related information associated with respective trace-nodes, as described above, a difference in direction can be determined for the node in question when compared with neighboring traces.","At , in , it is determined whether the directionality adjustment force is over a threshold. In one embodiment, a function of the directionality of the node in question can be compared with a function of the directionality of a segment of the neighboring trace. For example, the directionality of the node in question and the trace segment in question may comprise a directional value in degrees (of a compass). In one embodiment, the cosine of the two directional values may be calculated (e.g., Cos(dir, dir)), and a value less than one may represent a repelling force, and greater than one an attracting force.","For example, if dirand dirhave opposite directions, the cosine value will be less than one (e.g., over the threshold), and the directionality adjustment force will be a repelling force. Further, if dirand dirhave common directions, the cosine value will be greater than one (e.g., under the threshold), and the directionality adjustment force will be an attraction force. Additionally, if dirand dirhave orthogonal directions, the directionality adjustment force will be zero.","At , where the directionality difference is over the threshold, a magnitude of the repelling force can be determined between the node and the respective one or more neighboring traces. For example, a smaller cosine value from the calculations above may indicate a greater repelling force for the node away from the trace segment. However, at , if the directionality is under the threshold, a magnitude of an attraction force can be determined between the node and the respective one or more neighboring traces. For example, a larger cosine value from the above calculations may indicate a greater attraction force for the node to the trace segment.","At , an attraction force can be determined for the node to its original position (e.g., from a possible position to where it is moved due to the attraction force to a neighboring trace). As an example, the exemplary embodiment , in , illustrates two traces  and  with common directionality (e.g., heading from left to right across the illustration). Node A in the trace  may have been moved toward the trace  due to an attraction force  toward the trace  (e.g., based on the common direction of the two traces) to its current location . However, an attraction force  to node A's original position  may adjust a position of the node back toward the original position . In this way, for example, a balance may be struck between a type of gravitational force  pulling the node  toward a neighbor  and a type of springy force  that pulls the node  back to its original position .","In another embodiment, the magnitude of the adjustment forces for a node may be determined by utilizing closed form equations to predict outcomes using different parameters. For example, where one may wish traces to coalesce and separate when roadways are separate, closed form equations can be written to account for these idealized scenarios. In this way, in this example, a variety of parameters can be input and adjusted to predict what would occur in a variety of situations. Further, these simple scenarios can be used to see what may happen, for example, and then applied to real-world data. In other words, one may test a variety of parameters without using real-world data, to determine appropriate adjustment force magnitudes.","Returning to , at , the adjustment forces for the node can be aggregated. For example, the repelling force, and\/or attraction forces (e.g., to a neighboring trace and to the node's original position) can be aggregated for the node for the respective one or more neighboring traces. If the aggregated adjustment forces meet a threshold, at , the node can be moved to a location in accordance with the magnitude of the aggregated adjustment forces, at . For example, in , where the node A has a same directionality as the neighboring trace , the aggregated adjustment forces may comprise merely the two attraction forces, which allow for node A to be moved to a new position . However, if the node in question has a neighboring trace with an opposite directionality, after the aggregation the node may be moved away from the neighboring traces, as seen in the illustration  of .","In this example, the traces  before clarification  are close together. However, because some of the traces have opposing directionality, in this embodiment, the nodes of a trace are repelled away, forming two distinct lanes of traces  after clarification . Further, those traces that have common directionality are attracted closer to each other after clarification  to form more distinct lane patterns for a roadway, for example.","At , in , after the node has been moved according to the adjustment forces, or if the aggregated adjustment forces do not meet the threshold for being moved, a next node from the trace is retrieved and sent through the loop at . Further, at , when respective nodes in a trace have been subjected to clarification, a next trace is retrieved and sent through the clarification loop at . At , a determination is made regarding whether resultant forces are less than some (predetermined) threshold. If not, the method advances to  where the respective nodes can be moved to the locations recorded at , and the method then loops back to  for another iteration. If the resultant forces are less than the threshold, the method advances to  for clarified traces. That is, a result of the clarification of the respective traces is a plurality of clarified traces , such as those represented in .","I will be appreciated that, while the above embodiments describe aggregating adjustment forces for the respective traces (e.g., per node), the techniques and systems described herein are not limited to these embodiments. It is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate ways to combine or utilize a variety of adjustment forces to clarify the traces. For example, one may attempt to balance attraction forces between a nodes original position and a neighboring trace by incrementally moving the node toward the trace and calculating whether the forces are balanced between each other. Further, after balancing attraction forces, one may determine whether a repelling force may be necessary to move traces apart based on directionality differences.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","526","802"]},"At , it is determined whether the trace node in question should be merged into the graph line, for example, by merging with an existing graph-line node. Initially, when the graph line comprises no nodes or edges, the respective determinations at , , and  will result in a negative. Therefore, at , the trace-node is not merged with a graph-line node, as there is not one present. The trace node is added to the graph line, at , and because it is a first node added to the graph line, no edge will be added at . At , a next trace node is retrieved for the trace and run through the merging loop, at .","When a second trace node is considered, it will also be added to the graph line (not merged), as it will not meet the criteria in . Therefore, in one embodiment, a first trace that is run through the graph line merging procedure may result in the trace (or trace segment) being merged into the graph line.  illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a stepped process for merging several traces into a graph line representation. In , the illustration  comprises three individual traces , , and . The initial graph line is empty, for example, so after trace  is merged it becomes the initial representation of the graph line , at  of .","After a graph line has been generated, as in , , a second trace can be run through the merging loop at , where a first trace node is selected. At , it can be determined whether the trace node should be merged with a graph-line node that is already part of the graph line. Intuitively, a trace node should be merged with a graph-line node when the two nodes are from a same roadway segment, for example. In this embodiment, to determine whether the nodes are from the same roadway segment, at , a distance between the trace node and an edge in the graph line is determined to meet a desired node-edge distance threshold value.","For example, if an edge is present in the graph line (e.g., the graph line for the comparative trace segment is not empty), the distance between the trace node and a closest edge can be measured and compared to the threshold. In one embodiment, the threshold can be a value generated from the closed equation testing described above, that yields desired merging results. If the distance does not meet the threshold, the nodes are not merged. However, at , if the distance meets the threshold, a difference in directionality of the trace node and the edge can be identified and determined whether it meets a desired directionality threshold.","As described above, a directionality for the node and the graph-line edge can be determined. Further, a difference between the two directionalities can be determined (e.g., using a cosine calculation as described above). The difference value can be compared against a desired directionality threshold to determine, such as determined by testing. If the directionality difference meets the threshold, at , it can be determined whether the trace node is closer to a first graph-line node than a second graph-line node, that comprise the ends of the graph-line edge.","For example, where gand gare two graph-line nodes and e is the edge between gand g, it can be determined whether the trace node is closer to gthan to g. At , if the trace node is closer to the first graph-line node, the trace node can be merged into the first graph-line node, in the graph. Further, at , an edge can be added between the merged node and the second graph-line node, if one is present.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9C","b":["940","922","904","900","922","940","904","900","922","940","904","900","922","940"]},"However, in , if any of the determinations for node merging , , , return in the negative, the trace node and the graph-line node are not merged, at . At , the trace node is added to the graph line, for example, , at  and , illustrate nodes that are added to the graph line, and not merged with existing graph-line nodes, such as  and . In these examples, the trace nodes may not be added because they do not meet a distance to the edge threshold, such as those in . Further, in this example, the trace nodes may not be added because they do not meet a directionality threshold, such as those in .","At , when a trace node is added to the graph line, such as  in , an edge is added between the added trace node and the second graph-line node, if the second graph-line node is present. In this way, for example, a new route can be developed for the graph line, as shown in , at  and . After the edge is added between the nodes, a next node for the trace is retrieved, at .","In one embodiment, by merging a trace node n to a graph-line node g, no new nodes are created for the graph line. However, it may be desirable to record connectivity information for the trace in the graph line. In this embodiment, a variable that indicates a previous node (prevNode) can be utilized by an algorithm that performs graph-line merging. This variable can be the graph-line node gthat the previous trace node n maps to. To record connectivity information, the graph-line node gshould be reachable from prevNode in a desired number of hops (e.g., hops between nodes). In this embodiment, if the graph line does not reflect this information, we can add a new edge from prevNode to gin the graph.","In one aspect, there may be random outlier traces that result from errors, such as GPS signal errors, driving errors, or other potential recording errors. These trace segments typically will map to graph edges that have a small trace volume (e.g., one trace forms the graph-line). Further, road segments that are traveled merely a few times will also typically be mapped to graph edges having a small trace volume (e.g., one to three traces form the graph-line). In this aspect, for example, these graph-line segments may be considered \u201cunreliable\u201d when they have a low trace volume forming the graph line. In one embodiment merging related traces into a graph line can comprise removing edges from the graph line that have a number of traces that meets a desired trace volume threshold. In this embodiment, for example, the desired trace volume threshold may be three traces, which typically provides a more reliable graph-line.","A system may be devised that can generate a graph line, which may be used to designate vehicular travel routing, such as for mapping purposes.  is a component block diagram of an exemplary system  for generating graph-line maps of vehicular routes. The exemplary system comprises a data storage component  that is configured to store a plurality of positioning data that mark traces of vehicular travel. In one embodiment, the positioning data can be GPS tracking points retrieved from vehicles and stored on the data storage component .","The data storage component  is operably coupled to a clarification component , which is configured to adjust a location of a trace using adjustment forces related to the trace. In one embodiment, positioning data points stored on the data storage component  can be nodes of a trace that trace a path of vehicular travel. The clarification component  can be used to clarify a position of respective traces, for example, to account for potential errors and\/or a plurality of traces occupying a similar location. Further, for example, the clarification component  can be used separate traces that represent vehicles traveling in different directions, such as in opposite directions on a highway.","The exemplary system  further comprises a graph line producing component configured to merge related traces into a graph line. For example, where a plurality of traces comprise a related area of a roadway, the traces can be merged to form a graph line that represents that roadway. Further, segments of traces that run in a direction along one side of a highway can be merged into a graph line, and segments of traces that run in another direction along another side of the highway can be merged into another graph line.","In one embodiment, the system can comprise a direction determiner component , which can be configured to identify directionality for segments of a trace and related nodes using time-related data from the nodes of the trace. For example, positioning data  stored in the data storage component  can comprise GPS data points collected from vehicles traveling along a roadway. GPS data points can comprise time stamps that identify when the GPS point was collected, which can identify a direction the vehicle traveled. In one embodiment, the time related data can identify the direction of the traces that is comprised of the time stamped nodes.","In one embodiment, the clarification component  comprises an attraction force adjustment component  that is configured to shift the location of the trace until a net force for the trace is balanced. In this embodiment, an attraction location adjuster  is configured to determine a first attraction force that shifts the location of the trace to an attraction location, and an original location adjuster  is configured to determine a second attraction force that shifts the location of the trace, which is shifted by the attraction location adjuster's  determination, to its original position. As an example, the node can be incrementally shifted toward a trace and the attraction force adjustment component  can determine whether the newly shifted location has a balanced net force (e.g., between forces from the attraction location adjuster  an original location adjuster ).","In another embodiment, the clarification component  can comprise a repelling force adjustment component  that is configured to shift a first trace away from a second trace, where the second trace has different directionality than that of the first trace. As described above, for example, where traces that are in a same general location but come from vehicles traveling in opposite directions, the repelling force adjustment component  can separate the traces.","In another embodiment, the graph line producing component  comprises a trace node merging component , which can be configured to determine whether a trace node should be merged with a first graph-line node. Further, in this embodiment, a merged node edge creation component  is configured to create an edge between the merged first graph-line node and a second graph-line node, if the second graph-line node is present and an edge between the nodes is not present, when the trace node is merged with a first graph-line node. Additionally, a non-merged node edge creation component can be configured to add the trace node to the graph line, and create an edge between the added trace node and the second graph-line node if the second graph-line node is present.","Further, in one embodiment, the trace node merging component  comprises a distance determination component  configured to determine if a distance between the trace node and an edge between the first graph-line node and the second graph-line node meets a desired threshold. A direction difference determination component  can be configured to determine if a difference in directionality of the trace node and the edge meets a desired threshold, and a proximity determination component  can be configured to determine if the trace node is closer to the first graph-line node than the second graph-line node.","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data .
