{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODES OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention concerns forfaiting transactions. In particular it concerns methods of operating a computerised forfaiting exchange to develop forfaiting transactions. In another aspect it concerns a computerised forfaiting exchange.","Forfaiting transactions are complex and not well understood, they are easily confused with other, similar, transactions. The knowledge of how to conduct these transactions is held by few individuals within a small number of financial institutions, and as a result it is not widely available.","Forfaiting specifically addresses cross boarder trade and was designed to facilitate the export of goods to emerging markets and OECD markets. It involves an exporter that wishes to ship goods and an importer that wishes to receive them. The exporter agrees to deferred payment terms, and the importer arranges a deferred payment (aka \u2018usance\u2019 in Asia) letter of credit with a local issuing bank. The letter of credit will expire unless the goods are delivered by its expiry date. If the goods are delivered the letter of credit may be cashed at its maturity date. The local issuing bank seeks payment from the importer.","After delivery, provided the shipping documents are accepted as in compliance with the terms of the letter of credit, and the obligation to pay is accepted or issued by the L\/C issuing \u2018opening\u2019 bank, then the exporter has a negotiable instrument that is a trade receivable in the form of a draft, promissory note or other form of documenting a payment obligation which can be held by the exporter until maturity or can be discounted prior to maturity.","An exporter that seeks payment prior to the maturity of the obligation, may sell the obligation say, to a bank or other purchaser or investor, for its net present value. The sale is \u2018without recourse\u2019 which means that the new owner does not look to the exporter or any subsequent holder or seller for payment in the case of default, but rather to the L\/C issuing \u2018opening\u2019 bank as obligor or guarantor, and to the primary purchaser as the party is responsible for having done enough due diligence to ascertain if the obligation is or is not fraudulent. Since the beneficiary of the letter of credit is the exporter, the ownership of the payment obligation must be transferred properly. This usually includes the execution of an acceptance or acknowledgment of the assignment of the underlying obligation by the LIC issuing \u2018opening\u2019 bank or other form of obligor (usually the initial guarantor), the exporter and the new purchaser\/holder\/owner. The new purchaser\/holder\/owner can subsequently sell the instrument again, and this may create for them an opportunity to generate profit often via an arbitrage based on geographic or other market differences in perspective.","The negotiable instrument is the draft or other form documenting the payment obligation and supported by the L\/C or original guarantee\u2014not the L\/C itself.","The exporter may put the entire export transaction in the hands of its bank and merely receive an agreed payment upon shipment or delivery of the goods, as called for in the L\/C or terms of sale contract. A negotiable instrument arises as a result of the export\/import transaction (but only after the goods have been delivered, the documents have been accepted by the L\/C issuing bank as incompliance with the terms of L\/C, and the acceptance or issuance of the pay obligation by the L\/C issuing bank) in the hands of the exporter (unless otherwise specified by the terms of L\/C), and is usually held by the exporter's negotiating bank, in compliance with the terms of the L\/C or other form of guarantee, issuance or acceptance by the obligor (guarantor) and under authorization by the exporter (unless nominated otherwise in the L\/C), and is sold \u2018without recourse\u2019 to the exporter. Care has to be taken to execute the appropriate documents to ensure the exporter and, as the case may be, exporter's bank have a viable negotiating instrument and a viable transfer of ownership of this receivable (obligation). The subsequent forfaiting transactions do not involve the exporter and generally may be carried on without the exporter having any knowledge of them.","This process has a number of benefits for both exporters and importers. For the exporter, it can grant credit (deferred payment terms) to foreign buyers without tying up cash flow or assuming all the risks of possible late payment or default. The exporter may also in this way protect against interest and currency rate movements during the credit period.","The importer deals only with its local bank. That bank is best positioned of any to assess the importer's credit risk and extract payment.","A \u2018forfaiting transaction\u2019 is defined, in this patent, to mean the transfer of ownership of a payment obligation (asset) in which the buyer forgoes any right of recourse to the exporter and subsequent holder or seller in the event that the obligor is unable to meet the payments required by the obligation (except in the case of fraud), where the payment obligation arises directly from a bank guarantee in any form given in the course of an export transaction and thereby resulting in a cross border trade receivable.","Of course, fraud may negate the subsequent transactions.","An example of a forfaiting transaction is as follows:","A letter of credit USD 1,000,000 is purchased at an interest rate of 8% p.a. for the deferred payment period of 360 days and that interest is discounted from the face at the time of purchase at a straight discount. The purchaser (possibly a forfaiter) pays USD 920,000 for the debt obligation and later sells it at 7% p.a. interest for duration of the deferred payment period, receiving USD 930,000. The intention of this transaction is to maximize the use of funds and generate revenue. USD 1,000,000 turned 40 times in a period of one year, assuming the same margins, could generate USD 400,000 in revenue. A counter party engaging in a forfaiting operation views this as a better value proposition rather than utilizing its capital to book assets on its balance sheet. If one were to assume the cost of funds of a traditional lender at 3% p.a. and the interest charged 8% p.a, this same transaction would generate USD 50,000 in revenue.","It is appreciated that forfaiting transactions can take place in connection with other credit enhancement products and or instruments as well as obligations supported by letters of credit. For instance, bills of exchange, drafts drawn under deferred payment (usance) letters of credit, Deferred payment claims with other forms of financial guarantees, drafts or promissory notes that are avalized, drafts and promissory notes with international \u2018creditability\u2019 that are naked, and any of these sometimes together with another form of credit enhancement\u2014that is of course provided the payment obligation results directly from an export transaction.","The invention is a method of operating a computerised forfaiting exchange to develop forfaiting transactions (as defined) for settlement, comprising the following steps:","Providing a web site accessible via the Internet to sellers and buyers using computers.","Providing a counter party selection document on request to a seller or buyer to view at the web site, where the document contains a list of classes of counter parties together with counter party selection entry facilities.","Permitting a seller to identify classes of buyers with whom they will, or will not, develop a forfaiting transaction, by entering selections on the counter party selection document using the counter party selection entry facilities.","Providing an offer document on request to a seller to view at the web site, where the offer document contains the following items:\n\n","Permitting the seller to create an instance of the offer document, by:\n\n","Permitting the seller to submit an instance of the offer document, so that it becomes available to view by potential buyers from only the classes of buyers identified as being those whom the seller will develop the transaction.","Providing a counter offer document on request to a buyer after they have viewed an offer document, where the counter offer document contains counter offer selection and counter offer information entry facilities for entry of variations to an offer document instance;","Permitting the buyer to create an instance of the counter offer document by entering selections and information using the counter offer selection and information entry facilities, and to submit the counter offer instance, so that it becomes available to the seller;","Providing a counter offer document on request to any party after they have viewed an instance of a counter offer document, where the counter offer document contains counter offer selection and information entry facilities for entry of variations;","Permitting the party to create an instance of the counter offer document by entering selections and information using the counter offer selection and information entry facilities, and to submit the counter offer instance, so that it becomes available to the counter party;","Repeating the last two steps.","Use of the exchange enables the transactions to become accessible and reliable. The independent nature of the exchange creates a trusted medium for developing the transactions for settlement. The exchange provides a step by step process by which the transactions are developed. It may require all the necessary documents to be completed before the next step can be taken, and it may guide the process to the extent of identifying mistakes and even offering corrections. The transaction may continue until all terms are matched. Settlement may then take place at the exchange or by any other suitable means. Where a complete match is not achieved, settlement may still be achieved, say by further off-line negotiation.","The document available at the web site may contain electronic links to independent sources of financial information, this enables the parties to conveniently check financial information such as rates and the standing of the obligor without having to exit the exchange.","Links may also be provided to standardized forms of documents, such as asset defining documents used to support instances of the offer document. This enables the parties to check whether any document offered complies with the standard, and to determine any differences. The differences may be automatically flagged. It also gives the party the option of using the standard documentation, which may ease the subsequent transaction.","Similarly, there may be links to standardized forms of undertaking documents. This access to standard forms and documents provides the user with a reliable way of understanding and testing the transactions.","The exchange may also provide on-line assistance in completing the process, as well as access to expertise and other sources of advice.","The exchange could operate to make forfaiting transactions available to local banks, reducing its cost and increasing the volume of forfaiting transactions.","An asset screening document may also be provided for use by potential buyers to select the types of asset they wish to view, and not view. In this way a potential buyer will only see assets that a seller wants to sell to buyers of their class, and which are of the selected types. This renders the initiation of transactions more efficient.","In a second aspect, the invention is a computerised forfaiting exchange, comprising:","A web site accessible via the Internet to sellers and buyers using computers.","A database associated with the web site and storing:","a counter party selection document, where the document contains a list of classes of counter parties together with counter party selection entry facilities;","an offer document, where the offer document contains the following items:\n\n","a counter offer document containing counter offer selection and information entry facilities.","A processor associated with the web site and the database and operable to retrieve a document from the database to view at the web site.","The processor being further operable on request either to permit the entry of selections and information to create instances of documents on-line.","The processor being further operable to permit viewing of instances of offer documents by potential buyers, depending upon the selections and entries made by the seller in counter party selection document.","Alternatively the processor being operable on request to print an offer document for use off-line.","In a third aspect, the invention is another method of operating a computerised forfaiting exchange to facilitate a forfaiting transaction, comprising the steps of:","Providing an offer document on request to a seller to view at the web site, where the offer document contains the following items:\n\n","Permitting the seller to download the offer document.","Referring first to  the computerised forfaiting exchange comprises a web site having site map  illustrated in . This site map is accessible by both bankers and other investors, and provides gateways into a primary platform  and a secondary platform .","The primary platform is designed to facilitate the development of transactions: the sale of receivables held by the exporter  to a third party purchaser  that is not the exporters negotiating bank . The transaction is between and exporter , a third party purchaser , and the negotiating bank ; as illustrated in .","All of the following precedes the \u2018forfaiting\u2019 transaction (the sale\/transfer of ownership of the receivable\/payment obligation without recourse to the exporter\/the beneficiary):","The exporter  has signed a sale\/purchase agreement with the importer  for goods to be imported.","The importer's bank  opens the deferred payment letter of credit in favour of the exporter . The letter of credit is sent to the exporter's advising bank . The advising bank  advises the exporter that the letter of credit has been opened.","The exporter then delivers the goods to the importer and presents all the necessary shipping documents for draw down of the letter of credit to its negotiating bank , which in turn forwards them to the importer's bank  for acceptance (unless otherwise instruct under the terms of the L\/C).","The (importer's) L\/C issuing \u2018opening\u2019 bank  accepts the shipping documents as in compliance with the terms of the letter of credit and the negotiating bank  draws (sends) a draft(s)\/bill(s) of exchange on (to) the importer's bank . In this transaction example, the exporter is the beneficiary of the draft(s). Upon the (importer's) L\/C issuing bank's  acceptance of the draft(s) a negotiable instrument is born. This occurs in one of two alternative executions: 1) the hard copy of the draft on which the exporter is the beneficiary is accepted by the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 (issuing) bank and for good practice is sent back to the exporter's negotiating bank which is legally authorized by the exporter to receive it on its behalf. The payment obligation (asset) has thereby been created; 2) the L\/C opening bank sends a tested telex or SWIFT message, in lieu of original draft(s)\/bill(s) of exchange, to the negotiating bank stating that the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 (issuing) bank accepts the draft(s) (bill(s) of exchange). If In accordance with best practice this telex fully states the payment obligation undertaken in the hard copy of draft(s) or bill(s) of exchange and thereby confirms the amount(s) due on day\/month\/year date(s), that the bank will under no circumstances release the bill(s) of exchange to any other party, person or institution other than exporter and\/or its assignee(s) and undertakes to pay upon presentation in effective currency at maturity the referenced amount(s), without any deductions whatsoever, to the exporter and\/or its assignee(s). The negotiating bank  informs the exporter that it (the exporter) has received the bona fide claim-payment obligation. It is at this point that in this example the forfaiting transaction (the sale\/transfer of ownership of the receivable\/payment obligation without recourse to the exporter\/the beneficiary) commences its execution via the website. Although the bank would have most likely consulted the software and platform for documentation forms and assistance in preparing the underlying documents to be authorized and or signed by the exporter prior to this point in time and in preparation for this point in time. The bank informs the exporter that it has a bona fide claim, transmitting all the details of that claim\/payment obligation, asks if the exporter would like to authorize the bank to initiate a sale of the receivable (transfer of the payment obligation) on Global Trade Finance Network's primary platform and if so at what price or price range, terms and provide a forfaiting contract between the bank and the exporter online for their signature and includes all the forms and authorizations necessary for the bank to execute such a transaction on behalf of the exporter. This can be executed using the software down loaded in hard copy, or online for an offline close or a completely digital execution.","The exporter then appoints its negotiating bank  to negotiate the sale of the asset and the negotiating bank goes out to find a third party purchaser  via the website.","In this example the exporter without recourse to itself endorses the draft to a third party purchaser , assigns the rights under the deferred payment letter of credit and commercial invoice(s) to a third party purchaser, notifies the negotiating bank and the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank of its assignment. There is an option to complete these documents in blank (without the name of the third party purchaser) to be held in trust and under specific instructions (or not) by the exporter's negotiating bank.","The negotiating bank is now in a position to seek a third party purchaser and seeks to find a match for the terms and documents which may be negotiated or not via the website distribution\/exchange system.","In the event the terms of the transaction are all agreed between the negotiating bank as agent for the exporter, the exporter and the buyer. The negotiating bank , acting as agent on behalf of the exporter acknowledges to the third party purchaser that they have been informed of the assignment. The third party purchaser reserves the right to request the negotiating bank to notify the importer's L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank  of the assignment of the claim. In this case the negotiating bank does this. The importer's L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank  then acknowledges their acceptance of the assignment and their obligation to pay irrevocably and directly to the third party purchaser  or according to their instructions. Generic documents acknowledging the sale\/transfer of ownership and obligation(s) to pay are executed online or viewed online and executed offline and then the counter parties will have the choice to close offline or online via a digital execution of the same. The counter parties will be able to choose 1) digital or non digital escrow services, warehouse services or neither, and 2) offline hard copy close or online digital closing. In this transaction example the offline option has been chosen prior to commencing the transaction, all the hard copy original and conformed copy documents are forwarded to the buyer, an escrow agent or warehouse facility for hard copy review and acceptance.","Settlement then takes place between the exporter  and the third party purchaser  via the negotiating bank . Upon presentation, verification and acceptance of all the documents, the third party purchaser  wires the funds to the negotiating bank  for the account of the exporter.","Upon maturity of the deferred payment letter of credit, the third party purchaser  (provided it has held the receivable until maturity) receives the payment directly from the importer's bank  or wired via the negotiating bank depending on the agreed upon terms. Of course if the third party purchaser(s) subsequently sell(s) the asset, payment is made to the current holder\/owner of the asset provided a bona fide transfer has been executed and or the L\/C issuing bank accepts the transfer as such.","The primary platform  of the forfaiting exchange  facilitates this transaction by providing a number of online, interactive, multi-lingual \u2018smart\u2019 documents and \u2018smart\u2019 guided processes for completing and submitting the documents either in hard copy or digitally for a hard copy or digital close. The primary platform also aggregates and provides access to information and links, such as financial information feeds like Reuters and the latest LIBOR rates. There is also access to risk management information, local, regional and international trade finance news feeds, speciality bulletin board, ratings, Uniform Code of Practice (UCP 500), indicative rates and any software solutions tools. These live links provide up to the minute global information, guided and selective searches, and improved risk and risk management. Multilingual administrative expertise (vocal and digital) is provided on specific transactions on a \u2018pay per use\u2019 facility (packages of time can also be purchased in advance). Administrative expertise is provided on generic documents free of charge. Information is also provided about procedures for primary and secondary financing and underlying transaction structures. All of this multilingual expertise & support critical to the transaction process and distribution is provided twenty four hours online or via telephone. At the outset of the aforementioned transaction the bank  informs the exporter that they have a bona fide claim.","In this case the advising and negotiating bank is the Singapore Bank Limited and it

The buyers can also choose to negotiate by returning counter offer documents, . When full agreement is reached, payment terms are agreed and accepted by both parties, .","Alternatively, if full agreement is not reached in through this match negotiate format and process the parties may enter the negotiating room  in order to negotiate. This might happen for instance, where there is a subject requiring negotiation that does not fit the structure described above. The negotiation continues to use the alphanumeric identifiers to maintain anonymity.","It should be appreciated that both the exporter  and the buyer  take part in the process anonymously until sufficient or all terms have been agreed for them to settle the negotiation. It should also be appreciated that the information they provide to each other is controlled by the offering institution excluding obligatory fields. Guidance is given and documents proposed via the online documents. At many places during the negotiations the forms provide links to obtain latest news and credit information as well as credit enhancement and software support tools that assist in developing the transaction.","The secondary trading platform  is provided for a slightly different transaction, that is the sale by the first (primary) purchaser of the exporter's receivable to a second purchaser . Subsequent sales require minor variation of the following. Nevertheless it enable the primary purchaser to revisit, amend and or enhance its underlying documentation with the exporter in order to utilize best practice documentation and procedures. Alternatively standard documentation and procedure can be engaged from the outset by the bank to execute the purchase form the exporter.","All of the following precede this second (secondary) \u2018forfaiting\u2019 transaction (the sale\/transfer of ownership of the receivable\/payment obligation without recourse to the exporter\/the beneficiary and subsequent holders (owners).","The exporter  has signed a sale\/purchase agreement with the importer  for goods to be imported. The importer's L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank  opens the deferred payment letter of credit in favour of the exporter . The letter of credit is sent to the exporter's advising bank . The advising bank  advises the exporter that the letter of credit has been opened. The exporter then delivers the goods to the importer and presents all the necessary shipping documents for draw down of the letter of credit to its negotiating bank , which in turn forwards them to the importer's L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank for acceptance.","The (importer's) L\/C issuing \u2018opening\u2019 bank  accepts the shipping documents as in compliance with the terms of the letter of credit and the negotiating bank  forwards on behalf of the exporter the draft(s)\/bill(s) of exchange that the exporter has drawn to the importer's bank . In this transaction example, the exporter is the beneficiary of the draft(s). Upon the (importer's) L\/C issuing bank's  acceptance of the draft(s) a negotiable instrument is born. This occurs in one of two alternative executions: 1) the hard copy of the draft on which the exporter is the beneficiary is accepted by the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 (issuing) bank is sent back to the exporter's negotiating bank which is legally authorized by the exporter to receive it on its behalf, the payment obligation (asset) has thereby been created; 2) the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank sends a tested telex or SWIFT message, in lieu of original draft(s)\/bill(s) of exchange, to the negotiating bank stating that the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 (issuing) bank has accepted the draft(s) (bill(s) of exchange). In accordance with best practice this draft(s) or bill(s) of exchange fully states the payment obligation undertaken by the hard copy draft and thereby confirms the amount(s) due on day\/month\/year date(s), that the bank will under no circumstances release the bill(s) of exchange to any other party, person or institution other than exporter and\/or its assignee(s) and undertakes to pay upon presentation in effective currency at maturity the referenced amount(s), without any deductions whatsoever, to the exporter and\/or its assignee(s).","The negotiating bank  informs the exporter that it, the exporter, has received the bona fide claim-payment obligation.","In this example the forfaiting transaction (the sale\/transfer of ownership of the receivable\/payment obligation without recourse to the exporter\/the beneficiary) is executed between the exporter and its negotiating bank which is also the first (primary) purchaser. This may be executed with the website or not. The negotiating bank also first purchaser (primary purchaser) informs the exporter that it has a bona fide claim.","Since the beneficiary of the letter of credit is the exporter, the ownership of the payment obligation must be transferred properly to the first (primary) purchaser that in this example is also the negotiating bank, and this transfer usually includes the execution of an acceptance of the assignment of the underlying obligation by the L\/C issuing \u2018opening\u2019 bank or other form(s) of obligation (usually the initial guarantor), the exporter and the new purchaser\/holder\/owner. And an acknowledgment of the assignment of the underlying obligation to the new purchaser\/holder\/owner by the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank and negotiating banks.","In this example transaction, the exporter has already agreed to sell this payment obligation to its negotiating bank which becomes the first purchaser (aka primary purchaser). The draft has been endorsed \u2018without recourse\u2019 to the exporter and the exporter assigns its rights under the letter of credit to the first purchaser (in this example the first purchaser, advising and negotiating bank are the same). Upon the completion of all the required assignments, acknowledgments, and draft(s) endorsement(s). The first purchaser (formerly the negotiating bank) pays the exporter the discounted proceeds.","The negotiating bank, now the first purchaser has thereby purchased the payment obligation and takes assignment of the rights under the letter of credit and commercial invoice. The bank may hold the asset or decide to sell it onward immediately. In any case, in this transaction example which commences at this point between the first purchase and second sale transactions, the first purchaser, formerly the negotiating bank seeks a second purchaser or secondary purchaser. The information requested on the transaction is managed in three -sections: 1) Documentation on the underlying export import transaction, 2) Documentation obtained by the first purchaser on the transfer of ownership from the exporter to the first purchaser, 3) Documentation the second seller is able and\/or willing to provide to the second purchaser. When a secondary purchaser is found and the terms confirmed, the first purchaser \u2018without recourse\u2019 to itself endorses the draft to the second purchaser. The first purchaser assigns all the rights it has obtained from the exporter's assignment under the letter of credit to the second purchaser  and obtains and issues all the required acknowledgments.","The second purchaser  wires funds to the first purchaser  (formerly the negotiating bank).","Upon maturity of the deferred payment letter of credit, provided the second purchaser holds the asset until such time, the second purchaser presents the draft to the L\/C issuing (opening) bank  for payment and receives payment directly from the L\/C \u2018opening\u2019 bank unless payment has been routed otherwise as per items ()(b) and (c) below.","The platform software guides the first (primary) purchaser (formerly the negotiating bank) through the proper orderly preparation of conformed copies of the documents representing the underlying trade transaction, the transfer of ownership from the exporter to the first purchaser using good practice process and procedures, and the onward sale of the asset to a second purchaser, and provides guidance and process for all the endorsement(s) and assignment(s) made by the exporter to the first purchaser and acknowledgment(s) by and other documents from the negotiating bank and others (as the case may call for). The platform (software) provides the same for the sale from the first purchaser to the second purchaser.","On the secondary platform the seller must be a holder\/owner of the asset and not the original beneficiary (the exporter) which is why it is called the secondary platform. The first purchaser\/holder (and second seller) is usually but not necessarily a commercial bank such as the exporter's negotiating bank, or a third party bank, forfaiting company or finance company.","A sale(s)\/purchase(s) \u2018matched\u2019 on the secondary platform can be executed with (sold to) banks, non-bank financial institutions, non-financial institutions and packagers.","On the secondary platform the selling institution will select counter parties by filling in the following form. The buyer fills in a corresponding form to select the sellers from whom it is willing to buy (and\/or those from whom it is not willing to buy). This is optionally executed at two levels first for overall, policy level broad criteria and second for the specific asset(s) to be sold.","Counterparty Selection General","Secondary: SELL: Counterparty Selection General: Seller's Worksheet","Disclaimer: The names and identities of counterparties and transactions utilized in the sample transaction are in no way similar to or representative of actual transactions or counterparties and are for demonstration purposes",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0190"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"CHOICES MENU of Broad Criteria"},{"entry":"Select Buyers that will view offers.
