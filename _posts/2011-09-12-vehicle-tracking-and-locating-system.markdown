{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority from provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/409,623, filed on Nov. 3, 2010, entitled Vehicle Tracking and Locating System, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to systems for identifying motor vehicles, and in particular, relates to systems for providing information about stolen vehicles and vehicles subject to repossession.","2. Background","Vehicles may be repossessed when a borrower is delinquent in payment of a loan or other contractual agreement. In a common scenario, if the borrower cannot timely service the loan and is delinquent in payments, the creditor may seek to repossess the vehicle, either directly or more commonly, through an affiliated repossession company.","The borrower may willingly relinquish possession of the vehicle to the repossession company. In such circumstances, the repossession company may take possession of the vehicle at the debtor's residence. In other situations, the debtor may not willingly relinquish possession of the vehicle, and may hide the vehicle or otherwise maintain the vehicle at an undisclosed location away from his or her place of residence. This renders it difficult for the repossession company to locate the vehicle.","Further, when a vehicle to be repossessed cannot be easily located, agents, \u201cskip-tracers,\u201d and \u201cspotters\u201d associated with the repossession company may randomly view the license plates of vehicles in areas known to be frequented by the debtor, often based on the description of the vehicle. The repossession company may employ such skip-tracers and spotters, or may have contractual arrangements with the skip-tracers and spotters in other jurisdictions or with other repossession companies.","However this is very expensive, inefficient and time-consuming because the agent, spotter, or skip-tracer may have a set of documents for each vehicle to be repossessed, and must cross-reference the documents in his possession with each suspect license plate that he or she views while driving or while a passenger in a spotter vehicle.","A vehicle tracking and locating system provides information to a user about a vehicle of interest. The system includes a database controller in operative communication with a database, and configured to receive data corresponding to vehicles from a plurality of client sources, and configured to save the data as information records corresponding to each client source. A plurality of external communication devices transmit a data request by the user corresponding to the vehicle of interest. A request server receives the data request in one of a variety of communication formats. An input request processor operatively coupled to the request server is configured to obtain information records from the database corresponding to the data request. An output processor operatively coupled to the request server provides the data of interest from the obtained information records for transmission to the respective communication device to satisfy the user request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The vehicle tracking and locating system  includes a database controller  in operative communication with a master database , a request server  configured to receive a data request from a user or agent, an input request processor  operatively coupled to the request server , and an output processor  operatively coupled to the request server  and configured to provide data of interest from information records  stored in the master database .","A recognition module , may be operatively coupled to the request server  and to the database controller , and may further include a license plate recognition system (LPRS)  or ALPR system (automatic license plate recognition), an optical character recognition system , and a dimensional recognition system A.","Users may communicate with the request server  using a variety of remote or external communication devices  to transmit a data request to the request server  regarding a particular vehicle of interest. The external communication devices  may be wireless devices and\/or wired devices, such as cellular telephones , smart phones , computers , mobile devices , tablets , a GPS navigation device , or any suitable communication device . The user may transmit a data request by inputting: a vehicle identification number (VIN), a license plate number, a photographic image of a license plate or the vehicle itself, or a video containing images of the vehicle and its associated license plate, as captured by the communication device  or by a digital camera .","Referring to , when the request server  receives the request from the user, the request may be in a variety of different formats using different communication protocols depending upon the type of external communication device  that is used and the communication mode in which it is operating. The dataflow may include varied protocols and message formats handled by hardware or software modules or components, such as a short message service (SMS) module , a text message module , an email message module , a multimedia message service (MMS) module , a voicemail (VM) module , a video module , or a streaming video module , for example. Any suitable component or module may be used to decode, format, and process the message received. The SMS module  may be a SMS server dedicated to receiving and processing SMS communication, while the MMS module  may be an MMS server dedicated to receiving and processing MMS communication.","Each of the requests or messages from the user is preferably decoded and handled by the input message component or handler directed toward that particular protocol or message format. Further, a voice recognition system  may be coupled to the voicemail module  to convert the voice message into a text message so that the text message can be provided to the request server . The request server  may include an authentication component  configured to verify and authenticate that the requesting user is authorized to access the vehicle tracking and locating system . A real-time log  may also be generated and maintained by the request server .","Such input message modules (, , , , ) or handlers, whether hardware, software, a combination of hardware or software, may be resident within the request server  or within another component of the vehicle tracking and locating system , or may be separate and independent from the vehicle tracking and locating system .","Alternatively, some input message components or handlers, services, and functions may be provided by a third-party or third-party component. The short message service (SMS) service module  may be provided by or replaced by an independent third-party SMS messaging service , and may be external to the vehicle tracking and locating system . The third-party SMS messaging service  may be provided by an entity referred to as \u201cTextMeForBusiness.com.\u201d Such third-party SMS providers  essentially host the SMS transactions and provide the necessary infrastructure to manage and service the SMS transactions, such as text to screen formatting, auto-response, message formatting, and other features. Such third party providers receive the data request from the external communication devices , and decode, extract, format, and forward the user message to the request server .","Similarly, a third party MMS (multi-media service) provider  may replace the multi-media messaging service module  in the request server , and may be external to the vehicle tracking and locating system . Such third-party MMS providers  essentially host the MMS transactions and provide the necessary infrastructure to manage and service the MMS transactions, such as text to screen formatting, auto-response, message formatting, and other features. Such third party providers receive the data request from the external communication devices , and decode, extract, format, and forward the user message to the request server . As referred to herein, the SMS service module  may be used interchangeably with the SMS third party provider service  because the end result is essentially similar, that is, the message is received and processed. Similarly, the MMS service module  may be used interchangeably with the MMS third party provider service .","As an overview regarding the user process for accessing the vehicle tracking and locating system , the following example involves use of the SMS format, but is applicable to any embodiment utilizing a different message format. In this example, the user may type a plurality of digits, such as a multi-digit access code, into the external communication device , such as a cellular telephone , smart phone , or any other communication device, which directs the call to the short message services (SMS) module  or to the SMS third party provider , for example. In response, the SMS module  or the SMS third party service provider  requests that the user provide a query, assuming that the user is authorized to access the system.","The user or agent may respond by entering \u201cplate=333ABCD.\u201d This informs the vehicle tracking and locating system  that the user is inquiring about a license plate number. Alternatively, the user may respond by entering the VIN number. Further, the user may respond by attaching a photographic image, a video stream, or any attachment containing the license plate number for which further information is desired, as will be discussed in greater detail below.","The SMS third party service provider  decodes and formats the request to the request server , which in turn, obtains the requested information from the master database  via a database lookup. If the requested license plate number is found in the database, information about the corresponding vehicle is provided to the user via the SMS third party service provider . Such information includes, for example, data about a possible repossession action or stolen vehicle action, the registered owner of the vehicle, name of debtor or lien-holder, lien status, vehicle insurance status, vehicle year, vehicle make, vehicle model, vehicle color, VIN number, associated finance company, date that vehicle entered a repossession list or a stolen vehicle list, case number, location status (address and\/or GPS coordinates), law enforcement status (stolen, owner APB, predator in a restricted area, etc.), and the like. Also, when a match is found, the system may transmit an electronic copy of the documents corresponding to the vehicle of interest.","Referring to , one embodiment of the database controller  is illustrated. The database controller  includes a client data processor , a search engine , and a video and image input processor  operatively coupled to the master database . The client data processor  may receive input from a client data feed system , while the video and image input processor  may receive input from a video\/image feed system , the license plate recognition system , and an optical character recognition system .","The master database  may be updated based on input from the client data feed system , which includes multiple \u201cclients\u201d . Such clients  may represent the various credit companies, banking entities, finance credit companies, vehicle credit agencies, and law enforcement agencies, which may have agreements in place with owner of the vehicle tracking and locating system . Such clients  or third-party entities provide data to the master database  through the database controller  based on vehicles that are subject to repossession for nonpayment of loans with respect to banking and credit agencies, while law enforcement may provide additional data with respect to stolen vehicles. Alternatively, the database controller  may access remote databases through an external database request interface or communication link . The database controller may request information from external databases, such as municipal vehicle databases  and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database , which maintains a record of all vehicles reported stolen in the United States, and other municipal, state, and Federal databases.","The client data feed system  facilitates data transfer from the clients , including documents and messages. The data may be in the form of CSV files (comma separated value), PDF documents, or may be any suitable data format. The database controller  may create, update, and\/or delete information records in the master database  based on the information received from the clients . The documents and data may be transmitted using standard file transfer protocol, such as FTP, for example.","In one specific embodiment, the master database  may be segmented or divided into separate logical data areas corresponding to the specific client source. For example, a first client may be TRW Credit Corp., while a second client may be GE Credit Corp. The master database  may be segmented for security and privacy considerations because if a vehicle is subject to repossession with respect to a first client, only repossession agencies authorized by that first client are permitted to access the corresponding information and engage in action related to the repossession of the subject vehicle.","In some embodiments, a user may be denied information about a vehicle subject to repossession if that user is not authorized by the client . Thus, in one embodiment, such a user may not even be informed by the vehicle tracking and locating system  that a requested vehicle license plates corresponds to a vehicle subject repossession if that user is not authorized by the client to receive such information. Accordingly, even if a particular vehicle is subject to a repossession order, if the user inquiring about that that license plate number is not a member of one of the repossession companies authorized to handle repossession of that car, that user may not receive an affirmative indication that the vehicle is subject to repossession. Alternatively, the user may be given an indication that the vehicle is subject to repossession but that the requesting user is not authorized to go forward with the associated repossession.","In other embodiments, rather than logically or physically segmenting the master database , the information records  may instead be tagged or associated with the corresponding client . The search engine  may inspect the associated client identifier and provide requested information only if there is a match between the information record associated with the client  and the authorization status of the user requesting the information.","The database controller  may provide access to the master database  on a multi-tier basis. For example, authentication and access may be provided based on three access levels, such as a master administrator level, a manager level, and a user level, each with different privileges and access rights.","Master administrator rights are typically granted to selected employees of the company that own and control the master database . The master administrator determines which users and managers are able to obtain data regarding vehicle subject repossession based upon arrangements between clients  and the third-party repossession companies.","The master administrator is responsible for accepting or pre-authorizing dial-in telephone numbers, authorized IP addresses, or other external communication device  identifiers corresponding to the various users. The master administrator can create, delete, and manage the user-level and the manager-level accounts. Further, the master administrator may set a particular maximum number of users and managers in the vehicle tracking and locating system .","The master administrator may also access the real-time log  that is maintained by the vehicle tracking and locating system . The real time log  may record all of the queries requested by the users, and all the responses provided to the users. The report may indicate the frequency of successful license plate number matches and statistics surrounding the matching process, such as the number of matches per 100 queries, and the like. Such statistics may also include geographical data so that the success rate for matches can be correlated with various geographical locations.","The manager-level entity is typically a member of an external repossession company, which may employ for example, ten users, agents, or drivers. A technician at the external repossession company may be considered to be a manager, and such a manager is typically able to provide authorization to the various users or drivers, under authorization from the master administrator.","The video and image input processor  of the database controller  receives video and image data from the video\/image feed system . The video\/image feed system  is shown in greater detail in . The video\/image feed system  provides a real-time data stream of license plate data for storage in the master database .","The video data and image data may be received from a plurality of sources, such as from municipal cameras , highway toll-collection cameras , traffic cameras , security cameras , spotter vehicle cameras , law enforcement cameras , \u201ccrowd-source\u201d external devices , and other video image capture devices , which may correspond to mobile image capture devices or fixed image capture devices. Spotter vehicle cameras  are typically mounted on \u201cspotter cars\u201d and\/or tow trucks, which may continuously capture images of vehicles and their license plates as the spotter vehicles drive along streets, travel through parking lots, and along other access routes.","Once the images of the vehicles and their license plates are captured, by whatever means available, automatic license plate recognition processing may be applied to the images to isolate, extract, and identify the license plate number prior to storage in the master database , along with the time and date that the image was captured, and including the geographical location or coordinates of the image capture. To facilitate this process, the license plate recognition system  (ALPR) and the OCR system  may be operatively coupled to the video and image input processor .","The automatic license plate recognition system (ALPR)  may be a commercially available recognition system embodied either in hardware components and\/or software components. For example, the license plate recognition system  may be commercially available from PIPS Technology, a Federal Signal Company, of Knoxville, Tenn. Software processing modules to facilitate ALPR may also be commercially available from Inex\/Zamir of Knoxville, Tenn., under the name of Insignia software.","In one embodiment, the video images are transmitted with an indication of a time and date that the image was captured in addition to the geographic location where the image was captured. The geographic location may be provided by an associated GPS system  coupled to the image capture device. Alternatively, for fixed image capture devices, a known geographical location of the fixed camera may be transmitted, or an identifying number of the fixed camera may be transmitted so that the vehicle tracking and locating system  can assign a predetermined geographical location to the fixed image capture device.","As described above, the user may transmit a data request to the request server  by inputting a vehicle identification number (VIN) or a license plate number. Using the external communication device , such as a digital camera, the user may also capture an image of the license plate number and transmit a photographic image of a license plate number to the request server . A video stream may also be captured. The input request processor  may transmit the image or the video stream to the video and image input processor  of the database controller, which in turn, may utilize the license plate recognition system  and\/or the OCR system  to convert the photographic image into a license plate number suitable for storage in the master database .","As described above, the user may direct an MMS message to either the multimedia messaging service module  or to the MMS third party service provider . The MMS data format is more complex than a text message because the information requested is usually embedded in an image or series of images (video stream), and must be extracted using some form of recognition processing, such as the license plate recognition system  and\/or the optical character recognition system . Once the MMS message has been received by the MMS service module  each image or each frame of the video stream is analyzed to locate and isolate the portion of the image that contains the license plate image.","The OCR recognition system  may be used to determine the particular portion of the image that contains characters, such as the license plate. The OCR recognition system  may crop and discard the portion of the image that is determined not to contain text data. The OCR recognition system  may be a color OCR system or an infrared OCR system. Alternatively, if the image as originally captured has a tight-focus, meaning that the image captured only includes the image of the license plate, the image may be transmitted directly to the license plate recognition system  without preprocessing by the OCR recognition system to isolate the license plate.","In another embodiment, the OCR recognition system  may be incorporated into the ALPR system . The ALPR system  may then analyze the image of the license plate to convert the image to alphanumeric characters representing the license plate number.","The following is an example of an agent or a spotter using a mobile device, such as a smart phone , to transmit MMS data to the vehicle tracking and locating system . The agent or user may walk through parking garage or public area, or may be a passenger in a moving vehicle, and may point the hand-held mobile device  (external communication device) toward parked or moving vehicles to capture images of the license plates.","The smart phone  may be recording and saving the video stream in memory or may be streaming the video in real-time through a cellular connection to the MMS third party service provider  or the MMS service module . In this way, each image or sequence of images is processed by the vehicle tracking and locating system  to isolate the plurality of license plate numbers captured.","Each license plate number captured is forwarded to the database controller  to perform a data match and or save the data if it does not exist in the database . Preferably, all license plate numbers are saved in the master database  along with the time that the image was captured and the location of capture based upon the GPS tag associated with the data transmission.","In one embodiment, to reduce the storage requirements of the database , certain license plate numbers may be deleted if they are \u201cstale,\u201d meaning that the associated timestamp is very old. Whether the external communication device  is streaming the video in real-time or whether it is transmitting the recorded video or still frame image at a later time from memory, the MMS module  analyzes the images on a frame-by-frame basis.","Turning back to , the request server  may provide the authentication component , which includes login control and verification. In one embodiment, the user is not required to affirmatively log-in. Rather, using caller-ID, IP address confirmation, or a similar process, the authentication component  may recognize the phone number or internet address of the caller or other identification of the external communication device , which has been preauthorized for acceptance by the authentication component . Each telephone or other communication device  is preferably authorized in advance for acceptance by the authorization component .","Alternatively, the authorization component  need be not be resident in the request server  or in the vehicle tracking and locating system , and may be provided by a third-party component or service, such as the SMS third party service provided  or the MMS third party service provider  discussed above. Any third-party provider may assist in authenticating the user.","In another embodiment, when the user places a call to the request server , the request server transmits a display interface or GUI to the user, and the user may then provide a security code or other password to gain access to vehicle tracking and locating system . Of course, the third-party component or service such as the SMS or MMS third party service provider ,  may also transmit the display interface or GUI to the user.","Once the user has transmitted a request to the request server and  and has been properly authenticated, the search engine  determines if the requested license plate number is found in the database, subject to the above-described criteria for permitting the user to obtain access to information. If a match is found, the output processor  organizes and transmits the data of interest to the user in one of a variety of possible formats, depending upon the format in which the request was received.","The data of interest may be transmitted as text, a synthesized voice message based on text, and may also be transmitted in the form of documents, such as in PDF format, JPG format, or document text format, or in other suitable electronic format. The data of interest may include information about the vehicle, including vehicle year, vehicle make, vehicle color, vehicle model, vehicle owner, lien holder, vehicle identification number, vehicle location history, case number, date of repossession action, reporting agency, credit agency, date stolen if applicable, and the like.","As shown in , each external communication device  may include a resident application or \u201cApp,\u201d  which is a specific plug-in or software module installed on the external communication device  to facilitate the above communication process. Preferably, the application  is installed on a smart phone, tablet, or other device having an operating system used by a large number of people. For example, mobile devices using the Google's Android\u2122 operating system or Apple's iOS\u2122 operating system may implement the application .","The application  increases the efficiency and flexibility of the system , minimizes use of customized hardware and software to reduce cost, and increases user or agent convenience, satisfaction, and efficiency. Such an application  may replace customized software modules, and provides a uniform interface to the user or agent. Further, because most external communication devices , such as smart phones , are GPS-enabled, images and video captured by such devices can be tagged with the GPS coordinates so that the location of the image (vehicle) captured is associated with its corresponding location.","Such applications  may be used by the agent, or by the members of the general population that receive compensation to provide video or images to the vehicle tracking and location system . This is referred to as \u201ccrowd-sourcing,\u201d that is, employing the masses or general population as spotters to participate in providing data to the vehicle tracking and locating system . For example, students may be paid a commensurate amount to record and\/or stream video images of the areas in which they travel using external communication devices  they own.","Such video may be recorded for subsequent transmission, or may be transmitted in real-time to the vehicle tracking and locating system . The student need only download the application  to his or her mobile device and activate the application to permit the device to record any and all images. In one embodiment, the participating students or spotters may be paid a stipend depending upon the volume of recorded information. In another embodiment, to encourage higher-quality information, the students may be paid a percentage of fees received if the information provided by the student is used in an actual repossession or identification of a vehicle in question.","Embodiments of the vehicle tracking and locating system  are not limited to finding only vehicles of interest, such as vehicles subject to repossession. The vehicle tracking and locating system  may also find application in parking enforcement. For example, a parking enforcement officer or agent may have an external communication device , such as a smart phone , for which the above-described application  is installed.","The officer or agent may travel past many parked vehicles while the smart phone  streams video data or still photographs to the vehicle tracking and locating system , preferably in MMS format. Based upon a recorded images of the plurality of license plates, the vehicle tracking and locating system  may isolate, recognize and identify each license plate number and compare the license plate numbers to the municipal vehicle database  operated by a municipality or other government body. The municipal vehicle database  may contain records corresponding to vehicles having outstanding parking or other violations. The vehicle tracking and locating system  may also request data from the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database .","Based on a match between the license plate number recognized and the license plate number contained in the database, the output processor  may provide an output to a parking meter enforcement agent that confirms that a vehicle scanned has outstanding tickets, and thus should be impounded or booted with a Denver Boot\u2122 or similar immobilization device. The parking officer or agent may receive a graphic output or notification directly on the smart phone  or display device. Alternatively, the smart phone  may be coupled to a wireless or wired printer so that a hardcopy can be printed. If the officer or agent as printing capability, a further citation may be printed and issued and a affixed to the vehicle in lieu of impoundment.","In another embodiment, the license plate recognition system  (ALPR) may be used in conjunction with the dimensional recognition or object recognition system A so that the dimensions or general shape of the vehicle may be identified and quantified. In this way, a license plate number recognized can be compared to the municipal vehicle database  to verify that the license plate indeed belongs to that specific type of vehicle to which it is affixed. For example, once the license plate number has been recognized, the make and model of the vehicle may be obtained from the official vehicle registration database .","A vehicle dimension database  () may be part of or may be included in the master database  or may be separate therefrom. The vehicle dimension database  may include information as to the overall dimensions of every make and model of vehicle. In operation, when the license plate recognition system  (ALPR) extracts the license plate number of a particular vehicle, it may instruct the database controller  to request the make and model of that vehicle from the municipal vehicle database  or other database containing official vehicle registration information, if such information is not already of record in the master database . Of course, the request for information from the municipal vehicle database  need not necessarily be made by the database controller , but rather, may be made by the request server  or other component of the vehicle tracking and locating system .","In one embodiment, for example, if the municipal vehicle database  indicates that the vehicle scanned is a Volkswagen, but the vehicle dimension database  indicates that the size of the vehicle corresponding to the license plate number is much larger than a Volkswagen, an alert can be issued indicating that the license plate may be stolen and is affixed to the wrong vehicle.","In another embodiment, the vehicle tracking and locating system  may provide a \u201cproximity alert\u201d for fleet and dispatch management. In this embodiment, the identity of vehicles of interest (whether subject to repossession or of interest for any reason, such as for marketing purposes) are downloaded or imported into a GPS navigation device , or map enabled smart phone  installed in the agent's or spotter's vehicle. Of course, the GPS navigation device  must have a sufficiently large memory to accommodate all of the data. The GPS navigation device  may be a commercially available navigation device, such as those provided by Garmin Corporation.","The GPS navigation device  may then compare the current location of the agent's vehicle (in a real-time), against the location of all of the downloaded data corresponding to various vehicles of interest. The GPS navigation device  may then compare the location of each vehicle of interest in memory to the current location of the agent's vehicle to determine the distance from the agent's vehicle to the last known location of the vehicle of interest, assuming the time stamp associated with the vehicle of interest is not \u201cstale.\u201d","If the GPS navigation device  determines that the vehicle of interest is within a predetermined radius of the agent's vehicle, for example, within one mile, and the time stamp was relatively recent, for example, within five minutes, the GPS navigation device  may alert the agent and direct the agent to the last known location of the vehicle of interest.","In that way, the agent could attempt to locate and track the vehicle of interest and take appropriate action. Of course, the predetermined radius and the time stamp differential (i.e., the current time minus the timestamp associated with the vehicle of interest) may be increased or decreased depending upon the application and the scope of the agent's work. Also, to keep the data \u201cfresh,\u201d or up-to-date, the information corresponding to the vehicles of interest are preferably downloaded to the GPS navigation device  periodically, such as every 5 minutes.","Alternatively, the data corresponding to the vehicles of interest need not be downloaded and remain resident in the GPS navigation device. Rather, the GPS navigation device may communicate in real-time with the vehicle tracking and location system , and may transmit the current location or coordinates of the agent's vehicle to the vehicle tracking and location system, for example every 30 seconds. The vehicle tracking and location system  may then compare the location of the agent's vehicle to all of the vehicles of interest in the database  based upon the location of the vehicle of interest and the time that the vehicle of interest was spotted.","If the vehicle of interest was spotted within a predetermined radius of the current location of the agent vehicle, and if the time that the vehicle of interest was spotted was relatively recent (i.e. within the last 10 minutes, for example), the vehicle tracking and location system  may inform the agent through the GPS navigation device  that a vehicle of interest was spotted and may be close by. The GPS navigation device  may also provide navigational directions to the agent to facilitate pursuit of the vehicle interest, at least with respect to its last known location.","Note that the vehicle tracking and location system  may provide navigational directions to the agent or spotter should the agent not be in possession of a GPS navigational device. Based on the coordinates of a destination, reverse geo-coding can be applied to either the vehicle interest or the agent vehicle. Reverse geo-encoding means that once the GPS coordinates of a destination are known, a map or navigational directions, or an address can be transmitted to the agent's smart phone or other device. In one embodiment, a commercially available reverse geo-coding system, such as Google Maps\u2122, Microsoft Bing On-Line\u2122, Microsoft MapPoint\u2122, Streets & Trips\u2122, or MapQuest\u2122, may be used.","The vehicle tracking and locating system  may be embodied as a system cooperating with computer hardware components and\/or as computer-implemented methods. The vehicle tracking and locating system  may include a plurality of software modules or subsystems. The components, modules, or subsystems, such as the request server , the input request processor , the output processor , the database controller , the video and image input processor , the client data processor , the search engine , the license plate recognition system , the optical character recognition system  and other components and\/or modules of the vehicle tracking locating system , may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination of hardware, software, and firmware.","Such components, modules, or subsystems may or may not reside within a single physical or logical space. For example, the components, modules, or subsystems referred to in this document and which may or may not be shown in the drawings, may be remotely located from each other and may be coupled by a communication network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500"]},"The computer  may be a personal computer and may include various hardware components, such as RAM , ROM , hard disk storage , cache memory , database storage , and the like (also referred to as \u201cmemory subsystem \u201d). The computer  may include any suitable processing device , such as a computer, microprocessor, RISC processor (reduced instruction set computer), CISC processor (complex instruction set computer), mainframe computer, work station, single-chip computer, distributed processor, server, controller, microcontroller, discrete logic computer, and the like, as is known in the art. For example, the processing device  may be an Intel Pentium\u00ae microprocessor, x86 compatible microprocessor, or equivalent device, and may be incorporated into a server, a personal computer, or any suitable computing platform.","The memory subsystem  may include any suitable storage components, such as RAM, EPROM (electrically programmable ROM), flash memory, dynamic memory, static memory, FIFO (first-in, first-out) memory, LIFO (last-in, first-out) memory, circular memory, semiconductor memory, bubble memory, buffer memory, disk memory, optical memory, cache memory, and the like. Any suitable form of memory may be used, whether fixed storage on a magnetic medium, storage in a semiconductor device, or remote storage accessible through a communication link. A user or system interface  may be coupled to the computer system  and may include various input devices , such as switches selectable by the system manager and\/or a keyboard. The user interface also may include suitable output devices , such as an LCD display, a CRT, various LED indicators, a printer, and\/or a speech output device, as is known in the art.","To facilitate communication between the computer  and external sources or other components, modules, and subsystems, a communication interface  may be operatively coupled to the computer system . The communication interface  may be, for example, a local area network, such as an Ethernet network, intranet, Internet, or other suitable network . The communication interface  may also be connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  or POTS (plain old telephone system), which may facilitate communication via the Internet . Any suitable commercially-available communication device or network may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","100","116","130","224","610","100","612","130"]},"If the user is authorized () to access the vehicle tracking and locating system , the user then initiates a request () to the request server or third-party provider service . If the user is not authorized (), an output message is prepared indicating that the user is not authorized (), processing then branches to a component that outputs the prepared message (), and the routine exits. The component that prepares and\/or sends the output message, in some embodiments, may be the output processor .","The user may provide the request in a variety of formats, such as a voice request (), an image request (), or a text request (). If the request is not in any of the required formats, an output message is prepared indicating an input request error, which requests that the user try again ().","If the request is a voice request, voice recognition is applied to identify the text of the request (), which corresponds to a license plate number. If the request is an image request where the user is transmitting a digital image of a license plate, automatic license plate recognition is applied to identify the license plate number in the request (). If the request is an video request or streaming video request, the OCR system  isolates the portions of the images\/frames containing the license plate and forwards the cropped portions to the license plate recognition system  so as to identify the license plate number in the request (). If the request is a text message, license plate number in the message is extracted ().","Once the license plate number of interest is been extracted and identified, the search engine  searches the master database  to determine if a match exists (). In one embodiment, if the request contains video or photographic images, and if no match is found (), the license plate number and associated information (such as location and time) are saved in the database so as to continuously build the database, and an output message is prepared indicating that no match has been found (). Processing then branches to the component that outputs the prepared message (), and the routine exits.","In one embodiment, if the request contains video or photographic images, and if a match is found in the master database (), the master database is updated with respect to the location and time (). Next, the matching record is inspected to determine if the user is authorized to view the matching information and\/or engage in actions relative to the repossession of the vehicle for which a match is found (). If the user is not authorized, an output message is prepared indicating that the user is not authorized and that the request is denied (). Processing then branches to the component that outputs the prepared message ().","If the user is authorized to view the matching information and\/or engage in actions relative to the repossession of the vehicle for which a match is found, the information of interest is obtained from the matching database record (), and an output message is prepared indicating that the information is available. The output message is then sent to the user along with the information of interest obtained from the database (), and the routine exits.","The logic, circuitry, and processing described above may be encoded or stored in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium such as a compact disc read only memory (CDROM), magnetic or optical disk, flash memory, random access memory (RAM) or read only memory (ROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) or other machine-readable medium as, for examples, instructions for execution by a processor, controller, or other processing device.","The medium may be implemented as any device that contains, stores, communicates, propagates, or transports executable instructions for use by or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device. Alternatively or additionally, the logic may be implemented as analog or digital logic using hardware, such as one or more integrated circuits, or one or more processors executing instructions; or in software in an application programming interface (API) or in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), functions available in a shared memory or defined as local or remote procedure calls; or as a combination of hardware and software.","In other implementations, the logic may be represented in a signal or a propagated-signal medium. For example, the instructions that implement the logic of any given program may take the form of an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or other type of signal. The systems described above may receive such a signal at a communication interface, such as an optical fiber interface, antenna, or other analog or digital signal interface, recover the instructions from the signal, store them in a machine-readable memory, and\/or execute them with a processor.","The systems may include additional or different logic and may be implemented in many different ways. A processor may be implemented as a controller, microprocessor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash, or other types of memory. Parameters (e.g., conditions and thresholds) and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, or may be logically and physically organized in many different ways. Programs and instructions may be parts of a single program, separate programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
