In a second particular embodiment, a photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus includes a silicon nitride integral photonic waveguide and a silicon nitride integral photonic crystal resonator which provide for optical trapping within an aqueous solution absent appreciable heating of the aqueous solution, since the integrated silicon nitride photonic waveguide and silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator may be used to transmit optical radiation at a wavelength of about 1064 nanometers (or alternatively in a range from about 700 to about 1200 nanometers, more preferably from about 750 to about 850 nanometers, or alternatively more preferably from about 960 to about 1070 nanometers, where the foregoing more preferable ranges take into consideration both radiation absorption by water and also biological cell photodamage) rather than at a wavelength of about 1550 nanometers as is typically used with a silicon photonic waveguide and a silicon photonic crystal resonator which appreciably heat an aqueous solution.","A particular optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the embodiments includes a photonic waveguide located over a substrate.

Particular photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the embodiments may be fabricated from monocrystalline silicon materials, or alternatively from silicon nitride materials (which are generally not monocrystalline, or polycrystalline, but rather generally amorphous). Other materials are not precluded for fabricating photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatuses in accordance with the illustrative non-limiting embodiments.","Particular photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatuses in accordance with the embodiments do not use chemical functionalization of either a coupled photonic waveguide (i.e., either a separately coupled photonic waveguide or an integrally coupled photonic waveguide) or a photonic crystal resonator, but rather rely upon physical near field optical trapping characteristics of at least one of the coupled photonic waveguide and the photonic crystal resonator absent chemical functionalization. Additional particular photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatuses in accordance with the embodiments provide for selection of materials of construction of a photonic waveguide and a photonic crystal resonator to provide for optical resonance at a wavelength not appreciably absorbed by a fluid that may be analyzed by the photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus so that the fluid that may be analyzed by the photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus is not appreciably heated (i.e., a temperature rise of less than about 1 degree centigrade) when analyzed by the photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus.","I. Separately Coupled Photonic Waveguide Based Photonic Crystal Resonator Optical Trapping Apparatus Fabricated from Monocrystalline Silicon Materials","As illustrated in , a particular photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance with a first embodiment includes, located and formed over a substrate (of which an upper surface comprises a buried oxide layer within a silicon-on-insulator substrate), a one-dimensional silicon photonic crystal resonator that is evanescently coupled to a single mode silicon bus photonic waveguide. A standing wave nature of a resonant optical field within the silicon photonic crystal resonator of the resonant optical trapping apparatus enables a true static point trap with strong field confinement in all three dimensions.","A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance the first embodiment is shown in . A fabrication process for such a photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus is provided in further detail below. Generally each of the single mode silicon bus photonic waveguide and the one dimensional silicon photonic crystal resonator is patterned from a surface silicon layer within a silicon-on-insulator substrate and has a thickness from about 200 to about 500 nanometers, a linewidth from about 200 to about 1000 nanometers and a separation distance from about 50 to about 400 nanometers. Moreover, the one-dimensional silicon photonic crystal resonator has a length from about 2 to about 10 microns and includes from about 6 to about 30 apertures (i.e., periodic structures that provide the photonic crystal resonator, and that typically comprise holes) located and formed penetrating through a top surface of the one-dimensional silicon photonic crystal resonator. The apertures will typically have a diameter from about 50 to about 400 nanometers, either uniformly sized or variably sized. A smaller sized aperture or hole from about 10 to about 100 nanometers may be beneficially located centered with respect to remaining apertures.","When light (i.e., photonic radiation) at a resonant wavelength is coupled into the silicon bus photonic waveguide, a stationary interference pattern is formed within the silicon photonic crystal resonator resulting in a tight confinement of an optical field in an extremely small volume, as illustrated in (where the arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of local optical forces). These strong field gradients coupled with the resonant amplification of the optical field within the silicon photonic crystal resonator enables a stable trapping of nanoparticles ranging in size from 50 to 500 nm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"An interesting aspect of the photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus design in accordance with at least this first embodiment is that a guided optical mode within a silicon (or possibly other photonic material) bus photonic waveguide possesses a forward momentum which enables the simultaneous trapping and propulsion of nanoparticles along its surface. In contrast, at resonance, the field within the silicon photonic crystal resonator consists of a tightly confined standing wave with no propagation component. Thus, by tailoring a microfluidic flow and exploiting this contrasting nature of the optical field within the silicon bus photonic waveguide and the one-dimensional silicon photonic crystal resonator, a novel technique for performing particle manipulations may be demonstrated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4B"],"i":"a"},"To characterize the trapping stiffness as well as the maximum trapping force in all three dimensions within a photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, a detailed three-dimensional finite element numerical analysis has been undertaken using a commercial software package (COMSOL). The material properties of the silicon photonic crystal resonator and the surrounding water medium within a fluid channel were taken into consideration while solving for the electromagnetic field distribution at resonance. To determine the force exerted on a particle, a virtual spherical surface was constructed that enclosed the particle, and an electromagnetic field on this surface was calculated. By evaluating the time-independent Maxwell stress tensor and integrating it over the closed surface enclosing the particle, one is able to obtain the trapping force in various directions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["a","b ","c ","c"],"sup":["\u22121 ","\u22121 ","\u22121 ","\u22121"]},"To obtain experimental values for the trapping stiffness in the X and Y axes and compare them with theoretical estimates, the suppressed Brownian motion of a trapped 200 nm particle was studied. Triton X-100 (1%) was used as a surfactant to minimize stiction between the nanoparticle and the silicon photonic crystal resonator surface. illustrates a scatter plot of the position trace of a 200 nm particle when the output power measured at the waveguide output was 140 \u03bcW. The scatter plot is overlaid on top of the field distribution within the silicon photonic crystal resonator (to scale). It is evident that at such low optical powers, the trapping is weak and the particle hops between the two center lobes of the resonant optical field. One can also observe that the particle hops to the weaker traps at the side lobes for a short duration of time. When the power is raised such that the measured power at the waveguide output is 175 \u03bcW, the strength of the trapping increases and the particle is observed to remain stably trapped at a single site. and show histograms for the displacement of a trapped 200 nm particle, each of which exhibits a Gaussian distribution. From these plots, one may determine a radial trapping stiffness of 2.86 pN nmW, which is slightly lower than a numerical estimate of 5.38 pN nmWfor a 200 nm particle (see additional information below). Since the experimentally observed trap stiffness agrees reasonably well with numerical estimates, one may infer that surface interactions between a particle and a photonic crystal resonator surface do not dominate the trapping characteristics. In general, one may observe a higher trap stiffness for larger particles, as they are influenced by a larger portion of an optical trapping field.","The estimated trapping stiffness for a resonant optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment is an order of magnitude higher than that of slot waveguides (0.2 pN nmWfor a 100 nm particle; see Yang et al., Nature 2009, 457, 71-759) and several orders of magnitude higher than other recent optical trapping techniques such as plasmonic tweezers (0.013 pN nmWfor a 200 nm bead; see Grigorenko et al., Nat. Photonics, 2008, 2, 365-370.), conventional high-NA optical tweezers (0.16 pN nmWfor a 500 nm bead; see Neuman et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum., 2004, 75, 2787-2809), and Fresnel zone plate optical tweezers (0.1 pN nmWfor a 2 \u03bcm bead; see Schonbrun et al., Appl. Phys. Lett., 2008, 92, 071112-3). While it is difficult to make a clear comparison between these different trapping techniques due to the dependence of the trapping stiffness on particle size, it is evident that the stiffness of trapping within a photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance with at least this first embodiment exceeds the state-of-the-art by at least an order of magnitude.","The presence of a trapped particle affects the resonant wavelength of the silicon photonic crystal resonator by a small amount. Thus, when a trapped particle escapes from the trap, it induces a slight shift in the resonant wavelength which manifests itself as a discrete jump in the output power from the coupled photonic waveguide. By monitoring the laser power at the output end of the coupled photonic waveguide, it is possible to infer the release of a particle from the optical trap, as shown in . It is important to note that this effect is more pronounced in the case of larger nanoparticles. As the size of the nanoparticle reduces, an induced shift in the resonant wavelength also decreases.","A. Experimental Details","The photonic crystal resonator optical trapping devices and apparatus in accordance with the foregoing first embodiment were fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers having a device layer thickness of 250 nm. XR-1541 electron beam resist (HSQ, Dow-Corning Corporation) was spun on the wafer and the devices were patterned using a Leica VB6-HR electron beam lithography system. Details regarding the fabrication procedure of these devices are generally conventional, but in particular include the use of e-beam evaporated silicon oxide as a nanotaper cladding. A tunable infrared laser was connected to a tapered fiber lens via an erbium-doped-fiber-amplifier (EDFA) to produce enough optical power for performing these optical trapping experiments. Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 50-500 nm (Duke Scientific) and refractive index 1.59 were mixed in a 100 mM phosphate buffer solution. 1% Triton X-100 surfactant was added to minimize adhesion and stiction issues between the polystyrene nanoparticles and the microfluidic channel surfaces, as well as the substrate of the chip. PDMS microfluidic channels were bonded to the chips after plasma treatment for 15 seconds. The channels were 120 \u03bcm wide and 5 \u03bcm tall. A syringe pump was used to control the fluid flow within the microfluidic channels. Measurements of the particle position and Brownian motion were made using the Video Spot Tracker software package.","B. Suppressed Brownian Motion and Trap Stiffness Measurement","In accordance with disclosure above, the radial trapping stiffness of a photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment was estimated by analyzing the suppressed Brownian motion of a trapped 200-nm polystyrene nanoparticle when the power at the output of a silicon bus photonic waveguide was measured to be 175 \u03bcW. For a particle in a harmonic potential with stiffness k, the equipartition theorem states that:\n\n\u00bd\u00bd]\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere kis the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and [x] is the positional variance of the trapped particle. By measuring the instantaneous position of the particle, it is possible to determine the stiffness of the optical trap. However, detection systems such as video cameras do not measure the instantaneous particle position. Instead, they introduce a bias in the measurements due to the finite integration time W of the device. Wong et al., Opt. Express, 2006 14, 12517-12531, performed a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis to demonstrate a novel method that accounts for these systematic biases introduced in measurements due to video-image motion blur. The true and measured variance var(X) and var(X) are related by:\n\n()=()(\u03b1)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere S(\u03b1) is the motion blur correction function. \u03b1 is given by Wk\/2\u03c0\u03b3 where \u03b3 is the Stoke's drag coefficient and W is 51.17 ms. By combining equation (1) and equation (2) one may obtain:\n\n()=[()2(\u03b1)\/(\u03b1)]\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nEquation (3) may be solved numerically for a using values for var(X) and var(Y) determined from and . Thus one may obtain trap stiffness values along the X and Y axes of 3.73\u00d710pN\/nm and 3.50\u00d710pN\/nm respectively. One may also determine the true standard deviation of the Brownian fluctuations in the X and Y axes to be 33.2 nm and 34.3 nm, respectively.\n","The resonant output spectrum for the photonic crystal resonator was recorded. The ratio of the output power at the resonant wavelength to the output power for a nonresonant wavelength was determined to be 0.44. Additionally, silicon crystal bus photonic waveguides that are fabricated using HSQ\/XR-1541 (Dow-Corning Corporation) typically exhibit propagation losses around 2 dB\/cm. Taking these into account, one may estimate the corresponding input power in the silicon bus photonic waveguide to be 630.4 \u03bcW. Thus, the power normalized stiffness for the resonant optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the foregoing first embodiment is determined to be 5.90 pN nmWand 5.55 pN nmWalong the X and Y axes respectively thus giving a final radial trap stiffness of 2.86 pN nmW.","By performing a detailed three dimensional finite element numerical analysis one may obtain theoretical trap stiffness values of 15.85 pN nmW(X-axis) and 8.14 pN nmW(Y-axis) resulting in a net radial trap stiffness of 5.38 pN nmW. The results of these calculations are shown in and ","Within and , all forces are normalized to 1-W of input power in the waveguide. Within , a force is experienced by a 200-nm trapped polystyrene nanoparticle as it is displaced along the length of the silicon photonic crystal resonator (X-axis). The zero X-axis value corresponds to the stable trapping position at the lobe centre. The slope in the linear region of the plot indicates a trapping stiffness of 15.85 pN nmWalong the X-axis. Within , the restoring force on the 200-nm particle is displaced in the Y-axis, normal to the length of the silicon photonic crystal resonator. The zero Y-axis value corresponds to the stable trapping position at the lobe centre. The slope of the linear region in the plot indicates a trapping stiffness of 8.14 pN nmWalong the Y-axis.","II. Integrally Coupled Photonic Waveguide Based Photonic Crystal Resonator Optical Trapping Apparatus Fabricated from Silicon Nitride Materials","Although conventional optical tweezers have been used for more than a decade, they are generally limited to trap dielectric particles lager than about 100 nm in diameter since the size of the focusing spot is limited by diffraction. Among different kinds of near-field optical trapping devices, photonic crystal resonators are especially promising for the trapping of even smaller nanoparticles and biomolecules since they can tightly confine electric fields in a very small volume. However, to utilize photonic crystal resonators to trap small biomolecules, in addition to optimizing the design of resonators to increase the field gradient, it is critical to minimize the heat generated in the vicinity of the devices so that the trapped biomolecules can function normally and that buoyancy driven flow and thermophoresis resulting from thermal heating does not affect the transport of biomolecules to the hot spots.","To reduce thermal heating, although almost all near-field optical trapping devices demonstrated so far, which are mostly made of silicon, are designed to operate at a wavelength of \u02dc1550 nm, a second embodiment of a photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the embodiments uses 1064 nm (or alternatively a wavelength in a range from about 700 to about 1200 nanometers) as the operating wavelength of a photonic crystal resonator since light of this wavelength is significantly less absorbed by water as compared to light of 1550 nm. Another benefit of using 1064 nm light in particular to trap biomolecules is that biomolecules are relatively more transparent in the spectrum around 750-1200 nm, which means photodamage to biomolecules is minimized when light within the spectrum mentioned above is used for trapping. Partly because of the choice of the operating wavelength, silicon nitride instead of silicon is used to fabricate the photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatus in accordance with the second embodiment. Silicon nitride is transparent in the visible and near-infrared spectrum and has optical and material properties suitable for near-field optical trapping applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","c ","d "],"sup":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"]},"Within this particular second embodiment, the trapped 22-nm polymer particle jumped from one place to another when they were moving on the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator surface in the direction of the laser since the electric fields were much stronger between two adjacent holes than in the holes, except at the center of the cavity. After the laser was turned off, the trapped particle was released from the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator, which suggests that the trapping of the polymer particle was caused by optical forces rather than non-specific binding. Similar optical trapping experiments were undertaken with streptavidin-coated CdSe\/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), the cores of which were \u02dc10-15 nm in diameter. Because of intrinsic fluorescence of silicon nitride, it was difficult to determine if QDs were trapped on the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator by observing their fluorescence. Therefore, to observe trapping of QDs, an optical filter blocking 1064-nm laser light in front of a CCD camera was removed so that laser light scattered by optically trapped QDs could be seen by the CCD camera. As shown in , QDs were trapped in and close to the cavity, which resulted in considerable scattering of 1064-nm light when the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator was on resonance. However, when the laser filter was returned to block the 1064-nm light in front of the camera so that only fluorescent light could pass through, observed was only the QDs flowing in the flow chamber but not those trapped on the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator. One possible explanation is that some kind of fluorescence quenching effect might cause the fluorescence of trapped QDs to disappear on the photonic crystal resonator surface.","Wilson disease proteins, which are only \u02dc10 nm in diameter, were also trapped using a silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator in accordance with this second embodiment. These proteins have two sites that can be conjugated to Cy3 and Cy5 dyes. Since the filter cube used in the fluorescence microscope was for observing Cy5 but not Cy3, each protein seen by the CCD camera had either one or two Cy5 dyes. As shown in , Wilson disease proteins were trapped when they were in close proximity to the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator surface, and the Cy5 dyes were gradually photobleached in less than \u02dc10 seconds. The one-stage decay of the fluorescence intensity, shown in , suggests that the trapped protein is a single protein rather than aggregation of proteins. Finite element analysis shows that, under the experimental conditions used, a temperature increase at the resonator cavity of the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator in accordance with the second embodiment is less than 0.1 K, which is small enough not to affect biological activities. In contrast, according to the numerical and experimental results, the temperature increase on a silicon photonic crystal resonator in accordance with the foregoing first embodiment that is excited by 1550-nm light and has a Q-factor of \u02dc3000 is on the order of 60 K under similar experimental conditions. The significant difference in the temperature increase between the two photonic crystal resonator optical trapping apparatuses highlights the benefits of using silicon nitride photonic crystal resonators operating at 1064 nm over silicon photonic crystal resonators operating at 1550 nm for trapping small biomolecules.","To determine the trapping stiffness of the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator in accordance with the second embodiment, the suppressed Brownian motion of a trapped 22-nm fluorescent polystyrene polymer particle was measured. and illustrate the histograms of the displacement of the trapped particle in the X and Y direction, respectively, when the laser power coupled into the resonator was \u02dc6 mW. After correcting for the effect of the integration time of the CCD camera on the measurements of the particle motion, one may determine the standard deviation of the Brownian motion in the X and Y direction to be 75.7 nm and 94.4 nm, respectively. A stiffness of the optical trap in the X and Y direction was determined to be 0.12 pNWand 0.08 pN nmW, respectively. Although it is difficult to compare the optical trapping capability of different optical trapping devices as, again, the trapping stiffness depends on the particle size, the observation that a photonic crystal resonator in accordance with the second embodiment can trap 15-nm QDs, 22-nm polymer particles, and 10-nm Wilson disease proteins already demonstrates the excellent trapping capability of the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator in accordance with the second embodiment.","As demonstrated in this work, silicon nitride photonic crystal resonators operating at near infrared or visible wavelength can provide high optical trapping stiffness without generating much heat. The significantly reduced heat generation ensures that the trapped biomolecules can function normally and that the transport of biomolecules in a flow chamber would not be affected by thermal effects. Silicon nitride photonic crystal resonators in accordance with the second embodiment, such as the one used in this work, can be used to trap small biomolecules that are too small to be easily trapped using other optical trapping techniques for single-molecule studies.","A. Device Fabrication","Silicon nitride photonic crystal resonator optical tapping devices and apparatuses in accordance with the second embodiment were fabricated using silicon wafers that included a 3.5 \u03bcm thick thermal oxide layer. A 250 nm-thick stoichiometric silicon nitride layer was deposited on the top of the thermal oxide layer using a low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) process. For example, ma-N 2403 electron beam photoresist was then spun on a wafer and then was patterned using a JEOL 9300 electron beam lithography system. The silicon nitride layer was then etched with the ma-N 2403 mask using an inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etch (ICP RIE) system, Oxford . Then, the lift-off process was used to create a patterned silicon dioxide layer, which was 3 \u03bcm-thick and was deposited using a magnetron sputtering deposition system, CVC 601, to cover the entire wafer except the area where the silicon nitride photonic crystal resonators were located.","B. Nanoparticle Sample Preparation","22-nm fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (Thermo Scientific) were suspended in 1\u00d7 phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), and streptavidin-coated QDs (Life Technologies) were suspended in 50 mM borate buffer solution (pH 7.4). Wilson disease proteins were suspended in HEPES buffer solution (60 mM HEPES, 110 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Each of the three buffer solutions mentioned above also contained 0.05% (v\/v) Tween 20 surfactant to reduce nonspecific binding. In addition, an oxygen scavenging system that consists of 50 nM protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase (PCD) and 2.5 mM protocatechuic acid (PCA) was introduced into the buffer solution right before each optical trapping experiment to increase the stability of fluorescent dyes.","C. Fluid Chamber Preparation","To prepare the flow chamber, two access holes were fabricated on a coverslip using a COlaser system, and then Tygon tubing was affixed to the access holes with epoxy glue. Then, the coverslip, the fabricated chip, and a Parafilm spacer (which had a cut-out for the flow channel between the holes) were sandwiched together and briefly baked to create a sealed fluid chamber. A syringe driven by a syringe pump was used to inject the buffer solutions into the fluid chamber via Tygon tubing. Before introducing particles into the fluid chamber, the fluid chamber was first incubated with PBS solution that had 1 mg\/ml casein for \u02dc20 minutes to prevent nonspecific binding.","D. Optical Trapping Experiments","A 1064-nm fibre-coupled high power diode laser was used to provide the light source for optical trapping. Laser light was coupled into the silicon nitride photonic waveguide through a lensed fibre. The temperature of the laser diode was adjusted to fine-tune the centre wavelength of the laser diode, which shifted 0.3 nm per degree centigrade. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera.","E. Simulation and Data Analysis","The analysis of the Brownian motion of 22-nm polystyrene polymer nanoparticles was performed using the Video Spot Tracker software developed by CISMM at UNC Chapel Hill, and the three-dimensional FDTD simulation was carried out using FDTD Solutions (Lumerical Solutions, Inc.). The FIONA kernel of the Video Spot Tracker software was used to for particle tracking.
