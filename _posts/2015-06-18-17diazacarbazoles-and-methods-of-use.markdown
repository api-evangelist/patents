The invention also relates to compositions, more specifically pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using the same to treat various forms of cancer and hyperproliferative disorders, as well as methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Individual cells replicate by making an exact copy of their chromosomes, and then segregating these into separate cells. This cycle of DNA replication, chromosome separation and division is regulated by mechanisms within the cell that maintain the order of the steps and ensure that each step is precisely carried out. Involved in these processes are the cell cycle checkpoints (Hartwell et al., Science, Nov. 3, 1989, 246(4930):629-34) where cells may arrest to ensure DNA repair mechanisms have time to operate prior to continuing through the cycle into mitosis. There are two such checkpoints in the cell cycle\u2014the G1\/S checkpoint that is regulated by p53 and the G2\/M checkpoint that is monitored by the serine\/threonine kinase checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1).","Chk1 and chk2 are structurally unrelated yet functionally overlapping serine\/threonine kinases activated in response to genotoxic stimuli (reviewed in Bartek et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001, vol. 2, pp. 877-886). Chk1 and chk2 relay the checkpoint signals from the ATM and ATR, which phosphorylate and activate them. Chk2 is a stable protein expressed throughout the cell cycle, activated mainly by ATM in response to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). In contrast, Chk1 protein expression is largely restricted to S and G2 phases. In response to DNA damage, ChK1 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM\/ATR, resulting in cell cycle arrest in the S and G2\/M phases to allow for repair of DNA damage (reviewed in Cancer Cell, Bartek and Lukas, Volume 3, Issue 5, May 2003, Pages 421-429. Inhibition of Chk1 has been shown to abrogate cell cycle arrest leading to enhanced tumor cell death following DNA damage by a range of chemotherapeutics. Cells lacking intact G1 checkpoints are particularly dependent on S and G2\/M checkpoints and are therefore expected to be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment in the presence of a chk1 inhibitor, whereas normal cells with functional G1 checkpoints would be predicted to undergo less cell death.","The invention relates to 1,7-diazacarbazoles of Formula (I), (I-a), and\/or (I-b) (and\/or solvates, hydrates and\/or salts thereof) with kinase inhibitory activity, more specifically with chk1 inhibitory activity. The compounds of the present invention are also useful as inhibitors of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3), KDR kinase, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Accordingly, the compounds of the invention and compositions thereof are useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer.","One embodiment of the invention provides compounds of

P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. For example, any reference to a structure of 2-hydroxypyridine include its tautomer 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine, also known as 2-pyridone.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention.

A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counter ion.","If the compound of the invention is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.","If the compound of the invention is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like.
