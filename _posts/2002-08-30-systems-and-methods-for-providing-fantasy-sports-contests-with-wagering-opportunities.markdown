{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates to fantasy sports contests, and more particularly, this invention relates to systems and methods for providing wagering opportunities in conjunction with fantasy sports contests.","In known fantasy sports contests, a user (i.e., a fantasy sports contestant) selects a roster, a team, a particular individual, or a group of individuals in a season-long athletic competition. Fantasy sports contests are typically based on real-life team sports (e.g., football, baseball, basketball, hockey, soccer, rugby, etc.), real-life athletic events in which individuals compete (e.g., golf, tennis, automotive racing, etc.), and real-life sporting events involving animals (e.g., horse and dog racing). The user is given the ability to take on the role of a fictional general manager with powers which may include the ability to draft, trade, dismiss and otherwise manage the user's fantasy sports contest team selections.","Known fantasy sports contest systems provide services to users which include providing statistical information for real-life athletic competition and tracking users' standings (i.e., rankings) in fantasy sports contests. Known fantasy sports contest systems typically determine a user's standing (i.e., ranking) in a fantasy sports contest based on the performance of the user's fantasy sports contest team selections in real-life athletic competition. For example, a conventional fantasy sports contest system might award five fantasy sports contest points to the user for every goal scored in real-life by a member of the user's fantasy sports contest soccer team. Generally, the user who has accumulated the most fantasy sports contest points by the conclusion of a fantasy sports contest (e.g., the end of a real-life athletic season) is the overall winner of that fantasy sports contest.","Fantasy sports contestants may often find it desirable to wager with one another based on, for example, which of the fantasy sports contestants accumulates the most fantasy sports contest points in a fantasy sports contest (e.g., for a particular week of the fantasy sports contest, over the entire fantasy sports contest, etc.). Fantasy sports contestants may also find it desirable to wager based on real-life athletic events (e.g., real-life athletic events that are related to the contestants' fantasy sports contest). In particular, because fantasy sports contestants typically track closely real-life athletic events (e.g., to plan favorable trades of the contestants' fantasy sports contest team selections, as a hobby or pastime, for entertainment purposes, etc.), fantasy sports contestants may find it desirable to wager (e.g., with other fantasy sports contestants, through a wagering service) based on the outcomes of these real-life athletic events.","Known fantasy sports contest systems do not provide to a user the ability to wager. In particular, a user of a known fantasy sports contest system is required to establish independently from the fantasy sports contest system terms of a wager with, for example, another fantasy sports contestant. Therefore, fantasy sports contest data (e.g., real-life sports statistics, fantasy sports standings, etc.) that may otherwise be useful in establishing the terms of a wager may be not be conveniently accessible to a user who is determining whether to wager. Additionally, the user may have no choice but to reiterate (i.e., independent from the fantasy sports contest system) an opportunity to wager to, for example, a second fantasy sports contestant in the event that wager terms cannot be established with a first fantasy sports contestant. Furthermore, because known fantasy sports contest systems do not store or otherwise process data for the user's wagers, the user may forget the agreed-upon terms of a wager or, even worse, whether a wager was ever made.","In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide systems and methods for providing wagering opportunities in conjunction with fantasy sports contests.","It is an object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for providing wagering opportunities in conjunction with fantasy sports contests.","This and other objects are accomplished in accordance with the present invention by providing a fantasy sports contest application that provides to a user the ability access to fantasy sports contests and wagering opportunities.","Systems and methods for providing to a user the ability to use a fantasy sports contest application to access fantasy sports contests and wagering opportunities are provided in accordance with the present invention. The fantasy sports contest application may display to the user fantasy sports contest information that is associated with a fantasy sports contest in which the user participates. The fantasy sports contest information may include, for example, information for real-life athletic competition that is associated with the user's fantasy sports contest or information that indicates the user's performance in the fantasy sports contest. The fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to place a wager related to the fantasy sports contest and may process the wager for the user.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to place a wager based on the user's performance in a fantasy sports contest. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to place a wager based on whether the user wins the fantasy sports contest or a portion of the fantasy sports contest (e.g., a particular week of a season-long fantasy sports contest). In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to place a wager based on a portion of a sporting event, a sporting event, or more than one sporting event that is related to a fantasy sports contest in which the user participates. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to a contestant of a fantasy sports Major League Baseball contest the ability to place a wager based on Major League Baseball events. In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to use the fantasy sports contest to place a wager unrelated to a fantasy sports contest in which the user participates.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may display to the user information indicating a wagering opportunity that is related to a fantasy sports contest in which the user participates. In response to receiving with the fantasy sports contest application a user indication of the wagering opportunity, the wager may be accepted for the user.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may use application data to at least partially define a wagering opportunity for the user. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may use application data that indicates an account balance of the user to define a maximum wager amount for the user. The maximum wager amount for the user may also be set to an arbitrary number. The total amount of wagers by a user for a given time period may also be set (e.g, daily wagering limits). In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to at least partially define a wagering opportunity. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to a user the ability to at least partially define wagering opportunity terms such as a wagering opportunity description and to whom a wagering opportunity is directed.","Wagering opportunities of the present invention may be opportunities to wager for, for example, fantasy sports contest points (i.e., points that accumulate to increase the user's standing in the fantasy sports contest), points redeemable for prizes (i.e., cash or non-cash prizes), non-cash prizes, or money. Wagering opportunities of the present invention may have, for example, a predetermined payout schedule (e.g., the winner receiving 25 points redeemable for prizes, the winner receiving a specified percentage of the sum of all the entry fees to a wagering pool, etc.) or may be organized in a pari-mutuel approach (i.e., determining a winning wagerer's payout based on the number and disposition of other wagerers). In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to access only wagering opportunities that are valid for the user (e.g., wagering opportunities for money if wagering for money is legally permitted in the user's geographic region).","In some embodiments of the present invention, multiple fantasy sports contest leagues can be grouped together into a fantasy sports contest. A fantasy sports contest league for a particular sport may be a sub-division of a larger fantasy sports contest for that sport (e.g., multiple fantasy sports NBA Basketball contest leagues can be grouped together into a fantasy sports contest). A fantasy sports contest of the present invention may include one or more leagues all of which are for a particular sport, may include one or more leagues for multiple sports, or may not be sub-divided into leagues.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to one or more fantasy sports contestants the ability to access wagering opportunities. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to one or more fantasy sports contestants that participate in a fantasy sports contest league the ability to access intra-fantasy sports contest league (\u201cintra-league\u201d) wagering opportunities. Intra-league wagering opportunities are opportunities to wager between contestants of the same fantasy sports contest league or wagering opportunities for fantasy sports contest points between a contestant of a fantasy sports contest league and the fantasy sports contest application system.","As another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to one or more fantasy sports contestants that participate in fantasy sports contest leagues the ability to access inter-fantasy sports contest league (\u201cinter-league\u201d) wagering opportunities. Inter-league wagering opportunities are opportunities to wager between different fantasy sports contest leagues or between contestants of different fantasy sports contest leagues. Inter-league wagering opportunities need not be limited to those between leagues or contestants of the same fantasy sports contest. Still another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to one or more fantasy sports contestants the ability to access out-of-fantasy sports contest league (\u201cout-of-league\u201d) wagering opportunities.","Out-of league wagering opportunities include all other wagering opportunities that are not intra-league or inter-league wagering opportunities (e.g., traditional sports-related wagering opportunities on the outcome of a game).","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may store data for a wager of the user. The fantasy sports contest application may display to the user various wagering information including, for example, information for an outcome of a wager, information indicating the parties involved in a wager, information indicating when a wager was placed, and information indicating whether a wager has been paid.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to enable wagering related to a fantasy sports contest in which the user participates. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user an option to enable one or more of intra-league wagering, inter-league wagering, and out-of league wagering related to the fantasy sports contest. In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user alternatives to wagering for money if wagering for money is not legally permitted in the user's geographic region. In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to the user the ability to enable wagering unrelated to a fantasy sports contest in which the user participates.","Systems and methods for providing wagering opportunities in conjunction with fantasy sports contests are presented.","Fantasy sports contests of the present invention may include any suitable sports contest in which the user is given the ability to make decisions that may affect the standing of the user in the sports contest. For example, in typical team-oriented fantasy sports contests, the user may participate in the capacity of a fictional general manager. In this situation, the user may be have responsibilities such as creating a team roster (e.g., drafting players), selecting reserves, making trades, and otherwise maintaining the composition of the user's team roster. It will be understood that any other suitable decision-making capability may be given to the user in a fantasy sports contest in addition to or in place of those indicated above.","Fantasy sports contests of the present invention need not be limited or restricted in time. For example, a fantasy sports contest may last an entire season, a portion of a season, multiple seasons, a definite period of time (e.g., one month, two weeks, three days, one hour, etc.), the duration of a particular event (e.g., Wimbledon, etc.), a portion of a particular event, or any other suitable period of time.","In one suitable approach, fantasy sports contests of the present invention may include contests in which the user is not necessarily playing the role of a fictional general manager. For example, fantasy sports contests may involve the user selecting (i.e., blindly or with calculation) whether particular outcomes will occur (e.g., whether a particular golfer will make the next putt). Any such suitable decision-making may be the basis of a fantasy sports contest or a part of a fantasy sports contest.","Fantasy sports contests of the present invention may use any suitable one or more scoring systems. For example, existing fantasy scoring systems include straight point systems (e.g., points are awarded and subtracted based on real-life plays without regard to the performance of other players on other fantasy teams in a league), rotisserie systems (e.g., points are awarded based on the user's relative ranking against other users), and head-to-head systems (e.g., users in a league are matched against one another in a round-robin series of one-on-one contests during the course of a season). These are merely illustrative scoring systems. Any other suitable scoring system may be used in the fantasy sports contests of the present invention.","It will be understood that the above are merely illustrative elements of fantasy sports contests. Any other suitable arrangement or approach may be used. It will further be understood that the nature of the fantasy sports contests may vary depending on which activity or sport is involved or based on any other suitable criteria.","The present invention is primarily described herein in terms of a fantasy sports contest application. The fantasy sports contest application may be any suitable software, hardware, or both that may be used to implement the features of present invention. It will be understood that any other suitable software, hardware, or both (e.g., a wagering application) may be used in conjunction with the fantasy sports contest application or in place of the fantasy sports contest application to implement some or all of the features of the present invention.","Illustrative systems and methods for providing fantasy sports contest applications are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,918,603 (Hughes, et al.), 5,846,132 (Junkin), 5,971,854 (Junkin) and 6,193,610 (Junkin), as well as Hughes et al. U.S. patent application Ser.

In some embodiments of the present invention, statistics data source  may provide data for events that can be wagered on to server . For example, statistics data source  may provide data for sporting events, televised events, events broadcasted on radio, or any, other events that can be wagered on. Statistics data from statistics data source  may be used to, for example, determine wagering opportunities and to determine wagering outcomes.","Contest data source  may be any equipment suitable for generating, storing or otherwise providing application data including data for fantasy sports contests to server . For example, contest data source  may provide application data including a list of fantasy sports contestants of a particular fantasy sports contest league, fantasy sports contest standings, a list of available fantasy sports contest selections (e.g., sports players), or any other data for fantasy sports contests. In some embodiments of the present invention, contest data source  may provide application data specific to one or more fantasy sports contestants to server . For example, contest data source  may provide application data including fantasy sports contestant preferences (e.g., whether a contestant wishes to view wagering opportunities), a list of a fantasy sports contestant's team selections, or any other data specific to one or more fantasy sports contestants.","Wagering data source  may be any equipment suitable for generating, storing or otherwise providing application data including wagering data to server . In some embodiments of the present invention, wagering data source  may provide data for available wagering opportunities to server . For example, wagering data source  may provide data indicating events that can be wagered on. In some embodiments of the present invention, wagering data source  may provide data for wagers (i.e., wagering opportunities that have been accepted) to server . For example, wagering data source  may provide data that indicates the terms of wagers (e.g., the parties involved in a wager, an amount of a wager, a type of a wager, an outcome of a wager, other data indicating the terms of a wager, etc.). In some embodiments of the present invention, wagering data source  may provide data that indicates guidelines of acceptable wagering opportunities and wagers. For example, wagering data source  may provide data indicating a limit on the amount of an acceptable wagering opportunity or wager, types of acceptable wagering opportunities or wagers, or any other data indicating guidelines of acceptable wagering opportunities or wagers. Wagering data may also include handicapping, tote board, current track conditions, other information used in horse racing, or any other wagering odds, spreads, or betting lines used in other sports.","In the example of , data for fantasy sports contests and wagering opportunities and wagers is provided by separate data sources , ,  and . In other embodiments of the present invention, data for fantasy sports contests and wagering opportunities and wagers may provided by a single data source or any other combination of data sources.","Server  accesses or otherwise receives application data from data sources , ,  and  over communications paths , ,  and , respectively. Each of communications paths , ,  and  may be one or more satellite communications paths, fiber-optic paths, coaxial cable paths, radio frequency paths, electromagnetic communications paths, microwave communications paths, Internet paths, or any other suitable wired or wireless communications paths or combination of such paths. Communications paths , ,  and  may have sufficient bandwidth to transmit video signals.

For example, server  may define (e.g., manually via a system operator or automatically using any suitable criteria) wagering opportunities for fantasy sports contestants based on statistics data received from statistics data source  or other source of statistics data. In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may define wagering opportunities based on data input via user input device  () or other suitable user interface. In some embodiments of the present invention (i.e., in which the fantasy sports contest application is provided in an interactive television arrangement), main facility  or external information service  may define wagering opportunities for a fantasy sports contestant. For example, main facility  or external information service may define wagering opportunities based on rules data stored in data sources  and  (e.g., data indicating whether a user is permitted to wager).","User equipment (, ) may request or otherwise receive application data for various types of wagering opportunities. For example, user equipment  may receive data for various types of wagering opportunities from server , from data sources , ,  and  (e.g., each having one or more servers), and from user input device  (). As another example, user equipment  may receive data for various types of wagering opportunities from user input device  () or a server included as part of distribution equipment  or external information service . In some embodiments of the present invention, user equipment (, ) may receive application data for wagering opportunities between various parties including fantasy sports contestants who participate in various fantasy sports contest leagues. A fantasy sports contest league may be a sub-division of a fantasy sports contest, the contest comprising other fantasy sports contests (e.g., a fantasy sports NBA Basketball contest may comprise multiple individual fantasy sports NBA Basketball contest leagues and may induce fantasy competition between members of the individual different leagues). For example, in some embodiments of the present invention, user equipment (, ) may receive data for intra-fantasy sports contest league (\u201cintra-league\u201d) wagering opportunities. Intra-league wagering opportunities are opportunities to wager between contestants of the same fantasy sports contest league or wagering opportunities for fantasy sports contest points between a contestant of a fantasy sports contest league and the fantasy sports contest application system. The fantasy sports contest application may provide opportunities to view, propose, accept and otherwise manage intra-league wagering opportunities to fantasy sports contestants.","In some embodiments of the present invention, intra-league wagering opportunities may be based on one or more fantasy sports contestants' performance in a fantasy sports contest. For example, an intra-league wagering opportunity between a user who participates in a fantasy sports contest league and one or more other contestants of that fantasy sports contest league may be based on whether the user will accumulate the most fantasy sports contest points (e.g., by the conclusion of a particular week of a fantasy sports contest league, by the conclusion of the entire fantasy sports contest league, etc.). As another example, an intra-league wager between a user of a particular fantasy sports contest and the fantasy sports contest application system may be based on whether the user wins the fantasy sports contest of which the user's fantasy sports contest league is a sub-division.","In some embodiments of the present invention, intra-league wagering opportunities may be based on real-life sporting events that are related to contestants' fantasy sports contest leagues. For example, intra-league wagering opportunities between contestants of the same fantasy sports NFL football contest league may be based on NFL football events (e.g., the outcome of a particular game or group of games, the outcome of a particular quarter, the outcome of a particular possession, the outcome of a particular field goal attempt, the outcome of a televised NFL draft, etc.). As another example, intra-league wagering opportunities between a contestant of a fantasy Major League Baseball contest league and the fantasy sports contest application system may be based on real-life Major League Baseball events.","In some embodiments of the present invention, intra-league wagering opportunities may be based on real-life sporting events and other events that are unrelated to contestants' fantasy sports contest leagues. For example, intra-league wagering opportunities between contestants of the same fantasy soccer league may be based on Major League Baseball events. Intra-league wagering opportunities may be based on any other events that are unrelated to contestants' fantasy sports contests leagues and that can be wagered on such as, for example, televised events, broadcasted events, or events that are otherwise made public (e.g., the Grammy awards).","In some embodiments of the present invention, user equipment (, ) may receive data for inter-fantasy sports contest league (\u201cinter-league\u201d) wagering opportunities. Inter-league wagering opportunities are opportunities to wager between different fantasy sports contest leagues or between contestants of different fantasy sports contest leagues. The fantasy sports contest application may provide opportunities to view, propose, accept and otherwise manage inter-league wagering opportunities.","In some embodiments of the present invention, inter-league wagering opportunities may be based on one or more fantasy sports contestants' performance in a fantasy sports contest. For example, inter-league wagering opportunities between one or more contestants of a first fantasy sports contest league and one or more contestants of a second fantasy sports contest league may be based on which league will perform better in its corresponding fantasy sports contest (e.g., the first and second fantasy sports contest leagues being of the same type and sub-divisions of the same fantasy sports contest).","In some embodiments of the present invention, inter-league wagering opportunities may be based on real-life sporting events that are related to contestants' fantasy sports contest leagues. For example, inter-league wagering opportunities between a first fantasy Major League Baseball contest league and second fantasy Major League Baseball contest league may be based on real-life Major League Baseball events.","In some embodiments of the present invention, inter-league wagering opportunities may be based on events that are unrelated to contestants' fantasy sports contest leagues. For example, inter-league wagering opportunities between fantasy sports contest leagues or contestants of fantasy sports contest leagues may be based on trivia contests, televised game shows, quiz shows, or other events that are unrelated contestants' fantasy sports contest leagues.","In some embodiments of the present invention, inter-league wagering opportunities between one or more contestants of a first fantasy sports contest league and one or more contestants of a second fantasy sports contest league may be based on events that are related to only the first fantasy sports contest league. For example, inter-league wagering opportunities between a contestant of a fantasy college football contest league and a contestant of a fantasy soccer contest league may be based on real-life college football events.","In some embodiments of the present invention, user equipment (,) may receive data for out-of-fantasy sports contest league (\u201cout-of-league\u201d) wagering opportunities. Out-of-league wagering opportunities include all wagering opportunities that are not intra-league wagering opportunities and inter-league wagering opportunities. The fantasy sports contest application may provide opportunities to view, propose, accept and otherwise manage out-of-league wagering opportunities.","In some embodiments of the present invention, out-of-league wagering opportunities may be based on events that are related to contestants' fantasy sports contest leagues. For example, out-of-league wagering opportunities (e.g., wagering opportunities based on defined wagering odds or spreads) between a contestant of a fantasy sports contest league and a wagering service or a non-fantasy sports contestant (e.g., a user of the fantasy sports contest application that is not currently involved in a fantasy sports contest) may be based on events that are related to that fantasy sports contest league.","In some embodiments of the present invention, out-of-league wagering opportunities may be based on events that are unrelated to fantasy sports contest leagues. For example, out-of league wagering opportunities between a contestant of a fantasy Major League Baseball contest league and a wagering service may be based on real-life Minor League baseball events.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager for fantasy sports contest points. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to contestants of the same fantasy sports contest league (i.e., intra-league wagering opportunities) the ability to wager for fantasy sports contest points to enhance league competition and user-enjoyment. As another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to contestants of different fantasy sports contest leagues (i.e., inter-league wagering opportunities) that are competing to accumulate the most fantasy sports contest points the ability to wager for fantasy sports contest points.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager for money. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to a user who participates in a fantasy sports contest the ability to wager one or more other fantasy sports contestants for money based on the user's performance in the fantasy sports contest. As another example, because fantasy sports contestants may track closely real-life sporting events (e.g., that may be both related and unrelated to the contestants' fantasy sports contest leagues), and because the contestants may find it desirable to wager on these events, the fantasy sports contest may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager for money based on real-life sporting events.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager for prizes (i.e., non-cash prizes). For example, because wagering for money may not be legally permitted in particular geographic regions, to fantasy sports contestants of these geographical regions the ability to wager for prizes. As another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to contestants who prefer to wager for prizes the ability to wager for prizes (e.g., gift certificates, free subscriptions to the fantasy sports contest application service, a trophy, etc.).","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager for points redeemable for prizes. For example, because fantasy sports contestants (e.g., of different fantasy sports contest leagues) may live in geographical regions in which monetary currencies are different, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager for points redeemable for cash prizes to allow the contestants of the different geographical regions to better understand wagering opportunity terms (e.g., wagering opportunity amount). As another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants in geographical regions in which wagering for money is not legally permitted the ability to wager for points redeemable for non-cash prizes.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager based on outcomes of single events. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager based on an outcome of a single sporting event or a portion of a single sporting event (e.g., a winner of a baseball game, whether a particular player gets a hit during a particular at-bat in a baseball game, a winner of an automobile race, etc.). As another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager based on an outcome of a single non-sports event or a portion of a single non-sports event (e.g., the winner of the Oscar Award for \u201cBest Movie\u201d, whether a contestant in a televised game show answers a particular question correctly, etc.).","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager based on more than one event. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager based on more than one sporting event (e.g., a wagering pool for the World Series or NCAA Basketball tournament, how close a particular baseball player will come to breaking the record for longest hitting streak, etc.).","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager for a predefined wagering opportunity amount. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager on a sporting event for a predefined amount of money (e.g., $10). As another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager on a non-sports event for a predefined amount of points (e.g., 15 points) redeemable for prizes.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager based on defined odds or spreads. For example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager on a non-sports event in which the payout is determined by the number and disposition (i.e., wagering choice) of wagerers that accept the wagering opportunity (i.e., a pari-mutuel type wagering opportunity). As another example, the fantasy sports contest application may provide to fantasy sports contestants the ability to wager on a sporting event in which a certain team or player must clear a defined spread (e.g., a point spread for a basketball game, a number of strikeouts for a baseball pitcher) for a wagerer to win the wager.","The fantasy sports contest application (e.g., implemented at least partially on user equipment (, )) may change its displays and available options based on application data for fantasy sports contests and wagering opportunities and wagers.  and - show various fantasy sports contest application display screens in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.

Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration rather than of limitation, and the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 17-22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 23-25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 39"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 44"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 45-46"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 47"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIGS. 48-49"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
