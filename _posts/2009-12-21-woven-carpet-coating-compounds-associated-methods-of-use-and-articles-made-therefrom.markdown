No. 61\/139,749, filed Dec. 22, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates generally to coating compounds containing aqueous polyolefin dispersions. In particular, at least in some embodiments, the coating compounds of the present invention may be useful for coating woven carpets.","Generally speaking, woven carpets may be produced on a loom similar to how a woven cloth is produced. Coatings can be applied to either the front side or the back side of the carpet to enhance certain properties. For instance, to provide adhesive bonding, a coating compound may be applied to the carpet. Among other things, the coating compound may bond the warp and weft yarns in the woven carpet. Typical coating compounds include latex, urethane, or vinyl systems, with latex being most common. Examples of typical latexes that may be used are carboxylated styrene-butadiene (\u201cSB\u201d) or acrylate latex adhesives. Conventional latex systems are low-viscosity, aqueous compositions that can be applied at high carpet production rates. The carpet typically passes through an oven that dries the latex on the carpet. The coating compound may be applied as a single coating or layer or as a multiple layered system.","As the use of polyolefin fibers in carpets has become more popular, the use of carboxylated SB and acrylate-based latex coating compounds on a polyolefin substrate has presented challenges. This is believed to be due, at least in part, to the relative incompatibility of the apolar polyolefin fibers and the more polar polymer in the coating compound. This incompatibility is believed to result in weak associations between the fibers and the latex coating compounds. One of the practical results of this is an increased incidence of carpet fraying. When carpet is manufactured, it has a raw edge that if it is not protected will fray. Although this fraying phenomena can also be observed with naturals yarns (like jute and cotton) or relative polar polymer yarns (like nylon and polyester), most fraying occurs as a result of the combination of apolar yarns (like polypropylene and other polyolefin copolymers) and carboxylated SB- and acrylate-based latex coating compounds.","To combat these problems with latex coating compounds, polyolefin-based coating compounds have become more prevalent. Additionally, those in the art have tried to combat the fraying problems by controlling the degree of yarn coverage. The degree of yarn coverage in the woven fabric is controlled by three parameters: wetting ability, viscosity, and applied dry coat weight. Another technique to protect the edge of the carpet against fraying has involved application of a serge strip on the edge of the carpet.","The present invention relates generally to coating compounds containing aqueous polyolefin dispersions. In particular, at least in some embodiments, the coating compounds of the present invention may be useful for coating woven carpets.","An embodiment of the present invention provides a method of preparing a woven carpet comprising: applying a coating compound as an adhesive layer to the woven carpet to form a coated woven carpet, wherein the coating compound comprises: an aqueous dispersion comprising a base polymer, a stabilizing agent, and a liquid medium; and a wetting agent, wherein the base polymer comprises a polyolefin-based polymer.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a textile article: comprising a substrate; and an adhesive layer comprising a dehydration product of a coating compound comprising: an aqueous dispersion comprising a base polymer, a stabilizing agent, and a liquid medium; and a wetting agent, wherein the base polymer comprises a polyolefin-based polymer.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a woven carpet comprising: a woven substrate; and an adhesive layer comprising a dehydration product of a coating compound comprising: an aqueous dispersion comprising a base polymer, a stabilizing agent, and a liquid medium; and a wetting agent, wherein the base polymer comprises a polyolefin-based polymer.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a woven carpet comprising a woven substrate; and a coating comprising a base polymer and a wetting agent, wherein the base polymer comprises a polyolefin-based polymer.","The features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are within the spirit of the invention.","The present invention relates generally to coating compounds containing aqueous polyolefin dispersions, in particular, at least in some embodiments, the coating compounds of the present invention may be useful for coating woven carpets.","Of the many advantages of embodiments of the present invention, many of which are not mentioned or alluded to herein, is the ability to provide coating compounds and methods that should enable the production of broad loom woven carpet that is non-fraying, as well as the potential to make rugs out of these broad looms on site, eliminating the need for expensive serging of the edges. This is due at least in part to the optimized coating compounds of the present invention, which should provide sufficient yarn coverage, as well as adhesive (between yarn and coating) and cohesive (within coating) bonding to improve the fray resistance. Additionally, another potential advantage associated with embodiments of the present invention is that the coating compounds should produce a transparent non-hazy, non-tacky film on the carpet, which is desirable in that it allows strike through of flat woven carpets, or even application of a top coating instead of back coating, and can contribute to enhancement of the brightness of such carpet. Because the polymer film from the polyolefin-based dispersion generally does not contain discrete polymer particles, the typical Tyndall effect should not be present and therefore the color of the carpet should be enhanced or less dull. The Tyndall effect is the blue haze that can be observed with latex-based films. Due to absence of the Tyndall effect, he polymer film from the polyolefin-based dispersion is clear and fully transparent. It is also believed that embodiments of the coating compounds of the present invention should provide enhanced resistance to water and stains, like wine, coffee, oil, etc, to substrates on which the coating compounds are placed. Another potential advantage of the present invention is that carpets that are made using embodiments of the coating compounds of the present invention may be easily recycled into resin-based fibers, using trim and other carpet waste from the manufacturing process as well as carpets that are at the end of their serviceable lives.","Glossary of Certain Terms","All numbers disclosed herein are approximate values, regardless of whether the word \u201cabout\u201d or \u201capproximate\u201d is used in connection therewith.

latexes can improve somewhat the Pile-Fraying resistance. Polyolefin dispersions have much better resistance to Slip fraying and Pile Fraying, even at lower application weight. Carboxylated SB latex B shows more tendency to break through and shows somewhat better Pile-Fray resistance. This is believed to be predominantly caused by the lower surface tension. Sample 12a vs. 11a demonstrates that addition of wetting agent can further improve the Slip- and Pile-Fray resistance, Sample 11b vs. 11a shows the variation in properties that can be observed at equally applied wet coating weight. Sample 12b vs. 12a shows that absolute coat weight also determines final properties. Slip-, and Pile-Fray resistance have increased to the maximum qualitatively observable level as well as the dry break through have increased. The color with polyolefin coating appears rather bright than dull, as can be observed with carboxylated SB, The Tyndall effect is not present.","To provide quantitative results, a test method is developed which measured the force needed to pull out the warp yarn from the woven carpet.

At the frontside or faceside  there are the decorative, darker-colored Pile warps . The warps are bound by the pile fillings  and the base fillings . Among the warps, we can identify at the surface are the outer warp, sub-surface warp, and two inner warps. The inner warps are carrying the Pile warps. As illustrated by , the carpet  is cut such, that a 3.5 cm long outer warp is isolated, from which 1 cm is unraveled, using thin tweezers , to allow sufficient length for the tuft-lock grip. As illustrated by , the tuft-lock grip  is placed over the full free Outer Warp (OWPF) length and hung into the Tuft lock meter (not shown). Subsequently, the force to pull out the Warp is measured.
