","FIG. and FIG. ","FIG. ","FIG. "],"p":["The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC07-05ID14517, between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA).","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method and device for secure, high-density tritium bonded with carbon, preferably by irradiating an intercalated precursor into tritium bonded with carbon in a substrate.","2. Background of the Invention","There has been and continues to be a great interest in new and improved energy sources. One interest is in reliable long-term energy. For example, medical devices, long-range sensors (e.g. down-hole well sensors), extreme environment sensors (e.g. deep ocean, vacuum of space, high altitude, etc.) and long-term storage (e.g. nuclear waste monitoring), greatly depend on long-term, reliable energy sources. Radioactive sources, such as tritium, have been used as an energy source for many years. Over 50 years ago, early pacemakers used radioactive sources for long-term use. However, these devices were discontinued in favor of batteries after significant advancements in battery technology. Recent advancements in semiconductor technologies have made energy conversion from low-energy radioactive sources, such as tritium, a viable solution for high-energy electronics as well as increased efficiencies. Tritium still remains a significant health concern, unless properly secured. However, current efforts to safely secure tritium result in a low-density tritium, minimizing tritium's potential as a significant energy source. For example, in an existing solution, a tritium gas is absorbed into a porous silicon carbide substrate, which is limited by the surface area of the substrate, resulting in a low-density bulky substrate. As the resulting tritium is secured in a low-density form, it is virtually unusable for use in energy production, due to cost efficiencies, and the size of energy source. Therefore, there is a need for a device and method for the secure, high-density storage of tritium.","A method and device for producing secure, high-density tritium bonded with carbon. A substrate comprising carbon is provided. A precursor is intercalated between carbon in the substrate. The precursor intercalated in the substrate is irradiated until at least a portion of the precursor, preferably a majority of the precursor, is transmutated into tritium and bonds with carbon of the substrate forming bonded tritium, tritium bonded with carbon. The resulting bonded tritium produces electrons via beta decay. The substrate is preferably a substrate from the list of substrates consisting of highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite, carbon fibers, carbon nanotunes, buckministerfullerenes, and combinations thereof. The precursor is preferably boron-10, more preferably lithium-6. Preferably, thermal neutrons are used to irradiate the precursor. Preferably, the resulting bonded tritium is used in a long-term power source (preferably between 10 and 20 years), capable of operating under extreme environments (e.g. deep ocean, vacuum of space, high altitude, etc.) and under extreme temperatures (preferably up to 300\u00b0 F.).","A method and device for producing secure, high-density tritium bonded with carbon. A substrate comprising carbon is provided. A precursor is intercalated between carbon in the substrate. Preferably, the precursor forms a covalent bond with carbon in the substrate. The precursor intercalated in the substrate is irradiated until at least a portion of the precursor, preferably a majority of the precursor, is transmutated into tritium and bonds with carbon of the substrate forming bonded tritium, tritium bonded with carbon. Preferably, tritium forms a covalent bond with carbon in the substrate. The resulting bonded tritium produces electrons via beta decay. The substrate is preferably a substrate from the list of substrates consisting of highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite, carbon fibers, carbon nanotunes, buckministerfullerenes, and combinations thereof. The precursor is preferably boron-10, more preferably lithium-6. Preferably, thermal neutrons are used to irradiate the precursor.","Preferred embodiments also include cleaving, peeling, milling or machining micron thin sheets of the bonded tritium. The carbon structure of the resulting bonded tritium are ideal and are preferably eventually manufactured into extremely thin wafers or powders, thus minimizing internal absorption or loss of electrons emitted and maximize the amount of captured electrons.","Preferably, the resulting bonded tritium is used in long-term power source (preferably between 10 and 20 years), capable of operating under extreme environments (e.g. deep ocean, vacuum of space, high altitude, etc.) and under extreme temperatures (up to 300\u00b0 F.). In one embodiment, the bonded tritium is used to generate electricity, which is used to trickle charge a primary battery. In one embodiment, the resulting bonded tritium is positioned in electron communication with a p-n junction, whereby the electrons generated from beta decay are captured by the p-n junction and generate electricity for power generation. In another embodiment, a phosphor screen receives electrons generated from beta decay from the resulting bonded tritium and generates photons which are subsequently received by a photocell for power generation. The power density of the tritiated substrate is preferably at least 1 mW\/cc. The resulting product is a secure, high-density tritium source, which produces electrons with inert helium and graphite, two very safe bi-products. Other uses for a secure, high-density tritium source, include, but are not limited to, medical devices, research equipment, detectors, etc. Preferably, any resulting products incorporated the bonded tritium source comprises a means for venting, capturing or containing the helium bi-product.","The substrate comprises carbon. Preferably, the substrate is rigid and comprises ample space for loading of the precursor. Preferably, the substrate has a thickness sufficient to contain the resulting nuclear reaction during irradiation, depending on various factors, for example substrate material, neutron energy, etc. The substrate is positioned to provide at least the majority of neutrons passing through the thickness of the substrate. Some matrix damage to the substrate during irradiation is expected, for example from the recoil event and ionization pathway, but these defects or vacancies become additional sites for tritium to bond with carbon within the substrate.","In one embodiment, the substrate is preferably a large size for ease of handling during production, for example 10\u00d710\u00d71 mm. Preferably, the substrate is carbon in a graphite form, due to graphite's resistance to damage from neutron flux. More preferably the substrate is highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), carbon fibers, carbon nanotunes, buckministerfullerenes, or combinations thereof.","In a preferred embodiment, the substrate is highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG); and atoms of the precursor are located in the interplanar space between the graphene layers and individually spaced under the graphene rings of the substrate. HOPG is graphite with an angular spread between the graphite sheets of less than 1 degree. HOPG is preferred, as the carbon in the HOPG has a low probability of undesired reaction within a thermal neutron flux.","The precursor is any one or more elements that when irradiated form tritium. Preferably, the precursor is lithium, boron, and combinations thereof. More preferably, the precursor is lithium-6, boron-10, and combinations thereof. Preferably, the precursor forms a covalent bond with carbon in the substrate. Preferably, the precursor is a single element or composition to provide uniformity in the final bonded tritium and to allow for an optimized irradiation for just the single element or composition. Preferably, the precursor is lithium-6 and bonds with carbon in the substrate forming at least a portion of, preferably at least a majority of LiC, due to its relative ease in transmutation to tritium. Preferably, the forming of LiCwithin the substrate is maximized, due to LiCfavorable conversion to tritium. A lithium-6 precursor bonded, preferably covalently bonded, with carbon in the substrate may form various other stoicheiometries with any number of lithiums, for example forming LiC, depending on various factors such as the length of exposure of the substrate to Li, temperature during exposure, etc.","The precursor is intercalated with carbon in the substrate, whereby the precursor is positioned between at least two carbon atoms of the substrate. In a preferred embodiment, the substrate is highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG); and the precursor is intercalated with carbon in the substrate, whereby the atoms of the precursor are located in the interplanar space between the graphene layers and individually spaced under the graphene rings of the substrate. The precursor may be intercalated using various methods, for example the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,604,276 and 4,388,227, hereby fully incorporated by reference. In a preferred embodiment the substrate is completely immersed in molten precursor, preferably molten Li-6 metal. Preferably, the substrate is completely immersed in the molten precursor for less than 8 hours, preferably under a dry argon atmosphere (e.g. glove box). This embodiment is preferred as it is cleaner than the other methods, for example electrochemical intercalation.","Preferably, the precursor is irradiated with thermal neutrons. Preferably, the precursor is irradiated for a time optimized to transmutate at least a portion, preferably a majority, of the precursor to tritium. Preferably, the precursor is exposed to thermal neutrons for one to five months, depending on various factors, for example, neutron flux, substrate material, substrate thickness, etc.","The neutron source generates neutrons, preferably thermal neutrons. In a preferred embodiment, the neutron source is a nuclear reactor, preferably a thermal reactor. In one embodiment, the neutron source is a compact neutron source, for example as described in Ser. No. 12\/303,851, hereby fully incorporated by reference. Preferably, the neutron source is optimized for a high thermal neutron flux. It is estimated that in a thermal reactor, about 10% of a precursor made of Li-6 will be converted in 16 days, about 30% of a precursor made of Li-6 will be converted in 55 days, and about 50% of a precursor made of Li-6 will be converted in 107 days.","For example, the irradiation of Li-6 into tritium will be governed by the following equation 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msup":{"mi":"N","msup":{"mi":"H","mn":"3"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msup":{"mi":"N","mrow":{"mi":"Li","mo":"-","mn":"6"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"N","mrow":{"mi":"Li","mo":"-","mn":"6"}},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":"\u2205\u03c3","mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":[",","\u221d"]}},{"mi":"Li","mo":"-","mn":"6"}]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":["H",{"sup2":"3 "},"Li-6 ","Li-6 ","Li-6"],"sub":"(n,\u221d)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"N","msup":{"mi":"H","mn":"3"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"N","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"o","mrow":{"mi":"Li","mo":"-","mn":"6"}}},{"mi":["N","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","*","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":[{"mi":"o","mrow":{"mi":"Li","mo":"-","mn":"6"}},{"mi":"\u2147","mo":"-"}],"msubsup":{"mi":"\u2205\u03c3","mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":[",","\u221d"]}},{"mi":"Li","mo":"-","mn":"6"}]}}],"mo":"-"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":["H",{"sup2":"3 "},"Li-6 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"msubsup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":[",","\u221d"]}},{"mi":"Li","mo":"-","mn":"6"}]}}},"br":{},"sup":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","3","5","5","3","1","5","7","9","5"]},"In a preferred embodiment, the substrate  is HOPG and is intercalated with a precursor  made of Li-6 and subsequently irradiated with neutrons , preferably thermal neutrons, from the neutron source .
