title: Synthesis of tetracyclines and intermediates thereto
abstract: The tetracycline class of antibiotics has played a major role in the treatment of infectious diseases for the past 50 years. However, the increased use of the tetracyclines in human and veterinary medicine has led to resistance among many organisms previously thought susceptible to tetracycline antibiotics. The recent development of a modular synthesis of tetracycline analogs through a chiral enone intermediate has allowed for the efficient synthesis of novel tetracycline analogs never prepared before. The present invention provides more efficient routes for preparing the enone intermediate and allows for substituents at positions 4a, 5, 5a, and 12a of the tetracycline ring system.

New York, 1978). The total production of tetracyclines by fermentation or semi-synthesis is measured in the thousands of metric tons per year. The first tetracycline, chlorotetracycline (1) (AUREOMYCIN\u2122), was isolated from the soil bacterium by Lederle Laboratories (Wyeth-Ayerst Research) in 1945 (Duggar, 51:177-181, 1948; Duggar, Aureomycin and Preparation of Some, U.S. Pat. No. 2,482,055, 1949; incorporated herein by reference). Oxytetracycline (2) was isolated soon after from by scientists at Pfizer Laboratories (Finlay et al., 111:85, 1950). The structures of chlorotetracycline and oxytetracycline were elucidated by scientists at Pfizer in collaboration with R. B. Woodward and co-workers at Harvard University (Hochstein et al., 74:3708-3709, 1952; Hochstein et al., 75:5455-75, 1953; Stephens et al., 74:4976-77, 1952; Stephens et al., 76:3568-75, 1954). Tetracycline (3) was later prepared by the hydrogenolysis of chlorotetracycline and was found to retain the antimicrobial activity of chlorotetracycline and oxytetracycline and had increased stability (Boothe et al. 75:4621, 1953; Conover et al. 75:4622-23, 1953). Tetracycline was later found to be a natural product of , and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"118.87mm","wi":"66.63mm","file":"US09073829-20150707-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The primary tetracyclines of clinical importance today include tetracycline (3) (Boothe et al., 75:4621, 1953), oxytetracycline (2, TERRAMYCIN\u2122) (Finlay et al., 111:85, 1950), (\u2212)-doxycycline (Stephens et al., 85:2643, 1963), (\u2212)-minocycline (Martell et al., 10:44, 1967; Martell et al., 10:359, 1967), and tigecycline. The tetracyclines exert their antimicrobial activity by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis (Bentley and O'Hanlon, Eds., --The Royal Society of Chemistry: Cambridge, UK, 1997). Most tetracyclines are bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal (Rasmussen et al., 35:2306-11, 1991; Primrose and Wardlaw, Ed. \u201cThe Bacteriostatic and Bacteriocidal Action of Antibiotics\u201d Society for General Microbiology, Academic Press Ltd., London, 1982). It has been proposed that after tetracycline passes through the cytoplasmic membrane of a bacterium it chelates Mg, and this tetracycline-Mgcomplex binds the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome (Goldman et al., 22:359-368, 1983). Binding of the complex to the ribosome inhibits the binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis (Wissmann et al., 292-99, 1998; Epe et al., 3:121-26, 1984). Tetracyclines have also been found to bind to the 40S subunit of eukaryotic ribosome; however, they do not achieve sufficient concentrations in eukaryotic cells to affect protein synthesis because they are not actively transported in eukaryotic cells (Epe et al., 213:443-47, 1987).","Structure-activity relationships for the tetracycline antibiotics have been determined empirically from 50 years of semi-synthetic modification of the parent structure (Sum et al., 4:119-32, 1998). Permutations of the upper left-hand portion of the natural product, also known as the hydrophobic domain, have provided new therapeutically active agents, while modifications of the polar hydrophobic domain result in a loss of activity. However, semi-synthesis by its very nature has limited the number of tetracycline analogs that can be prepared and studied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"35.73mm","wi":"65.87mm","file":"US09073829-20150707-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The tetracyclines are composed of four linearly fused six-membered rings with a high density of polar functionality and stereochemical complexity. Previous approaches to the synthesis of tetracyclines typically proceeded via a stepwise assembly of the tetracyclic ring system. In 1962, Woodward and co-workers reported the first total synthesis of racemic 6-desmethyl-6-deoxytetracycline (sancycline, 4), the simplest biologically active tetracycline (Conover et al., 84:3222-24, 1962). The synthetic route was a remarkable achievement for the time and proceeded by the stepwise construction of the rings in a linear sequence of 22 steps (overall yield \u02dc0.003%). The first enantioselective synthesis of (\u2212)-tetracycline (3) from the A-ring precursor D-glucosamine (34 steps, 0.002% overall yield) was reported by Tatsuda and co-workers in 2000 (Tatsuta et al., 646-47, 2000). Other approaches to the synthesis of tetracycline antibiotics, which have also proceeded by the stepwise assembly of the ABCD ring system beginning with D or CD precursors, include the Shemyakin synthesis of (\u00b1)-12a-deoxy-5a,6-anhydrotetracycline (Gurevich et al., 8:131, 1967; incorporated herein by reference) and the Muxfeldt synthesis of (\u00b1)-5-oxytetracycline (terramycin, 22 steps, 0.06% yield) (Muxfeldt et al., 101:689, 1979; incorporated herein by reference).

The new synthetic approach to the enone intermediate is particularly useful in preparing 6-deoxytetracyclines. The new synthetic methodology and intermediates are also useful in preparing 6-hydroxytetracyclines, pentacyclines, hexacyclines, C5-substituted tetracyclines, C5-unsubstituted tetracyclines, C5a-substituted tetracyclines, C4a-substituted tetracyclines, C12a-substituted tetracyclines, tetracyclines with heterocyclic b-rings, and other tetracycline analogs. Such structures may include R, R, and Rsubstituents, wherein one or more of the following conditions are met: i) Ris not hydroxyl or a protected hydroxyl; ii) Ris not hydrogen; and iii) Ris not hydrogen. As would be appreciated by one of skill in this art, the new synthesis of enone VII is also useful in preparing other organic compounds which may or may not be related to tetracyclines.","Some of the broad classes of compounds available through these new approaches and considered to be a part of the present invention include tetracyclines and various analogs with substituents at positions 4a, 5, 5a, and\/or 12a of the tetracycline ring system, wherein substituents at the 12a (R) position is not \u2014OR, or substituents at the 5a (R) and 4a (R) positions are not simultaneously hydrogen. Important subclasses of tetracyclines include 6-deoxytetracyclines with or without a C5-hydroxyl group, and 6-hydroxytetracyclines with or without a C5-hydroxyl group. Many of the analogs available through these new approaches have never been synthesized before given the limitations of semi-synthetic approaches and earlier total syntheses. For example, certain substitutions about the D-ring become accessible using the present invention's novel methodologies. In certain classes of compounds of the invention, the D-ring of the tetracyclines analog, which is usually a phenyl ring, is replaced with a heterocyclic moiety, which may be bicyclic or tricyclic. In other classes, the D-ring is replaced with a non-aromatic ring. The size of the D-ring is also not limited to six-membered rings, but instead it may be three-membered, four-membered, five-membered, seven-membered, or larger. In the case of pentacyclines, the five rings may or may not be linear in arrangement. Each of the D- and E-rings may be heterocyclic or carbocyclic, may be aromatic or non-aromatic, and may contain any number of atoms ranging from three to ten atoms. In addition, higher cyclines such as hexacyclines may be prepared. In certain classes, the C-ring may not be fully formed, leading to dicyclines with the A-B fused ring system intact. The compounds of the invention include isomers, stereoisomers, enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, protected forms, pro-drugs, salts, and derivatives of any particular compound.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00012","num":"00012"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00012","he":"202.69mm","wi":"64.94mm","file":"US09073829-20150707-C00012.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In certain embodiments, the invention provides several basic approaches to the synthesis of tetracycline analogs using the synthesis described herein for preparing the enone intermediate. The first approach to preparing tetracycline analogs involves reaction of the enone with an anion formed by the deprotonation of a toluate or metalation of a benzylic halide. The deprotonation of a toluate is particularly useful in preparing 6-deoxytetracyclines with or without a C5-substituent. The metalation (e.g., metal-halogen exchange (e.g., lithium-halogen exchange), metal-metalloid exchange (e.g., lithium-metalloid exchange) is particularly useful in preparing 6-deoxytetracyclines with or without a C5-substituent as well as pentacyclines. The second approach to preparing tetracycline analogs involves reacting the enone intermediate, as prepared by the inventive methodology, in a Diels-Alder-type reaction with a diene or a benzocyclobutenol. In both of these approaches, the chiral enone provides the functionalized A and B rings of the tetracycline core, and the D-ring is derived from the toluate, benzylic halide, or benzocyclobutenol. In bringing these two portions of the molecule together the C-ring is formed. In certain embodiments, the C-ring is formed in a stereoselective manner. These approaches not only allow for the stereoselective and efficient synthesis of a wide variety of tetracycline analogs, but they also allow for the efficient preparation of tetracycline analogs in which the D-ring is replaced with a heterocycle, 5-membered ring, or other ring system. They also allow the prepartion of various pentacyclines or higher cyclines containing aromatic and non-aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles. These approaches also allow for the preparation of various tricyclines.","In certain embodiments, the inventive intermediates (e.g., enone, derivatives of enone, dicyclines) have biological activity. For example, an intermediate may possess anti-microbial or anti-proliferative activity. In another aspect, the present invention provides methods of treatment and pharmaceutical compositions including the novel compounds of the present invention. The pharmaceutical compositions may optionally include a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The methods and pharmaceutical compositions may be used to treat any infection including cholera, influenza, bronchitis, acne, malaria, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases including syphilis and gonorrhea, Legionnaires' disease, Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever, typhus, bubonic plague, gas gangrene, hospital acquired infections, leptospirosis, whooping cough, and anthrax. In certain embodiments, the infections are caused by tetracycline-resistant organisms. In certain instances, the compounds of the invention exhibit anti-neoplastic or anti-proliferative activity, in which case the compounds may be useful in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and diabetic retinopathy. The methods and compositions may be used to treat disease in humans and other animals including domesticated animals. Any mode of administration including oral and parenteral administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inventive compound may be used.","In some embodiments, tetracycline analogs having non-hydrogen substituents at position C4a and\/or C12a have reduced metabolism or phototransformation to B-ring quinone derivatives as compared to known tetracyclines. A reduction in this undesired chemistry may reduce photosensitivity and teeth-staining properties of tetracycline analogs.","Given the versatility and efficiency of the synthesis of tetracycline analogs using enone VII as an intermediate, the present invention represents an improvement in the overall synthetic approach to tetracycline analogs. The present invention allows for the preparation of tetracycline analogs in higher yields than previously attainable and allows for the synthesis of novel tetracycline analogs that were previously inaccessible. The new synthetic approach to the enone intermediate also makes the synthesis of tetracycline analogs more amenable to large-scale production given its improved overall yield. In some embodiments, the present invention provides new synthetic methods to enones of formula VII, new intermediates to enones of formula VII, and\/or new tetracycline analogs and the synthesis of the same from enones of formula VII.","Definitions of specific functional groups and chemical terms are described in more detail below. For purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, 75Ed., inside cover, and specific functional groups are generally defined as described therein.

Smith and Jerry March, Wiley-Interscience, 6edition: Jan. 16, 2007, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","It should be understood that any atom described herein includes all isotope forms of that atom. For example, \u2014H may be \u2014H, \u2014H (-D), \u2014H, etc. Accordingly, the structures described herein include all isotopologues thereof.","Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The present invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, ()-isomers, ()-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.","Isomeric mixtures containing any of a variety of isomer ratios may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. For example, where only two isomers are combined, mixtures containing 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, 80:20, 90:10, 95:5, 96:4, 97:3, 98:2, 99:1, or 100:0 isomer ratios are all contemplated by the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that analogous ratios are contemplated for more complex isomer mixtures.","If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers.","One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the synthetic methods, as described herein, utilize a variety of protecting groups. By the term \u201cprotecting group\u201d, as used herein, it is meant that a particular functional moiety, e.g., O, S, or N, is temporarily blocked so that a reaction can be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a multifunctional compound. In preferred embodiments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to give a protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions; the protecting group should be selectively removable in good yield by readily available, preferably non-toxic reagents that do not attack the other functional groups; the protecting group forms an easily separable derivative (more preferably without the generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group has a minimum of additional functionality to avoid further sites of reaction.

In other embodiments, the compounds show cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against neoplastic cells such as cancer cells. In yet other embodiments, the compounds inhibit the growth of or kill rapidly dividing cells such as stimulated inflammatory cells.","As discussed above, the present invention provides novel compounds having antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity, and thus the inventive compounds are useful for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions including infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and diabetic retinopathy. Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions are provided, wherein these compositions comprise any one of the compounds as described herein, and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g., another antimicrobial agent or another antiproliferative agent. In other embodiments, these compositions further comprise an antiinflammatory agent such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc., pain reliever, or anti-pyretic.","It will also be appreciated that certain compounds of the present invention can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or any other adduct or derivative which upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof, e.g., a prodrug.","As used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in 66: 1-19, 1977; incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or separately by reacting the free base functionality with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hernisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate, and aryl sulfonate.","Additionally, as used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable ester\u201d refers to esters which hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters include formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates. In certain embodiments, the esters are cleaved by enzymes such as esterases.","Furthermore, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs\u201d as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","As described above, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicles, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's , Fifteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1975) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the anti-cancer compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; CREMOPHOR\u2122 (polyethoxylated castor oil); SOLUTOL\u00ae (Kolliphor); excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.","Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutical Compositions","The invention further provides a method of treating infections and inhibiting tumor growth. The method involves the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof to a subject (including, but not limited to a human or animal) in need of it.","The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be used in treating or preventing any disease or conditions including infections (e.g., skin infections, GI infection, urinary tract infections, genito-urinary infections, systemic infections), proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to animals, preferably mammals (e.g., domesticated animals, cats, dogs, mice, rats), and more preferably humans. Any method of administration may be used to deliver the compound of pharmaceutical compositions to the animal. In certain embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered orally. In other embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered parenterally.","In yet another aspect, according to the methods of treatment of the present invention, bacteria are killed, or their growth is inhibited, by contacting the bacteria with an inventive compound or composition, as described herein. Thus, in still another aspect of the invention, a method for the treatment of infection is provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inventive compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition is that amount effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria. The compounds and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular compound, its mode of administration, its mode of activity, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.","Furthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels sufficient to deliver from about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg, from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 40 mg\/kg, preferably from about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 30 mg\/kg, from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, and more preferably from about 1 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. The desired dosage may be delivered three times a day, two times a day, once a day, every other day, every third day, every week, every two weeks, every three weeks, or every four weeks. In certain embodiments, the desired dosage may be delivered using multiple administrations (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or more administrations).","Liquid dosage forms for oral and parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, the compounds of the invention are mixed with solubilizing agents such as CREMOPHOR\u2122 (polyethoxylated castor oil), alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and combinations thereof.","Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.","The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.","In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.","Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.","Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and\/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.","Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.","The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.","Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.","It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and\/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another anticancer agent), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).","In still another aspect, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, and in certain embodiments, includes an additional approved therapeutic agent for use as a combination therapy. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceutical products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","These and other aspects of the present invention will be further appreciated upon consideration of the following Examples, which are intended to illustrate certain particular embodiments of the invention but are not intended to limit its scope, as defined by the claims.","All reactions were performed in flame-dried round bottomed or modified Schlenk (Kjeldahl shape) flasks fitted with rubber septa under a positive pressure of argon, unless otherwise noted. Air- and moisture-sensitive liquids and solutions were transferred via syringe or stainless steel cannula. Where necessary (so noted), solutions were deoxygenated by alternative freeze (liquid nitrogen)\/evacuation\/thaw cycles (\u2267three iterations). Organic solutions were concentrated by rotary evaporation at \u02dc25 Torr (house vacuum).

Enedione 1 was prepared in >100 g batches according to the procedure in Oda, et al., (1996) 73: 253-261. The reaction mixture was stirred at 23\u00b0 C. until enedione 1 completely dissolved, whereupon cerium trichloride heptahydrate (214 g, 574 mmol, 2 equiv) was added and the resulting slurry was stirred for 1 h at 23\u00b0 C.

Sodium borohydride (13.6 g, 359 mmol, 1.23 equiv) was added to the cold reaction solution at a rate such that the internal temperature remained below 8\u00b0 C. (addition over \u02dc1.5 h, CAUTION\u2014EVOLUTION OF HYDROGEN GAS). The resulting slurry was stirred for 30 min at 5-8\u00b0 C., then saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (1 L) was added over the course of 30 min. The reaction flask was removed from the cooling bath and allowed to warm to 23\u00b0 C. The homogeneous product mixture was partitioned between half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (1 L) and ethyl acetate (1 L). The layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with two 1-L portions of ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined and the combined solution was dried over sodium sulfate.

Fifty \u03bcL of the mixture in well 2 was removed and added to well 3 and mixed as above. Serial dilutions were continued in the same manner through well 12. Fifty \u03bcL was removed from well 12 so that all contained 50 \u03bcL. Fifty \u03bcL of the working inoculum was then added to all test wells.
