{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/225,335, filed Sep. 18, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,992,936, which was the National Stage of International Application No. PCT\/IB07\/00745, filed Mar. 22, 2007, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates to a seat which comprises an underframe and a seat element, the seat element comprising a front seat part, a rear seat part, a lower backrest part and an upper backrest part.","DE 42 35 691 C2 describes a seat in which the seat is to be automatically adapted to the body weight of the particular user. A drawback of seats of this type is the enormous constructional complexity which leads to high costs and to the seat being heavy.","The invention is based on the object of developing a seat, in which, in order to provide basic compensation for different body weights of the individuals using the seat, the use of a weighing device in the sense of a complex mechanism, in which movements are used to automatically change spring forces or spring characteristics, is to be omitted.","This object is achieved, for example and without limitation, by the features of Claim . Advantageous and expedient developments are provided in the subclaims.","The seat according to the invention has a front seat part, a rear seat part, a lower backrest part and an upper backrest part, which comprise at least one supporting arm, the supporting arm being composed of at least one upper support and at least one lower support, the upper support being guided in a region A of the front seat part by at least one guide element, the upper support and the lower support being connected to each other in a region D of the upper backrest part, the upper support and the lower support having an arcuate profile in the region B of the rear seat part and in the region C of the lower backrest part, the upper support and the lower support being positioned with respect to each other in the region B of the rear seat part or in the region C of the lower backrest part by at least one connecting link, and the front seat part being able to be pulled back by the upper support with a pulling-back movement directed towards the backrest parts C, D if, when the backrest part is loaded by an individual leaning against it, the seat element is displaced from a basic position I into a resting position II. By this means, a movement by means of which the seat part is actively pulled back can be produced by the seat element. The active displacement or deformation of the seat element makes it possible to influence the position of an individual sitting on the seat relative to the underframe of the seat and, by this means, to counteract the loss of potential energy when the individual leans back into the resting position II. This compensation takes place in order to keep the restoring force, which has to be applied by the backrest part to comfortably move the individual from the resting position II into the basic position I, low or to make it entirely superfluous. The core of the invention is a seat with at least one supporting arm by means of which an active movement of the front seat part can be produced by a largely defined change in shape.","Furthermore, the invention makes provision, by means of the pulling-back movement, to bring about a movement of the front seat part or of the upper support with a horizontal component or a vertical, upwardly directed component. By means of the movement of the front seat part upwards and in the direction of the backrest part, it is possible, as an individual sitting on the seat leans back, to raise his lower body gently from the basic position I into the resting position II or into any intermediate position by means of the front seat part. By this means, a loss of potential energy due to the lowering of the upper body of the individual can be compensated for by the backrest part. The opposed movements of the seat part and of the backrest part permit a seesaw movement or rocking movement, similar to a seesaw or a beam-balance, of the individual on the seat, which movement can take place very substantially independently of the individual's body weight. A presetting of a spring that is dependent on the body weight of the individual using the seat can therefore be basically or very substantially omitted, since the deformation of the seat element brings about a compensation which is independent of the body weight. That is to say, each individual using the seat forms a counterweight as a function of the body weight with a proportion of the body weight itself and thereby brings about intrinsic compensation.","According to the invention, elastic deformability of the supporting arm or of the upper support and\/or of the lower support is provided at least in the region B of the rear seat part and in the region C of the lower backrest part. This makes it possible to change a radius of curvature of the supports and therefore also a relative movement between the two supports, by means of which the front seat part can then also be moved.","According to the invention, the guide element, which guides the upper support in the region of the front seat part on the lower support or on the underframe, is essentially designed as a lever arm which is fastened rotatably to the upper support and rotatably to the lower support or to the underframe. This makes it possible, using simple means, to define a movement on a circular path, which movement has a horizontally directed component and a component directed vertically upwards during a movement from the basic position I into the resting position II.","Alternatively, the invention makes provision to design the guide element as a slotted-guide mechanism in which the upper support is movable in the region of the front seat part relative to the lower support or to the underframe. In the case of a slotted-guide mechanism, a curve on which the front seat part or the upper support moves can be very substantially freely selected. By this means, a complicated coupling mechanism for defining a curve for the movement of the upper support can be omitted.","According to a first variant embodiment, as the connecting link or mechanical connecting link between the upper support and the lower support, the invention provides a lever which is connected rotatably in each case to the upper support and the lower support. This makes it possible to define the profile of a relative movement executed by the two supports during the transition from the basic position I into the resting position II, with the supports being pulled towards each other or pushed apart from each other during their opposed displacement depending on the positioning of the bearing points of the lever. Instead of a lever which is mounted by means of bolts, use of clasps or clips is also provided.","According to a second variant embodiment, the invention makes provision to form the connecting link between the upper support and the lower support by at least one slotted-guide mechanism. It is possible to define, by means of a connecting link of this type, any desired curves on which the supports move during corresponding loading.","According to a third variant embodiment, the invention makes provision to form the connecting link between the upper support and the lower support by an elastic element. This makes it possible to reduce the elastic deformation of the upper and\/or lower support, since the bearing element used as the bearing can also be deformed and therefore can store energy. In particular, a rubber block which is adhesively bonded to the supports is provided as the bearing.","The invention provides an energy store which, in particular, is adjustable. By this means, for example, particular seat loads caused, for example, by the body build of individuals using the seat can be compensated for.","The invention provides, as energy store, for example, a spring element counter to which the upper support can be pulled back in the direction of the backrest part. A spring element of this type can be realized with little outlay and requires little construction space.","The invention also provides a guided rocking movement of the seat element on the underframe, with there being approximately an equilibrium of forces between the seat part and the backrest part in every seat position between the basic position I and the resting position II. By this means, the function of the seat is largely independent of the body weight of an individual using the seat.","Furthermore, the invention makes provision to fasten the lower support of the supporting arm to the underframe. By this means, the upper support of the supporting arm obtains the required degrees of freedom in order, despite the guide element, despite the at least one connecting link and despite the connection to the lower support in the region of the upper backrest part, to compensate for the shifting of the weight of an individual using the seat.","The invention also provides an L-shaped profile of the supporting arm or of the supports of the supporting arm in the side view of the seat. This makes it possible to use the supporting arm as a supporting component of the seat element and to use it both to control the sequence of movement of the seat element and to form the seat part itself. In principle, every supporting arm is designed as an arcuate clamp which has two legs running next to each other and at a distance from each other, the legs forming the supports. Between a clamp head, in which the two legs are connected to each other or merge one into the other, and free ends of the legs, the legs are connected by at least one connecting link. The free end of the upper leg of the clamp, which end forms the seat surface or bears the latter, is guided on the lower leg or on the underframe by a guide element.","According to the invention, in the basic position I and in the resting position II, an upper pivotal point of the guide element is located higher than a lower pivotal point of the guide element, the upper pivotal point being at a greater distance from the backrest part than the lower pivotal point. This defines a movement clearance of the front seat part, in which the front seat part rises continuously from the basic position I into the resting position II and moves continuously in the direction of the backrest.","According to the invention, during a loading of the seat element by a person leaning back against the backrest part, the connecting link is rotatable by the supports and is displaceable with the latter. The connecting link therefore constitutes a connection between the supports, which connection permits the supports or the supporting arm to have a delimited movement.","A variant embodiment of the invention provides a seat in which the supporting arm is formed by a left, upper support and a right, upper support and a lower support situated between them, the lower support being connected to the left, upper support by at least one mechanical connecting link, and the lower support being connected to the right, upper support by at least one mechanical connecting link. By this means, with just one supporting arm, a seat or a seat element can be brought about, in which a supporting arm suffices in order to carry a covering which serves as the seat surface and backrest.","Furthermore, in the case of a supporting arm with two upper supports, the invention provides an upwardly directed limb of the lower support, which limb is divided into two struts and merges by means of the latter into upwardly directed limbs of the upper supports. Such a transition of the lower support into the upper supports changes a torsional rigidity of the seat element and is suitable for a single-piece design of the supporting arm.","The invention also makes provision, in the case of a supporting arm with two upper supports, to guide the upper supports on the lower support or on the underframe by means of a respective guide element. The use of two guide elements enables the divided upper support also to be guided along a desired curve.","According to the invention, the front seat part can be raised by deformation of the supporting arm, which is necessitated by an individual leaning back against the backrest part, along a path in the direction of the backrest part, with the supporting arm deformed in such a manner resuming its original shape by load alleviation of the backrest part, and with the front seat part being lowered again along the path mentioned during the re-forming. The lowering of the front seat part makes it easier for the individual to return into an upright sitting position.","Finally, the invention makes provision to connect the upper support and the lower support of the supporting arm in the region of the lower backrest part by at least one connecting link and to connect them in the region of the rear seat part by at least one connecting link. By this means, buckling of the supports during the deformation between the basic position I and the resting position II can be effectively prevented.","In particular, it is also provided to connect a central section of the upper support of the supporting arm and a central section of the lower support of the supporting arm to each other by at least three connecting links. By this means, the forces occurring during the deformation of the supporting arm between the basic position I and the resting position II can be distributed particularly uniformly to the supports. This distribution of the load leads to an increase of the service life of the supporting arm.","Further details of the invention are described in the drawing with reference to schematically illustrated exemplary embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1"],"i":["a ","a ","b","a ","b","a ","a ","b","b ","b","b","a","a ","b ","a ","a ","b ","a ","b","a","b ","b ","a","b ","b ","a","a","b ","a","b ","a ","b ","a ","b "],"b":["1","1","2","3","2","4","4","4","2","5","5","5","2","6","7","6","7","6","7","8","6","7","6","7","1","1","6","6","4","6","9","9","10","91","92","6","6","7","6","6","6","5","6","6","11","4","5","6","6","6","6","12","12","13","6","6","121","122","3","14","6","7","2","14","1","1","1","1","5"]},"In one embodiment, the upper support , has a cross sectional area of 1 inchand a moment of inertia of 0.005000 inchin the sections B and C.

In this connection, the guide element , which is designed as a spoke , is situated in all possible positions between 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock between the basic position I and the resting position II. The angle W taken up in this case by the guide element  changes from 32\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 and therefore increases by \u03b2=14\u00b0 (also see ). During the rotation, the guide element  raises the upper support or the region A of the front seat part at a pivotal point or elastic region D. In the elastic region D, the guide element  merges into the upper support . Upon rotation of the elastic region  on an arcuate path K, the region A is raised upwards by a distance H in an arrow direction y and is displaced to the right by a distance L in an arrow direction x (see ). This movement can be described by a type of rocking movement of the supporting arm  at a rocking point or rocking region WP. The rocking region here is arranged approximately wherever the lower support of the supporting arm  leaves the transverse support  as a cantilever or wherever elastic deformation of the lower support is possible. The supporting arm  is bent up in particular as a result of loading of a region D of an upper backrest part . The upper support here, as it is bent up from the lower support , is pulled rearwards and downwards in the arrow direction x and an arrow direction y\u2032. During this bending-up movement, the upper support is guided by the guide element  and by the connecting links  on the lower support on a multiplicity of paths K and K. As an individual leans back, this pulling-back action of the upper support causes the upper support to be raised on the left from a point P and causes the upper support to be lowered on the right from the point P. Therefore, during the movement into the position II, the seat part  is raised and, at the same time, the backrest part  is lowered. During the transition from the basic position I into the resting position II, the connecting links  all rotate to the right in the arrow direction w about pivotal points or elastic regions D on the lower support . In the process, the elastic regions D also change their position by the lower support being bent up.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1","2","6","6","6","6","6","2","6","3","1","1","2"],"i":["a ","b","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1","2","6","6","6","26","26","6","6","6","6","3","1"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","a","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["2","1","2","6","28","29","30","6","6","6","6","6","6","12","6","12","6","6","31","32","33","6","33","33","34","35","6","6","6","6","6","6","36","6","37","9","38","6","39","6"],"i":["a","a","b ","b ","a ","a","a ","a","b ","a","b ","a","a","a ","a","b ","b ","a ","a\u2032.
