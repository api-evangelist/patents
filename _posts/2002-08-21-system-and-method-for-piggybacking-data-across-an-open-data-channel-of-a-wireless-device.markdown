{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["I. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to computer networks and communications across computer networks. More particularly, the invention relates to the utilization of an idle open data channel by the device resources of a wireless device to communicate across a wireless network.","II. Description of the Related Art","Wireless computer devices that communicate data, typically in the form of packets, across a wireless or partially wireless computer network open a \u201cdata\u201d or \u201ccommunication\u201d channel on the network such that the device can send and receive data packets. The computer devices often have computer device resources, such as programs and hardware components, which individually use open communication connections to transmit and receive data on the network. In existing networked computers, such as personal computers that connect through an Ethernet or other LAN, the device resources are polled when an open communication channel is present to see if the resource needs to send or receive data at that time. If the device resources do not need the open channel, then the device closes the open channel and simply reopens the channel if a device resource requires communication. Because the communication channel on the LAN is inexpensive to establish and utilize, the establishment of channels is transparent to the user.","However, a problem arises when a network communication channel between devices is expensive to establish, such as in a wireless network between wireless devices. One example of network having expensive communication channels is a cellular telecommunication network between cellular devices where every second of connectivity has an appreciable cost to the user. Cellular telecommunication devices have in many instances full computer functionality and device resources that need to communicate across the wireless network, and the device resources will communicate packets when an open communication channel is present, in a similar manner to a common Ethernet or LAN. However, conversely to a wire-based LAN, if a cellular telecommunication device resource needs to communicate across the network, it is not as desirous to establish a communication channel anew on the cellular network because such connection will effect a per second airtime charge. The cellular telecommunication device must therefore either open an expensive communication channel if the device resource communication requirement is sufficiently vital to offset the cost of doing so, or the device resource will simply wait until the user opens a communication channel intentionally and then communicate across the open channel prior to its closure.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method that allows device resources to more efficiently use expensive bandwidth in network. The system and method should not cause interruption of other device functionality and other device resources that have priority in utilizing the open communication channel. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method to transmit data from device resources through expensive communication channels on a network that the present invention is primarily directed.","The present invention is a system, method, and computer program for transmitting data from the device resources of a wireless device across an idle open communication channel to a wireless network. The system includes one or more wireless devices that each selectively opens and closes a communication channel to the wireless network, and each wireless device has a computer platform and a plurality of device resources that selectively utilize a communication channel to communicate with other devices across the network. Each device resource can selectively request notification of an idle open communication channel and the system notifies all device resources that have requested such notification upon an idle open communication channel occurring whereby each notified device resource can selectively transmit data across the open communication channel prior to closure thereof.","The present invention further includes a method for transmitting data across an open communication channel on a wireless device that selectively opens and closes a communication channel to a wireless network, having the steps of requesting, from one or more device resources, notification of an idle open communication channel, then opening a communication channel from the wireless device to the wireless network, and upon the open communication channel becoming idle, notifying all device resources that have requested such notification, and then selectively transmitting data from one or more notified device resources across the open communication channel prior to closure thereof.","The present invention can particularly utilize the \u201clingering\u201d of an open communication channel which is common on smart cellular devices. During the lingering of the channel, which occurs after and initial voice or data transmission, other device resources that need to communicate across the network can \u201cpiggyback\u201d their data on the idle and open channel. The piggybacking of the data can be transparent to the user of the device.","It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide a system and method that leverages an idle open communication channel to transmit data from device resources instead of needing to bridge an expensive communication channel when communication is needed. The present invention can implement a priority of device resource communication access to insure that the most prudent data is transmitted across the idle open channel. Additionally, the present invention can be implemented on wireless devices embodied with linger timers, or can be constructed in either hardware components or software commands, or both. The present invention thus provides an advantage in that a wireless computer device, such as a cellular telecommunication device, can minimize the number of communication channel establishments necessary to provide adequate network access to the device resources.","Other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and the Claims.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates the partially wireless network  having a plurality of computer devices , , , , , ,  interconnected thereon. Such computer devices can include wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , in communication across a wireless network  and a LAN-based network , with at least one network server, such as application download server , that selectively downloads or provides access to software applications or other data to the wireless devices across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network . As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , a personal digital assistant , a pager , which is shown here as a two-way text pager, or even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection  to a network or the Internet. The inventive system and method can accordingly be performed on any form of computer device computer module including a wired or wireless communication portal, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, access terminals, personal computers, access terminals, telephones without a display or keypad, or any combination or sub-combination thereof.","The present invention is most advantageously utilized in a network where a communication channel has a significant overhead in its initial bridging. In wireless networks, or partially wireless networks, such as network  shown in , the communication channel must be initially bridged between at least the wireless device itself, such as devices , , , , and the wireless network , and the maintenance of the communication channel tends to be costly, especially in a cellular telecommunication network. The use of cellular telecommunication pathways has been increasing because wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d), communicating packets including voice and data over the wireless network. These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephone have installed application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) onto their local computer platform that allow software developers to create software applications that operate on the cellular telephone, and control certain functionality on the device.","In many of the smart cellular devices, such as cellular telephone  or PDA , after the last point-to-point (PPP) connection has stopped being used by the device resource, the device waits for a certain \u201clinger\u201d time before fully terminating the connection. Thus, the present invention can be implemented upon the triggering of an extant linger timer on the wireless device, such as cellular telephone  or text pager , or the device can be modified to have a linger of an open communication channel after the initial use of the channel by the user or device resource has ceased. The linger timer, if present, can typically be altered through a software command to API of the platform of the computer device, such as devices , , , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["14","14","12","18","20","22","14","16","28","30","16","30","40","40","42","40","42","40","42","42","44","42","44","44","12"]},"Each wireless device, such as cellular telephone , has a computer platform  that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from the application download server  or other network servers . The computer platform  also includes an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless device and is not normally upgradeable. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer  that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  also includes a local database  that can hold the software applications, file, or data not actively used in memory , such as the software applications or downloaded from the application download server . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","As shown more particularly in the block diagram of , each device, such as cellular telephone , has a computer platform  that can receive data, execute software applications, and display data transmitted from other computer devices, such as PDA  and application download server . The computer platform  includes a bus  that interconnects the device components. Among other components resident on the device platform  are several device resources: a central processing unit  (CPU), one or more peripheral devices , a communication interface , a memory , the secondary local database , and alternately, a graphics device . Other device resources can be separate programs executing on the CPU  or other processor of a component of the platform .","The system the transmits data across an open communication channel from wireless devices , , ,  on a wireless network , where each device selectively opens and closes a communication channel to the wireless network , and each wireless device including a computer platform  with a plurality of device resources , , , , ,  that each can selectively utilize a communication channel to communicate with other devices, such as another wireless device , , ,  or server , across the network , and each device resource selectively requests the system to notify that device resource of an idle open communication channel, and the system notifies all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification upon an idle open communication channel occurring, and each notified device resource selectively transmits data across the open communication channel prior to closure thereof.","Many wireless devices, such as devices , , , , can delay the closing of an open communication channel after cessation of usage thereof by a device resource or the user with an encoded linger timer. The present invention allows other device resources to utilize this open channel prior to closure of the channel. Through requesting notification, the other device resources , , , , ,  become aware of the idle open channel and if the resources need to communicate across the channel, the device resource can send or receive data across the open channel. The device resources can be allowed to sequentially transmit across the open channel through any priority system as known in the art such as round-robin polling, a priority queue, daisy-chain, or bus arbitration.","In one embodiment, the device resources , , , , ,  each send a flag to request notification of an idle open channel, and the flags can be stored on the CPU , memory , or database . The system then notifies all device resources , , , , ,  that sent a flag thereto upon an idle open communication channel occurring. In another embodiment, the device resources , , , , ,  each prompt the system for notification of an idle open channel, and the system can keep the prompts in active memory , or records such prompts in a local database . The system then notifies all device resources , , , , ,  that so prompted the system upon an idle open communication channel occurring.","If the wireless device , , ,  allows an unused communication channel to idle (linger) for a predetermined duration until closure of the open channel, the system preferably notifies all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification of an idle open communication channel upon the predetermined duration of idling beginning, i.e. when the linger timer begins counting. Further, it is preferable that the system notifies all device resources that have requested such notification of an idle open communication channel within the predetermined duration. Accordingly, the closure of the idle communication channel can be overridden or reset if so desired in order that all device resources , , , , ,  that need to communicate can use the open channel. Otherwise, to preserve the expensive bandwidth, the closure at the end of the predetermined duration can be absolute, and the device resources will simply wait until the next idle open communication channel.","The preferred process executed on the computer device, such as wireless devices , , , , is shown in the flowchart of , which can be a separate program or thread executing on CPU , or a subprogram that executes upon at least one device resource , , , , ,  requesting notification of an idle open communication channel. A determination is made as to whether a request for notion of an idle open channel, as shown by decision . If not, the process enters a monitoring wait-state to determine when a request to receive notice is received. If at least one request for notice has been received at decision , then the system stores all request to receive notice of an idle open channel, as shown by step . The storage can occur in memory  or local database . Then the device at sometime thereafter opens a communication channel to the wireless network , as shown by step . The opening of the channel can occur by a user sending or receiving voice or data from the device , , , , or a device resource can trigger the initial communication if the device is so embodied. Moreover, if a large number of device resources , , , , ,  need to communicate, the device can be embodied such that a communication channel will be established once a threshold number of resources need to communicate.","Once the open communication channel has commenced at step , a constant monitoring of the open channel to determine whether the channel has gone idle, as shown at decision . If the channel is not idle, the process enters a wait-state and constantly monitors the open channel. Once the open channel has idled, the device begins to count its predetermined duration of linger to keep the channel open, as shown at step . At the same time as beginning the linger count at step , or at sometime thereafter, the device notifies each device resource , , , , ,  that requested notification of the idle open channel. Accordingly, step  can be iterated as necessary to notify all device resources. Either while the device resources are being notified at step , or thereafter as shown in the embodiment of , a determination is made as to whether the linger time has elapsed, as shown by decision . If the predetermined duration of linger has not elapsed at decision , then the process enters a monitoring wait-state at decision  and awaits the end of the duration of linger. Once the linger duration has elapsed at decision , the device closes the open communication channel as shown at step . The process then restarts upon one or more requests for notification of an open communication channel being received at decision .","Using the process of , the system accordingly provides a method for transmitting data across an open communication channel on a wireless device, such as devices , , , , that selectively opens and closes a communication channel to a wireless network . The method includes the steps of requesting, from one or more device resources , , , , , , notification of an idle open communication channel, opening a communication channel from the wireless device , , ,  to the wireless network , upon the open communication channel becoming idle, notifying all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification, and selectively transmitting data from one or more notified device resources across the open communication channel prior to closure thereof. The step of requesting from one or more device resources can be a request from one or more software applications resident on the computer platform  of the wireless device , , , , or from one or more hardware components of the computer platform  of the wireless device , , , , as shown in FIG. . In one embodiment, the step of opening a communication channel from the wireless device , , ,  to the wireless network  is opening a communication channel from a cellular device, such as cellular telephone  to a cellular telecommunication network, as shown in FIG. .","The step of requesting notification of an idle open communication channel can be sending a flag from the device resources , , , , ,  to the system. Thus, the step of notifying all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification will then be notifying all device resources that sent a flag upon an idle open communication channel occurring. Alternately, the step of requesting notification of an idle open communication channel is prompting from the device resources , , , , ,  to request notification of an open channel, and the method will then further include the step of recording such prompts, preferably either in memory  or a local database . Consequently, in such embodiment, the step of notifying all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification will be notifying all device resources that so prompted the system.","If the system is embodied to allow an unused communication channel to idle for a predetermined duration until closure, as described above, the step of notifying all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification of an idle open communication channel occurs upon the beginning of the predetermined duration of idling. The step of notifying all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification of an idle open communication channel occurs within the predetermined duration.","The present invention further includes a wireless device, such as cellular telephone , that selectively opens and closes a communication channel to a wireless network , that includes a computer platform  and a plurality of device resources , , , , ,  that selectively utilize a communication channel to communicate with other computer devices, such as application download server  or database  across the network . The device resources of the wireless device selectively request notification of an idle open communication channel, and the wireless device notifies all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification upon an idle open communication channel occurring, and each notified device resource selectively transmits data across the open communication channel prior to closure thereof. The wireless device preferably is a cellular telecommunication device, such as cellular telephone  or text pager .","In one embodiment, the device resources , , , , ,  each send a flag to request notification of an idle open channel, such as sending a flag to CPU , and the wireless device notifies all device resources that sent a flag thereto upon an idle open communication channel occurring. Alternately, each device resource prompts the communication interface  for notification of an idle open channel, and the communication interface  records such prompts, or a local database  on the bus  records the prompts, and notifies all device resources , , , , ,  that so prompted the communication interface  upon an idle open communication channel occurring.","The device resources can be one or more software applications resident on the computer platform  of the wireless device , , , , or one or more hardware components of the computer platform  of the wireless device , , , . The wireless device further preferably allows an unused communication channel to idle, or linger, for a predetermined duration until closure, and notifies all device resources , , , , ,  that have requested such notification of an idle open communication channel upon the predetermined duration of idling beginning, such notification occurring within the predetermined duration of linger.","In view of the inventive method being executable on the computer platform of a wireless device , , , , the present invention includes a program resident in a computer readable medium, where the program directs a computer device , , ,  having a device platform  to perform the inventive steps of the method. Such program can be executed on any single computer platform, or can be multithreaded among several computer platforms.","The computer readable medium can be the memory  of the computer platform  of the cellular telephone , or other wireless device , , , or can be in a local database, such as local database  of the device platform . Further, the computer readable medium can be in a secondary storage media that is loadable onto a wireless device computer platform, such as a magnetic disk or tape, optical disk, hard disk, flash memory, or other storage media as is known in the art.","In the context of , the present inventive method may be implemented, for example, by operating portion(s) of the wireless network  and\/or LAN  to execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions, such as device platform , the application download server , and secondary server .
