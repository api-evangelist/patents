{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["It is well known that media files may be transferred from one device to another via various means. Currently, a media file is transferred from one device to another, and subsequently the user selects a point within the media file to be the starting point from which the media file will be rendered.","With users of media files desiring to experience the same media content on multiple devices, it is more imperative than ever to create systems that allow the synchronization of media files across various devices and which further allow the acquisition of media files which are resident on one device but not others.","Unfortunately, an adequate solution that addresses these issues has eluded those skilled in the art, until now.","The present disclosure describes solutions that enable the synchronization of one or more media files between a master device and a sister device, so that the media file is simultaneously rendered on both devices beginning from identical temporal starting points. The use of a computer network is employed with middleware to condition the media file in a manner which makes the media file compatible with the sister device. The data transactions between the middleware and the sister device may also be handled to search for the appropriate media file, acquire it, and transmit it to the sister device.","The foregoing is a summary that thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalization, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, features, and advantages of the devices and\/or processes and\/or other subject matter described herein will become apparent in the teachings set forth herein. The summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","It should be noted that the embodiments illustrated in these figures are representative only, and are not exclusive of all the embodiments that may implement a media synchronization system.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and make part of this disclosure.","This disclosure is drawn, inter alia, to methods, apparatus, computer programs and systems related to a media synchronization system. Certain preferred embodiments of one such system are illustrated in the figures and described below. Many other embodiments are also possible, however, time and space limitations prevent including an exhaustive list of those embodiments in one document.

Several examples of sister device  include a home media server, a digital video server, a video receiver, a computer, a cellular telephone, a smart telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a digital music player, a digital video player, a portable video player, a wireless handheld device, a mobile communication device, a vehicle navigation system, a vehicle media system, a laptop personal computer (PC), a notebook PC, a mobile computing device, or any other mobile or non-mobile device capable of rendering media files.","The data file  is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .  is a functional block diagram illustrating in greater detail one implementation of the data file introduced in conjunction with . Briefly described, the data file  includes a header . Header  includes a media code  which uniquely identifies media file  from other media files, such as by title or description. Media file  may be an MP3 file, a WAV file, an MPEG file, or any other video file, audio file, or audiovisual file which, when rendered by a mobile or non-mobile device, allows the user to view video content, listen to audio content, or view and listen to audiovisual content. In the illustrated embodiment of , the media file  is included in data file . In other embodiments, media file  may be resident on sister device  or available for acquisition via network .","Header  also includes a time code  which corresponds to a temporal starting point within media file .

In another embodiment, time code  may be modified continuously until receipt of data file  by a sister device. For instance, time code  may identify the temporal starting point \u201c1:05+elapsed time\u201d, indicating that upon receipt of data file , media file  is to be rendered beginning from the point which occurs exactly one hour and five minutes from the beginning of media file  plus the elapsed time between transmission of data file  by master device  and receipt of data file  by sister device .

Upon discovering that a sister device is present, MMSA  may be instructed to cause the media file  to be synchronously rendered on master device  and sister device . MMSA  interacts with media player  in a manner that allows identification of media file  which is being rendered by media player . MMSA  generates a media code  (e.g., see ) which identifies media file .","MMSA  also determines the precise amount of time which has elapsed from the beginning of media file  to the point in media file  which is currently being rendered by media player , and converts that time into a time code  (e.g., see ). For instance, if media player  is currently playing a scene from media file  which occurs exactly one hour and five minutes from the beginning of media file , the time code  may be \u201c1:05\u201d. Alternatively, the user of master device  may use controller  to set time code  to correspond to any temporal point within media file . After MMSA  generates the media code  and the time code , MMSA  creates a data file  which includes media code  and time code . MMSA  also determines whether media file  contains permissions enabling the user to view and\/or listen to media file  on a sister device. If media file  contains the necessary permissions, MMSA  includes media file  in data file . If media file  does not contain the necessary permissions, MMSA  omits media file  from data file .","After MMSA  generates data file , MMSA  transmits data file  to the communications module  resident on the master device . The communications module  is a component configured to facilitate digital or analog communications between the master device  and any other device, such as over a network, using wireless communications, or the like. In one specific implementation, communications module  may be implemented as an ethernet or Bluetooth\u00ae driver stack, although many other examples will become apparent to those skilled in the art.

The processor core  can include an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a floating point unit (FPU), a digital signal processing core (DSP Core), or any combination thereof. A memory controller  can also be used with the processor , or in some implementations the memory controller  can be an internal part of the processor .","Depending on the desired configuration, the system memory  can be of any type including but not limited to volatile memory (such as RAM), non-volatile memory (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.) or any combination thereof. System memory  typically includes an operating system , one or more applications , and program data . Application  includes a media synchronization algorithm  that is configured to support the synchronizing of media file play between two or more devices. Program Data  includes media file  that is useful for media synchronization as has been further described above (e.g., please list some examples). In some embodiments, application  can be arranged to operate with program data  and an operating system  such that media synchronization is facilitated between a master device and one or more sister devices. This described basic configuration is illustrated in  by those components within line .","Computing device  can have additional features or functionality, and additional interfaces to facilitate communications between the basic configuration  and any required devices and interfaces. For example, a bus\/interface controller  can be used to facilitate communications between the basic configuration  and one or more data storage devices  via a storage interface bus . The data storage devices  can be removable storage devices , non-removable storage devices , or a combination thereof. Examples of removable storage and non-removable storage devices include magnetic disk devices such as flexible disk drives and hard-disk drives (HDD), optical disk drives such as compact disk (CD) drives or digital versatile disk (DVD) drives, solid state drives (SSD), and tape drives to name a few. Example computer storage media can include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.","System memory , removable storage  and non-removable storage  are all examples of computer storage media.

Example output devices  include a graphics processing unit  and an audio processing unit , which can be configured to communicate to various external devices such as a display or speakers via one or more A\/V ports . Example peripheral interfaces  include a serial interface controller  or a parallel interface controller , which can be configured to communicate with external devices such as input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, etc.) or other peripheral devices (e.g., printer, scanner, etc.) via one or more I\/O ports . An example communication device  includes a network controller , which can be arranged to facilitate communications with one or more other computing devices  over a network communication via one or more communication ports . The communication connection is one example of a communication media. Communication media may typically be embodied by computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and includes any information delivery media. A \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d can be a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media can include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR) and other wireless media.

Computing device  can also be implemented as a personal computer including both laptop computer and non-laptop computer configurations.","As will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art, the system and method described herein affords distinct advantages not previously available to users of media files. The present system and method allows users to synchronize media files between a master device and a sister device exactly to a preferred point of usage, so that users of both devices are experiencing the same media file in the same temporal sequence. For instance, when both users are watching a movie, at all times the frame which is rendered on the master device will be identical to the frame which is rendered on the sister device. Further, the present system and method allows the user of a sister device to acquire and configure media files which were not originally present on the sister device, enabling the user of the sister device to experience the same media file which is being rendered on the master device, beginning at the same temporal starting point.","In another aspect, in this embodiment of the present system and method for media synchronization, each master device and each sister device may run a specialized media synchronization application that enables as much portability to other devices as the device technology allows and is made available by willing manufacturers and service providers. The ability to install a unified media player with the media synchronization application will speed adoption of the system as there will be fewer compatibility and updating issues to consider. Device portability options may be presented in an application menu for the SMSA. The media synchronization application for each master device and each sister device may be updated easily via application updates pushed from a central server system.","Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","There is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or software is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. There are various vehicles by which processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and\/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and\/or firmware vehicle; if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and\/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof.","The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","With respect to the use of substantially any plural and\/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and\/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and\/or application. The various singular\/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","While various embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in art.
