For example, one party may intend to ask the other party about a recent vacation, but may forget to raise this topic during a conversation.","In some cases when a conversation occurs the participants in the conversation may struggle to find something to discuss; awkward conversation or silence may ensue.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","In one aspect, the present disclosure describes a method for facilitating communications. The method includes: monitoring audio based communications; performing an audio analysis on the monitored audio based communications to identify a contact associated with the monitored communications; and providing information associated with the identified contact on an electronic device.","In another aspect, the present disclosure describes an electronic device. The electronic device includes a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory stores processor readable instructions for causing the processor to: monitor audio based communications; perform an audio analysis on the monitored audio based communications to identify a contact associated with the monitored communications; and provide information associated with the identified contact on an electronic device.","In yet another aspect, the present disclosure describes a non-transitory computer readable storage medium including computer executable instructions for: monitoring audio based communications; performing an audio analysis on the monitored audio based communications to identify a contact associated with the monitored communications; and providing information associated with the identified contact on an electronic device.","In yet a further aspect, the present disclosure describes a method for triggering a reminder on an electronic device. The method includes: associating a reminder with a contact; monitoring audio based communications; performing an audio analysis on the monitored communications to determine whether the contact associated with the reminder is a participant in the communications; and in response to determining that the contact associated with the reminder is a party to the communications triggering the reminder.","Other example embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.","As will be described in greater detail below, at least some example embodiments of the present disclosure describe electronic devices (such as a mobile communication device), methods, communication systems, and computer-readable mediums for providing notifications on an electronic device. The notifications which are provided include notification information which is associated with a contact on an electronic device.","For example, in some example embodiments which will be discussed in greater detail below, a user of an electronic device may store a reminder in a memory of the electronic device and may associate that reminder with a contact. The reminder may for example, be a user-specified text based reminder. Later, when the user is engaged in a conversation with the contact associated with the reminder, the electronic device may trigger the reminder in order to remind the user of the device of the information in the reminder.","Reference will now be made to  which illustrates an example electronic device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. In the illustrated example embodiment, the electronic device  is a communication device and, more particularly, is a mobile communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems; for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device , in various example embodiments the electronic device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system. The electronic device may also be referred to as a mobile communications device, a communication device, a mobile device and, in some cases, as a device.","The electronic device  includes a controller including one or more processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the electronic device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  is communicably coupled with additional device subsystems including one or more output interfaces  (such as a display screen  and\/or a speaker ), one or more input interfaces  (such as a microphone , keyboard (not shown), control buttons (not shown), a navigational input device (not shown), and\/or a touch-sensitive overlay (not shown)), memory (such as flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , etc.), auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, short-range communication subsystem  and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may include a touchscreen display which acts as both an input interface  (i.e. touch-sensitive overlay) and an output interface  (i.e. display). The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input interface  and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the electronic device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter. The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which electronic device  is intended to operate.","The mobile communication device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","In some example embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may include an external communication link or interface; for example, an Ethernet connection. The electronic device  may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks; for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network. The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may include a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  also includes a removable memory module  (typically including flash memory, such as a removable memory card) and a memory interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device  via the memory module , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the electronic device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device  by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to a host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the electronic device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The electronic device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface  such as the data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the electronic device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the electronic device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","The electronic device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments, the data  includes service data including information required by the electronic device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the electronic device  may be organized, at least partially, into one or more databases or data stores. The databases or data stores may contain data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The electronic device  may, in some example embodiments, be a mobile communication device which may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the electronic device  may also compose data items, such as email messages; for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the electronic device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., a voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input interfaces ). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory; for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  include operating system software  and other software applications  such a contact manager  and a notification module . In the example embodiment of , the contact manager  and the notification module  are implemented as separate stand-alone applications . However, in other example embodiments, one or more of these applications (i.e. notification module  and\/or the contact manager ) could be implemented as part of the operating system  or another application .","In some example embodiments, any of the functions performed by any combination of the notification module  and\/or the contact manager  may be realized in a common application. For example, the notification module  and the contact manager  may be implemented as a single application which provides the functions of the notification module  and the contact manager . For example, in at least some example embodiments, the notification module  may be included in the contact manager .","The contact manager  performs the functions of an address book and allows contact entries  to be created and stored in the memory. The contact manager  is configured to receive new contact entries  from one or more input interface  associated with the electronic device . For example, a user of the electronic device  may interact with an input interface  such as a navigational input device in order to input an instruction to the contact manager  to create a new contact entry . Such contact entries  may, in at least some example embodiments, be stored in a contact data store in the memory of the electronic device .","In at least some example embodiments, a contact entry  may be received at the contact manager  over the network  from another device or system. For example, the contact entry  may be received via the communication subsystem . The contact entry may be received in vCard format or in another format which describes contact information.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may have a notification module  stored in memory of the electronic device. The notification module  is configured to monitor audio based communications, such as phone calls and, in at least some example embodiments, in-person conversations. The notification module  may include a speaker identification system (not shown) which is configured to perform an audio analysis on the monitored audio based communications to identify a contact associated with the monitored communications. In at least some example embodiments, the speaker identification system may identify a speaker using one or more voice signatures  () stored in memory of the electronic device . After the speaker is identified as a specific contact, the notification module  may provide information associated with that contact on the electronic device . For example, in at least some example embodiments, the notification module  may display a reminder  () associated with that contact on the display screen  of the electronic device . The functions and features provided by the notification module  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","The software applications  on the electronic device  may also include a range of additional applications, including for example, a notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (e.g. the display ) according to the application.","The software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the electronic device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the electronic device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed; for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime.","Referring briefly to , an example contact entry  is illustrated. The contact entry  is associated with a specific contact. The example contact entry  includes information which is associated with that contact.","The information associated with the contact (which may be included in the contact entry ) may include for example, one or more names, such as a first name  (which may also be referred to as a given name) and\/or a last name  (which may also be referred to as a surname). The information associated with the contact may also include one or more messaging address  associated with the contact. The messaging addresses  are addresses which may be used to send electronic messages to the contact. The messaging addresses  may include for example, an email address associated with the contact. The messaging addresses  may also include other messaging addresses associated with the contact, such as for example, a text messaging address (such as an Short Messaging Service (SMS) or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) based messaging address), an instant messaging address, an device-to-device based messaging address (such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN) based messaging address), a fax number, or other messaging addresses.","The contact entry  may also include one or more phone numbers  associated with the contact. In at least some example embodiments, the contact entry  may specify a plurality of phone numbers  associated with the contact. Such phone numbers  may include for example, a business phone number, a home phone number, a mobile phone number. Other types of phone numbers are also possible.","The contact entry  may also include any one or more of the following fields: a company name  for specifying the name of the contact's employer, a job title field  for specifying the contact's job title, a department field  for specifying the department which the contact is a member of, one or more address fields  for specifying a physical address associated with the contact, such as a home address and\/or a business address. Other fields may also be included.","At least some of the information associated with the contact may operate as contact identification information . The contact identification information  is information which may be used to identify a contact when that contact is speaking. That is, the contact identification information  includes information that may be used by the electronic device  to identify which contact is speaking during an audio based conversation.","For example, the contact identification information  may include the one or more name ,  (such as the first name  and\/or the last name ). In at least some example embodiments, the contact identification information  may also include a company name . For example, when speaking a contact may introduce himself as \u201cJohn Smith from Company X\u201d. In such an example, a first name  (e.g. John), a last name  (e.g. Smith) and a company name  (e.g. Company X) are all used as contact identification information . That is, when a first name, last name and\/or company name are spoken in an audio based conversation, the electronic device may use the first name , last name  and\/or company name  to determine the identity of the speaker (i.e. to associate the speaker with the contact entry  having the same first name , last name  and\/or company name ).","In some example embodiments, a speaker recognition analysis may be used to determine whether a contact is a participant in a communication. In such example embodiments, the contact identification information  which may be used to identify a contact when that contact is speaking may include a voice signature  for the contact. The voice signature , in an example embodiment, includes acoustic pattern information which may be used as a biometric in order to perform speaker identification to attempt to recognize a speaker. The acoustic patterns may reflect anatomy, such as the size and shape of the throat and mouth, and\/or learned behavioural patterns, such as voice pitch and speaking style, in example embodiments.","The voice signature  is, in the example embodiment illustrated, stored in the contact entry . The voice signature  may be one or more files which are attached or associated with the contact entry . However, the voice signature  may be stored elsewhere, such as for example on a server in which the electronic device can access through a wireless network. The voice signature  is stored in a manner in which it is associated with the contact. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the voice signature  may be stored independently of the contact entry  but may link to the contact entry . Alternatively, in at least some example embodiments, the voice signature  may be stored independently of the contact entry  but the contact entry  may link to the voice signature .","Various methods of obtaining a voice signature  for a contact will be discussed below with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, the contact entry  may be associated with notification information . The notification information  includes information which the user of the electronic device  will be reminded of when they are speaking to the contact defined by the contact entry . For example, the notification information  may include one or more reminder . The reminder  may be a note that the user of the electronic device  wishes to be reminded about when they speak to the contact. In the example illustrated, the reminder  indicates that the user wishes to be reminded to \u201cAsk whether contact would like to be added to newsletter.\u201d As will be explained in greater detail below, when a user is engaged in an audio based communication with the contact, the reminder  may be triggered so that the user is reminded of the information contained in the reminder ","The reminder  may be created by a user of the electronic device . That is, a user of the electronic device  may interact with one of the input mechanisms associated with the electronic device  to input the reminder  to the device . The reminder  is received at the device  and stored in memory of the device . In the example embodiment illustrated, the reminder  is stored in the contact entry . However, the reminder may be stored elsewhere, such as for example on a server in which the electronic device can access through a wireless network. The reminder is, however, stored in a manner in which it is associated with the contact.","The reminder is, in at least some example embodiments, a text-based reminder. However, in other example embodiments, the reminder may be audio, video, or image based.","The notification information  may also include other information instead of or in addition to the reminder . For example, the notification information  may include one or more names (such as a first name  and a last name ) associated with the contact. Similarly, the notification information  may also include a company name  associated with the contact. In at least some example embodiments (not illustrated), the notification information  may include an image associated with the contact, such as a photograph of the contact.","As will be explained in greater detail below, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  is configured to display the notification information  associated with a contact on the display  when that contact is a participant in an audio based communication monitored by the electronic device . For example, in some example embodiments, when a user is engaged in a phone call with the contact, the notification information  for that contact may be displayed on the display . Similarly, in some example embodiments, when a user is engaged in an in-person conversation with the contact, the notification information  for that contact may be displayed on the display .","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may monitor communications on the electronic device and\/or communications in the vicinity of the electronic device  to identify participants in such communications. When participants are identified, information associated with those participants may be provided on the electronic device . For example, a participant may be identified as a contact associated with a contact entry on the electronic device  and a reminder associated with that contact entry may be provided on the electronic device .","Reference will now be made to  which illustrates a flowchart of a method  for facilitating communications using an electronic device . The electronic device  () may be configured to perform the method  of . In at least some example embodiments, the processor  () of the electronic device  () is configured to perform the method . More particularly, in at least some example embodiments, one or more application  () or module stored in memory of the device  () may be configured to perform the method  of . One or more applications  () may contain computer readable instructions which cause the processor  () of the electronic device  () to perform the method . In at least some example embodiments, the notification module  and\/or the contact manager  () may be configured to perform the method  of . More particularly, the notification module  and\/or the contact manager  may include computer readable instructions which, when executed, cause the processor  () to perform the method  of .","The method  of  may, in at least some example embodiments, be provided by other software applications or modules apart from those specifically discussed above; for example, the operating system  (). Similarly, any portion of the method  of  may be performed by or rely on other applications  (FIG. ) or modules which interface with the contact manager  and\/or the notification module  ().","In the method  of , at , notification information  () related to a contact is stored in memory and is associated, in memory, with that contact. The notification information  () is, in at least some example embodiments, stored by the contact manager . The notification information  is information which the electronic device  is configured to display when the user of the electronic device  is engaged in a conversation with the contact associated with the notification information  (). The notification information  () may be information which a user of the electronic device  may wish to be presented to the user when the user is speaking to the contact.","In some example embodiments, the notification information  () associated with the contact may include the name of the contact (such as for example, the first name  () and\/or last name  ()). Such information may be useful to a user who has difficulty remembering the identity of the contact. In at least some example embodiments (not shown), the notification information  () may include an image associated with the contact, such as a photograph depicting the contact.","In at least some example embodiments, the notification information  () related to the contact which is stored at  may include a reminder  () associated with the contact. The reminder  () may specify information which the user of the electronic device  wishes to be reminded of when they next speak with the contact. For example, the reminder  may specify a question which the user of the electronic device  () wishes to ask of the contact. Other types of reminders are also possible.","The notification information  related to the contact is, in at least some example embodiments, stored in one or more datastores in a memory of the electronic device . The datastore associates the notification information  () related to the contact with corresponding contact identification information  () for that contact. As noted previously, the contact identification information  () is information which may be used by the electronic device  to identify a contact as a participant in an audio based communication. For example, the contact identification information  may include a first name , a last name , and\/or a company name . The contact identification information  may also include a voice signature  associated with the contact.","In at least some example embodiments, the notification information  related to the contact may be stored in a contact entry  () in memory of the electronic device .","At , the notification module  () monitors audio based communications. The audio based communications which are monitored include, in at least some example embodiments, audio based communications which take place over a communication subsystem  () associated with the electronic device  (). For example, in at least some example embodiments, the monitored communications include phone calls made with the electronic device .","In at least some example embodiments, the audio based communications which are monitored include local conversations. Local conversations are conversations which are in the acoustic vicinity of the electronic device  (). That is, the local conversations are in-person conversations which are audible at the electronic device  (). The audio based communications are, in at least some example embodiments, monitored using the microphone  () on the electronic device . The microphone  () which is used to monitor the audio based communications may be the same microphone which is used by the electronic device  for phone calls. In at least some example embodiments, the microphone  () which is used to monitor the audio based communications may also be used for audio input for speakerphone based communications on the electronic device  ().","At , an audio analysis is performed on the monitored communications to identify a contact associated with the monitored communications. The audio analysis may, in at least some example embodiments, use contact identification information  () to determine whether a contact is a participant in the monitored communications. Various methods of identifying a contact in the monitored communications will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","After a participant in the audio based communication is identified as a contact, at , notification information  () associated with the identified contact is provided on the electronic device  (). The notification information  () associated with the identified contact may be the notification information (or a portion of the information) stored at .","The notification information may be information which a user of the electronic device  previously indicated that they would like to be reminded of when the user is speaking to the contact. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the notification information  provided at  may include a reminder  () associated with the contact.","Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, in response to determining that a contact associated with a reminder is a party to the monitored communications, the reminder associated with that contact is triggered. More particularly, in some example embodiments, after identifying a contact associated with the monitored communications (at ) and prior to providing the information associated with the identified contact (at ), the notification module  may determine whether the identified contact is associated with a reminder. In response to determining that the identified contact is associated with a reminder , that reminder  may be displayed (at ) on the display. That is,  (providing the notification information associated with the identified contact) may occur in response to determining that the identified contact is associated with the reminder.","In some example embodiments, if it is determined that the identified contact is not associated with any reminders, then the notification information associated with the identified contact may not be provided on the display (i.e.  may be omitted). That is, in at least some example embodiments, if it is determined that the identified contact is not associated with a reminder, then notification information associated with the identified contact is not provided on the electronic device  () at . In other example embodiments, if the identified contact is not associated with a reminder, other notification information  (such as a first name , last name , company name  and\/or image (such as a photograph)) may be provided on the display  ().","In some example embodiments, the notification information  () which is provided at  may include the name of the identified contact (such as for example, a first name  () and\/or last name  ()). Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, the notification information which is provided at  may include the company name  () associated with the identified contact. The notification information  which is provided at  may also include an image associated with the identified contact, such as a photograph depicting the identified contact.","In at least some example embodiments, at , the notification information  associated with the identified contact may be provided on a display  () associated with the electronic device  (). That is, the notification information  may be displayed in a notification screen  () on the display  (). An example notification screen  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, to alert a user to the notification information  () displayed on the display  (), an alert may be generated on the electronic device . The alert may be generated on the electronic device  contemporaneously with the display of the notification information  () on the display  (). The alert is, in at least some example embodiments, a vibratory notification which is provided by a vibrator associated with the electronic device  (). In other example embodiments, an audible notification may be provided by a speaker  () associated with the electronic device  (). Similarly, in other example embodiments, an optical notification may be provided by a light associated with the device, such as an light emitting diode (LED) associated with the electronic device  ().","The notification information  () may, in at least some example embodiments, be presented using an output interface  () on the electronic device  () instead of or in addition to the display  (). For example, in some example embodiments, the reminder may be presented as an audio based reminder through the speaker .","The method  may be modified in some example embodiments. For example, in some example embodiments (not illustrated), the notification information , such as a reminder, may only be displayed if it is determined that one or more conditions is satisfied. The conditions may be previously set by a user of the device . For example, a user may specify a condition at  which is associated with the notification information  and which must be satisfied before the notification information is displayed at . In such example embodiments, the method  may include receiving, via an input interface  (), conditional information which specifies a condition associated with the notification information . Then, the method  may include, prior to displaying the notification information , determining whether a condition specified by the conditional information is satisfied. If it is determined that the condition is satisfied, then the method  may proceed to  where the notification information  is displayed. If the condition is not satisfied, then the display of the notification information may be suppressed (i.e. not displayed).","For example, in some example embodiments, a user may specify that the notification information (such as a reminder) is only to be displayed during specified times. By way of example, a user may specify that the notification information should only be displayed if the time of day of a communication is before a predetermined time. This would allow a user to trigger a notification if they are in a communication with a person during the day but suppress the notification if they are in a communication with a person during the evening. In such example embodiments, the method may include receiving, via an input interface  (), timing information which specifies a time during which notification information  may be displayed. Then, the method  may include, prior to displaying the notification information  (at ), determining whether the time of the communication is within the time specified by the timing information. If the time is within the time specified by the timing information, the method  may proceed to  where the notification information  is displayed. If, however, the time of the communication is not within the time specified by the timing information, then the display of the notification information may be suppressed (i.e. not displayed).","Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, a user may specify one or more black-out period associated with notification information, such as a reminder. A black-out period is a period of time where a user does not want notification information  to be displayed. For example, a user may not want notification information, such as a reminder, to be displayed during a specific meeting with a contact. For example, a user may not want a reminder regarding a recent vacation to be displayed when a user is engaged in an important meeting with the contact. Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, the method  may include receiving, via an input interface  () black-out information associated with notification information . The black-out information may specify one or more black-out periods during which the user does not want the notification information  to be displayed. In such example embodiments, the method  may also include, prior to displaying the notification information (at ), determining whether the time of the communication is within a blackout period specified by the black-out information. If the time is within the black-out period specified by the black-out information, then the display of the notification information may be suppressed (i.e. not displayed). If, however, the time is not within the black-out period, then the method  may proceed to  where the notification information  is displayed.","Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, a user may specify a type of audio based communication associated with the notification information . That is, a user may specify that the notification information  is only to be displayed when the user is engaged in a certain type of audio based communication with the contact. For example, in some example embodiments, a user may specify whether the notification information  is to be displayed only when the user is engaged in a phone call with the contact. Similarly, a user may specify whether the notification information  is to be displayed only when the user is engaged in a local conversation with the contact. In such example embodiments, the method  may include receiving, via an input interface  (), communication type information which specifies one or more communication types associated with the notification information . The method  may also include, prior to displaying the notification information (at ), determining whether a type of the communication corresponds to a type associated with the communication type information associated with the notification information . If the type of the communication which the user is currently engaged in corresponds to the type associated with the communication type information, then at , the notification information  is displayed (i.e. if the user is engaged in a local conversation and the user specified that the notification information  should be displayed during a local conversation, then the notification information  is displayed). If, however, the type of the communication which the user is currently engaged in does not correspond to the type associated with the communication type information, then the notification information is suppressed (i.e. not displayed)","Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, a user may specify whether notification information, such as a reminder, is to be displayed when a user is engaged in a public communication. A public communication may be defined as a communication which includes participants in addition to the user of the device and the contact. That is, a public communication includes more than two people. This may be contrasted with a private communication which may be defined as a communication which includes only the user and the contact. In some cases, a user may wish to be reminded of something when that user is only speaking with a contact and no third parties are included in the communication. Accordingly, in some example embodiments, the method  may include receiving, via an input interface  (), a private communication indicator which indicates whether the notification information  is only to be displayed when the user is engaged in a private communication. In such example embodiments, if the private communication indicator specifies that the notification information  is only to be displayed when the user is engaged in a private communication, the method may include determining whether the user is engaged in a private communication. If the user is not engaged in a private communication and the private communication indicator specifies that the notification information  is only to be displayed when the user is engaged in a private communication, then the notification information may be suppressed (i.e. not displayed). If, however, the user is engaged in a private communication, then the notification information may be displayed at .","Referring now to , an example notification screen  is illustrated.

In the example embodiment illustrated this selectable interface element  is labelled \u201cwrong contact\u201d. The selectable interface element  for indicating to the electronic device  that the contact associated with the notification screen  is not a participant may be used by a user to indicate to the electronic device  that an error has occurred in the identification process. That is, the user may use the selectable interface element  to advise the electronic device  that it has misidentified a participant in the audio based communication.","In response to receiving a selecting of the selectable interface element , the notification module  may attempt to re-identify the participants in the conversation. That is, the method  of  may resume monitoring the audio based communications (at ) to attempt to identify participants at . During this pass of identification, the notification module  may be configured to exclude, from the identification process, the contact which was previously identified in the analysis. That is, the notification module  may be prevented from re-selecting the contact which the user indicated was not a participant in the communication.","In at least some example embodiments, a speaker identification analysis may be performed in order to identify one or more participants in an audio based communication so that notification information  () related to those participants may be provided.","Referring now to , one such example embodiment is illustrated.  illustrates a flowchart of a method  for facilitating communications using an electronic device .
