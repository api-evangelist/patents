Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method of extracting an experience-revealing sentence from a blog document and a method of classifying activity verbs and state verbs in sentences recorded in a blog document, and more particularly, to a method of classifying sentences of blog text into experience sentences and non-experience sentences using grammatical features such as tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes.","2. Discussion of Related Art","Web documents contain various pieces of information such as facts, opinions, and experiences. In particular, experiences play an important role in making decisions or solving problems. Blogs, a kind of web documents, contain abundant user experiences, unlike other web documents such as news articles and homepages.","In the field of information extraction, there are methods of mining user experiences from blogs. These methods are intended to extract attributes such as who, where, when, what, and why from a blog document and structuralize and store an experience using natural language processing technology and machine learning technology.","However, a conventional information extraction method has the following problem. For example, when a sentence \u201cProbably, she will laugh and dance in his funeral\u201d is in a blog document, a structuralized experience \u201cShe, Funeral, Laugh and dance\u201d is extracted. In this way, the hypothesis that has not actually happened is extracted as an experience. This is because all text in the blog document has been assumed to be experiences.","The present invention is directed to providing a method of automatically classifying sentences expressing actual experiences and sentences not expressing actual experiences (i.e., non-experience sentences) in a blog document using various grammatical features to extract experiences that a user has actually had or that have actually occurred.","The present invention is also directed to providing a method of automatically classifying activity verbs that play an important role in experience extraction using various statistical features on the basis of Vendler's verb theory.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of extracting an experience sentence from a blog document, including: generating a sentence classifier using a machine learning algorithm based on grammatical features; and classifying experience sentences that represent actual experiences of users and non-experience sentences that represent no experience in the blog document using the sentence classifier.","Generating the sentence classifier may include: extracting the grammatical features from given training data; and generating the sentence classifier for classifying sentences using the machine learning algorithm based on the extracted grammatical features.","The machine learning algorithm may be a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.","Extracting the grammatical features from the given training data may include: extracting tense from sentences included in the training data; extracting mood from the sentences; extracting aspect from the sentences; extracting modality from the sentences; extracting experiencers from the sentences; and extracting verb classes from the sentences.","Extracting the tense may include extracting the tense by part-of-speech (POS) tagging.","Extracting the mood may include extracting the mood using punctuation marks and the orders of POS occurrences in the sentences.","Extracting the aspect may include extracting the aspect by POS tagging.","Extracting the modality may include extracting the modality using POS tagging and a modal dictionary.","Extracting the experiencers may include extracting the experiencers by parsing and using a named-entity recognizer.","Extracting the verb classes may include extracting the verb classes using an activity verb dictionary.","Classifying the experience sentences that represent actual experience of users and the non-experience sentences that represent no experience in the blog document using the sentence classifier may include: preprocessing text of the blog document; extracting grammatical features from the preprocessed blog document; and classifying the experience sentences and the non-experience sentences using the sentence classifier on the basis of the extracted grammatical features.","Preprocessing the text of the blog document may include performing hypertext markup language (HTML) parsing and sentence tokenization of the blog document.","Extracting the grammatical features from the preprocessed blog document may include: tagging the sentences from which the grammatical features will be extracted with POSs; parsing the sentences from which the grammatical features will be extracted; recognizing entity names of the sentences from which the grammatical features will be extracted; loading a dictionary for extracting grammatical features; and extracting tense, aspect, mood, modality, experiencer, and verb class features from the sentences using the dictionary.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of classifying a verb in a blog document, including: generating a verb classifier using a machine learning algorithm based on statistical features; and classifying activity verbs that represent acts and activities of a person and state verbs that represent feelings and perceptions of a person in a blog document using the sentence classifier.","Generating the verb classifier may include: extracting the statistical features from a training verb set including activity verbs and state verbs; and generating the verb classifier for classifying verbs using the machine learning algorithm based on the extracted statistical features.","Extracting the statistical features may include: generating an appropriate query about a given verb for a search engine; and extracting a statistical value of the query from the search engine.","Generating the appropriate query may include generating the query using a test pattern of Vendler's verb theory.","Extracting the statistical value of the query from the search engine may include extracting the statistical value using a search engine application programming interface (API) and a regular expression.","The machine learning algorithm may be an SVM algorithm.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. While the present invention is shown and described in connection with exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","The present invention relates to a method of extracting an experience of a user from text in a blog document, whereby sentences in the blog are classified into experience sentences and non-experience sentences using a variety of grammatical features. That is, unlike a conventional experience extraction method, experiences that a user has actually had or that have actually occurred are extracted. The following sentences are examples that are not extracted as containing an experience according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, but which are extracted as containing an experience according to conventional art. As shown below, the following sentences are hypotheses, questions, orders, etc. rather than actual experiences.","(1) If Jason arrives on time, I'll buy him a drink.","(2) Probably, she will laugh and dance in his funeral.","(3) Can anyone explain what is going on here?","(4) Don't play soccer on the roads!","An experience defined in the present invention denotes an activity that a user has actually done or an event that has happened to a user. Typical experience sentences defined in the present invention are as follows.","(1) I ran with my wife three times a week until we moved to Washington, D.C.","(2) Jane and I hopped on a bus into the city center.","(3) We went to a restaurant near the central park.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , generation of a sentence classifier according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention involves training data , a grammatical feature extractor , a support vector machine (SVM) learner , and a sentence classifier .","The training data  consists of experience sentences and non-experience sentences. A large number of sentences are sampled from actual blog document data, and a plurality of evaluators tag each of the sentences with whether or not the sentence represents an actual experience. The results of tagging performed for each of the sentences by the majority of the evaluators are used as training data.","The grammatical feature extractor  extracts grammatical features required for sentence classification from a given sentence. Grammatical features taken into consideration according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention are six features, that is, tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencers, and verb classes.","The SVM learner  generates the sentence classifier  using an SVM algorithm using those features extracted from the training data  by the grammatical feature extractor . In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the machine learning method is used because rule-based methods cannot cover the overall diversity of sentences in a blog document while the machine learning method enables rough estimation on even a sentence that is seen for the first time.","The sentence classifier  determines whether or not a sentence given to the classifier  itself trained using the training data  represents an experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","202","102","104","203","204"]},"The blog document data  is a large quantity of blog documents collected from an actual web.","The document processor  preprocesses text of the blog documents. The blog documents are hypertext markup language (HTML) documents and undergo HTML parsing and sentence tokenization to extract text in the blog documents that will be classified according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For HTML parsing and sentence tokenization, a variety of libraries widely used in the corresponding field may be used.","The blog document data  is preprocessed by the document processor , and grammatical features extracted by the grammatical feature extractor  are classified by the previously generated sentence classifier , resulting in the experience sentences  and the non-experience sentences .","A method for the grammatical feature extractor  to extract features according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Referring to , first, a sentence from which grammatical features will be extracted is tagged with parts-of-speech (POSs) (S). In step , POS tagging may use a variety of libraries widely used in the corresponding field. The tagged POS information provides basic information for extracting the six grammatical features.","Subsequently, the sentence from which grammatical features will be extracted is parsed (S). In step , parsing may use a variety of libraries widely used in the corresponding field. A sentence structure and intra-sentence dependency information extracted by parsing provide information for extracting experiencer and verb class features.","Subsequently, an entity name of the sentence from which grammatical features will be extracted is recognized (S). In step , entity name recognition may use a variety of libraries widely used in the corresponding field. In general, entity name recognition denotes recognition of a place name, a person's name, a company name, and a product name. The extracted entity name is used as information for extracting an experiencer feature.","Subsequently, a dictionary for extracting grammatical features is loaded (S). In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a dictionary in which modality expressions are collected and a dictionary in which activity verbs are collected may be loaded. A method of collecting activity verbs and generating the activity verb dictionary will be described later.","Since an experience defined in the present invention is an activity that a user has actually done or an event that has happened to a user, an expression relating to an activity of the user (e.g., run, swim, or walk) is required. On the other hand, expressions relating to a state are not considered as an experience (e.g., \u201cI love this place\u201d and \u201cI know him\u201d).","The activity verb dictionary provides information for extracting a verb class feature. The modal dictionary is a dictionary in which modality expressions are collected. A modality dictionary is a dictionary in which modals (e.g., can, will, must, and may) that change a characteristic of a verb such as probability, permission, and intention and expressions serving as modals (e.g., have to, and need to) are collected. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the modality dictionary serves to provide information for extracting a modality feature.","Subsequently, tense and aspect features are extracted (S). Tense and aspect are important features for classifying an experience sentence. For example, \u201cI will run tomorrow\u201d and \u201cI am going to run tomorrow\u201d are non-experience sentences due to the future tense and the progressive aspect. Tense and aspect of a verb in a sentence are extracted using the tagged POS information.","Subsequently, a mood feature is extracted (S). A mood is an important feature for classifying an experience sentence. For example, \u201cGo to school!\u201d and \u201cDid she come to school?\u201d are non-experience sentences due to the imperative and interrogative moods. A mood is estimated on the basis of a rule in consideration of which POS a sentence begins with, and which one of imperative, interrogative, and declarative sentences a sentence punctuation mark indicates.","Subsequently, a modality feature is extracted (S). A modality is an important feature for classifying an experience sentence. For example, \u201cShe might be there\u201d is a non-experience sentence because the modality of the sentence has been changed by a modal \u201cmight.\u201d Modality is estimated by looking up whether an expression recorded in the modality dictionary exists in the sentence.","Subsequently, an experiencer feature is extracted (S). An experiencer is also an important feature for classifying an experience sentence. For example, \u201cGolden leaves were swept out of the streets\u201d does not have a subject, that is, an experiencer, in the sentence itself and thus is a non-experience sentence. An experiencer is estimated on the basis of a rule in consideration of subject information and POS information provided by parsing and a person's name provided by entity name recognition.","Finally, a verb class feature is extracted (S). Verb classes are also an important feature for classifying an experience sentence. Verb classes denote two classes of activity verbs and state verbs. For example, \u201cI know that theory\u201d is a non-experience sentence due to a state verb \u201cknow.\u201d This is because knowing a theory is not an activity that a user actually does or an event that happens to a user. A verb class is estimated by looking up whether a verb in the sentence exists in the activity verb dictionary built according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.","A method of classifying a verb in a blog document according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Referring to , generation of a verb classifier according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention involves a training data set , a statistical feature extractor , an SVM learner , and a verb classifier .","The training data set  consists of a small number of activity verbs and state verbs. Table 1 below shows examples of typical activity verbs and state verbs mentioned in writings of Vendler. As shown in Table 1 below, activity verbs represent acts and activities of a person, and state verbs represent feelings and perceptions of a person.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Activity Verb ","State Verb"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Run, Swim, Walk, Paint (picture), ","Like, Know, Believe, Recognize,"]},{"entry":["Build (house)","Realize"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Vendler has suggested some tests as a method for easily classifying activity verbs and state verbs. These tests are not applied to all activity verbs and state verbs but can be applied to most activity verbs and state verbs. Tests used in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention are as follows.","(1) Progressive: A state verb used in the progressive form is awkward.","A. John is running. (O)","B. John is liking. (X)","(2) Force: A state verb used as a complement of a verb \u201cforce\u201d is awkward.","A. John forced harry to run. (O)","B. John forced harry to know.

(X)","(5) Carefully: A state verb used with an adverb \u201ccarefully\u201d is awkward.","A. John runs carefully. (O)","B. John knows carefully. (X)","The statistical feature extractor  extracts statistical features required for verb classification from a given verb by a search engine using the above-mentioned verb classification tests. The tests have been designed from the viewpoint of linguistics, and enable a person to recognize awkwardness when he\/she reads a sentence. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, statistics of the tests are made using the search engine on the following assumption: when an awkward expression is input to the search engine, there will be few search results. A statistical feature extraction method will be described in detail later.","The SVM learner  generates the verb classifier  using an SVM algorithm using those features extracted from the training verb set  by the statistical feature extractor .

In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an API of a search engine or a crawling method may be used to automatically query several thousands of verbs and return search results.","Subsequently, since a returned result is a webpage in an HTML form, HTML parsing is performed as a preprocess (S).","Subsequently, sentence tokenization (S), POS tagging (S), and parsing (S) are performed on the returned results to extract statistical features required for verb classification, thereby performing preprocessing to obtain basic statistical information.","Subsequently, three basic values are extracted from the search results (S). In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the three basic values may be a hit count, candidate sentence count, and correct sentence count.","The hit count denotes the number of result pages corresponding to a query. As the hit count, only an actual value is extracted from search result pages using a regular expression.","The candidate sentence count denotes the number of sentences including verbs to be classified among sentences in the search results. The candidate sentence count is obtained by determining whether the corresponding verb is in each sentence and counting sentences including the verb.","The correct sentence count denotes the number of sentences satisfying an intended test among sentences including verbs to be classified (i.e., candidate sentences). For example, in a sentence \u201cIs building an artifact?\u201d, \u201cIs building\u201d seems to satisfy the progressive test. However, \u201cbuilding\u201d in the sentence is used not as a verb but as a noun, and the test is not satisfied. The correct sentence count is obtained on the basis of a rule using parsing information and POS information.","Subsequently, statistical values are calculated using the search result values (S). When the hit count is H(\u03b8), the candidate sentence count is S(\u03b8), and the correct sentence count is C(\u03b8) (where i denotes a test type and \u03b8 denotes a verb), the following three statistical values are calculated by Equation 1, Equation 2, and Equation 3 (S).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["Absolute","hit","ratio"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mtext":":"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["A","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["H","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}},{"msub":{"mi":["H","i"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"(*","mo":")"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["Relative","hit","ratio"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mtext":":"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["H","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}},{"msub":{"mi":["H","\u03d5"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["Valid","ratio"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mtext":":"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["V","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["C","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}},{"msub":{"mi":["S","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"3"}}}]}]}}}},"Here, * is a wild card denoting all words, and \u03a6 denotes that no test is performed.","When the wild card is queried, the search engine automatically matches all words to the wild card position.

Portions of the embodiments may be implemented in a web server running one or more processes, for example, web server applications, to respond to various requests, for example, HTTPS, HTTP and\/or FTP, from remote browsers on computers. Through HTTP, the exchange system may provide a user interface graphics to various embodiments. The computing system environment may include, but not limited to, at least one computer having certain components for appropriate operation, execution of code, and creation and communication of data. For example, the computer includes a processing unit (typically referred to as a central processing unit or CPU) that serves to execute computer-based instructions received in the appropriate data form and format. Further, this processing unit may be in the form of multiple processors executing code in series, in parallel, or in any other manner for appropriate implementation of the computer-based instructions.","In order to facilitate appropriate data communication and processing information between the various components of the computer, a system bus is utilized. The system bus may be any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, or a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. In particular, the system bus facilitates data and information communication between the various components (whether internal or external to the computer) through a variety of interfaces, as discussed hereinafter.","The computer may include a variety of discrete computer-readable media components. For example, this computer-readable media may include any media that can be accessed by the computer, such as volatile media, non-volatile media, removable media, non-removable media, etc. As a further example, this computer-readable media may include computer storage media, such as media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVDs), or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage, or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the computer. Further, this computer-readable storage medium may include communications media, such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media, wired media (such as a wired network and a direct-wired connection), and wireless media (such as acoustic signals, radio frequency signals, optical signals, infrared signals, biometric signals, bar code signals, etc.). Of course, combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The computer may further include a system memory with computer storage media in the form of volatile and non-volatile memory, such as ROM and RAM. A basic input\/output system (BIOS) with appropriate computer-based routines assists in transferring information between components within the computer and is normally stored in ROM. The RAM portion of the system memory typically contains data and program modules that are immediately accessible to or presently being operated on by processing unit, e.g., an operating system, application programming interfaces, application programs, program modules, program data and other instruction-based computer-readable codes.","A user may enter commands, information, and data into the computer through certain attachable or operable input devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, etc., via a user input interface. Of course, a variety of such input devices may be utilized, e.g., a microphone, a trackball, a joystick, a touchpad, a touch-screen, a scanner, etc., including any arrangement that facilitates the input of data, and information to the computer from an outside source. As discussed, these and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through the user input interface coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a universal serial bus (USB). Still further, data and information can be presented or provided to a user in an intelligible form or format through certain output devices, such as a monitor (to visually display this information and data in electronic form), a printer (to physically display this information and data in print form), a speaker (to audibly present this information and data in audible form), etc. All of these devices are in communication with the computer through an output interface coupled to the system bus. It is envisioned that any such peripheral output devices be used to provide information and data to the user.","The computer may operate in a network environment through the use of a communications device, which is integral to the computer or remote therefrom. This communications device is operable by and in communication to the other components of the computer through a communications interface.
