{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims the priority benefit of the filing date of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/524,782, filed Nov. 24, 2003, which is incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference.","A computer listing is attached as an Appendix.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of application program interfaces (APIs) and language schemas.","Buyers, sellers, and other business partners, are increasingly utilizing electronic trading systems (e.g., electronic marketplaces) to collaborate and to do business with each other. Part of this collaboration may involve, for example, linking operational business processes. Business processes may be linked by the exchange of information, in agreed sequences and within agreed timeframes, between buyer and seller applications, and affiliated third party business service providers.","To facilitate the above-mentioned exchange of business information, buyer and seller applications, as well as applications of third party business service providers, may expose Application Program Interfaces (APIs) which allow applications to make calls (e.g., function calls) to other applications to either request or send information. However, as the number of buyers, sellers, and third party applications participating in the exchange of business information increases, the technical challenge of enabling this multitude of applications to exchange information increases. For example, the development of applications that are able to access APIs of a large number of other applications becomes increasingly burdensome and technically challenging.","According one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a server system to facilitate an exchange of messages with a remote client application. The server system includes a plurality of application servers hosting a plurality of applications. A plurality of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) provides programmatic access to the plurality of applications, each of the APIs being configured to receive request messages compiled by the remote client application. First and second request messages, respectively addressed to first and second APIs of the plurality of APIs, each comprise at least one common data component. Further, the first request message includes a first payload specific to the first API, and the second request message includes a payload specific to the second API.","A business language schema design framework for message exchanges in a trading system is described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is discussed below within the context of a network-based commerce system that supports a network-based, electronic marketplace. Buyers and sellers, utilizing buyer and seller applications, as well as third party business service providers, interact utilizing the electronic marketplace as a forum. Business processes may be driven by a wider range of electronic marketplace operational considerations, so as to enable buyers and sellers to conduct transactions utilizing the electronic marketplace. In one embodiment of the present invention, a buyer and seller communication model is proposed that identifies the requirements for message exchange sequences, message exchange timings, and the purpose of each message exchange.","In one embodiment, message exchanges comply with a business language schema component model. The business language schema design framework enables an electronic marketplace server system (e.g., the commerce system) to support a wide range of commerce transactions, including auction, fixed price buying and selling, product catalogs searches and payments. These transactions provide examples of communications between buying and selling applications via the electronic marketplace, as well as communications with other third party business service providers.","In an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a schema component model that provides an abstract definition of the business message payloads. Payloads may be defined in a way to support extensibility which enables other types of commerce transactions models to be made available via the marketplace (e.g., for electronic procurement, reverse auctioning, credit check, and shipment\/logistic activities).","The business language schema catalogs common business message components that may be utilized for any number of business communications facilitated by an electronic marketplace (e.g., auction, fixed price buying and selling, product catalog search, catalog-based listings, and electronic payment in support of item purchases). The business language schema, in one embodiment, enables a wide range of business applications to interoperate with XML web services APIs, and externally located and internally hosted clients.","Request\/response message payload components are defined by the business language schema which may be utilized to enable the building of a range of messages that may flow back and forth from buyers, sellers and third party business service providers to marketplace XML web services, these web services enabling trading parties to list, find, and sell items and services.","In various exemplary embodiments, message exchanges may be made, utilizing the business-language based message exchange model of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, with both external and internal business applications over synchronous communication and asynchronous communication links. Further, document-oriented synchronous messaging, as well as document-oriented asynchronous messaging, may be supported. As will be described in further detail below, a message packaging format may be a flavor of the XML messaging format (e.g., SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2, ebXML, or an e-mail format such as MIME or any other arbitrary message packaging format). Further, transport protocols used may include HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, or some other arbitrary transport protocol needed for particular business applications hosted remotely at a trading entity that requires moving data.","A schema design framework for a business language is accordingly provided, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, to support message payload definitions for a multitude of use cases and for use with a multitude of APIs. This may be accomplished via an extensibility model that includes base components, and business message components that support new transaction models and messaging components. Specifically, the base components provide a definition of basic core component types, basic components and aggregate components, including an abstract messaging framework. The business message components are based on the business information requirements for a particular use case.","Regarding the business messaging components, based on the business information requirements of a particular use case, the definitions of the basic set of messaging components are needed for a legacy transaction model can be supported utilizing the above mentioned base components in support of business message components. In one exemplary embodiment, the business language components for use in an electronic trading environment, such as that described below with respect to , may include: item, item transaction, shipping details, payment, address, user, buyer, seller and transaction components.","It will be appreciated that, over the course of time, many new types of business processes may be employed by a trading community (e.g., buyers, sellers and third party service providers) that utilize an electronic marketplace and accordingly that interface with services exposed by the electronic marketplace. Such new types of applications may exploit different types of transaction interfaces (e.g., APIs) exposed by an electronic marketplace. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention enables the reusability of certain components, both at a messaging and an application level, while providing for the extensibility to accommodate such new types of business processes and applications. Accordingly, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention proposes an abstract message payload framework that can be extended for many different types of messages and over different protocols, as may be required.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the business language schema design framework of the present invention may be utilized to achieve reusability, layering, extensibility, as well as ease of use and interoperability between a number of business processes and applications.","Further, the exemplary business language schema design framework seeks to avoid XML Schema Definition (XSD) features that present interoperability issues (e.g., WSDL and SOAP) in processes deployed on client application runtimes. Further, the exemplary framework seeks to take advantage of a wide a range of client run-time environments and development tools (e.g., ranging from public domain to commercially available software), and to decrease the cost of maintenance to clients to easily interpret messages by exploiting underlying reusable base and aggregate business components as well as extensibility features. An embodiment of the present invention also seeks to import, extend and or restrict schemas for a wide range of \u201cenumerated\u201d code types (e.g., ISO, currency and country codes) to use name spaces that enable modularity of business message components and corresponding XML web services APIs that consume and produce the resulting messages, and to satisfy the customization and extensibility needs of widely differing trading communities and transaction models. For example, the business language schema design framework seeks to be reusable in consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) trading communities.","In order to facilitate a framework for standardizing business information semantics in a flexible and yet interoperable manner, according to one embodiment, there may be provided application-specific message payload components that link back to a common set of core data components from which they are derived. Below are described core component concepts.","Business Language Schema Component Concepts","Core Component Type (CCT): a core component type is, in one embodiment, a low level construct that may have no meaning on its own. A core component type has a content component and additional components (e.g., mandatory or optional) which give it a specific meaning. An example of a core component type is an \u201camount\u201d, where the content part is a number (e.g., 87) and another required part is a unit (e.g., a Euro).","Basic core components: a basic core component represents, in the exemplary embodiment, a core business concept (e.g., a unique business semantic definition). This may be accomplished by employing a core component type (CCT) or a primitive data type (e.g., XSD data types) to which some other semantically unique object (e.g., a \u201cweight\u201d element is an instance of the core component type CCT Measure Type).","Aggregate core components: aggregate core components, in one exemplary embodiment, encapsulate two or more basic core components which represent higher-level business concepts (e.g., \u201cshipping address\u201d is an instance of Address Type). Each aggregate core component may have its own business semantic definition.","Having above provided a high level introduction, a more detailed description of an exemplary trading system, centered around a network-based commerce system, will now be described with reference to .","Platform Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22"]},"Turning specifically to the network-based commerce system , an Application Program Interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . Specifically, the API server  exposes multiple APIs to users of the commerce system . Each of these APIs supports one or more function calls to applications of the system .","The application servers  host one or more marketplace applications  and payment applications . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more databases servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases .","The marketplace applications  provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access the commerce system . The payment applications  likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment applications  may allow users to quantify for, and accumulate, value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints\u201d) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are made available via the marketplace applications . While the marketplace and payment applications  and  are shown in  to both form part of the network-based commerce system , it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments of the present invention, the payment applications  may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the commerce system .","Further, while the system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, the present invention is of course not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, system. The various marketplace and payment applications  and  could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.","The web client , it will be appreciated, accesses the various marketplace and payment applications  and  via the web interface supported by the web server . Similarly, the programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace and payment applications  and  via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . The programmatic client  may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the commerce system  in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client  and the network-based commerce system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["38","40","12","24","38","12","12"]},"Marketplace Applications",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","12","12","30","44","44"]},"A number of fixed-price applications  support fixed-price listing formats (e.g., the traditional classified advertisement-type listing or a catalogue listing) and buyout-type listings. Specifically, buyout-type listings (e.g., including the Buy-It-Now (BIN) technology developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) may be offered in conjunction with an auction-format listing, and allow a buyer to purchase goods or services, which are also being offered for sale via an auction, for a fixed-price that is typically higher than the starting price of the auction.","Store applications  allow sellers to group their listings within a \u201cvirtual\u201d store, which may be branded and otherwise personalized by and for the sellers. Such a virtual store may also offer promotions, incentives and features that are specific and personalized to a relevant seller.","Reputation applications  allow parties that transact utilizing the network-based commerce system  to establish, build and maintain reputations, which may be made available and published to potential trading partners. Consider that where, for example, the network-based commerce system  supports person-to-person trading, users may have no history or other reference information whereby the trustworthiness and credibility of potential trading partners may be assessed. The reputation applications  allow a user, for example through feedback provided by other transaction partners, to establish a reputation within the network-based commerce system  over time. Other potential trading partners may then reference such a reputation for the purposes of assessing credibility and trustworthiness.","Personalization applications  allow users of the commerce system  to personalize various aspects of their interactions with the commerce system . For example a user may, utilizing an appropriate personalization application , create a personalized reference page at which information regarding transactions to which the user is (or has been) a party may be viewed. Further, a personalization application  may enable a user to personalize listings and other aspects of their interactions with the commerce system  and other parties.","In one embodiment, the network-based commerce system  may support a number of marketplaces that are customized, for example, for specific geographic regions. A version of the commerce system  may be customized for the United Kingdom, whereas another version of the commerce system  may be customized for the United States. Each of these versions may operate as an independent marketplace, or may be customized (or internationalized) presentations of a common underlying marketplace.","Navigation of the network based-commerce system  may be facilitated by one or more navigation applications . For example, a search application enables key word searches of listings published via the commerce system . A browse application allows users to browse various category, catalogue, or inventory data structures according to which listings may be classified within the commerce system . Various other navigation applications may be provided to supplement the search and browsing applications.","In order to make listings, available via the network-based commerce system , as visually informing and attractive as possible, the marketplace applications  may include one or more imaging applications  utilizing which users may upload images for inclusion within listings. An imaging application  also operates to incorporate images within viewed listings. The imaging applications  may also support one or more promotional features, such as image galleries that are presented to potential buyers. For example, sellers may pay an additional fee to have an image included within a gallery of images for promoted items.","Listing creation applications  allow sellers conveniently to author listings pertaining to goods or services that they wish to transact via the commerce system , and listing management applications  allow sellers to manage such listings. Specifically, where a particular seller has authored and\/or published a large number of listings, the management of such listings may present a challenge. The listing management applications  provide a number of features (e.g., auto-relisting, inventory level monitors, etc.) to assist the seller in managing such listings. One or more post-listing management applications  also assist sellers with a number of activities that typically occur post-listing. For example, upon completion of an auction facilitated by one or more auction applications , a seller may wish to leave feedback regarding a particular buyer. To this end, a post-listing management application  may provide an interface to one or more reputation applications , so as to allow the seller conveniently to provide feedback regarding multiple buyers to the reputation applications .","Dispute resolution applications  provide mechanisms whereby disputes arising between transacting parties may be resolved. For example, the dispute resolution applications  may provide guided procedures whereby the parties are guided through a number of steps in an attempt to settle a dispute. In the event that the dispute cannot be settled via the guided procedures, the dispute may be escalated to a third party mediator or arbitrator.","A number of fraud prevention applications  implement various fraud detection and prevention mechanisms to reduce the occurrence of fraud within the commerce system .","Messaging applications  are responsible for the generation and delivery of messages to users of the network-based commerce system , such messages for example advising users regarding the status of listings at the commerce system  (e.g., providing \u201coutbid\u201d notices to bidders during an auction process or to provide promotional and merchandising information to users).","Merchandising applications  support various merchandising functions that are made available to sellers to enable sellers to increase sales via the commerce system . The merchandising applications  also operate the various merchandising features that may be invoked by sellers, and may monitor and track the success of merchandising strategies employed by sellers.","The network-based commerce system  itself, or one or more parties that transact via the commerce system , may operate loyalty programs that are supported by one or more loyalty\/promotions applications . For example, a buyer may earn loyalty or promotions points for each transaction established and\/or concluded with a particular seller, and be offered a reward for which accumulated loyalty points can be redeemed.","Data Structures",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["90","36","30","32","92","12","12","12"]},"The tables  also include an items table  in which are maintained item records for goods and services that are available to be, or have been, transacted via the commerce system . Each item record within the items table  may furthermore be linked to one or more user records within the user table , so as to associate a seller and one or more actual or potential buyers with each item record.","A transaction table  contains a record for each transaction (e.g., a purchase transaction) pertaining to items for which records exist within the items table .","An order table  is populated with order records, each order record being associated with an order. Each order, in turn, may be with respect to one or more transactions for which records exist within the transactions table .","Bid records within a bids table  each relate to a bid received at the network-based commerce system  in connection with an auction-format listing supported by an auction application . A feedback table  is utilized by one or more reputation applications , in one exemplary embodiment, to construct and maintain reputation information concerning users. A history table  maintains a history of transactions to which a user has been a party. One or more attributes tables  record attribute information pertaining to items for which records exist within the items table . Considering only a single example of such an attribute, the attributes tables  may indicate a currency attribute associated with a particular item, the currency attribute identifying the currency of a price for the relevant item as specified in by a seller.","Having above described an exemplary trading environment , within which an exemplary embodiment of the present invention maybe deployed, further details regarding a business language schema design framework, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, for message exchanges (e.g., within the trading environment ) are now described.  is block diagram illustrating a client-server architecture that may be deployed, for example, as part of the trading environment  described above with reference to . Referring specifically to , abstract request\/response messages  are sent between one of N third party systems, such as third party system , and a server system  that is accessed via a number of APIs exposed by respective API servers .","Thus, in broad terms, the third party system , using the client application , compiles a request message, which is directed to an API  (e.g., AddItem, GetItemTransaction, etc.) of the server system . Each API  in turn provides access through supported function calls to one of a plurality of applications, indicated generally by arrow , that have access to a database .","Turning now to , further details regarding the exemplary client application , hosted on a third party system , are shown. The client application  includes an abstract request\/response message process component  for processing the request\/response messages  shown in . In particular, the abstract request\/response message process component  comprises an Error Processor  and a Version Processor . The client application  further comprises an API-specific component  that includes XML schema definitions ,  for the various API's  with which the client application  is configured to communicate (e.g., API_ and API_ shown in ). A number of possible front end transport technologies, such as SOAP, MIME and HTTP, are shown to be supported by a transport handler .","The client application  also includes a message handler , and a serialization\/deserialization handler , in addition to the API specific component . Specifically, each third party system  may host a client application , which can exploit the abstract request\/response message via any one of the following processing components:\n\n","The transport handler  and the message handler can be formed from any standard, commercially available Software Development Kit (SDK) to which a third party has access in its development and runtime deployment environments.","The abstract request serialization and response deserialization handler  can be developed for client applications  once, and reused multiple times, thus reducing the cost of interfacing and also providing consistent interfacing with API-based application services exposed by the commerce system  over a wide range of transport and messaging particles. Such a \u201cwrite once and, use multiple times\u201d deployment is useful for trading communities, regardless of use case and other infrastructure components in support of transport, security and messaging protocols.","Turning now to , at the server side, an exemplary API Server  comprises a front end Presentation tier , which receives request messages and sends response messages, a Business tier  and a Data components tier . The Business tier  includes components corresponding to the various APIs, indicated generally by arrow . The benefits on the server side in terms of creating response payloads is that, as for request payloads, basic response components are compilable using reusable components.","The structure of exemplary abstract request and response messages ,  will now be described in detail with reference to . Referring first to the abstract request message , an exemplary abstract request message  comprises a Detail Level component  and an associated DetailCodeType . This advantageously allows the client application  to request a required level of detail within a listing, for example, relating to a particular item listed on the commerce system . The level of detail requested may range from a most detailed to a least detailed level. The abstract request message  further comprises an Error Language component  and an associated Language Identification Tag , and a Version_ID component  and an associated Version Identifier . The abstract request message  is then completed by providing a Request Payload component , for carrying any type of XML data .","An exemplary abstract response message  includes a Time Stamp component  and an associated DateTime , and an Acknowledgement component  and an associated AckCodeType . These components are used to acknowledge receipt of a request message of the received from a client application .","The abstract response message  further includes a Correlation_ID component  and associated String Identifier , an Error(s) Data component  and associated data , a Version_ID , a Build component  and a Response Payload component  for receiving any type of XML data .","The Correlation_ID component  and associated String Identifier  allow the abstract response message  to be correlated with a particular incoming request message , and to indicate this correlation to the requesting client application .","Thus, there is some commonality in the abstract request and abstract response messages  and , namely they both can carry any type of data, and both include version information.","The Error Language component  and the Error Data(s) component  ensure that the API request\/response messages consistently use, manage and communicate error components. Part of this is the ability to communicate versioning information identifying what version of an API a particular API server  is using to communicate with a client application  of a third party system  (e.g., a client  and ). Thus, for example, if a third party system  sends a request message that includes incorrect data or that does not comply with the published requirements of a target API, the Error Data(s) component  is used by the target API to communicate information regarding the error back to the client application . Thus, when an error is detected, a response message is generated by the relevant API, this response message being either a long message or a short message, and including an error code and associated severity code. This response message is sent to the relevant client application , thereby informing the client application  as to the nature of the error.","Regarding the version of the API that the API server  is using, versioning information is included in both a request message from a client application  to the API server , as well as a response message from the API server  back to the client application . This is indicated schematically by blocks  and  in . Thus, the respective version components in the request and response messages indicate a particular version of the API on the API server . In so doing, and in view of the fact that the API version used by the API server  typically changes, the client application  will have a way of detecting when it needs to upgrade the schema that it uses to format and generate request messages to the relevant.","An embodiment of the present invention facilitates extension of the behavior of the APIs in terms of the request and response message structures. In other words, the abstract request and response models can be extended to enable API requests and responses between a third party system  and any number of APIs provided by one or more API servers . For example, a particular server system may expose a number of APIs, each conforming to the basic request\/response messages described above. Thus, for example, the basic request\/response messages can be extended to enable an AddItem API, or a GetItem API, or a GetAccount API. Thus, for example, for a third party system wishing to exchange item information with the commerce system , the basic abstract request message may be extended with the addition of information conforming to a schema understood by a GetItem API.","In other words, this arrangement allows a third party system , hosting an appropriately configured client application , to communicate with multiple APIs with a degree of uniformity and predictability. In one embodiment, a uniform data processing model is utilized and supported by a number of APIs, thereby allowing developers of client applications to reuse parts of their code.","The abstract request and response data processing component  of a client application  allows a client application developer to create and modify a client application  to communicate with multiple APIs using a common portion of code. The abstract request and response data processing framework can be reused by a client application  for a number of APIs exposed by the commerce system , for example.","Dealing more specifically with the re-usability of the business language schema data components, in a specific exemplary deployment environment of a trading environment  such as that illustrated in , schema components may be defined such that they can be reused for multiple cases of purchasing and selling items listed via the network-based commerce system . Examples of such reuse are provided below:\n\n","In all of the above use cases, the client application  is required to send information back to a network-based commerce system  regarding items listed for sale via the commerce system . This may require description of an <item> structure in a consistent manner such that the client applications  from which the API calls originate understand the semantics of an item listed by a seller on the e-commerce system . However, since the context of each call from a client application  is different in each use case scenario, a different degree of information needs to be provided such that some data components are included or excluded.","Utilizing the item listing use case scenario described above, the issues described above can be addressed utilizing (1) an <item> data component model, and (2) multiple data validation levels.","Turning first to the <item> data component model, in terms of this model an \u201citem\u201d has required optional data components. These components internally also have child components that are required and optional components.","Accordingly, a single item component definition may be used for multiple API use cases, with the developers and designers of the APIs being able to select which elements of the item component must be present and which elements of an item component do not need to be present.","Turning now to the multiple data validation levels, when a client application  sends an API request message payload , an API processing payload may, in one embodiment, include the following sequence of validations:\n\n","The above sequence of validations, it will be noted, utilizes a single definition of key business data components such that data variability in request\/response messages can be supported in a controlled manner using the required validation logic for the business use case. For example, for the following the three exemplary APIs (GetItem, GetItem Transaction and SellerList), the same definition of an <item> business definition component can be used on the client side\u2014yet the APIs will return response messages with varying API data structures. This enables uniformity in a semantic definition, yet allows the return of different views of the <item> business component according to use case. Examples of response are provided in the attached Computer Program Listing Appendix.","Accordingly, a server system (e.g., a network-based commerce system ) that exposes multiple business application services can utilize these multiple exposed business applications in communicating with multiple client applications  in a way that the client applications  can understand and communicate. For example, information about an item with varying syntactic characteristics that correspond to an item is communicated (e.g., information about an item with varying syntactic characteristics that correspond to a data item component with a common semantic definition). The above contributes to the reusability of data components within, for example, a trading community with multiple use cases.","To develop a client application  that communicates with multiple APIs, or to modify an existing client application  to talk to multiple APIs, a developer downloads or imports XML schema definitions for each of the multiple APIs. For example, for an exemplary GetTransactionDetail API, the developer will need to import or download the corresponding schema for this API, and in particular the GetTransactionDetail request message as well as the GetTransactionDetail response message. Thereafter, the client application  will need to integrate these schema processing components with their own (e.g., as part of the API specific component ).","The above-described business language schema design framework is able to cater for messages being compiled in different data formats, ranging from a raw ACP format, to SOAP, to MIME to HTTP. Thus, for example, the same message data format can be used to transfer a request payload  from a client application  to the server, yet with the response payload  being sent from the server to the client application  in a different message format. From the point of view of the client application , a common data processing mechanism may be utilized. In other words, the request payload  and response payload  are transport and message data format independent.","With reference to , in exemplary use case scenarios, the abstract request\/response message  may be extended to an \u201citem listing\u201d use case  and a payment application use case . For the item listing use case , an abstract message  may be extended to be an Add_Item Request\/Response message  or a Get_Item_Transaction Request\/Response message . For the payment application use case , the abstract message  may be extended to be a Refund_Transaction Request\/Response  or a Get_Item_Transaction Request\/Response , merely for example.","An exemplary Get_Item_Transaction Request message is listed

This feature is described with reference to an example, such as the ListingDuration code type. Enumerated code types can be used for information components that may have a fixed set of values. For example, ListingDuration code type identifies how long an item may be listed on the commerce system . There are typically three different values that ListingDuration code type may assume, namely 7, 10 or 14 days. These can be enumerate in some constant data structure (e.g., weeks) so that, for example, a duration of 14 days can be formalized with the number \u201c2\u201d. Accordingly, any ListingDuration code type can only correspond to 7, 10 or 14 days. If the ListingDuration code type is attributed a value of 21 or 15, then such a value would violate the relevant XML schema definition.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, as and provides a \u201cforced element\u201d when encountering a value that violates an XML schema definition. Thus, a default value is provided as the enumerated code type can change over a period of time. Thus, in one month, an original XML schema definition may define 7, 10, 14 and 21 day duration values, but the next month, the updated up XML schema definition may be updated to remove the duration value of 21 days. Thus, when a client application , utilizing the original XML schema, attempt to provide a 21 day duration value against an updated API, this will be registered as a violation. To address this, the updated API will insert a \u201cdefault value\u201d, which can carry any value, into the response payload  of a response message  provided by the updated API and to the according client application .","Thus, an indication of a 21 day duration value duration value against the updated API of the commerce system  will be accepted, but as the updated API will issue a warning to the relevant client application  that it needs to upgrade the relevant XML schema. In use, the default value is only inserted by the API server into the response message when the server detects that the client is using an outdated version of the schema.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["250","124","12","250","12","124","124","12"]},"The method  commences at block , with the client application  including its version identifier (e.g., version_ID), identifying the version of an XML schema definition stored by the client application , within a request message  addressed to a particular target API.
