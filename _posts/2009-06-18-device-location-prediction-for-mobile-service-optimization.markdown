title: Device location prediction for mobile service optimization
abstract: Described technologies are generally related to predicting future mobile device locations and using the predictive information to optimize mobile communications service parameters. Mobile device locations may be predicted using real-time device location information, destination information, and location history. Predicted location information for a given device, and possibly other devices as well, may be used to adjust mobile communications service parameters such as handoffs, channel assignment, multipath fading response parameters, data rates, transmission modes, opportunistic scheduling parameters, location-based services, and location update rates.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile communications, by definition, provide communications services to devices that move through space. Mobile communications services must adapt to new device locations as the devices move. Effective adaptation is one aspect of providing quality mobile communications service.","Mobile communications services adapt to new device locations in a variety of ways such as switching communications channels and adjusting device, transmission, and network settings. A handoff is one example of adapting to new device locations. In mobile telecommunications, the term handoff refers to a process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one transmissions channel to another. There are a variety of reasons why a handoff might be conducted, including for example, when a mobile communications device in a cellular network is moving away from an area covered by a first cell, and entering an area covered by a neighboring cell. In this scenario, the call or data session may be transferred to the neighboring cell in order to avoid call degradation or termination when the mobile device moves outside the range of the first cell.","One or more current signal quality parameters may be monitored to decide when a handoff should be made. Current signal quality parameters may include, for example, current received signal power, current received signal-to-noise ratio, current bit error rate (BER), current block error\/erasure rate (BLER), current received quality of speech (RxQual), current distance between the mobile device and a base station, and other current signal quality parameters. In cellular communications, a mobile device and base stations of neighboring cells monitor each other's signals and the best target candidates are selected among the neighboring cells, based on current signal quality parameters. The handoff may be requested by the mobile device, by a base station associated with the first cell, or by a base station of a neighboring cell.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, may be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.","While adapting to new device locations by reacting to one or more current measurements is workable, one problem that occurs is, by the time that a mobile device or other network component can gather any required information and make a service decision, such as when to make a handoff, which neighbor cell to use, which network and channel to use, which data rate to set for a mobile device, or how many spatially-multiplexed data streams to allow for a mobile device, the location of the mobile device may have changed already, especially if the mobile device is moving quickly. In addition, the interference environment may also have changed, even if the mobile device is stationary, since other mobile devices may be moving. This often renders mobile service decisions no longer optimum, and can lead to significant degradation in performance for some mobile devices. Indeed, current wireless systems often add a significant margin to the required performance threshold to accommodate this degradation. For example, hysteresis is added for handoffs, such that the received signal level from a currently used base station needs to be well below that of another base station before a handoff occurs.","The present disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for predicting future mobile device locations, and optimizing mobile communications service parameters based on the predictive information. Mobile device locations may be predicted for example using one or more of real-time device location information, previous device location information, commuter information, velocity information, or time-of-day information. Location predictions may provide a basis for additional predictions such as a predicted interference environment, predicted multipath fading environments, and predicted service availability. Predictions may be calculated by a network server, by a mobile device, or by a third party location prediction service. Predicted location information may be used to adjust one or more mobile communications service parameters, such as for example handoffs, channels, multipath fading response parameters, data rates, transmission modes, opportunistic scheduling parameters, location-based services, and location update rates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","150","151","153","170","181","182","130","140"]},"In , locator device  may be coupled to location detection system  via communications connection , over which navigation data  and\/or real-time location information  may be transmitted. Inside location detection system , satellite  may be coupled with location detection server(s)  via communications connection , over which navigation data  and\/or real-time location information  may be transmitted. Location detection system  may also be coupled with communications network server(s)  via communications connection , over which navigation data  and\/or real-time location information  may be transmitted. Communications network server(s)  may be coupled with cell towers  and , via communications connections  and , respectively. Either of cell towers  and  may be coupled with mobile device  via communications connections  and , respectively. One or more of locator device data , service parameters , and mobile device communications data , may be transmitted over communications connections , ,  and . Mobile device  may be coupled with locator device  via communications connection , over which proximity detection data  and\/or various other data may be transmitted as discussed further below. Finally, locator device  and mobile device  are illustrated as disposed inside vehicle  in the illustrated embodiment.","In , locator device  may for example comprise a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. Mobile device  may be configured to use proximity detection data  to detect that it is in range of locator device . Upon detection, mobile device  may optionally acquire locator device data  from the locator device , and may establish a location information link for communication of real-time mobile device  location information to communications network server(s) . This may be accomplished for example by providing locator device data  identifying the locator device  to communications network server(s) . Network server(s)  may be arranged to establish a link to location detection system , such as the GPS, over which network server(s)  may receive real-time location information . Network server(s)  may thereby be arranged to track the location of locator device , and correspondingly, the location of mobile device . Location prediction module(s)  may be arranged to use the real-time location information  to predict future locations of the mobile device . For example, it may be predicted that device  will pass from the range of cell tower  into the range of cell tower , at a particular optimal time for handoff. Prediction data may be used by service parameters modules  to set service parameters for the mobile device  accordingly. Meanwhile, locator device  may be arranged to communicate real-time location information  to location detection system , or location information may otherwise be obtained by location detection system , so that detection system  may continue to have real-time location information . If mobile device  ceases to detect proximity detection data , it may inform the network server(s) , which may be configured to stop monitoring real-time location information , and may be configured to optionally switch to servicing mobile device  based on current location instead of predicted location. Mobile device communications data  may comprise regular device communications such as, for example, voice telephone calls and data transmissions, which may be handled by the communications network.","In the system depicted in , locator device  may comprise for example a stand-alone GPS unit or other stand-alone navigational device, a vehicle-based GPS unit or other vehicle-based navigational device, or a GPS device or navigational device integrated into mobile device . Locator device  may comprise a navigation device in which the user may enter destination data, such as in many vehicle navigation systems where such data may be provided as navigation data  to location detection system  and then to communications network server(s) , or to communications network server(s)  via mobile device . Navigation data  may be usefully leveraged by location prediction module(s) , because it may comprise explicit data about predicted locations, which may in some cases be more accurate than predicting locations based on historical movements or other metrics. Some embodiments may dispense with the locator device , and instead rely upon so-called cell phone location technology which triangulates the position of a mobile device based upon signals transmitted between device  and cell towers such as  and . Mobile device  may comprise for example a cellular telephone, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or a laptop computer.","In embodiments where mobile device  is separate from locator device , network server(s)  may be configured to determine that the two devices  and  are proximate to one another. In some embodiments this may be accomplished by receiving locator data  as described above. The mobile device  may have the capacity (for example, via Bluetooth, a mobile device dock to an automobile navigation system, or otherwise) to detect when mobile device  is in the vicinity of the locator device . Mobile device  may be configured to notify the server(s)  that mobile device  is in the vicinity of the locator device , and server(s)  may be configured to obtain information from the location detection system  for as long as mobile device  is in the vicinity of the locator device . In some embodiments, detecting that mobile device  is in the vicinity of the locator device  may be accomplished at the server(s)  by matching real-time location information  to triangulated location information associated with the mobile device .","In embodiments where mobile device  and locator device  may be integrated into a single unit, as in the case of many of today's smart phones which comprise integrated onboard GPS units, real-time device location information  may be obtained by the network server  directly from the mobile device . Mobile device  may be configured to determine a physical location from an integrated onboard GPS unit, and mobile device  may periodically transmit the determined physical location to the server(s) . Mobile device  may also be configured to determine its location using cell phone location triangulation techniques as set forth above, or for example via a user interface that allows a user to input location information.","Location prediction module(s)  may be configured to predict future mobile device  locations using a variety of techniques. For example, device locations may be predicted based on one or more of real-time location information, previous location information, commuter information, velocity information, or time-of-day information. Location prediction module(s)  may in some embodiments be arranged to collect data such as historical device location data, or other user data such as user home and\/or work addresses, and may be arranged to determine movement patterns based on the collected data. The determined movement patterns may be used by the location prediction module  to generate predictive data about a device's likely future location.","Predicting device locations based on real-time location information may involve, for example, applying known movement patterns to a present device location. For example, it may be that whenever a device is found to be on a certain southbound onramp to a particular highway, the device is likely to be at a location 10 miles south of the onramp in approximately 10 minutes.","Predicting device locations based on previous location information may involve, for example, applying known movement patterns to a present device movement pattern. For example, it may be that whenever a device is found to have been first in a first position on a particular highway, and five minutes later in a second position on the highway, the device may be accurately predicted to be in a third position along the same highway, for example at a location 10 miles south of the second position, in approximately 10 minutes.","Predicting device locations based on commuter information may involve, for example, applying known commute patterns to a present device location. For example, it may be known that a particular device commutes from point A to point B every weekday afternoon. Whenever a device is found to have left point A, it may be predicted that the device will be at point B in roughly 20 minutes, and may furthermore follow a predictable route to point B.","Predicting device locations based on velocity information may involve, for example, calculating a velocity comprising speed and direction of a device at a particular time. The velocity information may be used to predict the device locations along a same trajectory, or alternatively, to apply known movement patterns to the velocity information.","Predicting device locations based on time-of-day information may involve, for example, applying known movement patterns to a present device location based on time of day. For example, a commute-based prediction as discussed above may use time-of-day information. Also, it may be known for example that if a particular device moves away from point A at noon, the device is likely to proceed to a first location, while if the particular device moves away from point A at 5 o'clock, the device will most likely proceed to a second location.","Predicted location information may be used to adjust a variety of cellular network parameters, such as for example handoffs, channels, multipath fading response parameters, data rate, transmission mode, opportunistic scheduling, location-based service, or location update rate. Predicted movement information may be used to determine the update rate for network parameters, including when a wireless user sends update information and when the network recalculates the network parameters.","While the location prediction module  may be illustrated on the network server  in , the location prediction module  may in some embodiments be located on the mobile device , or on another network component such as a base station at a cell tower . When mobile device  is equipped with an onboard GPS or other locator device apparatus, the mobile device  may be well suited for aggregating device movement data and making predictions about future device movements. Moreover, in some embodiments information about details of historical device movements may be considered sensitive, private information which may be better suited for being retained on a personal device, rather than communicated to a network server. In such embodiments, prediction data generated by location prediction module(s)  implemented on device  may be communicated from device  to server(s)  to be used in determining service parameters, as described below. Alternatively, certain service parameters such as handoffs and handoff timing may be set by device  or a network component such as a base station at a cell tower . Also, in some embodiments, device location data and\/or predictive information may be obtained by a third party data supplier. The third party supplier may then provide prediction data to a network component such as the network server(s) , for example by exposing a networked database Application Programming Interface (API) to the network server(s) , for their use in retrieving device location predictions on an as-needed basis.","Location prediction information produced by location prediction module(s)  may be used by service parameters module(s)  to set service parameters at least in part based on predicted device  locations. Mobile communications service parameters that may be beneficially adjusted based on location prediction information include for example handoffs parameters (including which component to hand off to as well as time of handoff), channels, multipath fading response parameters, data rates, transmission modes, opportunistic scheduling parameters, location-based services, and location update rates. These parameters are described in the discussion of , operation , found below.","Network server  also may be arranged to store a variety of information to optimize the network's performance. For example, in order to integrate multiple wireless networks and provide content distribution to wireless devices, the network server  may be arranged to store data pertaining to wireless services (Wi-Fi, WiMAX, cellular, etc.) that are available at a given location, as well as the costs and capabilities of each service. For location-based services, the network server  may be arranged to store a mobile device current location and the services available at or near that location. For spectrum sensing for cognitive radio devices, the network server  may be arranged to estimate the interference environment at a given location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","170","201","200","210","220","230","210","220"]},"Depending on the desired configuration, processor  may be of any type including but not limited to a microprocessor (\u03bcP), a microcontroller (\u03bcC), a digital signal processor (DSP), or any combination thereof. Processor  may include one or more levels of caching, such as a level one cache  and a level two cache , a processor core , and registers . The processor core  may include an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a floating point unit (FPU), a digital signal processing core (DSP Core), or any combination thereof. A memory controller  may also be used with the processor , or in some implementations the memory controller  may be an internal part of the processor .","Depending on the desired configuration, the system memory  may be of any type including but not limited to volatile memory (such as RAM), non-volatile memory (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.), or any combination thereof. System memory  typically includes an operating system , one or more applications , and program data .","Applications - may include, for example, location prediction module(s)  and service parameters module(s) . Program data - may include real-time location data  and predictive future location data  that may be used by applications -, as well as any data needed for making location predictions as may be stored in data , and any data needed for adjusting service parameters based on the predictive future location data .","Real-time location data  may be acquired in several ways. In some embodiments, the data may be acquired from a location detection system such as GPS. GPS systems may also provide additional information in some embodiments, such as velocity information. Also, a GPS unit or other locator device may transmit information about its current location, allowing the information to be stored on a network server together with identifying information that allows it to be matched to other current or historic data about the same device user. For multiple users who share a single device, the network server application may have the capacity to keep track of each user's data separately. In other embodiments, the user's location may be determined via the user's mobile device, for example through measuring the mobile signal based on its proximity to nearby cell towers. In other embodiments, the user may manually specify his or her current location through a user interface on the user's mobile device.","Similarly, location prediction data  may be generated in several ways. In some embodiments, the network server may include a stored database of user- or device-specific information including historical and current location data. The data may be analyzed to generate the user's most frequently traveled routes, which may then be matched to real-time location data to predict future movement. In other embodiments, the server may access a database of commercially obtained third-party data, which may be matched to real-time location data to predict future movement. In other embodiments, location prediction data  may be received from a device equipped with a location prediction module, or a user may manually specify his or her intended destination through a user interface on the user's mobile device, such as by entering destination data in a navigation or directions lookup system. Note that navigational units also estimate the duration of a trip, and can therefore predict not just where a user will be but when they will be there.","The network server may also use program data  to calculate the user's direction of travel and velocity. It may then use the velocity information to determine the optimal rate at which it should update the stored real-time location data  and the predicted future location data . For example, for a vehicle traveling at  miles per hour, the network server may need to update its data every few seconds, while for a vehicle traveling at  miles per hour, the network server may need to update its data more frequently.","Computing device  may have additional features or functionality, and additional interfaces to facilitate communications between the basic configuration  and any required devices and interfaces. For example, a bus\/interface controller  may be used to facilitate communications between the basic configuration  and one or more data storage devices  via a storage interface bus . The data storage devices  may be removable storage devices , non-removable storage devices , or a combination thereof. Examples of removable storage and non-removable storage devices include magnetic disk devices such as flexible disk drives and hard-disk drives (HDD), optical disk drives such as compact disk (CD) drives or digital versatile disk (DVD) drives, solid state drives (SSD), and tape drives, to name a few. Example computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.","System memory , removable storage , and non-removable storage  are all examples of computer storage media. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that may be used to store the desired information and that may be accessed by computing device . Any such computer storage media may be part of device .","Computing device  may also include an interface bus  for facilitating communication from various interface devices (e.g., output interfaces, peripheral interfaces, and communication interfaces) to the basic configuration  via the bus\/interface controller . Example output devices  include a graphics processing unit  and an audio processing unit , which may be configured to communicate to various external devices such as a display or speakers via one or more A\/V ports . Example peripheral interfaces  include a serial interface controller  or a parallel interface controller , which may be configured to communicate through either wired or wireless connections with external devices such as input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, etc.) or other peripheral devices (e.g., printer, scanner, etc.) via one or more I\/O ports . Other conventional I\/O devices may be connected as well such as a mouse, keyboard, and so forth. An example communications device  includes a network controller , which may be arranged to facilitate communications with one or more other computing devices  over a network communication via one or more communication ports .","The communications connection is one example of a communication media. Communication media may typically be embodied by computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and include any information delivery media. A \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d may be a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal.

As discussed above, the network server  may be arranged to receive real-time location information for example from a location detection system such as a GPS unit, or directly from a device equipped with GPS or other navigational device that may be equipped to determine a physical location and transmit this location information to the server . The network server  may also be arranged to receive real-time information for example from a mobile device that may include radio location functionality, or may include a user interface that allows a user to input current location information.","In embodiments in which network server  is arranged to receive real-time location information from a location detection system such as GPS, operation  may comprise for example receiving GPS unit identification information, connecting with a GPS information provider, supplying the GPS information provider with the GPS unit identification information, and receiving from the GPS information provider location information associated with the identified GPS unit. In some examples, operation  may alternatively comprise receiving location information for one or more GPS units associated with a mobile device, and receiving or otherwise determining device location based on triangulated cell phone location. When the triangulated cell phone location matches a location of one of the GPS units, operation  may begin using GPS information corresponding to the unit for the mobile device location. When the triangulated cell phone location ceases to match the location of the one of the GPS units, as detected for example by a periodic location match update, operation  may stop using GPS information corresponding to the unit for the mobile device location.","In some embodiments, the network server may be arranged to identify a user associated with a mobile device through for example an identifying code transmitted by the navigational device or mobile device or a database lookup of the associated user, and may be arranged to store the real-time location information together with other recent or historical data relating to the same user. User movement patterns may thus be applied to a variety of different mobile devices the user may carry, and these movement patterns may be used to generate location predictions and set corresponding service parameters.","In a \u201cGenerate Mobile Device Velocity and Direction Information\u201d operation , the network server  may be arranged to determine the direction in which the device is traveling from the real-time location information received in step , and may calculate the device's velocity.","In a \u201cCalculate Mobile Device Location Update Rate\u201d operation , once the network server  has calculated the device's velocity, the network server may be arranged to calculate the optimal rate to update data about the device's actual and predicted location. As noted above, devices traveling at lower rates of speed may generally require less frequent update rates, while devices traveling more quickly may require more frequent update rates in order to continue to optimize network performance based on location prediction information.","In a \u201cGenerate Mobile Device Location Prediction Information\u201d operation , the network server  may be arranged to use one or more means of predicting the device's likely future location at a given time based on the device's current real-time location and one or more additional pieces of data, such as for example previous location(s), commuter information, velocity information, and\/or time of day information. In some embodiments, the network server  may be configured to query a database of stored user information to determine past patterns of movement and make a prediction based on those patterns. For example, the database may contain information that a user typically travels between a work location and a home location on a given route within a given timeframe on most weekdays. Given real-time location data that matches the beginning of the route and the timeframe, the server may be arranged to predict that the mobile device will continue to travel along the route and may be arranged to determine when the device is likely to arrive at various points along the route. The server  may be configured to update its real-time location data at a determined rate as set forth above, in order to confirm whether location predictions have been accurate so far and whether the predicted location data needs to be recalculated.","In other embodiments, the user may provide information through for example a user interface on the user's mobile device, indicating the user's intended location. The network server  may be arranged to calculate the vehicle's velocity and the route between the user's current real-time location and the user's intended destination, and may predict when the user is likely to arrive at various points along the route.","In other embodiments, the network server  may include a database or other form of third-party information, such as a commercial database of compiled information that may be used to predict a device's likely future location given its current location and direction of travel. The information in the database need not be specific to a device or user, but may offer predictions based on aggregated data from a number of devices\/users. For example, with prediction data showing that a large percentage of users travel a particular route at a particular time to a certain restaurant, the server may be arranged to predict that a particular device\/user on that route at that time is going to that restaurant. As noted above, the server may be configured to update its real-time location data at a determined rate in order to confirm whether its predictions have been accurate, and whether the predicted location data needs to be recalculated. The update rate may vary depending on whether the prediction is based on historic user-specific data or multi-user data.","In a \u201cSet Mobile Device Wireless Communications Service Parameter(s)\u201d operation , the network server  may be arranged to attempt to optimize network performance by setting one or more parameters for communicating with the mobile device based at least in part on the prediction information.","The prediction information may include, depending on the embodiment, location prediction information as well as additional prediction information that is based on or related to the location prediction information, such as a predicted interference environment, predicted multipath fading environments, and predicted service availability. In some embodiments, the prediction information may furthermore include prediction information relating to a plurality of mobile devices. The network may use the predicted location information relating to a plurality of devices, in combination with the capabilities of one or more of these devices, such as the ability to operate in certain modes (WiFi, WiMAX, cellular) with different levels of interference protection (e.g., using adaptive antennas), to set the network\/device parameters.","Mobile device wireless communications parameters may include, for example, one or more of a handoff parameter, a transmission channel parameter, a multipath fading response parameter, a transmission mode parameter, a data rate parameter, an opportunistic scheduling parameter, a location-based service parameter, and\/or a location update rate parameter.","A handoff may refer to the continuous provision of mobile service while a connection is in progress, which may be accomplished by changing the channel of the connection as the mobile device travels from one connection point to another. Handoff is a component of providing optimal network service. Badly designed handoffs tend to generate very heavy signaling traffic, which dramatically lowers the quality of service. To be successful, a handoff should be performed quickly, infrequently, and without the user noticing it. Using predicted location information may allow the network server  to optimize handoffs by proactively determining when a user is likely to require a handoff, and which cell to handoff to. These parameters may be sent to a mobile device, or to a base station associated with the handoff. By anticipating when a user is likely to be within range of certain cell towers, the server may be able to determine the optimal handoff parameters to minimize a loss of quality of service. Thus, the margin used with hysteresis for handoffs can be reduced or eliminated.","A transmission channel parameter may refer to the selection of a particular channel for wireless communication. Channels may be owned by various entities, such as different wireless communications service providers, and may have varying amounts of interference. Too many wireless access points on the same channel or on a neighboring channel may cause significant interference, particularly in high-density areas. In addition, certain channels may be shared by numerous non-wireless devices that may cause interference, such as microwave ovens, security cameras, Bluetooth devices, amateur radios, video senders, cordless phones, and baby monitors. Using predicted location information may allow the network server  to determine the optimal transmission channel by proactively scanning available channels to identify one or more channels with the least amount of interference, rather than waiting for the user to experience interference and seek a new channel. Also, past information on, or most recent measurement of, interference at a location by the mobile device, or other mobile devices, can be used to estimate the interference that will occur at a given time in the future and permit the mobile device parameters to be changed at the appropriate time to act proactively, rather than reactively.","A multipath fading response parameter may include any device communications parameter that is set in response to a multipath fading environment in which the device is located. Short term prediction of the multipath fading environments is explored for example in Jeng-Kuang Hwang and J. H. Winters, \u201cSinusoidal modeling and prediction of fast fading processes,\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 1998, pages 892-897, vol. 2.","A transmission mode may refers to the method of communication between the network server  and the mobile device. A given transmission on a communications channel may be characterized by the direction of the exchanges, the number of pieces of information sent simultaneously, and synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. In a simplex connection, the data flows from the transmitter to the receiver. In a half-duplex or alternating connection, the data flows in one direction or the other, but not both at the same time, making it possible to have bidirectional communications using the full bandwidth capacity of the line. In a full-duplex connection, the data flows in both directions simultaneously, causing the bandwidth to be divided in two for each direction of data transmission when the same transmission medium and transmission speed is used for both directions of transmission. Examples of transmission modes may include a cellular phone call routed through a cell tower, or a data transmission routed through a Wi-Fi hotspot. Using predicted location information may allow the network server  to determine the optimal transmission mode based on available services at the user's anticipated location. For example, the server may be configured to determine that there is an available Wi-Fi hotspot at the predicted location and may seamlessly transfer the user to that hotspot at the earliest possible moment, rather than waiting for the user to come within range and then scanning to find an available connection.","A data rate parameter may refer to the optimal rate (or approximately optimal rate) at which data may be sent from the network server  to the mobile device. In general, the greater the bandwidth of a given path, the higher the data transfer rate may be. Thus, the data rate may be limited by the bandwidth of the transmission mode or the type or quality of connection. Using predicted location information may allow the network server  to determine the maximum data rate at any given location along the user's predicted route and modulate the transmission of data based on the optimal rate. The server may also be arranged to set an opportunistic scheduling parameter based on the data rate determination.","Opportunistic scheduling may refer to scheduling data transmissions based on favorable channel conditions to achieve higher network performance. By predicting a device's available communication speeds, opportunistic scheduling may allow data transmission to be scheduled during relatively good conditions, thereby optimizing (or approximately optimizing) transmission speed and quality. Using predicted location information may allow the network server  to opportunistically schedule data transmissions for the optimal point (or approximately optimal point) along the user's predicted route. For example, if the server predicts that the user will be in the vicinity of a WLAN hotspot with maximum data rate, the server may delay the data transmission until the user is within that range, rather than transmitting the data less efficiently at a less optimal point along the route.","Location-based services may refer to information and entertainment services that may be accessed by mobile devices based on the geographical position of the mobile device. Examples of location-based services may include providing information about the nearest business or service, such as a restaurant or bank machine; providing turn-by-turn navigation to any address; locating people on a map displayed on the mobile device; receiving alerts, such as warning of a traffic jam; or providing location-based mobile advertising. Using predicted location information may allow the network server  to offer a greater range of location-based services, allowing users to access information relevant to the user's future locations as well as the user's current location. When tied to mobile device location patterns and destinations, gas levels, predicted meal times, etc., the network can predict what services will be needed and when, rather than waiting until a user determines that they should have stopped for services before the congestion occurred, for example.","Location update rate may refer to the frequency with which the server may request updated real-time location information from the mobile device. As noted above, the requested update rate may be determined by the vehicle's velocity, with faster travel speeds requiring more frequent updates. Because each location update may require computational power and may reduce the data rate available for content transmission, the network server  may be arranged to calculate the optimal times to request location updates based on for example the user's predicted proximity to a high-bandwidth network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","110","400","410","420","430","431","470","440","440","441","442","450","450","460"]},"In , communications device  may be coupled with communications network server(s)  via communications connection , over which locator device data \/service parameters \/mobile device communications data  may be transmitted by way of the wireless network .

It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms.
