Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a software update method and, more particularly, to a software update method for a display device.","2. Description of the Related Art","As technology advances, various small, thin, lightweight, power saving and portable smart information appliances such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) or notebook computers have been widely used in our daily life, and display devices disposed therein play a very important role as human-machine interfaces. The display device requires a software program installed therein to control the operation of the display device. In the design of the display device, the designer must code and test the software program for the display device repeatedly to obtain a release version of the software program which can control the operation of the display device. Even after the display device is sold in the market, the designer may further provide one or more update versions of the software program to add new functions or to solve compatibility problems to improve the usability or performance of the display device.","Traditionally, the update of the software program installed in the display device needs to use a burning device electrically coupled between a computer device and the display device to transfer the update version of the software program stored in the computer device to replace or patch the old release version of the software program installed in the display device. When a user finds that the display device cannot work well or wants to add new functions to the display device, owing to no burning device, the user cannot perform the update of the software program of the display device by himself or herself. Accordingly, the user has to send the display device to the manufacturer or service station so that it not only increases the service cost of the manufacturer but also makes the user inconvenient. Moreover, the burning device is more complex in operations and requires constant maintenance.","Furthermore, when the computer device updates the software program of the display device, the computer device should be electrically coupled to another display device such as a computer monitor to assist in displaying the update process of the software program of the computer device to increase the complexity and inconvenience in updating the software program. Therefore, there is a need for a display device whereby the user can perform the update of the software program of the display device by himself or herself, and the complexity in updating the software program of the display device can be reduced.","The present invention is directed to providing a software update method for a display device whereby a user can perform the update of a software program of the display device by himself or herself without using a burning device.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a software update method for a display device. The software update method includes: storing a first software program by a first memory of a computer device; electrically coupling the computer device to the display device; controlling a display card of the computer device by a public application programming interface (API) function of a driver program of the display card or by a physical address of the display card searched by a search program coded by an operating system of the computer device; transferring the first software program stored in the first memory to the display device through a display data channel (DDC) of the controlled display card; and, receiving the first software program by the display device and updating a second software program stored in a second memory of the display device into the first software program by a microcontroller of the display device.","In the software update method of the present invention, the software update method may further include reminding that the display device has already updated the second software program into the first software program by the display device, for example, by using an on-screen display (OSD) to display a reminding image on a screen of the display device.","In the software update method of the present invention, the first memory may be a flash memory, a hard disk or an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). The second memory may be a flash memory or an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM).","Accordingly, the present invention allows the user to perform the update of the software program of the display device by the display card of the computer device without using the burning device, and reminds the user whether the update is successful on the screen of the display device during the update of the software program of the display device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","10","20","10","12","14","16","16","20","22","24","26","24","16","24","22"]},"After the computer device  is electrically coupled to the display device , the processor  controls the display card  to transfer the first software program stored in the first memory  to the display device  through a display data channel (DDC) of the controlled display card . The DDC is a serial communication interface based on an inter-integrated circuit (C) protocol that provides communication between a display device and a computer device (e.g. a display card of the computer device). When the display device  receives the first software program, the microcontroller  controls updating the second software program stored in the second memory  into the first software program. When the display device  updates the second software program stored in the second memory  into the first software program, the display device  uses an on-screen display (OSD) to display a reminding image on the screen  to remind that the display device has finished the update of the software program of the display device. That is, the display device has already updated the second software program stored in the second memory  into the first software program.","In addition, there are two approaches to controlling the display card  to transfer the first software program stored in the first memory  to the display device  through the DDC of the controlled display card . The first approach is to control the display card by a public application programming interface (API) function of a driver program of the display card, which is provided by the manufacturer of the display card. However, not every manufacturer provides the public API function. The second approach is to develop a specific-purpose driver program including a search program coded by the developer through an operating system of the computer device , in which the search program is used to search a physical address of the display card to control the display card. For instance, the developer may code the search program of the display card  through a driver development kit (DDK) provided by the Microsoft Windows operating system of the computer device . Then, the processor  may use the search program to link a device database of the operating system to recognize the display card  in accordance with a vendor identification (ID) and a device ID and get the physical address of the display card  by the API function of the DDK. In the configuration of the computer device, devices such as a display card, an audio card and a network card have physical addresses for the operating system to control these devices and access related data. Hence, the processor  applies the physical address of the display card  to control the display card  to read the first software program stored in the first memory  and transfer the stored first software program to the display device  through the DDC of the controlled display card .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["20","20"]},"First, at the step S, the first memory  of the computer device  stores the first software program.","Next, at the step S, the computer device  is electrically coupled to the display device .","Next, at the step S, the display card  may be controlled by the public API function of the driver program of the display card . The display card  may also be controlled by the physical address of the display card  searched by the search program coded by the operating system of the computer device .","Next, at the step S, the display card  is controlled to transfer the first software program stored in the first memory  to the display device  through the DDC of the controlled display card .","Finally, at the step S, the display device  receives the first software program, and, then, the microcontroller  of the display device  updates the second software program stored in the second memory  of the display device into the first software program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1 and 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["20","110","108"]},"At the step S, the display device  reminds that the display device  has already updated the second software program stored in the second memory  into the first software program by using the OSD to display the reminding image on the screen  of the display device .","In summary, the present invention allows the user to perform the update of the software program of the display device by the display card of the computer device without using the burning device, and reminds the user whether the update is successful on the screen of the display device during the update of the software program of the display device.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing and other features of the disclosure will be apparent and easily understood from a further reading of the specification and claims and by reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
