Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified pulmonary hypertension into five groups:\n\n","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious, progressive and life-threatening disease of the pulmonary vasculature, characterized by profound vasoconstriction and an abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the walls of the pulmonary arteries. Severe constriction of the blood vessels in the lungs leads to very high pulmonary arterial pressures. These high pressures make it difficult for the heart to pump blood through the lungs to be oxygenated. Patients with PAH suffer from extreme shortness of breath as the heart struggles to pump against these high pressures. Patients with PAH typically develop significant increases in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and sustained elevations in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), which ultimately lead to right ventricular failure and death. Patients diagnosed with PAH have a poor prognosis and equally compromised quality of life, with a mean life expectancy of 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis if untreated.","Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the primary member of a family of potent vasoconstrictor peptides, which are known to play an essential role in mammalian cardiovascular physiology. ET-1 is synthesized de novo and released from endothelial cells in response to a variety of factors, including angiotensin II, catecholamines, cytokines, hypoxia and shear stress. Two receptor subtypes, endothelin receptor type A (ET) and endothelin receptor type B (ET), mediate the effects of ET-1. In humans, the ETreceptor is preferentially expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and is primarily responsible for the vasoconstrictive effects of ET-1. In contrast, ETreceptors are found mainly in the vascular endothelium, and their activation results in vasodilatation via production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The ETreceptor is also involved in regulation of circulating concentrations of ET-1, through effects on endothelin converting enzyme (ECE-1) expression, and the synthesis and reuptake of ET-1 by endothelial cells.","Ambrisentan is a non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with high affinity (\u02dc12 pM) for the ETreceptor. Bosentan, a non-selective, sulfonamide-class ERA, is approved for treatment of PAH in patients with WHO functional class III or IV symptoms. Sitaxsentan is another sulfonamide-class ERA that is selective for the ETreceptor. Sitaxsentan is currently under review for market authorization as a PAH therapeutic.","Myogen, Inc.

Improved drug therapies to treat pulmonary hypertensive disorders such as PAH are needed in the art. Further, methods for enhancing the clinical outcome for patients having pulmonary hypertension conditions would be highly desirable.","There is now provided a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition in a subject, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject, wherein, at baseline, time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.","There is further provided a method for providing an improved prognosis for a subject having a pulmonary hypertension condition, comprising administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to provide (a) a reduction of at least about 25% in probability of a clinical worsening event during the treatment period, and\/or (b) a reduction from baseline of at least about 15% in serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration; wherein, at baseline, time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.","There is still further provided a method for prolonging life of a subject having a pulmonary hypertension condition, comprising administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to increase life expectancy, from a time of initiation of treatment, by at least about 30 days; wherein, at baseline, time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.","There is still further provided a method for extending time to clinical worsening in a subject having PAH, comprising administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to decrease the probability of a clinical worsening event by at least about 25%; wherein, at baseline, time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.","There is still further provided a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition in a reproductively active male subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject, wherein fertility of the subject is not substantially compromised.","Any of the above methods is applicable to any pulmonary hypertension condition recognized in the WHO classification, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as classified in WHO Group 1.","There is still further provided a method for treating PAH in a subject, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject, wherein the PAH is associated with one or more of (a) a congenital heart defect such as a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt or Eisenmenger's syndrome, (b) portal hypertension, (c) use of a drug or toxin other than an anorexigen, (d) thyroid disorder, (e) glycogen storage disease, (f) Gaucher disease, (g) hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, (h) hemoglobinopathy, (i) myeloproliferative disorder, (j) splenectomy, (k) pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and\/or (l) pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.","There is still further provided a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition classified in WHO Groups 2-5 in a subject, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject.","Other embodiments, including particular aspects of the embodiments summarized above, will be evident from the detailed description that follows.","The present invention is based in part on a finding, in placebo-controlled clinical trials, that ambrisentan is effective for treatment of a pulmonary hypertension condition, more specifically pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), in subjects wherein the condition is relatively recently diagnosed. In the above-referenced presentation by Rubin (2004) at ATS 2004, subjects treated with ambrisentan were reportedly characterized at baseline by a mean time since diagnosis of 3.2\u00b13.8 years. In the absence of placebo control, it is not possible to determine how these subjects might have fared had they not been given the benefit of ambrisentan therapy.","It is noted, however, that a prediction based on the National Institutes for Health (NIH) registry is that only 74% of patients having a diagnosis of idiopathic PAH survive for 1 year (above-referenced presentation by Gali\u00e9 (2005) at ATS 2005). A cohort of patients that have survived with the disease for a longer period of time may not be representative of patients with more recent diagnosis, as that cohort may be inadvertently biased in favor of individuals better able to survive for a prolonged period.","The sooner treatment can begin after diagnosis, the better. Accordingly, in a first embodiment of the invention, a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition in a subject comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject, wherein, at baseline, time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years, for example not greater than about 1.5 years, not greater than about 1 year, not greater than about 0.75 year or not greater than about 0.5 year. In one aspect of the first embodiment, administration of ambrisentan can begin substantially immediately, for example within about one month or within about one week, upon diagnosis.","This method does not in any way negate ambrisentan therapy for subjects having a longer history of the condition. However, it recognizes that early intervention is advantageous. Benefits of the method to subjects having recent diagnosis (and poor prognosis without early intervention as exhibited, for example, in the NIH registry mentioned above) have now been quantified for the first time. Illustratively, in the placebo-controlled study described in Example 1 below, the median number of years for which PAH was present at baseline was 0.38 for subjects receiving placebo, 0.43 years for subjects receiving 2.5 mg ambrisentan daily, and 0.26 years for subjects receiving 5 mg ambrisentan daily. In the placebo-controlled study described in Example 2 below, the median number of years for which PAH was present at baseline was 0.54 for subjects receiving placebo, 0.33 years for subjects receiving 5 mg ambrisentan daily, and 0.60 years for subjects receiving 10 mg ambrisentan daily.","Except where otherwise indicated herein, the term \u201cbaseline\u201d herein means a time immediately prior to initiation of treatment with ambrisentan.","The term \u201cdiagnosis\u201d herein means recognition by a physician or clinician of a pulmonary hypertension condition, for example PAH, in the subject, by any means whether or not such diagnosis is confirmed by hemodynamic evaluation. In one aspect of the first embodiment, diagnosis is confirmed hemodynamically, for example in the case of PAH by presence of one or more, more typically two or all three of the following:\n\n","In one aspect, the pulmonary hypertension condition comprises PAH (WHO Group 1), for example idiopathic PAH, familial PAH or PAH associated with another disease or condition.","Pulmonary hypertension at baseline can be mild, moderate or severe, as measured for example by WHO functional class, which is a measure of disease severity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The WHO functional classification is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) system and is routinely used to qualitatively assess activity tolerance, for example in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment (Rubin (2004) 126:7-10). Four functional classes are recognized in the WHO system:\n\n","In one aspect of the first embodiment, the subject at baseline exhibits pulmonary hypertension (e.g., PAH) of at least WHO Class II, for example WHO Class II or Class III.","In another aspect, the subject at baseline exhibits mean PAP at rest of at least about 30 mmHg, for example at least about 35, at least about 40, at least about 45 or at least about 50 mmHg.","The term \u201ctreatment\u201d herein encompasses one or more of the following:\n\n","Except where otherwise indicated herein, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of ambrisentan is an amount (typically a daily amount administered over the course of a period of treatment) sufficient to provide any one or more of the effects mentioned above. Preferably the amount administered does not exceed an amount causing an unacceptable degree of adverse side effects.","What constitutes a therapeutically effective amount can vary depending on the particular pulmonary hypertension condition to be treated, the severity of the condition, body weight and other parameters of the individual subject, and can be readily established without undue experimentation by the physician or clinician based on the disclosure herein. Typically, a therapeutically effective amount will be found in the range of about 1 to about 25 mg\/day, for example about 2 to about 15 mg\/day, about 2.5 to about 10 mg\/day, or about 2.5, about 3, about 3.5, about 4, about 4.5, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9 or about 10 mg\/day.","Such an amount can be administered each day, for example in individual doses administered once, twice, or three or more times a day. However, dosages stated herein on a per day basis should not be construed to require administration of the daily dose each and every day. For example, if the ambrisentan is provided in a suitably slow-release form, two or more daily dosage amounts can be administered at a lower frequency, e.g., as a depot every second day to once a month or even longer. Most typically and conveniently for the patient, ambrisentan is administered once a day, for example in the morning.","The ambrisentan can be administered for an extended treatment period. Typically, the longer the treatment continues, the greater and more lasting will be the benefits. Illustratively, the treatment period can be at least about one month, for example at least about 3 months, at least about 6 months or at least about 1 year. In some cases, administration can continue for substantially the remainder of the life of the subject.","In this and other embodiments, ambrisentan can be administered by any suitable route including oral, rectal, intranasal, intrapulmonary (e.g., by inhalation) or parenteral (e.g., intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous) routes. Oral administration is most convenient for the majority of subjects and can occur independently of meal times, i.e., with or without food.","The ambrisentan can be administered in monotherapy or in combination therapy as described in greater detail hereinbelow.","In various aspects of the first embodiment, the subject experiences, during or following the treatment period, at least one of\n\n","Any suitable measure of exercise capacity can be used; a particularly suitable measure is obtained in a 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), which measures how far the subject can walk in 6 minutes, i.e., the 6-minute walk distance (6 MWD).","The Borg dyspnea index (BDI) is a numerical scale for assessing perceived dyspnea (breathing discomfort). It measures the degree of breathlessness after completion of the 6 minute walk test (6 MWT), where a BDI of 0 indicates no breathlessness and 10 indicates maximum breathlessness.","In various aspects of the first embodiment, the ambrisentan can be administered in an amount effective to adjust one or more hemodynamic parameters indicative of the pulmonary hypertension condition towards a more normal level. In one such aspect, mean PAP is lowered, for example by at least about 3 mmHg, or at least about 5 mmHg, versus baseline. In another such aspect, PVR is lowered. In yet another such aspect, PCWP or LVEDP is raised.","In various aspects of the first embodiment, the ambrisentan can be administered in an amount effective to improve pulmonary function versus baseline. Any measure of pulmonary function can be used; illustratively 6 MWD is increased or BDI is lowered.","In one such aspect, 6 MWD is increased from baseline by at least about 10 m, for example at least about 20 m or at least about 30 m. In many instances, the method of the present embodiment will be found effective to increase 6 MWD by as much as 50 m or even more.","In another such aspect, BDI, illustratively as measured following a 6 MWT, is lowered from baseline by at least about 0.5 index points. In many instances, the method of the present embodiment will be found effective to lower BDI by as much as 1 full index point or even more.","The SF-36\u00ae health survey provides a self-reporting, multi-item scale measuring eight health parameters: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). The survey also provides a physical component summary and a mental component summary. For further detail see, for example, Ware: SF-36\u00ae Health Survey Update, http:\/\/www.sf-36.org\/tools\/sf36.shtml.","In various aspects of the first embodiment, the ambrisentan can be administered in an amount effective to improve quality of life of the subject, illustratively as measured by one or more of the health parameters recorded in an SF-36\u00ae survey. For example, an improvement versus baseline is obtained in at least one of the SF-36 physical health related parameters (physical health, role-physical, bodily pain and\/or general health) and\/or in at least one of the SF-36 mental health related parameters (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and\/or mental health). Such an improvement can take the form of an increase of at least 1, for example at least 2 or at least 3 points, on the scale for any one or more parameters.","The ambrisentan can be administered in monotherapy or in combination therapy with one or more additional drugs, for example, as described in greater detail hereinbelow.","In a second embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for improving the prognosis for a subject having a pulmonary hypertension condition. The method of this embodiment comprises administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to provide (a) a reduction in probability of a clinical worsening event during the treatment period, and\/or (b) a reduction from baseline in serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration, wherein, at baseline, time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.","Time from first diagnosis, in various aspects of the second embodiment, can be, for example, not greater than about 1.5 years, not greater than about 1 year, not greater than about 0.75 year or not greater than about 0.5 year. In one aspect of the second embodiment, administration of ambrisentan can begin substantially immediately, for example, within about one month or within about one week, upon diagnosis.","In the method of the second embodiment, the ambrisentan is administered at a dose and frequency and for a period of treatment sufficient to provide one or both of the effects mentioned above. Preferably the dose administered does not exceed an amount causing an unacceptable degree of adverse side effects. The dose administered can vary depending on the particular pulmonary hypertension condition to be treated, the severity of the condition, body weight and other parameters of the individual subject, and can be readily established without undue experimentation by the physician or clinician based on the disclosure herein.","Typically, a suitable daily dose will be found in the range of about 1 to about 25 mg\/day, for example about 2 to about 15 mg\/day, about 2.5 to about 10 mg\/day, or about 2.5, about 3, about 3.5, about 4, about 4.5, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9 or about 10 mg\/day. Such an amount can be administered each day, for example in individual doses administered once, twice, or three or more times a day. However, dosages stated herein on a per day basis should not be construed to require administration of the daily dose each and every day.

Most typically and conveniently for the patient, ambrisentan is administered once a day, for example in the morning.","In the method of the second embodiment, the treatment period is long enough for the stated effect to be produced. Typically, the longer the treatment continues, the greater and more lasting will be the benefits. Illustratively, the treatment period can be at least about one month, for example at least about 3 months, at least about 6 months or at least about 1 year. In some cases, administration can continue for substantially the remainder of the life of the subject.","In various aspects of the second embodiment, the ambrisentan can be administered in monotherapy or in combination therapy as described in greater detail hereinbelow.","In a particular aspect of the second embodiment, the method is effective to provide a reduction of at least about 25%, for example at least about 50%, at least about 75% or at least about 80%, in probability of a clinical worsening event during the treatment period.","Clinical worsening event (CWEs) include death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for the pulmonary hypertension condition, atrial septostomy, initiation of additional pulmonary hypertension therapy or an aggregate thereof. Therefore, the present embodiment provides a method effective to provide a reduction of at least about 25%, for example at least about 50%, at least about 75% or at least about 80%, in probability of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for pulmonary arterial hypertension, atrial septostomy and\/or initiation of additional pulmonary hypertension therapy during the treatment period.","Time to clinical worsening of the pulmonary hypertension condition is defined as the time from initiation of a ambrisentan treatment regime to the first occurrence of a CWE.","In another particular aspect of the second embodiment, the method is effective to provide a reduction from baseline of at least about 15%, for example at least about 25%, at least about 50% or at least about 75%, in BNP concentration.","The pulmonary hypertension condition according to the second embodiment can comprise any one or more of the conditions in the WHO or Venice (2003) classification described above.

The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of PAH, as well as safety and tolerability of the study drug.","Study drug was provided in round, biconvex, oral tablets that were identical in appearance. Three strengths of active study drug, containing 1 mg, 2.5 mg or 5 mg of ambrisentan, were used in this study. All study drug was packaged in blister cards. Subjects were instructed to take study drug once daily (q.d.) by mouth (p.o.) in the morning, with or without food.","The maximum study duration was up to 14 weeks from the time of initial screening procedures to the final study visit (Week 12). Screening procedures were performed a maximum of 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. The maximum duration of study drug treatment was 12 weeks.","Placebo was indistinguishable from active treatment.","The number of subjects enrolled was 192 at 41 investigative sites.","Men and women, 18 years of age or older, with idiopathic PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD), e.g., mixed CTD, CREST syndrome, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), overlap syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, or PAH associated with anorexigen use or HIV infection were enrolled in this study. Subjects were to have a documented mean PAP\u226725 mmHg, PVR>3 mmHg\/L\/min, and PCWP or LVEDP<15 mmHg. Subjects must have been able to walk a distance of at least 150 m but no more than 450 m during 2 consecutive 6 MWTs to be eligible for inclusion in the study.","Study Design and Treatment","After a 2 week screening period, eligible subjects were stratified based on the underlying etiology of PAH (idiopathic or non-idiopathic) and were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (placebo, 2.5 mg or 5 mg ambrisentan) in a ratio of 1:1:1. One blinded dose reduction was permitted during the 12-week treatment period in the event of study drug intolerance (e.g., 5 mg to 2.5 mg, 2.5 mg to 1 mg, placebo to placebo). Subjects received a daily dose of 1 mg ambrisentan only if they reduced from the 2.5 mg dose group. Subjects were assessed for efficacy and safety at monthly intervals.","Due to the placebo-controlled design of this study, there was a 1 in 3 chance that a subject did not receive ambrisentan for a period of 12 weeks. Therefore, after a minimum treatment period of 4 weeks, subjects who met 2 or more of the following predefined early escape criteria may have been removed from the study:\n\n","Subjects receiving placebo who were removed from the study due to 2 or more early escape criteria were eligible to enter a long-term extension study, and receive active treatment with ambrisentan.","Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and total bilirubin were closely monitored in all subjects throughout the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential were required to undergo monthly pregnancy tests and to use a double method of contraception to reduce risk of pregnancy during the course of the study. Male subjects were required to undergo complete semen and hormone analyses to evaluate potential effects of ambrisentan on male fertility.","After completion of the 12-week study, subjects were eligible to enroll into the long-term extension study.","Efficacy Assessments","The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in 6 MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo.","The secondary efficacy endpoints included:\n\n","All adverse effects (AEs) reported during the course of the study were reported and summaries of all AEs were prepared showing frequencies and percentages of:\n\n","Liver function test (LFT) assessments were separately summarized by severity relative to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin.","For subjects who were on anticoagulants at any point during the study (regular visit or between visits), coagulation tests (prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR)) were completed. In addition to summary statistics by study visit, changes in PT and INR were examined relative to changes in warfarin-type anticoagulant dose. These analyses focused on the values at Week 0 and Week 12 and the percentage change from Week 0 to Week 12.","The results of semen samples and their normality or abnormality were assessed by an independent male fertility expert and summarized through frequency counts and percentages by treatment. Descriptive statistics for male hormone data were prepared by treatment for the Week 0 and Week 12 visits when data were collected. Change from Week 0 to Week 12 was determined. The male fertility hormone results were analyzed in combination with the semen sample results by a second independent male fertility expert.","Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarize frequency of normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, and abnormal and clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) results for each scheduled assessment time by treatment. All ECG data were digitally recorded and analyzed by a central reader. The following variables were analyzed: heart rate, RR and PR intervals, QRS duration, QT interval, QTcB, QTcF and ECG diagnostic variables. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize ECG results by treatment group and by week of ECG assessment.","Descriptive statistics for vital signs were reported for each scheduled assessment time by treatment and for the change from pre-dose Week 0 to each subsequent scheduled assessment by treatment.","Statistical Methods","A test of the null hypothesis of no treatment group difference in change from baseline in 6 MWD with 62 subjects per group had approximately 90% power to detect an average placebo-adjusted treatment effect of 35 m based on a 2-sample t-test and a standard deviation of 55 m.","The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For the ITT population, subjects were considered as belonging to their randomized treatment group, regardless of the actual treatment received.","The safety population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects were considered as belonging to a treatment group according to the highest actual treatment dose received. Any subject who received 5 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 5 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Any subject who received 2.5 mg ambrisentan on any day and never received 5 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 2.5 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Otherwise, any subject who received only placebo was included in the placebo group for safety analyses in the study.","The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in 6 MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, where the last observation was carried forward. Baseline 6 MWD was defined as the mean 6 MWD of the last two 6 MWTs prior to randomization.","Change from baseline for Weeks 4, 8 and 12 in each of the two ambrisentan treatment groups were compared to placebo. The mean change was reported with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated by normal theory. The primary comparison was the change from baseline to Week 12. The Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified by idiopathic and non-idiopathic PAH subjects was used for inference. A fixed sequence approach was used to control the type I error rate accounting for the two comparisons. The higher dose was first compared to placebo. Because the p-value from the Wilcoxon rank sum test was less than 0.05 for the 5 mg ambrisentan group, the difference was considered significant, and the lower dose was compared to placebo, again at the full 0.05 \u03b1-level.","The two ambrisentan dose groups were also combined and compared to the placebo group. A p-value was reported, but for descriptive purposes only, with no impact on the fixed sequence procedure used for comparing the two individual dose groups to the placebo group.","If both ambrisentan dose groups were superior to placebo for the primary endpoint, evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done by combining the subjects from the two dose groups for comparison to the placebo group. However, if only the 5 mg group was significant for the primary endpoint, evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done only for that dose group. Secondary endpoint analyses were stratified by idiopathic and non-idiopathic PAH subjects.","The two most important secondary endpoints, time to clinical worsening of PAH and change in WHO functional class, were compared to placebo using a weighted version of Hommel's extension of the Simes test, with an overall a of 0.05. Time to clinical worsening was assigned a weight of 80% while change in WHO functional class received 20% of the weight.

Similarly, 73.4% of subjects in the 2.5 mg dose group and 73.0% of subjects in the 5 mg dose group experienced at least 1 AE during the study.","Overall, more subjects in the placebo group compared to the ambrisentan groups prematurely discontinued from the study due to death, SAEs, AEs, and\/or the early escape procedure.","In general, more AEs were assessed as moderate and severe in the placebo group (43.1% and 18.5%, respectively) compared to the combined ambrisentan group (26.8% and 7.9%, respectively).","None of the 127 subjects who received ambrisentan developed any elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations >3.0\u00d7ULN, compared to 1 subject in the placebo group, and there were no notable mean changes from baseline at Week 12 for serum ALT and AST, and no differences between treatment groups. Furthermore, there was a notable decrease in mean total bilirubin and mean alkaline phosphatase that appeared to be dose-dependent.","Mean uric acid increased at Week 12 in the placebo group (+34.1 \u03bcmol\/l); whereas there was a substantial mean decrease in uric acid (\u221219.1 \u03bcmol\/l) in the combined ambrisentan group.","The analysis of male fertility hormones in combination with a limited number of subjects (n=6) providing serial semen samples did not suggest that ambrisentan was associated with an adverse effect on male reproductive potential.","More specifically, changes over baseline in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration at Week 12 were small, ranging from \u22120.25 IU\/liter (placebo group) to +0.58 IU\/liter (2.5 mg dose group). Although the baseline FSH concentrations for the placebo and 5 mg dose groups (7.6\u00b18.34 IU\/liter and 7.6\u00b15.69 IU\/liter, respectively) suggest possibility of some spermatogenic dysfunction prior to the first dose of study drug, the changes observed during the study were unlikely to be of substantial clinical relevance.","Minor increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration, ranging from 0.16 to 0.58 IU\/liter, were observed in all treatment groups, with no apparent difference between groups.","Increases from baseline in mean inhibin B concentration at Week 12 were observed for the placebo group (139.6\u00b195.34 pg\/ml) and the 5 mg dose group (131.2\u00b198.77 pg\/ml), but a decrease was observed in the 2.5 mg dose group (\u221243.2\u00b136.52 pg\/ml). Therefore, changes in inhibin B were not dose-dependent. Based on expert opinion, none of the mean inhibin B concentrations measured at baseline and Week 12 indicated presence or development of spermatogenic dysfunction.","Subjects in the placebo group had a minor increase (0.66\u00b13.904 nmol\/l) in testosterone concentration over the 12-week study; however, testosterone concentrations decreased in an apparently dose-dependent manner in subjects receiving ambrisentan (2.5 mg, \u22120.09\u00b14.595 nmol\/l; 5 mg, \u22122.61\u00b16.962 nmol\/l. The data were variable and the median values indicated little change. Furthermore, the Week 12 data did not represent a decrease below the lower range of normal (10.41 nmol\/l).","The ambrisentan treatment benefit observed by the primary and secondary endpoints of this study was robust, internally consistent, and clinically relevant.","Both doses demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in 6 MWD that was associated with a significant decrease in BDI. The improvement in 6 MWD was nearly twice as large in the 5 mg dose group compared to the 2.5 mg dose group, and improvements in 6 MWD were consistently dose-responsive for most subgroups evaluated. Furthermore, plasma BNP, a molecular marker that has been shown to decrease in patients with PAH who demonstrate improvements in 6 MWD or hemodynamics, was substantially reduced with ambrisentan treatment. Ultimately, these symptomatic improvements resulted in a patient's self-assessment of an overall better quality of life, as measured by statistically significant improvements in several scales of the SF-36\u00ae health survey.","In addition to the symptomatic improvements observed for exercise capacity and dyspnea, there was a more than 4-fold greater percentage of subjects in the placebo group who deteriorated by at least 1 WHO class compared to subjects in the ambrisentan groups. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in disease progression for subjects receiving ambrisentan compared to placebo as measured by the time to clinical worsening endpoint. This was associated with an 80% decrease in the risk of clinical worsening over the 12-week study for the ambrisentan group compared to placebo. The delay in disease progression was also apparent by the lower number of subjects in the ambrisentan treatment groups compared to placebo for each of the following safety categories: death, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and early escapes. Finally, the most frequent AE observed in this study was right ventricular failure, an indicator of disease progression, which was reported in more than 3 times the percentage of subjects in the placebo group compared to the combined ambrisentan treatment group.","In general, ambrisentan was well tolerated, as demonstrated by the lack of dose reduction and AEs leading to discontinuation. The most frequent AEs of clinical concern observed for subjects receiving ambrisentan were headache and palpitations. For the most part, these events were mild in severity and did not lead to study discontinuation. Peripheral edema, which has been reported frequently with other ERAs was observed at a similar or lower frequency in the ambrisentan groups compared to placebo. None of the 127 subjects that received ambrisentan developed elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations >3\u00d7ULN, and there were no increases in mean ALT or AST concentrations for either ambrisentan dose group. Furthermore, there appeared to be a dose-dependent decrease in mean total bilirubin and mean alkaline phosphatase. Decreases in hemoglobin concentration were observed early in the study and did not decrease further with continued treatment.","In conclusion, the treatment benefits observed for the primary and secondary endpoints of this study were robust, internally consistent, and clinically relevant. Ambrisentan was well tolerated, was associated with a manageable safety profile, and delayed disease progression, indicating a positive risk-to-benefit profile.","The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of ambrisentan on exercise capacity in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of PAH, as well as safety and tolerability of the study drug.","Study drug was provided in round, biconvex, oral tablets that were identical in appearance. Three strengths of active study drug containing 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of ambrisentan were used in this study. All study drug was packaged in blister cards. Subjects were instructed to take study drug once daily (q.d.) by mouth (p.o.) in the morning, with or without food.","The maximum study duration was up to 14 weeks from the time of initial screening procedures to the final study visit (Week 12). Screening procedures were performed a maximum of 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. The maximum duration of study drug treatment was 12 weeks.","Placebo was indistinguishable from active treatment.","The number of subjects enrolled was 202 at 46 investigative sites.","Men and women, 18 years of age or older, with idiopathic PAH, PAH associated with CTD, e.g., mixed CTD, CREST syndrome, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), overlap syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, or PAH associated with anorexigen use or HIV infection were enrolled in this study. Subjects were to have a documented mean PAP\u226725 mmHg, PVR>3 mmHg\/L\/min, and PCWP or LVEDP<15 mmHg. Subjects must have been able to walk a distance of at least 150 m but no more than 450 m during 2 consecutive 6 MWTs to be eligible for inclusion in the study.","Study Design and Treatment","After a 2 week screening period, eligible subjects were stratified based on the underlying etiology of PAH (idiopathic or non-idiopathic) and were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg ambrisentan) in a ratio of 1:1:1. One blinded dose reduction was permitted during the 12-week treatment period in the event of study drug intolerance (e.g., 10 mg to 5 mg, 5 mg to 2.5 mg, placebo to placebo). Subjects received a daily dose of 2.5 mg ambrisentan only if they reduced from the 5 mg dose group. Subjects were assessed for efficacy and safety at monthly intervals.","Due to the placebo-controlled design of this study, there was a 1 in 3 chance that a subject did not receive ambrisentan for a period of 12 weeks. Therefore, after a minimum treatment period of 4 weeks, subjects who met 2 or more of the following predefined early escape criteria may have been removed from the study:\n\n","Subjects receiving placebo who were removed from the study due to 2 or more early escape criteria were eligible to enter a long-term extension study, and receive active treatment with ambrisentan.","Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and total bilirubin were closely monitored in all subjects throughout the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential were required to undergo monthly pregnancy tests and to use a double method of contraception to reduce risk of pregnancy during the course of the study. Male subjects were required to undergo complete semen and hormone analyses to evaluate potential effects of ambrisentan on male fertility.","After completion of the 12-week study, subjects were eligible to enroll into the long-term extension study.","Efficacy Assessments","The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in 6 MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo.","The secondary efficacy endpoints included:\n\n","All adverse effects (AEs) reported during the course of the study were reported and summaries of all AEs were prepared showing frequencies and percentages of:\n\n","Liver function test (LFT) assessments were separately summarized by severity relative to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin.","For subjects who were on anticoagulants at any point during the study (regular visit or between visits), coagulation tests (PT, PTT and INR) were completed. In addition to summary statistics by study visit, changes in PT and INR were examined relative to changes in warfarin-type anticoagulant dose. These analyses focused on the values at Week 0 and Week 12 and the percentage change from Week 0 to Week 12.","The results of semen samples and their normality or abnormality were assessed by an independent male fertility expert and summarized through frequency counts and percentages by treatment. Descriptive statistics for male hormone data were prepared by treatment for the Week 0 and Week 12 visits when data were collected. Change from Week 0 to Week 12 was determined. The male fertility hormone results were analyzed in combination with the semen sample results by a second independent male fertility expert.","Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarize frequency of normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, and abnormal and clinically significant ECG results for each scheduled assessment time by treatment. All ECG data were digitally recorded and analyzed by a central reader. The following variables were analyzed: heart rate, RR and PR intervals, QRS duration, QT interval, QTcB, QTcF and ECG diagnostic variables. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize ECG results by treatment group and by week of ECG assessment.","Descriptive statistics for vital signs were reported for each scheduled assessment time by treatment and for the change from pre-dose Week 0 to each subsequent scheduled assessment by treatment.","Statistical Methods","A test of the null hypothesis of no treatment group difference in change from baseline in 6 MWD with 62 subjects per group had approximately 90% power to detect an average placebo-adjusted treatment effect of 35 m based on a 2-sample t-test and a standard deviation of 55 m.","The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For the ITT population, subjects were considered as belonging to their randomized treatment group, regardless of the actual treatment received.","The safety population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects were considered as belonging to a treatment group according to the highest actual treatment dose received. Any subject who received 10 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 10 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Any subject who received 5 mg ambrisentan on any day and never received 10 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 5 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Otherwise, any subject who received only placebo was included in the placebo group for safety analyses in the study.","The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in 6 MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, where the last observation was carried forward. Baseline 6 MWD was defined as the mean 6 MWD of the last two 6 MWTs prior to randomization.","Change from baseline for Weeks 4, 8 and 12 in each of the two ambrisentan treatment groups were compared to placebo. The mean change was reported with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated by normal theory. The primary comparison was the change from baseline to Week 12. The Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified by idiopathic and non-idiopathic PAH subjects was used for inference. A fixed sequence approach was used to control the type I error rate accounting for the two comparisons. The higher dose was first compared to placebo. Because the p-value from the Wilcoxon rank sum test was less than 0.05 for the 5 mg ambrisentan group, the difference was considered significant, and the lower dose was compared to placebo, again at the full 0.05 \u03b1-level.","The two ambrisentan dose groups were also combined and compared to the placebo group. A p-value was reported, but for descriptive purposes only, with no impact on the fixed sequence procedure used for comparing the two individual dose groups to the placebo group.","If both ambrisentan dose groups were superior to placebo for the primary endpoint, evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done by combining the subjects from the two dose groups for comparison to the placebo group. However, if only the 10 mg group was significant for the primary endpoint, evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done only for that dose group. Secondary endpoint analyses were stratified by idiopathic and non-idiopathic PAH subjects.","The two most important secondary endpoints, time to clinical worsening of PAH and change in WHO functional class, were compared to placebo using a weighted version of Hommel's extension of the Simes test, with an overall a of 0.05. Time to clinical worsening was assigned a weight of 80% while change in WHO functional class received 20% of the weight. These two tests served as a parallel gatekeeper, allowing the physical functioning scale of the SF-36\u00ae health survey to be tested if at least one of the first two secondary endpoints was significant. Lastly, the BDI was tested conditional on a significant result from the test of the SF-36\u00ae physical functioning scale.","Additional measures of interest included change from baseline measured after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo in ET-1, BNP and cTnT.","Disposition of randomized subjects is shown in Table 2.1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0318"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2.1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Subject disposition (% of randomized subjects)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"5 mg","10 mg","Combined"]},{"entry":[{},"Placebo","ambrisentan","ambrisentan","ambrisentan"]},{"entry":[{},"(N = 67)","(N = 67)","(N = 68)","(N = 135)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Randomized","\u200267 (100.0)","\u200267 (100.0)","\u200268 (100.0)","135 (100.0)"]},{"entry":["Completed","57 (85.1)","63 (94.0)","63 (92.6)","126 (93.3)\u2002"]},{"entry":["Withdrew","10 (14.9)","4 (6.0)","5 (7.4)","9 (6.7)"]},{"entry":"Reasons for"},{"entry":"withdrawal:"},{"entry":["Adverse event","1 (1.5)","1 (1.5)","1 (1.5)","2 (1.5)"]},{"entry":["Withdrawal of","1 (1.5)","0 (0.0)","0 (0.0)","0 (0.0)"]},{"entry":"consent"},{"entry":["Treatment with","1 (1.5)","0 (0.0)","0 (0.0)","0 (0.0)"]},{"entry":"other PAH"},{"entry":"therapeutic"},{"entry":"agents"},{"entry":["Other","1 (1.5)","2 (3.0)","1 (1.5)","3 (2.1)"]},{"entry":["Early escape","4 (6.0)","0 (0.0)","2 (2.9)","2 (1.5)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A total of 201 subjects, with a mean age of 50.1 years, received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the ITT and safety populations.

The most clinically important AEs observed in this study were peripheral edema, headache and nasal congestion. For the most part, these events were mild in severity and none led to study discontinuation. Serum aminotransferase abnormalities, which have been observed and treatment-limiting for other ERAs, were not observed in any subjects receiving ambrisentan. Furthermore, there were no increases in mean ALT and AST and there were notable decreases in mean total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase in subjects receiving ambrisentan. Decreases in hemoglobin concentration were observed early in the study and did not decrease further with continued treatment.","In conclusion, the treatment benefits observed for the primary and secondary endpoints of this study were robust, internally consistent, and clinically relevant. Ambrisentan was well tolerated and was associated with a manageable safety profile, indicating a positive risk-to-benefit profile.","The trials described in Examples 1 and 2 enrolled subjects from a population having PAH including idiopathic PAH and PAH associated with CTD, anorexigen use or HIV infection. Patients with pulmonary hypertension due to other etiologies were generally excluded. However, the efficacy and safety of ambrisentan observed in this classic PAH population, and the need for effective therapy in pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions, merits evaluation in these non-traditional groups. Therefore, a further study is conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of ambrisentan in both classic PAH patients (WHO Group 1) and in an expanded pulmonary hypertension patient population (WHO Groups 3 and 4).","This expanded population includes subjects having idiopathic and familial PAH; PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, HIV infection, drugs and toxins, thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher disease and splenectomy; pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), sleep-disordered breathing and alveolar hypoventilation disorders; and pulmonary hypertension due to thromboembolic obstruction of proximal and\/or distal pulmonary arteries. Four groups are of particular interest in this study:\n\n","Subjects having pulmonary hypertension associated with ILD or COPD must demonstrate a degree of pulmonary hypertension that is disproportionate to the severity of the underlying disease. Subjects with ILD must have total lung capacity \u226760% of predicted normal, mean PAP>35 mmHg, and PVR>3.5 mmHg\/l\/min (280 dyne\u00b7sec\/cm). Subjects with COPD must have forced expiratory volume in 1 second \u226750% of predicted normal, mean PAP>35 mmHg, and PVR>3.5 mmHg\/l\/min (280 dyne\u00b7sec\/cm).","The study is designed to evaluate improvements compared to baseline for the overall study population and for key subgroups of interest. The study also examines safety and tolerability of ambrisentan in a broad population of subjects with pulmonary hypertension.","The target population includes men and women, 18 years or older, with pulmonary hypertension as defined by the WHO clinical classification. Subjects must have a documented history of pulmonary hypertension and be able to walk at least 150-450 meters in a 6 MWT.","Subjects who have discontinued bosentan or sitaxsentan therapy due to aminotransferase abnormalities or lack of efficacy are eligible for this study. Subjects currently receiving chronic prostanoid therapy and\/or an oral PDE-5 inhibitor are also eligible for this study.","All subjects must have a documented mean PAP\u226725 mmHg, PVR>3 mmHg\/l\/min, and PCWP or LVEDP<15 mmHg. Subjects with ILD or COPD must meet the additional or stricter requirements stated above.","All hemodynamic data represent resting pressures and must be assessed no more than 1 year (52 weeks) prior to the screening visit. All pulmonary function tests must be assessed no more than 3 months (12 weeks) prior to the screening visit.","Certain etiology subgroups are of particular interest. Therefore, this study enrolls a minimum of 18 subjects in the following etiology subgroups:\n\n","This study also enrolls a minimum of 30 PAH (WHO Group 1) subjects receiving concomitant sildenafil therapy at baseline.","Enrollment continues (up to a maximum of 200 subjects) until the enrollment goals for each of the etiology subgroups, as well as the sildenafil subgroup, have been met.","The primary objective of this study is to evaluate effect of ambrisentan on exercise capacity in a broad population of subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Secondary objectives are to evaluate effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of pulmonary hypertension, long-term treatment success and survival. In addition, safety and tolerability of ambrisentan will be evaluated. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated in the overall study population and in various subgroups.","Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients with non-classical pulmonary hypertension may respond more slowly to therapy than the classical PAH population; therefore, the primary analysis of efficacy is evaluated after 24 weeks of treatment. Eligible subjects receive 5 mg ambrisentan once daily for the first 24 weeks. One dose reduction is permitted during the 24-week fixed-dose treatment period if a subject is not tolerating study drug (e.g., 5 mg to 2.5 mg). After the initial 24-week treatment period, investigators are allowed to adjust study drug dose as clinically indicated (available doses are 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg).","Subjects are monitored with clinical laboratory tests every 4 weeks throughout the study. These safety laboratory tests may be performed at a local phlebotomy laboratory or at the investigator clinic. In addition, the investigator assesses each subject for safety and efficacy at Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24. Following Week 24, subjects are assessed for safety and efficacy every 24 weeks.","Subjects who have received stable sildenafil treatment for at least 4 weeks are permitted to enroll in this study and continue receiving sildenafil in combination with ambrisentan. Subjects who are not receiving sildenafil treatment prior to enrollment are permitted to initiate concomitant sildenafil treatment; however, prior to addition of concomitant sildenafil treatment, investigators must conduct at least one 6 MWT after the subject has received 10 mg q.d. ambrisentan for a minimum of 4 weeks. Up-titration to 10 mg q.d. ambrisentan is allowed at any time after the Week 24 visit; therefore, concomitant sildenafil treatment may be added after 28 weeks of ambrisentan monotherapy. Furthermore, addition of concomitant sildenafil treatment requires that a subject meet two or more of the following predefined criteria:\n\n","The efficacy endpoints of 6 MWD, WHO functional class, BDI and BNP must be assessed immediately prior to initiation of sildenafil treatment to establish baseline efficacy prior to combination therapy.","Concomitant administration of an approved prostanoid treatment (i.e., i.v. epoprostenol, i.v. or subcutaneous treprostinil, or i.v. or inhaled iloprost) is permitted at any time after the Week 12 visit. The efficacy endpoints of 6 MWD, WHO functional class, BDI and BNP must be assessed immediately prior to initiation of prostanoid treatment to establish baseline efficacy prior to combination therapy.","Trough (pre-dose) and peak (2-hour) PK samples are collected at Week 0 and Week 4 to assess ambrisentan plasma concentrations. For subjects on concomitant sildenafil therapy, trough (pre-dose) and peak (1-hour) samples are collected at Week 0 and Week 4 to assess sildenafil and N-desmethylsildenafil plasma concentrations.","Male subjects complete semen and hormone analyses to evaluate potential effects of ambrisentan on male fertility.","The primary endpoint of this study is the change from baseline in 6 MWD at Week 24 for all subjects.","Secondary endpoints include:\n\n","Incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ambrisentan treatment, including elevations in AST and ALT >3\u00d7ULN, are evaluated for all subjects, as well as for key etiology subgroups, and concomitant sildenafil or prostanoid treatment.","All patents and publications cited herein are incorporated by reference into this application in their entirety.","The words \u201ccomprise\u201d, \u201ccomprises\u201d, and \u201ccomprising\u201d are to be interpreted inclusively rather than exclusively."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES","Example 1","Summary","Methods (Example 1)","Patients","Results (Example 1)","Patients (Study Population)","Discussion (Example 1)","Example 2","Summary","Methods (Example 2)","Patients","Results (Example 2)","Patients (Study Population)","Discussion (Example 2)","Example 3"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
