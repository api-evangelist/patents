R21-NS067613 and R01-DK075309 awarded by National Institute of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) often play key roles in cellular processes and human disease. Examples of biological events that involve PPIs include signal transduction, transcription, protein ligand-receptor interactions, and protein assembly. There are many instances in which it is therapeutically useful to block the interaction of a target protein with another protein or with a therapeutic agent (e.g., small molecule drug). Protein inhibition is the most common and successful target for drug treatment. However, the proteins involved in these interactions often lack compact pockets accessible to traditional ligand-discovery methods.","The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted electronically in ASCII format and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The inhibitor covalently linked to a rhodium(II) complex may be more selective and potent than inhibitor molecules that rely on organic non-covalent assembly or inorganic coordination assembly separately.","It has previously been shown that for enzyme inhibitors, multiple weak interactions can be combined to yield polyvalent ligands with enhanced potency and specificity. The present disclosure is based in part on hybrid structures utilizing cooperative organic-inorganic binding to a target protein.  illustrates the binding mechanism of such a hybrid structure.","The inhibitors may be covalently linked to a rhodium(II) complex through carboxylate side chains. In general, the rhodium(II) complex is capable of forming secondary contacts with a target protein, for example, at the periphery of a protein binding interface. Such secondary contacts facilitate interaction between the inhibitor and the target protein. The dirhodium centers can interact with specific amino acid residues delivering significantly more stabilization energy (up to 5 kcal\/mol) than noncovalent interactions (typically <1 kcal\/mol). In certain embodiments, the rhodium(II) metallopeptide may be capable of reversible coordination chemistry across a binding interface.","It is believed that to exploit reversible coordination chemistry across the binding interface, a discrete organic-inorganic complex must contain a stable organic-metal linkage, while allowing ligand exchange at the metal center in order to bind targeted side chains. Di-metal \u201cpinwheel\u201d structures, such as rhodium(II) tetracarboxylate, have well differentiated ligand environments containing both kinetically inert, equatorial \u03ba-carboxylate ligands and kinetically labile axial ligand sites (see ), with demonstrated capabilities to bind biologically relevant thiol and imidazole compounds in a reversible manner.","In general, inhibitors suitable for use include peptides, peptidomimentics, or a small molecule therapeutic (i.e., not peptide-based) that are capable of covalently binding to the rhodium(II) complex.","In certain embodiments, the inhibitor is a peptide that comprises a Lewis basic side chains (e.g., histidine or methionine). For example, a rhodium(II) metallopeptides may comprise Lewis basic side chains comprising glutamate (E3E) or methionine (E3M) peptides.","In certain specific embodiments, the inhibitor covalently linked to a rhodium(II) complex is capable of displacing representative peptide ligands from the PDZ domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-associated ligand CAL. The PDZ domain is a family of peptide-binding PPI modules named for the first three members: PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1.","In certain specific embodiments, the covalently linked to a rhodium(II) complex is an inhibitor of Na+\/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF 1) binding to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).","To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples of certain aspects of some embodiments are given. In no way should the following examples be read to limit, or define, the entire scope of the invention.","Rhodium(II) centers are capable of forming stabilizing secondary contacts at the periphery of a protein binding interface while examining the coiled-coil assembly of rhodium(II) metallopeptides with histidine-containing peptides. A rhodium(II) center linked to a coil at positions a and e of a heptad repeat abcdefg (See ) would be proximal to position g of the complementary peptide, E3X. It has been found that coordination of appropriate position g side chains strongly stabilizes the coiled coil. For example, thermal denaturation of a mixture of E3H and K3Rhrevealed a high melting temperature (T=66.1\u00b0 C.; See , entry 1 and ), in contrast to simple E3\/K3 dimers and to control experiments with non-coordinating phenylalanine (T=39.5\u00b0 C., , entry 1).","This coiled-coil stabilization reflects a specific interaction of the rhodium center. It has been shown that moving the histidine residue away from the interface, to position c, led to a drop in Tto 47.0\u00b0 C. (, entry 8, and ). The addition of large concentrations of imidazole, either before or after coiled-coil assembly, also led to a significant drop in melting temperature (to 46\u00b0 C., ), providing evidence for a reversible metal-ligand interaction. Finally, upon assembly with the E3H coil, the metallopeptide K3Rhexhibits a blue shift of the UV-vis absorption peak from 587 nm to 567 nm, consistent with a rhodium(II) tetracarboxylate containing axial nitrogen or sulfur ligands.","Coiled-coil assemblies with either glutamate (E3E) or methionine (E3M) peptides exhibited elevated Tvalues (50.2\u00b0 C. and >70\u00b0 C., respectively), consistent with carboxylate-rhodium or stronger thioether-rhodium interactions (, entries 3, 5-7). The Tvalues of 65-70\u00b0 C. represent the most stable intermolecular coiled coils yet reported for such a short peptide (21 amino acids), similar to stabilities achieved with covalent crosslinking Insertion of cysteine at the same position, on the other hand, led to a coiled coil with decreased stability.","To extend the concept of organic-inorganic cooperatively to the discovery of potent PPI inhibitors, interactions between the CAL PDZ domain (CALP) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) were examined. The C-terminus of CFTR interacts with several proteins (e.g. CAL, NHERF1). Despite its potential value as a target, inhibiting CALP is distinctly difficult due to its broad specificity and comparatively low baseline affinity. A screen of inverted peptide arrays was combined with in vitro fluorescence polarization measurements to identify selective CALP inhibitors. However, the potency of these inhibitors remained modest, with Ki\u22671.3 \u03bcM.","The CAL PDZ domain contains several histidine residues near the peptide-binding site, making it an attractive target for a hybrid organic-inorganic approach to inhibitor design (See ). To test the potential contributions of rhodium-based interactions to CALP inhibitor affinity, known methods were used to prepare metallopeptides based on sequences known to interact with CALP. PDZ binding requires free C-terminal carboxylates, and it was found to be convenient to metalate a peptide containing both C-terminal and side-chain carboxylates and then to isolate the side-chain-modified metallopeptide from the product mixture by HPLC (See ).","Inhibitor equilibrium dissociation (K) constants were measured using fluorescence anisotropy to observe the displacement of a fluorescent reporter peptide ( and ). The VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:1) peptide, derived from the native target CFTR, had a weak CALP affinity. Direct incorporation of a rhodium(II) center at the aspartate side-chain carboxylate (VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:2)) resulted in a decrease in the apparent inhibitory constant (K) relative to the parent peptide (, entries 1-2), but when the new value (6.3 \u03bcM) was compared to a simple rhodium complex, Rh(OAc), the improvement was not statistically significant. The apparent affinity of VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:2) was also comparable to that of a metallopeptide derived from a non-binding, scrambled control sequence, QLDVTR (SEQ ID NO:4) (, entry 4). Together, these data suggest that the effects seen with rhodium(II) addition at the Psite (P=C-terminal residue) of VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:1) are not specific.","Two metallopeptides having a site of rhodium attachment at the Pwere designed because it was believed that the structural analysis of the CALP domain indicated that the Pposition should be proximal to the His301 residue in this target (See ). , entries 5-8 demonstrate that these metallopeptides exhibit statistically significant and reproducible affinity enhancement relative to controls (, entries 5-8). Working with a sequence (EWPTSII (SEQ ID NO:5)) carrying a glutamate side chain at the Pposition, metalation increased binding affinity from 65 to 1.7 \u03bcM, a \u02dc40-fold enhancement. An even larger enhancement was seen with the sequence EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6), which contains the dominant C-terminal tetrapeptide identified by array screens. The metallopeptide EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:7) bound with the highest affinity yet reported for CALP (0.56 \u03bcM), a 75-fold change relative to the parent peptide ( and ). HSQC footprinting spectra in the presence of either the peptide or metallopeptide (supporting information) were well dispersed\u2014confirming binding to the canonical PDZ site, with localized differences.","A CALP-H301A mutant was prepared to ascertain the role of His301 in metallopeptide affinity. This mutant binds the parent EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6) with a Kvalue of 80 \u03bcM, only slightly (\u02dc2-fold) weaker than the wild-type protein. However, the mutant binds the metallopeptide with an apparent Kof 9.2 \u03bcM, a >16-fold loss of affinity relative to wild-type, consistent with the predicted His301-rhodium ligation.","To provide an independent demonstration of rhodium-based affinity enhancement and to establish the efficacy of rhodium metallopeptides in a more complex environment, a pulldown inhibition assay was performed using epithelial cell lysate. Relative to the non-metalated control, the metallopeptide EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:7) exhibits improved inhibition, demonstrating that the affinity gains carry over to a more physiological environment ().","As shown in , Western blot of native CAL was captured from epithelial lysates, in the presence of increasing concentrations of EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6) peptide with (+Rh) or without (\u2212Rh) rhodium. Quantification reveals dose-dependent inhibition of CAL pulldown (PD) by the metalated peptide (n=3) as shown in . Thus, the metalation improves inhibitor potency.","The metallopeptide EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:7) (K=0.56 \u03bcM) is the first reported inhibitor with sub-micromolar affinity for the CAL PDZ domain and is significantly shorter than decameric single-micromolar alternatives. In addition, comparative binding studies with the CALP-H301A mutant and with Pmetalated peptides indicate that rhodium mediates affinity enhancement through peripheral interactions specific to the given target binding site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 28","sub":"norm"},"Materials and Methods","Solvents and reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific and used as received. Millipore ultra-purified water (18 M\u03a9) was used in all cases.","Synthesis of known compounds: The dirhodium precursor cis-Rh2(tfa)2(OAc)2,1 substrate coil peptides and catalysts K3a,eRh2 and K3g,dRh2,2 as well as the diazo reagent [2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethyl (E)-4-phenyl-2-diazo-3-butenoate (1)3a were prepared and purified according to published procedures that are known in the art.","Peptide synthesis: All peptides were synthesized with an Advanced ChemTech APEX 396 Automated Multipeptide Synthesizer using standard solid-phase Fmoc protocols. Rink amide MBHA resin (AAPPTEC) or preloaded Wang resin (AAPPTEC) was used to afford C-terminal amides or carboxylates, respectively. The peptides were acetylated at the N-terminus prior to cleavage from the resin. The purification was accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC with gradients of water-acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and peptides were isolated by lyophilization. Analysis and purity assessment was attained by mass spectrometry and analytical HPLC.","Protein reagents: The expression vector for the CALP-H301A mutant was prepared by PCR mutagenesis using the WT vector as a template. Mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of the WT and mutant CAL PDZ domains were performed according to commonly described and known methods in the art. The preparation of 15N-labeled protein for NMR analysis followed known published protocols.","HPLC: HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu CBM-20A instrument with Phenomenex Jupiter 4\u03bc Proteo 90A (250\u00d715 mm preparative) and Phenomenex Jupiter 4\u03bc Proteo 90A (250\u00d74.6 mm analytical) columns. Flow rates of 8 mL\/min and 1 mL\/min were used for preparative and analytical columns, respectively. Analytical and preparative HPLC were performed with gradient of acetonitrile in water. Both solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) unless otherwise noted. Data was collected using UV-vis absorption at 220 nm and 300 nm.","Mass Spectrometry: MALDI-MS was performed on a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex MALDI-TOF\/TOF mass spectrometer with CHCA matrix (10 mg\/mL, Thermo Scientific Pierce). Data analysis was performed with the mMass program.","NMR: Peptide characterization: 1H spectra were recorded on Bruker 500 UltraShield\u2122 (500 MHz) spectrometer (for EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6) system) and on Oxford (400 MHz) spectrometer (for VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:1) system). The chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in units of part per million (ppm) relative to solvent peak. HSQC footprinting: 25 \u03bcM N-labeled CAL PDZ protein was also subjected to H, N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) analysis, as described, except that tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was omitted from the final dialysis buffers. Spectra were measured either in the presence of 125 \u03bcM EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6), 45 \u03bcM Rh-EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6), or no peptide, each at a final concentration of 2.5% (v\/v) DMSO. HSQC backbone crosspeaks were assigned by comparison with the previously assigned CALP apo spectrum. NMR comparisons of Dirhodium attachment results to the peptides are shown in . Additionally HSQC analysis and results are shown in .","UV-Vis: UV-Vis spectra were recorded on Varian-Cary 50 scan UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. The spectra were acquired with 1000 nm\/min scanning speed in the range of 200-750 nm, in a quartz cuvette of -cm path length. Visible absorption spectra of c are detailed in .","Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy: Thermal denaturation experiments (\u22125-105\u00b0 C. with a gradient of 1\u00b0 C.\/min) were performed on a Jasco-J810 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier temperature controller (Jasco PTC423S). Solutions of 1:1 E3-peptide and K3-metallopeptide (both components 100 or 33 \u03bcM) in aqueous buffer in a 0.1 cm sealed cell were analyzed, and ellipticity data were acquired at 222 nm (red data points, S-5). When imidazole additive was utilized, ellipticity data were acquired at 225 nm. Temperature denaturation curves were fit to a two-state unfolding model and plotted (black line, S-5) as fraction unfolded vs. temperature as described previously by Lavigne et al.8 Error associated with the non-linear least squared-determined Tm was determined using the freely available \u201cSolver Statistics\u201d macro for Microsoft Excel. The representative studies of the thermal denaturation of the Dirhodium peptide assemblies are shown in .","Protein binding studies: Fluorescence anisotropy inhibition binding assays were performed using standard procedures. Briefly, wells were prepared containing 1.8 \u03bcM (WT) or 5.5 \u03bcM (H301A) CAL PDZ protein, 30 nM fluorescein-labeled iCAL36 reporter (Tufts University Core Facility), and varying concentrations of inhibitor peptides (VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:1) and EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6), with and without rhodium side-chain modification). Following equilibration, fluorescence anisotropy values were determined using a Tecan Infinite M1000 plate reader (n=3). Inhibitor equilibrium dissociation (Ki) constants were estimated as described. DMSO and rhodium(II) acetate were used as negative controls for unlabeled and labeled peptides, respectively.","Capture inhibition assays: To determine the ability of inhibitor peptides to displace the interactions of full-length CAL in the presence of the epithelial-cell proteome, a capture inhibition assay was developed. Briefly, using published methods a biotin-conjugated peptide \u201cbait\u201d sequence (BT-iCAL36) was immobilized on streptavidin beads and incubated with clarified lysates of CFBE4lo\u2212 cells to capture full-length CAL in the presence of cellular proteins. For the inhibition assay used here, capture was performed in the presence of a dilution series of metalated or non-metalated EVQSTRL (SEQ ID NO:6) inhibitor peptides. Beads were washed and eluted, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using an \u03b1-CAL antibody. Band intensities were separately quantified and averaged (n=3).","Synthetic Procedures.","General procedure for synthesis of CFTR-derived metallopeptides: Example synthesis of VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:2): The peptide VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:1) (15.0 mg, 19.4 \u03bcmol) and Rh2(tfa)(OAc)3 (10.1 mg, 20.4 \u03bcmol) were charged into a 1-dram vial equipped with a stir bar. A solution of MES buffer (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, 19.4 mL, 0.1 M aq soln, pH 4.9) was added. The reaction was heated at 50\u00b0 C. overnight, after which all reactants were consumed based on HPLC analysis. The resulting mixture of dirhodium-peptide complexes were purified by direct injection of the reaction mixture onto a preparative HPLC column. The metallopeptide bound through the C-terminal carboxylate eluted first, followed by the desired aspartate-bound metallopeptide, which was isolated by lyophilization to afford a fluffy light blue powder (8.35 mg, 46% yield). Smaller amounts of the later-eluting bis-dirhodium metallopeptide could also be isolated. Analysis and purity assessment was attained by ESI-MS and analytical HPLC. The site of metalation was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy on the basis of chemical shifts of protons proximal to the bound dirhodium. Dirhodium attachment resulted in discernible changes to one leucine H\u03b4 methyl (from 0.87 ppm to 0.65 ppm, \u0394\u03b41H ca. \u22120.22 ppm) in the C-terminal bound product VQDTRL(SEQ ID NO:10), and to the aspartate H\u03b2 methylene (from 2.81 ppm to 2.69 ppm, \u0394\u03b41H ca. \u22120.12 ppm) in the side-chain-bound metallopeptide, VQDTRL (SEQ ID NO:2) and as shown in .","Additional analysis and purity assessments of the CFTR-derived metallopeptide assemblies are shown in , B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, and B.","Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein.
