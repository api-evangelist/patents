{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to an electromagnetic weapon. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to a phased array with dynamic and semi-randomly arranged elements that can operate as an electromagnetic weapon.","In today's complex environment there is sometimes a need for military, police, or other entities to disengage or degrade certain hostile electronic equipment, cause premature detonation, or disable hostile explosive devices at a distance. Using conventional weapons or methods to accomplish these tasks may cause unwanted casualties or damage to certain equipment. Currently, there is no weapon or system that will damage electronic systems at a distance without potentially damaging other items or injuring people.","Thus, there is a need in the art to provide an electromagnetic weapon for degrading or destroying electronics or explosive devices that incorporates the listed benefits without the limitations inherent in present methods.","The present invention is directed to an electromagnetic weapon that includes semi-randomly arranged antenna elements and a central weapon computer. The antenna elements are coordinated to function as an active phased array capable of finding and exciting a resonate mode of a target. The central weapon computer controls all the antenna elements, and is able to determine the location of all the antenna elements.","It is an object of the invention to provide an electromagnetic weapon that can pinpoint and destroy or degrade electronics or detonate or disable explosive devices.","It is an object of the invention to provide an electromagnetic weapon that does not damage anything except the intended target.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . As seen in , the electromagnetic weapon  includes semi-randomly arranged antenna elements  and a central weapon computer . The semi-randomly arranged antenna elements  are coordinated to function as an active phased array capable of finding and exciting the resonate mode of a target. The central weapon computer  controls all the antenna elements , and is able to determine the location of all the antenna elements .","An antenna element  may be defined, but without limitation, as an object that radiates or receives radio waves or as a conductor by which electromagnetic waves are sent out or received. The antenna elements  used in the electromagnetic weapon  may be capable of omni-directional (in azimuth) broadcasting. The antenna elements  may have a battery or other self powered device or be connected to an electrical source. However, the antenna elements  may utilize any power source practicable. The antenna elements  may be dipoles or loops. A dipole antenna or dipole antenna element may be defined as, but without limitation, as any one of the class of antennas producing the radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole or an antenna consisting of two equal rods extending in opposite directions. A dipole may be defined, but without limitation, as a pair of electric point charges or magnetic poles of equal magnitude and opposite signs, separated by an infinitesimal distance. A loop antenna or loop antenna element may be defined, but without limitation, as an antenna that has one or more complete turns of conductor, excited so as to provide essentially uniform circulatory current, and producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary magnetic dipole.","As seen in , each antenna element  may include a radiating element , an amplifier , an attenuator , a phase shifter , and a communications link  to the central weapon computer . The radiating element , the amplifier , the attenuator  and the phase shifter  electronically communicate with the communications link , while the communications link  electronically communicates with the central weapon computer .","In one of the embodiments of the electromagnetic weapon , the attenuator  may be removed or set to zero. The radiating element  may be a dipole or loop antenna or some other radiating element that radiates largely equally in azimuth. The amplifier  amplifies incoming and outgoing microwaves. In the preferred embodiment the communications link  is a wireless radio frequency (RF) link , which sends and receives signals  from the central weapon computer . However, the communications link  may be any type of communications link such as, but without limitation, wires, coaxial wires, optical fibers, infrared data links, laser data links, or any type of communication link or data transfer apparatus practicable. The signals  received from the central weapon computer , via the RF communications link , set the amount of attenuation in the attenuator  and the amount of phase shift in the phase shifter . The signals  sent from the antenna element  to the central weapon computer , via the RF communications link , indicate the strength and frequency of incoming microwaves. The attenuator  reduces the strength of the incoming or outgoing signals. The central weapon computer  can set the attenuation amount for an individual antenna element . This variable attenuation of individual antenna elements , called sidelobe tapering, can reduce the amount of energy sent or received in the sidelobes of the antenna. Sidelobes of an antenna are in directions away from the main beam where the antenna has non-trivial gain, but a gain less than the main beam, and extraneous energy is sent and received in these directions. The phase shifter  controls the phase of the outgoing or incoming microwave, setting the main beam direction.","In operation, each antenna element  sends electromagnetic energy  (composed of microwaves) that corresponds to the resonate mode (eigenmode) of the intended target . The resonate mode (eigenmode) of the intended target  may be defined as, but without limitation, as the frequency of electromagnetic energy that causes a peak of oscillating currents in the target. The resonate mode of a target  may be found, but without limitation, by sending a sharp pulse, a chirp pulse, or a series of different frequencies and looking at the strength and frequency of the returns. The peak of oscillating currents is significantly greater than would be induced by only one wavelength of electromagnetic energy. The resonating electrical currents induced in the target  by the antenna elements  would destroy or degrade electronics, possibly even damaging robust electrical systems.","The antenna elements  do not need to directly interact with each other. Each antenna element  sends out and receives microwaves in a mostly omnidirectional pattern. These individual antenna patterns can combine in a preferred direction to form a main beam or main lobe (the individual beams  or microwaves combined) because the phase of each element can be set. The microwaves largely cancel out in other directions (sidelobes).","The central weapon computer  controls all the antenna elements , and may via measuring time delays or phase differences or differential GPS (global positioning system) of signals between antenna elements  determine the location of all the antenna elements . The central weapon computer  may control the timing of emission or reception of the signals, thereby forming a large antenna array. As seen in , a beam of intense electromagnetic energy  (the beam  includes the individual beams  or microwaves) can be formed and directed toward a particular spot, target, or focal point .","For each arrangement of antenna elements  and desired main beam  directions or focal point , the central weapon computer  calculates each antenna element's phase shift and, optionally, the attenuation. To transmit or receive microwaves, the central weapon computer  sends the desired frequency, phase shift, attenuation, and start and stop time to each antenna element  via the communications link . To receive microwaves, each antenna element  must send to the central weapon computer  the strength of the received microwaves (at the desired frequency) and the phase shift of the received microwaves (received phase shift) relative to the antenna element phase shift setting. Optionally, for receiving, the central weapon computer  may not send the phase shift and attenuation values but apply them after receiving the strength and received phase shift information from each antenna element .","The semi-randomly arranged antenna elements  are coordinated to function as an active phased array capable of finding and exciting the resonate mode of a target . A greater number of antenna elements  and wide spacing (large aperture) of the antenna elements  increase the energy on the target . The destructive effects are greatly increased by exciting the resonate mode of the target . The target  itself acts as an integrator of the energy placed on it.","Accurate frequency and phase settings between antenna elements  are important for the system to work. Frequency and phase coherency may be established and maintained by several methods including, but without limitation: local oscillators in each antenna element  that are updated for phase matching as needed via the communications link , the central weapon computer  broadcasting several frequencies that are combined by each antenna element  to provide the frequency and phase reference, or the central weapon computer  broadcasting a frequency that is multiplied or divided by each antenna element . If the central weapon computer  broadcasts the exact frequency to be used by the antenna elements  interference will result.","The antenna elements  may be dynamic, such as on vehicles in a convoy. The central weapon computer  may constantly re-measure the antenna element positions and adjust the beam forming to match. The antenna elements  may also be strung in a line and towed behind a vehicle such as an aircraft. In another embodiment of the invention, several people or vehicles have an antenna element . In another embodiment, some antenna elements  may be stacked vertically to achieve some measure of vertical beam directional control.","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements. The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.","Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims, and accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
