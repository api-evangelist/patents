{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel substituted 6-fluoro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridines, to processes for preparation thereof, to the use thereof, alone or in combinations, for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to the use thereof for preparing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. It is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","By forming cGMP, and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in different physiological processes, more particularly in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion, and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in the event of disorders based on disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and few side effects, a treatment of such disorders which targets the influence of the cGMP signal path in organisms and is NO-independent is a promising approach.","Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates, the effect of which is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of heme. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","In recent years, some substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, such as, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","WO 2008\/031513 discloses inter alia 1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridines as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. WO 2005\/030121 describes fused pyrazoles for the treatment of cancer diseases. WO 2011\/119518 and WO 2011\/115804 disclose carbamate-substituted pyrimidines for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.","It is an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and which have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to compounds known from the prior art, for example with respect to their in vivo properties such as their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior and\/or their dose-activity relationship.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"54.44mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09309239-20160412-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Rrepresents hydrogen or (C-C)-alkyl,\n    \n    ","Rrepresents (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl or a 4- to 7-membered heterocycle,\n    \n    ","Rrepresents (C-C)-alkyl or benzyl,\n    \n    "]}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds, comprised by formula (I), of the formulae mentioned below and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts and the compounds comprised by formula (I), mentioned below as embodiments, and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, if the compounds, comprised by formula (I), mentioned below are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","In the context of the present invention, preferred salts are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention.

Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, such as, more particularly, those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be of benefit, for example, for the study of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to the comparative ease of preparability and detectability, compounds labeled particularly with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. Furthermore, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic advantages as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore, in some cases, also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and\/or starting compounds.","Moreover, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Here, the term \u201cprodrugs\u201d refers to compounds which for their part can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents, unless specified otherwise, are each defined as follows:","Alkyl in the context of the invention is a linear or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

These auxiliaries include carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecylsulfate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants, for example ascorbic acid), dyes (e.g. inorganic pigments, for example iron oxides) and flavor and\/or odor correctors.","In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg\/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration, the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg\/kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg\/kg of body weight.","It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts, specifically as a function of the body weight, route of administration, individual response to the active compound, nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. For instance, in some cases, less than the aforementioned minimum amount may be sufficient, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of greater amounts, it may be advisable to divide them into several individual doses over the day.","The working examples which follow illustrate the invention. The invention is not limited to the examples.","The percentages in the tests and examples which follow are, unless indicated otherwise, percentages by weight; parts are parts by weight. Solvent ratios, dilution ratios and concentration data for the liquid\/liquid solutions are in each case based on volume.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0039","list-style":"none"},"li":["aq. aqueous solution","calc. calculated","DCI direct chemical ionization (in MS)","DMF dimethylformamide","DMSO dimethyl sulfoxide","eq. equivalent(s)","ESI electrospray ionization (in MS)","Et ethyl","h hour(s)","HPLC high-pressure high-performance liquid chromatography","HRMS high-resolution mass spectrometry","conc. concentrated","LC\/MS liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry","LiHMDS lithium hexamethyldisilazide","Me methyl","min minute(s)","MS mass spectrometry","NMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","Pddbatris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium","Ph phenyl","RT room temperature","Rretention time (in HPLC)","THF tetrahydrofuran","UV ultraviolet spectrometry","v\/v ratio by volume (of a solution)","XPHOS dicyclohexyl(2\u2032,4\u2032,6\u2032-triisopropylbiphenyl-2-yl)phosphine\n\nLC\/MS Methods:\n\nMethod 1 (LC-MS):\n"]}},"Instrument: Waters Acquity SQD UPLC System; column: Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8\u03bc 50\u00d71 mm; mobile phase A: 1 l of water+0.25 ml of 99% strength formic acid, mobile phase B: 1 l of acetonitrile+0.25 ml of 99% strength formic acid; gradient: 0.0 min 90% A\u21921.2 min 5% A\u21922.0 min 5% A; oven: 50\u00b0 C.; flow rate: 0.40 ml\/min; UV detection: 210-400 nm.","Method 2 (LC-MS):","Instrument: Micromass Quattro Micro MS with HPLC Agilent Series 1100; column: Thermo Hypersil GOLD 3\u03bc, 20 mm\u00d74 mm; mobile phase A: 1 l of water+0.5 ml of 50% strength formic acid, mobile phase B: 1 l of acetonitrile+0.5 ml of 50% strength formic acid; gradient: 0.0 min 100% A\u21923.0 min 10% A\u21924.0 min 10% A\u21924.01 min 100% A (flow rate 2.5 ml\/min)\u21925.00 min 100% A; oven: 50\u00b0 C.; flow rate: 2 ml\/min; UV detection: 210 nm.","Starting Materials and Intermediates:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0229"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00020","num":"00020"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00020","he":"18.71mm","wi":"26.67mm","file":"US09309239-20160412-C00020.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A suspension of 5.00 g (31.4 mmol) of 3,5-difluoropyridine-2-carboxylic acid in thionyl chloride (21 ml) was heated to reflux for 5 h.

Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous and Oral Administration:","The pharmacokinetic parameters of the substance are determined in male CD-1 mice, male Wistar rats and female beagles. The administration volume is 1 ml\/kg for mice, 5 ml\/kg for rats and 0.5 ml\/kg for dogs. Intravenous administration is via a formulation of species-specific plasma\/DMSO (99\/1) in the case of mice and rats and via water\/PEG400\/ethanol (50\/40\/10) in the case of dogs. The taking of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The surgical intervention takes place one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anesthesia and administration of an analgetic (carprofen 5 mg\/kg s.c.). Substance administration is as i.v. bolus in the case of mice and via a 15-minute infusion in the case of rats and dogs. Removal of blood is after 0, 0.033, 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours in the case of mice and after 0, 0.083, 0.25, 0.28, 0.33, 0.42, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours in the case of dogs and rats. For all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance via gavage is carried out based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation (50\/40\/10). Here, the removal of blood from rats and dogs is after 0, 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours. By contrast, oral administration is as a suspension using a 0.5% strength Tylose formulation. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation; if required, it can be stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (ZK 228859) is added to the unknown samples, calibration samples and QCs, and the protein is precipitated using excess acetonitrile. After addition of a sodium acetate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.8) and subsequent vortexing, the mixture is centrifuged at 1000 g and the supernatant is examined by LC-MS\/MS (API 4000, AB Sciex). Chromatographic separation is carried out on an Agilent 1100-HPLC. The injection volume is 10 \u03bcl. The separation column used is a Phenomenex Luna 5\u03bc C8(2) 100 A 50\u00d72 mm, adjusted to a temperature of 40\u00b0 C. A binary mobile phase gradient at 400 \u03bcl\/min is used (A: 0.01M ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.8, B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile): 0 min (90% A), 1 min (90% A), 3.50 min (15% A), 4.50 min (15% A), 4.60 (90% A), 7 min (90% A). The temperature of the Turbo V ion source is 500\u00b0 C. The following MS instrument parameters are used: curtain gas 20 units, ion spray voltage 5 kV, gas \u00bd 35 units, CAD gas 40 units. The substances are quantified by peak heights or areas using extracted ion chromatograms of specific MRM experiments.","The plasma concentration\/time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, t(half life) and CL (clearance) employing the validated pharmacokinetic calculation program KinEx (Vers. 2.5 and 3).","Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma, it is necessary to determine the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. To this end, a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (see above) and determined by calculating the quotient of the c\/cvalues.","Following intravenous administration of 0.3 mg\/kg of example 1 in rats, the following values were recorded:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0269","num":"0354"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Example","1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"AUC[kg * h\/l]","4.62"]},{"entry":[{},"C[l\/h\/kg]","0.33"]},{"entry":[{},"t[h]","1.38"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The compounds according to the invention can be converted to pharmaceutical formulations as follows:","Tablet:","Composition:","100 mg of the compound according to the invention, 50 mg of lactose (monohydrate), 50 mg of maize starch (native), 10 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 25) (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and 2 mg of magnesium stearate.","Tablet weight 212 mg, diameter 8 mm, radius of curvature 12 mm.","Production:","The mixture of the compound according to the invention, lactose and starch is granulated with a 5% solution (w\/w) of the PVP in water.
