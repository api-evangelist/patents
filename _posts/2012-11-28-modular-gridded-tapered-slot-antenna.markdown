No. 61\/610,499, filed Mar. 14, 2012, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Governmental Interest\u2014The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to communication systems and, more particularly, to tapered slot antennas.","Various structures have been developed in the field of antenna design to maximize signal strength and fidelity while minimizing cost and size. One antenna structure is the tapered slot antenna (TSA). Much of antenna design literature also use \u201ctapered-notch,\u201d \u201cflared-slot,\u201d and \u201ctapered-slot\u201d interchangeably with TSAs. TSAs consist of a tapered slot etched into a thin metal film, either with or without a dielectric substrate on one side of the film.","TSAs are travelling wave type antennas that offer simple, lightweight topology capable of radiating over a wide bandwidth with superior radiation performance and impedance matching compared to other slot antennas. TSAs are frequency independent, meaning the antenna pattern and impedance remain constant over a relatively wide frequency bandwidth. A TSA can be designed with a variety of taper profiles to optimize antenna pattern, bandwidth and\/or gain.","One profile has a gradual curve shape with an exponential taper that enables multiple operating frequencies and high gain, is known as an exponential TSA. The exponential TSA is able to operate over wide bandwidths and produce a symmetrical end-fire beam with appreciable gain and low sidelobes. The size of the guiding slot is constant in wavelength and TSAs have a broad operating frequency range, with constant beam width over this range.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["140","140","150","130","145","135","120","120","120","145","115","110","100","140","120","110","110","100","120","110","120","105","145","110","100","120","140","130","135","120"]},"The conventional ETSA faces challenges involving beam shaping and beam switching, especially in the context of antenna arrays. Specifically, the topology for wideband application is limited by the technique used to couple the feed line signal to the input slot. The feed line supplying the signal is typically soldered or otherwise electrically connected in a fashion that requires another layer and\/or is otherwise not easily removable. Furthermore, to create an array of ETSAs, requires multiple additional layers in the same plane or on different planes such as to require a large amount of additional materials.","The fabrication of conventional TSA antennas carries a high cost of materials for forming a solid curved conductive structure used to radiate the beam. The solid conductive metal on the substrate also creates undesirable surface waves with energy detracting from the radiated signal. Furthermore, the conventional TSA loses energy from the radiated signal to the conductive edges or through absorption into the substrate.","Therefore, a need exists for a compact, cost effective, robust antenna adaptable to operate at multiple frequencies.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise a planar antenna comprising: a substrate, a resonant element generating an electromagnetic wave, a plurality of parallel, spaced apart conductive strips on the substrate, wherein the conductive strips form collinear rows of at least two strips that are physically separated by a slot to guide the electromagnetic wave in a specific direction. Other and further embodiments of the present invention are described below.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures. The figures are not drawn to scale and may be simplified for clarity. It is contemplated that elements and features of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.","An embodiment of the present invention comprises a planar gridded exponential tapered slot antenna (GTSA) with a reconfigurable radiating element. The term \u201cgridded\u201d in this disclosure is to mean a one dimensional grid of substantially parallel, separated conductive strips .  illustrates a GTSA  comprising a director portion , and a portion for a modular resonator controller . The director portion  comprises a slot , a plurality of parallel conductive strips (directors)  disposed on a substrate , a modular resonator controller , a resonant element (resonator) , a microstrip feed line  disposed on a substrate , an optional reflector , and a connector . The optional reflector  helps improve forward gain and reduce the backward gain, thus giving a better front to back ratio (F\/B). In some embodiments there may be more than one reflector  or in other instances none at all.","The GTSA  comprises a plurality of conductive strips  arranged in collinear rows of at least two strips . Each pair of strips  defines a gap  between the ends of the strips . Cumulatively, the strips , taken together, are tapered to form an increasingly widened slot  driven by a resonant element . In one embodiment, the resonator element  of the GTSA  is a resonant dipole that propagates a signal  through the slot  using proximity excitation of the nearby conductive strips . The dipole  of the embodiment thus does not need to be electrically connected to the rest of the structure for operation and forms an adaptable structure when using different resonant sources. While the included examples focus on exponential tapering of the slot , other shapes such as linear tapering may be also realized within the scope of invention. In other embodiments, each strip  may be formed of strip segments (i.e. a collinear row may have more than two strips). Further embodiments may include substrate materials of predominantly air, with low dielectrics such as foam and cardboard or more conventional microwave substrates such as Duroid, FR4, and G10.","The strips  are able to perform the same wave guidance of the signal (arrow ) as a solid conductor, since the spacing  between successive conductive strips  is much smaller than a wavelength (\u03bb) of the propagating signal (\u03bb\/10, for example), the structure mimics a solid conductor. The strips  form collinear rows such that the spacing between rows allows the GTSA  to cumulatively mimic the electromagnetic wave propagation of a conventional solid conductor TSA. Compared to a solid conductor, the reduction in conductive material using the strips  reduces fabrication costs but also minimizes surface waves on the antenna and reduces transmission toss. The spacing  of the strips  may be uniform or different depending on the desired application requirements.","In some embodiments, the resonant dipole element  may share the same substrate  as the strips  or may be mounted to a modular controller . The ability to proximity excite the waveguide conductive strips  allows the resonant dipole element  to be modular and easily replaceable in some embodiments. In a modular controller , the resonant element  may be reconfigured such that the dipole element  may be moved with respect to the strips  through a separable substrate  demonstrated by the gap . Alternative embodiments may include a dipole element  that is replaceable wherein different resonant elements may operate at different resonant frequencies. In one embodiment, each modular controller  comprises a substrate  separate from the substrate  of the conductive strips . The modular controller  may also include a dipole element that is reconfigurable to radiate at different frequencies. The dipole may be adjusted with respect to the strips  for example, through at least one of switches, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), pneumatic structure, telescopic structure, hydraulic structure, conducting liquids and\/or the like.","The substrate  of the resonant element  further comprises a microstrip feed line  to communicate signals to and from a connector . Embodiments of the modular controller  may or may not include a reflector . The connector  may be a surface mount sub-miniature type-A (SMA) connector used to transmit and receive signals from various electronics such as receivers, transmitters, transceivers and\/or components thereof (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","3","3","250","280","225","225","220","285","285","335","285","200","240","225","220","285","220","225","260","250"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","405","110","420","410","415"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","505","510","535","515","520","525","530","515","530","515","530","535","515","530","515","530"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","620","625","610","605","615","620","625","615","620","810","615","625","605","615","610","605","615","605","610","630","615","605","610","600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","600","7","7","605","610","615","620","710","660","625","715","620","625","610","605","620","625","610","605"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","820","825","830","835","840","845","805","810","815","835","840","845","800","835","840","845","805","810","815","835","840","845","820","830","900","905","910","900","905","910"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8","FIG. 10"],"b":["1000","1005","1010","1015","1020","1025","1030","1015"]},"Some embodiments of the present invention involve mounting the gridded antenna on windows, composite, and plastics of vehicles.
