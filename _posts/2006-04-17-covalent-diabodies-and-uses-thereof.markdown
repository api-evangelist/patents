{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/671,657, filed Apr. 15, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention is directed to diabody molecules and uses thereof in the treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders, including immunological disorders and cancers. The diabody molecules of the invention comprise at least two polypeptide chains that associate to form at least two epitope binding sites, which may recognize the same or different epitopes. Additionally, the epitopes may be from the same or different molecules or located on the same or different cells. The individual polypeptide chains of the diabody molecule may be covalently bound through non-peptide bond covalent bonds, such as, but not limited to, disulfide bonding of cysteine residues located within each polypeptide chain. In particular embodiments, the diabody molecules of the present invention further comprise an Fc region, which allows antibody-like functionality to be engineered into the molecule.","The design of covalent diabodies is based on the single chain Fv construct (scFv) (Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In an intact, unmodified IgG, the VL and VH domains are located on separate polypeptide chains, i.e., the light chain and the heavy chain, respectively. Interaction of an antibody light chain and an antibody heavy chain and, in particular, interaction of VL and VH domains forms one of the epitope binding sites of the antibody. In contrast, the scFv construct comprises a VL and VH domain of an antibody contained in a single polypeptide chain wherein the domains are separated by a flexible linker of sufficient length to allow self-assembly of the two domains into a functional epitope binding site. Where self assembly of the is impossible due to a linker of insufficient length (less than about 12 amino acid residues), two of the scFv constructs interact with each other to form a bivalent molecule, the VL of one chain associating with the VH of the other (reviewed in Marvin et al., 2005, Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 26:649-658). Moreover, addition of a cysteine residue to the c-terminus of the construct has been show to allow disulfide bonding of the polypeptide chains, stabilizing the resulting dimer without interfering with the binding characteristics of the bivalent molecule (see e.g., Olafsen et al., 2004, Prot. Engr. Des. Sel. 17:21-27). Further, where VL and VH domains of differing specificity are selected, not only a bivalent, but also a bispecific molecule may be constructed.","Bivalent diabodies have wide ranging applications including therapy and immunodiagnosis. Bivalency allows for great flexibility in the design and engineering of diabody in various applications, providing enhanced avidity to multimeric antigens, the cross-linking of differing antigens, and directed targeting to specific cell types relying on the presence of both target antigens. Due to their increased valency, low dissociation rates and rapid clearance from the circulation (for diabodies of small size, at or below \u02dc50 kDa), diabody molecules known in the art have also shown particular use in the field of tumor imaging (Fitzgerald et al., 1997, Protein Eng. 10:1221). Of particular importance is the cross linking of differing cells, for example the cross linking of cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells (Staerz et al., 1985, Nature 314:628-631, and Holliger et al., 1996, Protein Eng. 9:299-305). Diabody epitope binding domains may also be directed to a surface determinant of any immune effector cell such as CD3, CD16, CD32, or CD64, which are expressed on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells or other mononuclear cells. In many studies, diabody binding to effector cell determinates, e.g., Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R), was also found to activate the effector cell (Holliger et al., 1996, Protein Eng. 9:299-305; Holliger et al., 1999, Cancer Res. 59:2909-2916). Normally, effector cell activation is triggered by the binding of an antigen bound antibody to an effector cell via Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction; thus, in this regard, diabody molecules of the invention may exhibit Ig-like functionality independent of whether they comprise an Fc domain (e.g., as assayed in any efferctor function assay known in the art or exemplified herein (e.g., ADCC assay)). By cross-linking tumor and effector cells, the diabody not only brings the effector cell within the proximity of the tumor cells but leads to effective tumor killing (see e.g., Cao and Lam, 2003, Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 55:171-197, hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","2.1 Effector Cell Receptors and their Roles in the Immune System","In traditional immune function the interaction of antibody-antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses, ranging from effector functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, mast cell degranulation, and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally related an antigen binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.","The Fc\u03b3 receptors, members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of proteins, are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fc\u03b3 portion of immunoglobulin molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the alpha chain of the Fc\u03b3 receptor. Fc\u03b3 receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fc\u03b3 receptors for IgG are referred to as Fc\u03b3R, for IgE as Fc\u03b5R, and for IgA as Fc\u03b1R. Different accessory cells bear Fc\u03b3 receptors for antibodies of different isotype, and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response (reviewed by Ravetch J. V. et al. 1991, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92; Gerber J. S. et al. 2001 Microbes and Infection, 3: 131-139; Billadeau D. D. et al. 2002, The Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2(109): 161-1681; Ravetch J. V. et al. 2000, Science, 290: 84-89; Ravetch J. V. et al., 2001 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 19:275-90; Ravetch J. V. 1994, Cell, 78(4): 553-60). The different Fc\u03b3 receptors, the cells that express them, and their isotype specificity is summarized in Table 1 (adapted from Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease, 4ed. 1999, Elsevier Science Ltd\/Garland Publishing, New York).","Fc\u03b3 Receptors","Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein, possessing extracellular domains related to a C2-set of immunoglobulin-related domains, a single membrane spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length. There are three known Fc\u03b3Rs, designated Fc\u03b3RI(CD64), Fc\u03b3RII(CD32), and Fc\u03b3RIII(CD16). The three receptors are encoded by distinct genes; however, the extensive homology between the three family members suggest they arose from a common progenitor perhaps by gene duplication.","Fc\u03b3RII(CD32)","Fc\u03b3RII proteins are 40 kDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig (10M). This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc\u03b3R, present on all hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and platelets. Fc\u03b3RII has only two immunoglobulin-like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc\u03b3RI. There are three human Fc\u03b3RII genes (Fc\u03b3RII-A, Fc\u03b3RII-B, Fc\u03b3RII-C), all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes.","Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc\u03b3RII-A and Fc\u03b3RII-B create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The fundamental difference is that the A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the B isoform initiates inhibitory signals, e.g., inhibiting B-cell activation.","Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16)","Due to heterogeneity within this class, the size of Fc\u03b3RIII ranges between 40 and 80 kDa in mouse and man. Two human genes encode two transcripts, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, an integral membrane glycoprotein, and Fc\u03b3RIIIB, a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-linked version. One murine gene encodes an Fc\u03b3RIII homologous to the membrane spanning human Fc\u03b3RIIIA. The Fc\u03b3RIII shares structural characteristics with each of the other two Fc\u03b3Rs. Like Fc\u03b3RII, Fc\u03b3RIII binds IgG with low affinity and contains the corresponding two extracellular Ig-like domains. Fc\u03b3RIIIA is expressed in macrophages, mast cells and is the lone Fc\u03b3R in NK cells. The GPI-linked Fc\u03b3RIIIB is currently known to be expressed only in human neutrophils.","Signaling through Fc\u03b3Rs","Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc\u03b3Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs (ITAMs) or immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIMS) account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the Fc\u03b3R-mediated cellular responses. ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R complexes include Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, whereas ITIM-containing complexes only include Fc\u03b3RIIB.","Human neutrophils express the Fc\u03b3RIIA gene. Fc\u03b3RIIA clustering via immune complexes or specific antibody cross-linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor-associated kinases which facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinase, activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates (e.g., PIK). Cellular activation leads to release of proinflammatory mediators.","The Fc\u03b3RIIB gene is expressed on B lymphocytes; its extracellular domain is 96% identical to Fc\u03b3RIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner. The presence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB defines this inhibitory subclass of Fc\u03b3R. Recently the molecular basis of this inhibition was established. When co-ligated along with an activating Fc\u03b3R, the ITIM in Fc\u03b3RIIB becomes phosphorylated and attracts the SH2 domain of the inosital polyphosphate 5\u2032-phosphatase (SHIP), which hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R-mediated tyrosine kinase activation, consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca. Thus crosslinking of Fc\u03b3RIIB dampens the activating response to Fc\u03b3R ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness. B cell activation, B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is thus aborted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"350pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Receptors for the Fc Regions of Immunoglobulin Isotypes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Fc\u03b3RI","Fc\u03b3RII-A","Fc\u03b3RII-B2","Fc\u03b3RII-B1","Fc\u03b3RIII",{},"Fc\u03b1RI"]},{"entry":["Receptor","(CD64)","(CD32)","(CD32)","(CD32)","(CD16)","Fc\u03b5RI","(CD89)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Binding","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgE","IgA1, IgA2"]},{"entry":[{},"10M","2 \u00d7 10M","2 \u00d7 10M","2 \u00d7 10M","5 \u00d7 10M","1010 M","10M"]},{"entry":["Cell Type","Macrophages","Macrophages","Macrophages","B cells","NK cells","Mast cells","Macrophages"]},{"entry":[{},"Neutrophils","Neutrophils","Neutrophils","Mast cells","Eosinophil","Eosinophil","Neutrophils"]},{"entry":[{},"Eosinophils","Eosinophils","Eosinophils",{},"Macrophages","Basophils","Eosinophils"]},{"entry":[{},"Dendritic cells","Dendritic cells",{},{},"Neutrophils",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Platelets",{},{},"Mast Cells",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Langerhan cells",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Effect of","Uptake","Uptake","Uptake","No uptake","Induction of","Secretion of","Uptake"]},{"entry":["Ligation","Stimulation","Granule release","Inhibition of","Inhibition of","Killing","granules","Induction of"]},{"entry":[{},"Activation of",{},"Stimulation","Stimulation",{},{},"killing"]},{"entry":[{},"respiratory burst",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Induction of",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"killing"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The present invention relates to covalent diabodies and\/or covalent diabody molecules and to their use in the treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders including cancer, autoimmune disorders, allergy disorders and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses.

In some cases, terms with commonly understood meanings are defined herein for clarity and\/or for ready reference, and the inclusion of such definitions herein should not necessarily be construed to represent a substantial difference over what is generally understood in the art. The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry, nucleic acid chemistry, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, Current Protocols in Immunology (J. E. Coligan et al., eds., 1999, including supplements through 2001); Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., 1987, including supplements through 2001); Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, third edition (Sambrook and Russel, 2001); PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction, (Mullis et al., eds., 1994); The Immunoassay Handbook (D.

Staines, eds., Weinheim: VCH Verlags gesellschaft mbH, 1993), Harlow and Lane Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999; and Beaucage et al. eds., Current Protocols in Nucleic Acid Chemistry John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 2000).","As used herein, the terms \u201cantibody\u201d and \u201cantibodies\u201d refer to monoclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, synthetic antibodies, chimeric antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, camelized antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032) fragments, disulfide-linked bispecific Fvs (sdFv), intrabodies, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id and anti-anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, IgG, IgA, and IgA) or subclass.","As used herein, the terms \u201cimmunospecifically binds,\u201d \u201cimmunospecifically recognizes,\u201d \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d \u201cspecifically recognizes\u201d and analogous terms refer to molecules that specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., eptiope or immune complex) and do not specifically bind to another molecule. A molecule that specifically binds to an antigen may bind to other peptides or polypeptides with lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIAcore, or other assays known in the art. Preferably, molecules that specifically bind an antigen do not cross-react with other proteins. Molecules that specifically bind an antigen can be identified, for example, by immunoassays, BIAcore, or other techniques known to those of skill in the art.","As used herein, immune complex, refers to a structure which forms when at least one target molecule and at least one heterologous Fc\u03b3 region-containing polypeptide bind to one another forming a larger molecular weight complex. Examples of immune complexes are antigen-antibody complexes which can be either soluble or particulate (e.g., an antigen\/antibody complex on a cell surface.).","As used herein, the terms \u201cheavy chain,\u201d \u201clight chain,\u201d \u201cvariable region,\u201d \u201cframework region,\u201d \u201cconstant domain,\u201d and the like, have their ordinary meaning in the immunology art and refer to domains in naturally occurring immunoglobulins and the corresponding domains of synthetic (e.g., recombinant) binding proteins (e.g., humanized antibodies, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, etc.). The basic structural unit of naturally occurring immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG) is a tetramer having two light chains and two heavy chains, usually expressed as a glycoprotein of about 150,000 Da. The amino-terminal (\u201cN\u201d) portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal (\u201cC\u201d) portion of each chain defines a constant region, with light chains having a single constant domain and heavy chains usually having three constant domains and a hinge region. Thus, the structure of the light chains of an IgG molecule is n-V-C-c and the structure of IgG heavy chains is n-V-C-H\u2014C-C-c (where H is the hinge region). The variable regions of an IgG molecule consist of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which contain the residues in contact with antigen and non-CDR segments, referred to as framework segments, which in general maintain the structure and determine the positioning of the CDR loops (although certain framework residues may also contact antigen). Thus, the Vand Vdomains have the structure n-FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4-c.","When referring to binding proteins or antibodies (as broadly defined herein), the assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991). Amino acids from the variable regions of the mature heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins are designated by the position of an amino acid in the chain. Kabat described numerous amino acid sequences for antibodies, identified an amino acid consensus sequence for each subgroup, and assigned a residue number to each amino acid. Kabat's numbering scheme is extendible to antibodies not included in his compendium by aligning the antibody in question with one of the consensus sequences in Kabat by reference to conserved amino acids. This method for assigning residue numbers has become standard in the field and readily identifies amino acids at equivalent positions in different antibodies, including chimeric or humanized variants. For example, an amino acid at position 50 of a human antibody light chain occupies the equivalent position to an amino acid at position 50 of a mouse antibody light chain.","As used herein, the term \u201cheavy chain\u201d is used to define the heavy chain of an IgG antibody. In an intact, native IgG, the heavy chain comprises the immunoglobulin domains VH, CH1, hinge, CH2 and CH3. Throughout the present specification, the numbering of the residues in an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., , 5Ed. Public Health Service, NH1, MD (1991), expressly incorporated herein by references. The \u201cEU index as in Kabat\u201d refers to the numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. Examples of the amino acid sequences containing human IgG1 hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains are shown in  as described, infra.  also set forth amino acid sequences of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of the heavy chains of IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. The amino acid sequences of IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 isotypes are aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues of the respective hinge regions, which form the inter-heavy chain S\u2014S bonds, in the same positions. For the IgG2 and IgG3 hinge region, not all residues are numbered by the Eu index.","The \u201chinge region\u201d or \u201chinge domain\u201d is generally defined as stretching from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1. An example of the amino acid sequence of the human IgG1 hinge region is shown in  (amino acid residues in  are numbered according to the Kabat system). Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter-heavy chain S\u2014S binds in the same positions as shown in .","As used herein, the term \u201cFc region,\u201d \u201cFc domain\u201d or analogous terms are used to define a C-terminal region of an IgG heavy chain. An example of the amino acid sequence containing the human IgG1 is shown in . Although boundaries may vary slightly, as numbered according to the Kabat system, the Fc domain extends from amino acid 231 to amino acid 447 (amino acid residues in  are numbered according to the Kabat system).  also provides examples of the amino acid sequences of the Fc regions of IgG isotypes IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4.","The Fc region of an IgG comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341 according to the numbering system of Kabat (). The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447 according to the numbering system of Kabat (). The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as \u201cC\u03b32\u201d domain) is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N-linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG.","As used herein the terms \u201cFc\u03b3R binding protein,\u201d \u201cFc\u03b3R antibody,\u201d and \u201canti-Fc\u03b3R antibody\u201d, are used interchangeably and refer to a variety of immunoglobulin-like or immunoglobulin-derived proteins. \u201cFc\u03b3R binding proteins\u201d bind Fc\u03b3R via an interaction with Vand\/or Vdomains (as distinct from Fc\u03b3-mediated binding). Examples of Fc\u03b3R binding proteins include fully human, polyclonal, chimeric and humanized antibodies (e.g., comprising 2 heavy and 2 light chains), fragments thereof (e.g., Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments), bifunctional or multifunctional antibodies (see, e.g., Lanzavecchia et al., 198717:105), single chain antibodies (see, e.g., Bird et al., 1988242:423-26), fusion proteins (e.g., phage display fusion proteins), \u201cminibodies\u201d (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,821) and other antigen binding proteins comprising a Vand\/or Vdomain or fragment thereof. In one aspect, the Fc\u03b3RIIIA binding protein is a \u201ctetrameric antibody\u201d i.e., having generally the structure of a naturally occurring IgG and comprising variable and constant domains, i.e., two light chains comprising a Vdomain and a light chain constant domain and two heavy chains comprising a Vdomain and a heavy chain hinge and constant domains.","As used herein the term \u201cFc\u03b3R antagonists\u201d and analogous terms refer to protein and non-proteinacious substances, including small molecules which antagonize at least one biological activity of an Fc\u03b3R, e.g., block signaling.

Further, a prophylactically effective amount with respect to a prophylactic agent of the invention means that amount of prophylactic agent alone, or in combination with other agents, that provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of disease.","As used herein, the terms \u201cprevent\u201d, \u201cpreventing\u201d and \u201cprevention\u201d refer to the prevention of the recurrence or onset of one or more symptoms of a disorder in a subject as result of the administration of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent.","As used herein, the term \u201cin combination\u201d refers to the use of more than one prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents. The use of the term \u201cin combination\u201d does not restrict the order in which prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents are administered to a subject with a disorder. A first prophylactic or therapeutic agent can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent to a subject with a disorder.","\u201cEffector function\u201d as used herein is meant a biochemical event that results from the interaction of an antibody Fc region with an Fc receptor or an antigen. Effector functions include but are not limited to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Effector functions include both those that operate after the binding of an antigen and those that operate independent of antigen binding.","\u201cEffector cell\u201d as used herein is meant a cell of the immune system that expresses one or more Fc receptors and mediates one or more effector functions. Effector cells include but are not limited to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and may be from any organism including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys.","As used herein, the term \u201cspecifically binds an immune complex\u201d and analogous terms refer to molecules that specifically bind to an immune complex and do not specifically bind to another molecule. A molecule that specifically binds to an immune complex may bind to other peptides or polypeptides with lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIAcore, or other assays known in the art. Preferably, molecules that specifically bind an immune complex do not cross-react with other proteins. Molecules that specifically bind an immune complex can be identified, for example, by immunoassays, BIAcore, or other techniques known to those of skill in the art.","A \u201cstable fusion protein\u201d as used herein refers to a fusion protein that undergoes minimal to no detectable level of degradation during production and\/or storage as assessed using common biochemical and functional assays known to one skilled in the art, and can be stored for an extended period of time with no loss in biological activity, e.g., binding to Fc\u03b3R.","Each polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule comprises a VL domain and a VH domain, which are covalently linked such that the domains are constrained from self assembly. Interaction of two of the polypeptide chains will produce two VL-VH pairings, forming two epitope binding sites, i.e., a bivalent molecule. Neither the VH or VL domain is constrained to any position within the polypeptide chain, i.e., restricted to the amino (N) or carboxy (C) terminus, nor are the domains restricted in their relative positions to one another, i.e., the VL domain may be N-terminal to the VH domain and vice-versa. The only restriction is that a complimentary polypeptide chain be available in order to form functional diabody. Where the VL and VH domains are derived from the same antibody, the two complimentary polypeptide chains may be identical. For example, where the binding domains are derived from an antibody specific for epitope A (i.e., the binding domain is formed from a VL-VHinteraction), each polypeptide will comprise a VHand a VL. Homodimerization of two polypeptide chains of the antibody will result in the formation two VL-VHbinding sites, resulting in a bivalent monospecific antibody. Where the VL and VH domains are derived from antibodies specific for different antigens, formation of a functional bispecific diabody requires the interaction of two different polypeptide chains, i.e., formation of a heterodimer. For example, for a bispecific diabody, one polypeptide chain will comprise a VLand a VL; homodimerization of said chain will result in the formation of two VL-VHbinding sites, either of no binding or of unpredictable binding. In contrast, where two differing polypeptide chains are free to interact, e.g., in a recombinant expression system, one comprising a VLand a VHand the other comprising a VLand a VH, two differing binding sites will form: VL-VHand VL-VH. For all diabody polypeptide chain pairs, the possibly of misalignment or mis-binding of the two chains is a possibility, i.e., interaction of VL-VL or VH-VH domains; however, purification of functional diabodies is easily managed based on the immunospecificity of the properly dimerized binding site using any affinity based method known in the are or exemplified herein, e.g., affinity chromatography.","In other embodiments, one or more of the polypeptide chains of the diabody comprises an Fc domain. Fc domains in the polypeptide chains of the diabody molecules preferentially dimerize, resulting in the formation of a diabody molecule that exhibits immunoglobulin-like properties, e.g., Fc-Fc\u03b3R, interactions. Fc comprising diabodies may be dimers, e.g., comprised of two polypeptide chains, each comprising a VH domain, a VL domain and an Fc domain. Dimerization of said polypeptide chains results in a bivalent diabody comprising an Fc domain, albeit with a structure distinct from that of an unmodified bivalent antibody (). Such diabody molecules will exhibit altered phenotypes relative to a wild-type immunoglobulin, e.g., altered serum half-life, binding properties, etc. In other embodiments, diabody molecules comprising Fc domains may be tetramers. Such tertramers comprise two \u2018heavier\u2019 polypeptide chains, i.e. a polypeptide chain comprising a VL, a VH and an Fc domain, and two \u2018lighter\u2019 polypeptide chains, i.e., polypeptide chain comprising a VL and a VH. Said lighter and heavier chains interact to form a monomer, and said monomers interact via their unpaired Fc domains to form an Ig-like molecule. Such an Ig-like diabody is tetravalent and may be monospecific, bispecific or tetraspecific.","The at least two binding sites of the diabody molecule can recognize the same or different epitopes. Different epitopes can be from the same antigen or epitopes from different antigens. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from different cells. In another embodiment, the epitopes are cell surface antigens on the same cell or virus. The epitopes binding sites can recognize any antigen to which an antibody can be generated. For example, proteins, nucleic acids, bacterial toxins, cell surface markers, autoimmune markers, viral proteins, drugs, etc. In particular aspects, at least one epitope binding site of the diabody is specific for an antigen on a particular cell, such as a B-cell or T-cell, a phagocytotic cell, a natural killer (NK) cell or a dendritic cell.","Each domain of the polypeptide chain of the diabody, i.e., the VL, VH and FC domain may be separated by a peptide linker. The peptide linker may be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. amino acids. In certain embodiments the amino acid linker sequence is GGGSGGGG (SEQ ID NO:10) encoded by the nucleic acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:76).","In certain embodiments, each polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule is engineered to comprise at least one cysteine residue that will interact with a counterpart at least one cysteine residue on a second polypeptide chain of the invention to form an inter-chain disulfide bond. Said interchain disulfide bonds serve to stabilize the diabody molecule, improving expression and recovery in recombinant systems, resulting in a stable and consistent formulation as well as improving the stability of the isolated and\/or purified product in vivo. Said at least one cysteine residue may be introduced as a single amino acid or as part of larger amino-acid sequence, e.g hinge domain, in any portion of the polypeptide chain. In a specific embodiment, said at least one cysteine residue is engineered to occur at the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain. In some embodiments, said at least one cysteine residue in introduced into the polypeptide chain within the amino acid sequence LGGC. In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain comprising the diabody molecule of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence LGGC. In another embodiment, said at least one cysteine residue is introduced into the polypeptide within an amino acid sequence comprising a hinge domain, e.g. SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:4. In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of an IgG hinge domain, e.g. SEQ ID NO:1. In another embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain of a diabody molecule of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence VEPKSC (SEQ ID NO:79), which can be encoded by nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:80). In other embodiments, said at least one cysteine residue in introduced into the polypeptide chain within the amino acid sequence LGGCFNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:17), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:78). In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence LGGCFNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:17), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:78). In yet other embodiments, said at least one cysteine residue in introduced into the polypeptide chain within the amino acid sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:77). In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:77).","In certain embodiments, the diabody molecule comprises at least two polypeptide chains, each of which comprise the amino acid sequence LGGC and are covalently linked by a disulfide bond between the cysteine residues in said LGGC sequences. In another specific embodiment, the diabody molecule comprises at least two polypeptide chains, one of which comprises the sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23) while the other comprises a hinge domain (containing at least one cysteine residue), wherein said at least two polypeptide chains are covalently linked by a disulfide bond between the cysteine residue in FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23) and a cysteine residue in the hinge domain. In particular aspects, the cysteine residue responsible for the disulfide bond located in the hinge domain is Cys-128 (as numbered according to Kabat EU; located in the hinge domain of an unmodified, intact IgG heavy chain) and the counterpart cysteine residue in SEQ ID NO:23 is Cys-214 (as numbered according to Kabat EU; located at the C-terminus of an unmodified, intact IgG light chain) (Elkabetz et al., 2005, J. Biol. Chem. 280:14402-14412; hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). In yet other embodiments, the at least one cysteine residue is engineered to occur at the N-terminus of the amino acid chain. In still other embodiments, the at least one cysteine residue is engineered to occur in the linker portion of the polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule. In further embodiments, the VH or VL domain is engineered to comprise at least one amino acid modification relative to the parental VH or VL domain such that said amino acid modification comprises a substitution of a parental amino acid with cysteine.","The invention encompasses diabody molecules comprising an Fc domain or portion thereof (e.g. a CH2 domain, or CH3 domain). The Fc domain or portion thereof may be derived from any immunoglobulin isotype or allotype including, but not limited to, IgA, IgD, IgG, IgE and IgM. In preferred embodiments, the Fc domain (or portion thereof) is derived from IgG. In specific embodiments, the IgG isotype is IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 or an allotype thereof. In one embodiment, the diabody molecule comprises an Fc domain, which Fc domain comprises a CH2 domain and CH3 domain independently selected from any immunoglobulin isotype (i.e. an Fc domain comprising the CH2 domain derived from IgG and the CH3 domain derived form IgE, or the CH2 domain derived from IgG1 and the CH3 domain derived from IgG2, etc.). Said Fc domain may be engineered into a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody molecule of the invention in any position relative to other domains or portions of said polypeptide chain (e.g., the Fc domain, or portion thereof, may be c-terminal to both the VL and VH domains of the polypeptide of the chain; may be n-terminal to both the VL and VH domains; or may be N-terminal to one domain and c-terminal to another (i.e., between two domains of the polypeptide chain)).","The present invention also encompasses molecules comprising a hinge domain. The hinge domain be derived from any immunoglobulin isotype or allotype including IgA, IgD, IgG, IgE and IgM. In preferred embodiments, the hinge domain is derived from IgG, wherein the IgG isotype is IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4, or an allotype thereof. Said hinge domain may be engineered into a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody molecule together with an Fc domain such that the diabody molecule comprises a hinge-Fc domain. In certain embodiments, the hinge and Fc domain are independently selected from any immunoglobulin isotype known in the art or exemplified herein. In other embodiments the hinge and Fc domain are separated by at least one other domain of the polypeptide chain, e.g., the VL domain. The hinge domain, or optionally the hinge-Fc domain, may be engineered in to a polypeptide of the invention in any position relative to other domains or portions of said polypeptide chain. In certain embodiments, a polypeptide chain of the invention comprises a hinge domain, which hinge domain is at the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain, wherein said polypeptide chain does not comprise an Fc domain. In yet other embodiments, a polypeptide chain of the invention comprises a hinge-Fc domain, which hinge-Fc domain is at the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain. In further embodiments, a polypeptide chain of the invention comprises a hinge-Fc domain, which hinge-Fc domain is at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain.","As discussed above, the invention encompasses multimers of polypeptide chains, each of which polypeptide chains comprise a VH and VL domain. In certain aspects, the polypeptide chains in said multimers further comprise an Fc domain. Dimerization of the Fc domains leads to formation of a diabody molecule that exhibits immunoglobulin-like functionality, i.e., Fc mediated function (e.g., Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction, complement binding, etc.). In certain embodiments, the VL and VH domains comprising each polypeptide chain have the same specificity, and said diabody molecule is bivalent and monospecific. In other embodiments, the VL and VH domains comprising each polypeptide chain have differing specificity and the diabody is bivalent and bispecific.","In yet other embodiments, diabody molecules of the invention encompass tetramers of polypeptide chains, each of which polypeptide chain comprises a VH and VL domain. In certain embodiments, two polypeptide chains of the tetramer further comprise an Fc domain. The tetramer is therefore comprised of two \u2018heavier\u2019 polypeptide chains, each comprising a VL, VH and Fc domain, and two \u2018lighter\u2019 polypeptide chains, comprising a VL and VH domain. Interaction of a heavier and lighter chain into a bivalent monomer coupled with dimerization of said monomers via the Fc domains of the heavier chains will lead to formation of a tetravalent immunoglobulin-like molecule (exemplified in Example 6.2 and Example 6.3). In certain aspects the monomers are the same, and the tetravalent diabody molecule is monospecific or bispecific. In other aspects the monomers are different, and the tetra valent molecule is bispecific or tetraspecific.","Formation of a tetraspecific diabody molecule as described supra requires the interaction of four differing polypeptide chains. Such interactions are difficult to achieve with efficiency within a single cell recombinant production system, due to the many variants of potential chain mispairings. One solution to increase the probability of mispairings, is to engineer \u201cknobs-into-holes\u201d type mutations into the desired polypeptide chain pairs. Such mutations favor heterodimerization over homodimerization. For example, with respect to Fc-Fc-interactions, an amino acid substitution (preferably a substitution with an amino acid comprising a bulky side group forming a \u2018knob\u2019, e.g., tryptophan) can be introduced into the CH2 or CH3 domain such that steric interference will prevent interaction with a similarly mutated domain and will obligate the mutated domain to pair with a domain into which a complementary, or accommodating mutation has been engineered, i.e., \u2018the hole\u2019 (e.g., a substitution with glycine). Such sets of mutations can be engineered into any pair of polypeptides comprising the diabody molecule, and further, engineered into any portion of the polypeptides chains of said pair. Methods of protein engineering to favor heterodimerization over homodimerization are well known in the art, in particular with respect to the engineering of immunoglobulin-like molecules, and are encompassed herein (see e.g., Ridgway et al., 1996, Protein Engr. 9:617-621, Atwell et al., 1997, J. Mol. Biol. 270: 26-35, and Xie et al., 2005, J. Immunol. Methods 296:95-101; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","The invention also encompasses diabody molecules comprising variant Fc or variant hinge-Fc domains (or portion thereof), which variant Fc domain comprises at least one amino acid modification (e.g. substitution, insertion deletion) relative to a comparable wild-type Fc domain or hinge-Fc domain (or portion thereof). Molecules comprising variant Fc domains or hinge-Fc domains (or portion thereof) (e.g., antibodies) normally have altered phenotypes relative to molecules comprising wild-type Fc domains or hinge-Fc domains or portions thereof. The variant phenotype may be expressed as altered serum half-life, altered stability, altered susceptibility to cellular enzymes or altered effector function as assayed in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay. Fc domain variants identified as altering effector function are disclosed in International Application WO04\/063351, U.S. Patent Application Publications 2005\/0037000 and 2005\/0064514, U.S. Provisional Applications 60\/626,510, filed Nov. 10, 2004, 60\/636,663, filed Dec. 15, 2004, and 60\/781,564, filed Mar. 10, 2006, U.S. Pat. No. 7,632,497 and United States Patent Publication 2006\/0177439, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The bispecific diabodies of the invention can simultaneously bind two separate and distinct epitopes. In certain embodiments the epitopes are from the same antigen. In other embodiments, the epitopes are from different antigens. In preferred embodiments, at least one epitope binding site is specific for a determinant expressed on an immune effector cell (e.g. CD3, CD16, CD32, CD64, etc.) which are expressed on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells or other mononuclear cells. In one embodiment, the diabody molecule binds to the effector cell determinant and also activates said effector cell. In this regard, diabody molecules of the invention may exhibit Ig-like functionality independent of whether they further comprise an Fc domain (e.g., as assayed in any effector function assay known in the art or exemplified herein (e.g., ADCC assay). In certain embodiments the bispecific diabody of the invention binds both a cancer antigen on a tumor cell and an effector cell determinant while activating said cell. In alternative embodiments, the bispecific diabody or diabody molecule of the invention may inhibit activation of a target, e.g., effector, cell by simultaneously binding, and thus linking, an activating and inhibitory receptor on the same cell (e.g., bind both CD32A and CD32B, BCR and CD32B, or IgERI and CD32B) as described supra (see, Background Section). In a further aspect of this embodiment, the bispecific diabody may exhibit anti-viral properties by simultaneously binding two neutralizing epitopes on a virus (e.g., RSV epitopes; WNV epitopes such as E16 and E53).","In certain embodiments, bispecific diabody molecules of the invention offer unique opportunities to target specific cell types. For example, the bispecific diabody or diabody molecule can be engineered to comprise a combination of epitope binding sites that recognize a set of antigens unique to a target cell or tissue type. Additionally, where either or both of the individual antigens is\/are fairly common separately in other tissue and\/or cell types, low affinity biding domains can be used to construct the diabody or diabody molecule. Such low affinity binding domains will be unable to bind to the individual epitope or antigen with sufficient avidity for therapeutic purposes. However, where both epitopes or antigens are present on a single target cell or tissue, the avidity of the diabody or diabody molecule for the cell or tissue, relative to a cell or tissue expressing only one of the antigens, will be increased such that said cell or tissue can be effectively targeted by the invention. Such a bispecific molecule can exhibit enhanced binding to one or both of its target antigens on cells expressing both of said antigens relative to a monospecific diabody or an antibody with a specificity to only one of the antigens.","Preferably, the binding properties of the diabodies of the invention are characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining binding activity and\/or one or more Fc\u03b3R mediator effector cell functions (mediated via Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions or by the immunospecific binding of a diabody molecule to an Fc\u03b3R) (See Section 5.4.2 and 5.4.3). The affinities and binding properties of the molecules, e.g., diabodies, of the invention for an Fc\u03b3R can be determined using in vitro assays (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for determining binding domain-antigen or Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions, i.e., specific binding of an antigen to a binding domain or specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc\u03b3R, respectively, including but not limited to ELISA assay, surface plasmon resonance assay, immunoprecipitation assays (See Section 5.4.2). In most preferred embodiments, the molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.","In some embodiments, molecules of the invention are engineered to comprise an altered glycosylation pattern or an altered glycoform relative to the comparable portion of the template molecule. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, enhancing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example, DI N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTI11), by expressing a diabody of the invention in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the diabody has been expressed and purified.

A non-limiting example of the antibodies that are used for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory disorders which can be engineered according to the invention is presented in Table 9, and a non-limiting example of the antibodies that are used for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorder is presented in Table 10.","For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use diabodies with variable domains derived from human, chimeric or humanized antibodies. Variable domains from completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences.

A humanized antibody may comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence.","The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the donor CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the donor antibody. Such mutations, however, are preferably not extensive. Usually, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental framework region (FR) and CDR sequences, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.

These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions.

It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the invention encompasses CDR grafting of antibodies in general. Thus, the donor and acceptor antibodies may be derived from animals of the same species and even same antibody class or sub-class. More usually, however, the donor and acceptor antibodies are derived from animals of different species. Typically the donor antibody is a non-human antibody, such as a rodent MAb, and the acceptor antibody is a human antibody.","In some embodiments, at least one CDR from the donor antibody is grafted onto the human antibody. In other embodiments, at least two and preferably all three CDRs of each of the heavy and\/or light chain variable regions are grafted onto the human antibody. The CDRs may comprise the Kabat CDRs, the structural loop CDRs or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses a humanized Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody comprising at least one CDR grafted heavy chain and at least one CDR-grafted light chain.","The diabodies used in the methods of the invention include derivatives that are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the diabody. For example, but not by way of limitation, the diabody derivatives include diabodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.","A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a non-human antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, 1985, Science 229:1202; Oi et al., 1986, BioTechniques 4:214; Gillies et al., 1989, J. Immunol. Methods 125:191-202; and U.S. Pat.

For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, pp. 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (both of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties). The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.","Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with an antigen of interest or a cell expressing such an antigen. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limiting dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding the antigen. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by inoculating mice intraperitoneally with positive hybridoma clones. Antigens of interest include, but are not limited to, antigens associated with the cancers provided in section 5.8.1, antigens associated with the autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases provided in section 5.8.2, antigens associated with the infectious diseases provided in section 5.8.3, and the toxins provided in section 5.8.4.","Antibodies can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains, such as Fab and Fv or disulfide-bond stabilized Fv, expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage, including fd and M13. The antigen binding domains are expressed as a recombinantly fused protein to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof, of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol.

This technique would be useful in obtaining high affinity antibodies. The technology, referred to as affinity maturation, employs mutagenesis or CDR walking and re-selection using the cognate antigen to identify antibodies that bind with higher affinity to the antigen when compared with the initial or parental antibody (See, e.g., Glaser et al., 1992, J. Immunology 149:3903). Mutagenizing entire codons rather than single nucleotides results in a semi-randomized repertoire of amino acid mutations. Libraries can be constructed consisting of a pool of variant clones each of which differs by a single amino acid alteration in a single CDR and which contain variants representing each possible amino acid substitution for each CDR residue. Mutants with increased binding affinity for the antigen can be screened by contacting the immobilized mutants with labeled antigen. Any screening method known in the art can be used to identify mutant antibodies with increased avidity to the antigen (e.g., ELISA) (See Wu et al., 1998, Proc Natl. Acad Sci. USA 95:6037; Yelton et al., 1995, J. Immunology 155:1994). CDR walking which randomizes the light chain is also possible (See Schier et al., 1996, J. Mol. Bio. 263:551).","The present invention also encompasses the use of binding domains comprising the amino acid sequence of any of the binding domains described herein or known in the art with mutations (e.g., one or more amino acid substitutions) in the framework or CDR regions. Preferably, mutations in these binding domains maintain or enhance the avidity and\/or affinity of the binding domains for Fc\u03b3RIIB to which they immunospecifically bind. Standard techniques known to those skilled in the art (e.g., immunoassays) can be used to assay the affinity of an antibody for a particular antigen.","Standard techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used to introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody, or fragment thereof, including, e.g., site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis, which results in amino acid substitutions. Preferably, the derivatives include less than 15 amino acid substitutions, less than 10 amino acid substitutions, less than 5 amino acid substitutions, less than 4 amino acid substitutions, less than 3 amino acid substitutions, or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the original antibody or fragment thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the derivatives have conservative amino acid substitutions made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues.","5.1.1 Diabodies Comprising Eptiope Binding Sites which Immunospecifically Bind Fc\u03b3RIIB","In a particular embodiment, at least one of the binding domains of the diabodies of the invention agonizes at least one activity of Fc\u03b3RIIB.

In other embodiments, further confirmation of the epitope specificity may be done by using peptides with specific residues replaced with those from the Fc\u03b3RIIA sequence.","The antibodies can be characterized using assays for identifying the function of the antibodies of the invention, particularly the activity to modulate Fc\u03b3RIIB signaling. For example, characterization assays of the invention can measure phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the ITIM motif of Fc\u03b3RIIB, or measure the inhibition of B cell receptor-generated calcium mobilization. The characterization assays of the invention can be cell-based or cell-free assays.","It has been well established in the art that in mast cells coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB with the high affinity IgE receptor, Fc\u03b5RI, leads to inhibition of antigen-induced degranulation, calcium mobilization, and cytokine production (Metcalfe D. D. et aL 1997, Physiol. Rev. 77:1033; Long E. O. 1999 Annu Rev. Immunol 17: 875). The molecular details of this signaling pathway have been recently elucidated (Ott V. L., 2002, J. Immunol. 162(9):4430-9). Once coaggregated with Fc\u03b5RI, Fc\u03b3RIIB is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in its ITIM motif, and then recruits Src Homology-2 containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP), an SH2 domain-containing inosital polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, which is in turn phosphorylated and associates with Shc and p62(p62is the prototype of a family of adaptor molecules, which includes signaling domains such as an aminoterminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain), a PTB domain, and a carboxy terminal region containing PXXP motifs and numerous phosphorylation sites (Carpino et al., 1997 Cell, 88: 197; Yamanshi et al., 1997, Cell, 88:205).","The anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies for use in the invention may likewise be characterized for ability to modulate one or more IgE mediated responses. Preferably, cells lines co-expressing the high affinity receptor for IgE and the low affinity receptor for Fc\u03b3RIIB will be used in characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies in modulating IgE mediated responses. In a specific embodiment, cells from a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-H23; Barsumian E. L. et al. 1981 Eur. J. Immunol. 11:317, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) transfected with full length human Fc\u03b3RIIB will be used. RBL-2H3 is a well characterized rat cell line that has been used extensively to study the signaling mechanisms following IgE-mediated cell activation. When expressed in RBL-2H3 cells and coaggregated with Fc\u03b5RI, Fc\u03b3RIIB inhibits Fc\u03b5RI-induced calcium mobilization, degranulation, and cytokine production (Malbec et al., 1998, J. Immunol. 160:1647; Daeron et al., 1995 J. Clin. Invest. 95:577; Ott et al., 2002 J. of Immunol. 168:4430-4439).","Antibodies for use in the invention may also be characterized for inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI induced mast cell activation. For example, cells from a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-H23; Barsumian E. L. et al. 1981 Eur. J. Immunol. 11:317) that have been transfected with Fc\u03b3RIIB are sensitized with IgE and stimulated either with F(ab\u2032)fragments of rabbit anti-mouse IgG, to aggregate Fc\u03b5RI alone, or with whole rabbit anti-mouse IgG to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI. In this system, indirect modulation of down stream signaling molecules can be assayed upon addition of antibodies of the invention to the sensitized and stimulated cells. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and recruitment and phosphorylation of SHIP, activation of MAP kinase family members, including but not limited to Erk1, Erk2, JNK, or p38; and tyrosine phosphorylation of p62and its association with SHIP and RasGAP can be assayed.","One exemplary assay for determining the inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI induced mast cell activation by the antibodies of the invention can comprise of the following: transfecting RBL-H23 cells with human Fc\u03b3RIIB; sensitizing the RBL-H23 cells with IgE; stimulating RBL-H23 cells with either F(ab\u2032)of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (to aggregate Fc\u03b5RI alone and elicit Fc\u03b5RI-mediated signaling, as a control), or stimulating RBL-H23 cells with whole rabbit anti-mouse IgG to (to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI, resulting in inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI-mediated signaling). Cells that have been stimulated with whole rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies can be further pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention. Measuring Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity of cells that have been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention and cells that have not been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention, and comparing levels of Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity in these cells, would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention.","The exemplary assay described above can be for example, used to identify antibodies that block ligand (IgG) binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI signaling by preventing coaggregating of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI. This assay likewise identifies antibodies that enhance coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI and agonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI signaling by promoting coaggregating of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI.","In some embodiments, the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB diabodies, comprising the epitope binding domains of anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies identified described herein or known in the art, of the invention are characterized for their ability to modulate an IgE mediated response by monitoring and\/or measuring degranulation of mast cells or basophils, preferably in a cell-based assay. Preferably, mast cells or basophils for use in such assays have been engineered to contain human Fc\u03b3RIIB using standard recombinant methods known to one skilled in the art. In a specific embodiment the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention are characterized for their ability to modulate an IgE mediated response in a cell-based \u03b2-hexosaminidase (enzyme contained in the granules) release assay. \u03b2-hexosaminidase release from mast cells and basophils is a primary event in acute allergic and inflammatory condition (Aketani et al., 2001 Immunol. Lett. 75: 185-9; Aketani et al., 2000 Anal. Chem. 72: 2653-8). Release of other inflammatory mediators including but not limited to serotonin and histamine may be assayed to measure an IgE mediated response in accordance with the methods of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, release of granules such as those containing \u03b2-hexosaminidase from mast cells and basophils is an intracellular calcium concentration dependent process that is initiated by the cross-linking of Fc\u03b3RIs with multivalent antigen.","The ability to study human mast cells has been limited by the absence of suitable long term human mast cell cultures. Recently two novel stem cell factor dependent human mast cell lines, designated LAD 1 and LAD2, were established from bone marrow aspirates from a patient with mast cell sarcoma\/leukemia (Kirshenbaum et al., 2003, Leukemia research, 27:677-82, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.). Both cell lines have been described to express Fc\u03b5RI and several human mast cell markers. LAD 1 and 2 cells can be used for assessing the effect of the antibodies of the invention on IgE mediated responses. In a specific embodiment, cell-based \u03b2-hexosaminidase release assays such as those described supra may be used in LAD cells to determine any modulation of the IgE-mediated response by the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention. In an exemplary assay, human mast cells, e.g., LAD 1, are primed with chimeric human IgE anti-nitrophenol (NP) and challenged with BSA-NP, the polyvalent antigen, and cell degranulation is monitored by measuring the \u03b2-hexosaminidase released in the supernatant (Kirshenbaum et al., 2003, Leukemia research, 27:677-682, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","In some embodiments, if human mast cells have a low expression of endogenous Fc\u03b3RIIB, as determined using standard methods known in the art, e.g., FACS staining, it may be difficult to monitor and\/or detect differences in the activation of the inhibitory pathway mediated by the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB diabodies of the invention. The invention thus encompasses alternative methods, whereby the Fc\u03b3RIIB expression may be upregulated using cytokines and particular growth conditions. Fc\u03b3RIIB has been described to be highly up-regulated in human monocyte cell lines, e.g., THP1 and U937, (Tridandapani et al., 2002, J. Biol. Chem., 277(7): 5082-5089) and in primary human monocytes (Pricop et al., 2001, J. of Immunol., 166: 531-537) by IL4. Differentiation of U937 cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP has been described to increase expression of Fc\u03b3RII (Cameron et al., 2002 Immunology Letters 83, 171-179). Thus the endogenous Fc\u03b3RIIB expression in human mast cells for use in the methods of the invention may be up-regulated using cytokines, e.g., IL-4, IL-13, in order to enhance sensitivity of detection.","The anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB diabodies can also be assayed for inhibition of B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling. BCR-mediated signaling can include at least one or more down stream biological responses, such as activation and proliferation of B cells, antibody production, etc. Coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression and cellular survival. Further, coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR leads to inhibition of BCR-mediated signaling.","Specifically, BCR-mediated signaling comprises at least one or more of the following: modulation of down stream signaling molecules (e.g., phosphorylation state of Fc\u03b3RIIB, SHIP recruitment, localization of Btk and\/or PLC\u03b3, MAP kinase activity, recruitment of Akt (anti-apoptotic signal), calcium mobilization, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.","Although numerous effector functions of Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling are mediated through SHIP, recently it has been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated B cells from SHIP deficient mice exhibit significant Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of calcium mobilization, Ins(1,4,5)Pproduction, and Erk and Akt phosphorylation (Brauweiler A. et al., 2001, Journal of Immunology, 167(1): 204-211). Accordingly, ex vivo B cells from SHIP deficient mice can be used to characterize the antibodies of the invention. One exemplary assay for determining Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: isolating splenic B cells from SHIP deficient mice, activating said cells with lipopolysachharide, and stimulating said cells with either F(ab\u2032)anti-IgM to aggregate BCR or with anti-IgM to coaagregate BCR with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Cells that have been stimulated with intact anti-IgM to coaggregate BCR with Fc\u03b3RIIB can be further pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention. Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity of cells can be measured by standard techniques known in the art. Comparing the level of Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity in cells that have been pre-incubated with the antibodies and cells that have not been pre-incubated, and comparing the levels would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity by the antibodies.","Measuring Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity can include, for example, measuring intracellular calcium mobilization by flow cytometry, measuring phosphorylation of Akt and\/or Erk, measuring BCR-mediated accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P, or measuring Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated proliferation B cells.","The assays can be used, for example, to identify diabodies or anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies for use in the invention that modulate Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by blocking the ligand (IgG) binding site to Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonizing Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by preventing coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR. The assays can also be used to identify antibodies that enhance coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR and agonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling.","The anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies can also be assayed for Fc\u03b3RII-mediated signaling in human monocytes\/macrophages. Coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB with a receptor bearing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) acts to down-regulate Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis using SHIP as its effector (Tridandapani et al. 2002, J. Biol. Chem. 277(7):5082-9). Coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIA with Fc\u03b3RIIB results in rapid phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue on Fc\u03b3RIIB's ITIM motif, leading to an enhancement in phosphorylation of SHIP, association of SHIP with Shc, and phosphorylation of proteins having the molecular weight of 120 and 60-65 kDa. In addition, coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIA with Fc\u03b3RIIB results in down-regulation of phosphorylation of Akt, which is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in cellular regulation and serves to suppress apoptosis.","The anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB diabodies can also be assayed for inhibition of Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes\/macrophages. For example, cells from a human monocytic cell line, THP-1 can be stimulated either with Fab fragments of mouse monoclonal antibody IV.3 against Fc\u03b3RII and goat anti-mouse antibody (to aggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA alone), or with whole IV.3 mouse monoclonal antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB). In this system, modulation of down stream signaling molecules, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIB, phosphorylation of SHIP, association of SHIP with Shc, phosphorylation of Akt, and phosphorylation of proteins having the molecular weight of 120 and 60-65 kDa can be assayed upon addition of molecules of the invention to the stimulated cells. In addition, Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent phagocytic efficiency of the monocyte cell line can be directly measured in the presence and absence of the antibodies of the invention.","Another exemplary assay for determining inhibition of Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes\/macrophages by the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: stimulating THP-1 cells with either Fab of IV.3 mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to aggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA alone and elicit Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated signaling); or with mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB and inhibiting Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated signaling. Cells that have been stimulated with mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody can be further pre-incubated with the molecules of the invention. Measuring Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity of stimulated cells that have been pre-incubated with molecules of the invention and cells that have not been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention and comparing levels of Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity in these cells would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention.","The exemplary assay described can be used for example, to identify binding domains that block ligand binding of Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling by preventing coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIA. This assay likewise identifies binding domains that enhance coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIA and agonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling.","The Fc\u03b3RIIB binding domains of interest can be assayed while comprised I antibodies by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described (Tridandapani et al., 2000, J. Biol. Chem. 275: 20480-7). For example, an exemplary assay for measuring phagocytosis comprises of: treating THP-1 cells with the antibodies of the invention or with a control antibody that does not bind to Fc\u03b3RII, comparing the activity levels of said cells, wherein a difference in the activities of the cells (e.g., rosetting activity (the number of THP-1 cells binding IgG-coated SRBC), adherence activity (the total number of SRBC bound to THP-1 cells), and phagocytic rate) would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention. This assay can be used to identify, for example, antibodies that block ligand binding of Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This assay can also identify antibodies that enhance Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling.","In a preferred embodiment, the binding domains modulate Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity in human monocytes\/macrophages in at least one or more of the following ways: modulation of downstream signaling molecules (e.g., modulation of phosphorylation state of Fc\u03b3RIIB, modulation of SHIP phosphorylation, modulation of SHIP and Shc association, modulation of phosphorylation of Akt, modulation of phosphorylation of additional proteins around 120 and 60-65 kDa) and modulation of phagocytosis.","5.1.2 CD16A Binding Domains","The following section discusses CD16A binding proteins which can be used as sources for light and heavy chain variable regions for covalent diabody production. In the present invention CD16A binding proteins includes molecules comprising VL and VH domains of anti-CD16A antibodies, which VH and VL domains are used in the production of the diabodies of the present invention.","A variety of CD16A binding proteins may be used in connection with the present invention. Suitable CD16A binding proteins include human or humanized monoclonal antibodies as well as CD16A binding antibody fragments (e.g., scFv or single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, minibodies) and another antibody-like proteins that bind to CD16A via an interaction with a light chain variable region domain, a heavy chain variable region domain, or both.","In some embodiments, the CD16A binding protein for use according to the invention comprises a VL and\/or VH domain that has one or more CDRs with sequences derived from a non-human anti-CD16A antibody, such as a mouse anti-CD16A antibody, and one or more framework regions with derived from framework sequences of one or more human immunoglobulins. A number of non-human anti-CD16A monoclonal antibodies, from which CDR and other sequences may be obtained, are known (see, e.g., Tamm and Schmidt, 1996, J. Imm. 157:1576-81; Fleit et al., 1989, p. 159; LEUKOCYTE TYPING II: HUMAN MYELOID AND HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS, Reinherz et al., eds.

In addition, as shown in the Examples, new CD16A binding proteins that recognize human CD16A expressed on cells can be obtained using well known methods for production and selection of monoclonal antibodies or related binding proteins (e.g., hybridoma technology, phage display, and the like). See, for example, O'Connel et al., 2002, J. Mol. Biol. 321:49-56; Hoogenboom and Chames, 2000, Imm. Today 21:371078; Krebs et al., 2001, J. Imm. Methods 254:67-84; and other references cited herein. Monoclonal antibodies from a non-human species can be chimerized or humanized using techniques using techniques of antibody humanization known in the art.","Alternatively, fully human antibodies against CD16A can be produced using transgenic animals having elements of a human immune system (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,569,825 and 5,545,806), using human peripheral blood cells (Casali et al., 1986, Science 234:476), by screening a DNA library from human B cells according to the general protocol outlined by Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275, and by other methods.","In a preferred embodiment, the binding donor is from the 3G8 antibody or a humanized version thereof, e.g., such as those disclosed in U.S. patent application publication 2004\/0010124, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. It is contemplated that, for some purposes, it may be advantageous to use CD16A binding proteins that bind the CD16A receptor at the same epitope bound by 3G8, or at least sufficiently close to this epitope to block binding by 3G8. Methods for epitope mapping and competitive binding experiments to identify binding proteins with the desired binding properties are well known to those skilled in the art of experimental immunology. See, for example, Harlow and Lane, cited supra; Stahl et al., 1983, Methods in Enzymology 9:242-53; Kirkland et al., 1986, J. Immunol. 137:3614-19; Morel et al., 1988, Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15; Cheung et al., 1990, Virology 176:546-52; and Moldenhauer et al., 1990, Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77-82. For instance, it is possible to determine if two antibodies bind to the same site by using one of the antibodies to capture the antigen on an ELISA plate and then measuring the ability of the second antibody to bind to the captured antigen. Epitope comparison can also be achieved by labeling a first antibody, directly or indirectly, with an enzyme, radionuclide or fluorophore, and measuring the ability of an unlabeled second antibody to inhibit the binding of the first antibody to the antigen on cells, in solution, or on a solid phase.","It is also possible to measure the ability of antibodies to block the binding of the CD16A receptor to immune complexes formed on ELISA plates. Such immune complexes are formed by first coating the plate with an antigen such as fluorescein, then applying a specific anti-fluorescein antibody to the plate. This immune complex then serves as the ligand for soluble Fc receptors such as sFcRIIIa. Alternatively a soluble immune complex may be formed and labeled, directly or indirectly, with an enzyme radionuclide or fluorophore. The ability of antibodies to inhibit the binding of these labeled immune complexes to Fc receptors on cells, in solution or on a solid phase can then be measured.","CD16A binding proteins of the invention may or may not comprise a human immunoglobulin Fc region. Fc regions are not present, for example, in scFv binding proteins. Fc regions are present, for example, in human or humanized tetrameric monoclonal IgG antibodies. As described supra, in some embodiments of the present invention, the CD 16A binding protein includes an Fc region that has an altered effector function, e.g., reduced affinity for an effector ligand such as an Fc receptor or C1 component of complement compared to the unaltered Fc region (e.g., Fc of naturally occurring IgG1, proteins). In one embodiment the Fc region is not glycosylated at the Fc region amino acid corresponding to position 297. Such antibodies lack Fc effector function.","Thus, the CD16A binding protein may not exhibit Fc-mediated binding to an effector ligand such as an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement due to the absence of the Fc domain in the binding protein while, in other cases, the lack of binding or effector function is due to an alteration in the constant region of the antibody.","5.1.2.1 CD16A Binding Proteins Comprising CDR Sequences Similar to a mAb 3G8 CDR Sequences.","CD16A binding proteins that can be used in the practice of the invention include proteins comprising a CDR sequence derived from (i.e., having a sequence the same as or similar to) the CDRs of the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8. Complementary cDNAs encoding the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of the mouse 3G8 monoclonal antibody, including the CDR encoding sequences, were cloned and sequenced as described. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of 3G8 are provided below. Using the mouse variable region and CDR sequences, a large number of chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising complementary determining regions derived from 3G8 CDRs were produced and their properties analyzed. To identify humanized antibodies that bind CD16A with affinity and have other desirable properties, antibody heavy chains comprising a VH region with CDRs derived from 3G8 were produced and combined (by coexpression) with antibody light chains comprising a VL region with CDRs derived from 3G8 to produce a tetrameric antibody for analysis. Properties of the resulting tetrameric antibodies were determined as described below. As described below, CD16A binding proteins comprising 3G8 CDRs, such as the humanized antibody proteins described herein, may be used according to the invention.","5.1.2.1.1 VH Region","In one aspect, the CD16A binding protein of the invention may comprise a heavy chain variable domain in which at least one CDR (and usually three CDRS) have the sequence of a CDR (and more typically all three CDRS) of the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8 heavy chain for which the remaining portions of the binding protein are substantially human (derived from and substantially similar to, the heavy chain variable region of a human antibody or antibodies).","In an aspect, the invention provides a humanized 3G8 antibody or antibody fragment containing CDRs derived from the 3G8 antibody in a substantially human framework, but in which at least one of the CDRs of the heavy chain variable domain differs in sequence from the corresponding mouse antibody 3G8 heavy chain CDR. For example, in one embodiment, the CDR(S) differs from the 3G8 CDR sequence at least by having one or more CDR substitutions shown known in the art to affect binding of 3G8 to CD16A, as known in the art or as disclosed in Tables 3 and 4A-H. Suitable CD16 binding proteins may comprise 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or more of these substitutions (and often have from 1 to 4 of these substitutions) and optionally can have additional substitutions as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0205","num":"0204"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

that is the same as, or similar to, the VH domain of the Hu3G8VH-1 construct, the sequence of which is provided in SEQ ID NO:70. For example, the invention provides a CD16A binding protein comprising a VH domain with a sequence that (1) differs from the VH domain of Hu3G8VH-1 (SEQ ID NO:70) by zero, one, or more than one of the CDR substitutions set forth in Table 1; (2) differs from the VH domain of Hu3G8VH-1 by zero, one or more than one of the framework substitutions set forth in Table 1; and (3) is at least about 80% identical, often at least about 90%, and sometimes at least about 95% identical, or even at least about 98% identical to the Hu3G8VH-1 VH sequence at the remaining positions.","Exemplary VH domains of CD16 binding proteins of the invention have the sequence of 3G8VH, Hu3G8VH-5 and Hu3G8VH-22 (SEQ ID NO:81, SEQ ID NO:71 and SEQ ID NO:72, respectively)e. Exemplary nucleotide sequences encoding the sequences of 3G8VH and Hu3G8VH-5 (SEQ ID NO:81 and SEQ ID NO:71, respectively) are provided by SEQ ID NO:82 and SEQ ID NO:83, respectively.","The VH domain may have a sequence that differs from that of Hu3G8VH-1 (SEQ ID NO:70) by at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four 4, at least five, or at least six of the substitutions shown in Table 3. These substitutions are believed to result in increased affinity for CD16A and\/or reduce the immunogenicity of a CD16A binding protein when administered to humans. In certain embodiments, the degree of sequence identity with the Hu3G8VH-1 VH domain at the remaining positions is at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95% or at least about 98%.","For illustration and not limitation, the sequences of a number of CD16A building protein VH domains is shown in Table 4. Heavy chains comprising these sequences fused to a human C\u03b31 constant region were coexpressed with the hu3G8VL-1 light chain (described below) to form tetrameric antibodies, and binding of the antibodies to CD16A was measured to assess the effect of amino acid substitutions compared to the hu3G8VH-1 VH domain. Constructs in which the VH domain has a sequence of hu3G8VH-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 42, 43, 44 and 45 showed high affinity binding, with hu3G8VH-6 and -40 VH domains showing intermediate binding. CD16A binding proteins comprising the VH domains of hu3G8VH-5 and hu3G8VH-22 (SEQ ID NO:71 and SEQ ID NO:72, respectively) are considered to have particularly favorable binding properties.","5.1.2.2 VL Region","Similar studies were conducted to identify light chain variable domain sequences with favorable binding properties. In one aspect, the invention provides a CD16A binding protein containing a light chain variable domain in which at least one CDR (and usually three CDRs) has the sequence of a CDR (and more typically all three CDRs) of the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8 light chain and for which the remaining portions of the binding protein are substantially human (derived from and substantially similar to, the heavy chain variable region of a human antibody or antibodies).","In one aspect, the invention provides a fragment of a humanized 3G8 antibody containing CDRs derived from the 3G8 antibody in a substantially human framework, but in which at least one of the CDRs of the light chain variable domain differs in sequence from the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8 light chain CDR. In one embodiment, the CDR(s) differs from the 3G8 sequence at least by having one or more amino acid substitutions in a CDR, such as, one or more substitutions shown in Table 2 (e.g., arginine at position 24 in CDR1; serine at position 25 in CDR1; tyrosine at position 32 in CDR1; leucine at position 33 in CDR1; aspartic acid, tryptophan or serine at position 50 in CDR2; serine at position 53 in CDR2; alanine or glutamine at position 55 in CDR2; threonine at position 56 in CDR2; serine at position 93 in CDR3; and\/or threonine at position 94 in CDR3). In various embodiments, the variable domain can have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more of these substitutions (and often have from 1 to 4 of these substitutions) and optionally, can have additional substitutions as well.","In one embodiment, a suitable CD16A binding protein may comprise a light chain variable domain sequence that is the same as, or similar to, the VL domain of the Hu3G8VL-1 (SEQ ID NO:73) construct, the sequence of which is provided in Table 6. For example, the invention provides a CD16A binding protein comprising a VL domain with a sequence that (1) differs from the VL domain of Hu3G8VL-1 (SEQ ID NO:73) by zero, one, or more of the CDR substitutions set forth in Table 5; (2) differs from the VL domain of Hu3G8VL-1 by zero, one or more of the framework substitutions set forth in Table 5; and (3) is at least 80% identical, often at

In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses diabodies comprising a variant Fc region, or portion thereof, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIIA. In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses diabodies comprising a variant Fc region, or portion thereof, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses diabodies comprising a variant Fc region, or portion thereof, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIB. In certain embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc domain wherein said variant confers or mediates increased ADCC activity and\/or an increased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A), relative to a molecule comprising no Fc domain or comprising a wild-type Fc domain, as measured using methods known to one skilled in the art and described herein. In alternate embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc domain wherein said variant confers or mediates decreased ADCC activity (or other effector function) and\/or an increased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B), relative to a molecule comprising no Fc domain or comprising a wild-type Fc domain, as measured using methods known to one skilled in the art and described herein.","The invention also encompasses the use of an Fc domain comprising domains or regions from two or more IgG isotypes. As known in the art, amino acid modification of the Fc region can profoundly affect Fc-mediated effector function and\/or binding activity. However, these alterations in functional characteristics can be further refined and\/or manipulated when implemented in the context of selected IgG isotypes. Similarly, the native characteristics of the isotype Fc may be manipulated by the one or more amino acid modifications. The multiple IgG isotypes (i.e., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) exhibit differing physical and functional properties including serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc\u03b3R binding affinities and effector function activities (e.g. ADCC, CDC) due to differences in the amino acid sequences of their hinge and\/or Fc domains. In certain embodiments, the amino acid modification and IgG Fc region are independently selected based on their respective, separate binding and\/or effector function activities in order to engineer a diabody with desired characteristics. In most embodiments, said amino acid modifications and IgG hinge\/Fc regions have been separately assayed for binding and\/or effector function activity as described herein or known in the art in an the context of an IgG1. In certain embodiments, said amino acid modification and IgG hinge\/Fc region display similar functionality, e.g., increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIA, when separately assayed for Fc\u03b3R binding or effector function in the context of the diabody molecule or other Fc-containing molecule (e.g. and immunoglobulin). The combination of said amino acid modification and selected IgG Fc region then act additively or, more preferably, synergistically to modify said functionality in the diabody molecule of the invention, relative to a diabody molecule of the invention comprising a wild-type Fc region. In other embodiments, said amino acid modification and IgG Fc region display opposite functionalities, e.g., increased and decreased, respectively, affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIA, when separately assayed for Fc\u03b3R binding and\/or effector function in the context of the diabody molecule or other Fc containing molecule (e.g., an immunoglobulin) comprising a wild-type Fc region as described herein or known in the art; the combination of said \u201copposite\u201d amino acid modification and selected IgG region then act to selectively temper or reduce a specific functionality in the diabody of the invention relative to a diabody of the invention not comprising an Fc region or comprising a wild-type Fc region of the same isotype. Alternatively, the invention encompasses variant Fc regions comprising combinations of amino acid modifications known in the art and selected IgG regions that exhibit novel properties, which properties were not detectable when said modifications and\/or regions were independently assayed as described herein.","The functional characteristics of the multiple IgG isotypes, and domains thereof, are well known in the art. The amino acid sequences of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 are presented in . Selection and\/or combinations of two or more domains from specific IgG isotypes for use in the methods of the invention may be based on any known parameter of the parent isotypes including affinity to Fc\u03b3R (Table 7; Flesch and Neppert, 1999, J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 14:141-156; Chappel et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 33:25124-25131; Chappel et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:9036-9040, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). For example, use of regions or domains from IgG isotypes that exhibit limited or no binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB, e.g., IgG2 or IgG4, may find particular use where a diabody is desired to be engineered to maximize binding to an activating receptor and minimize binding to an inhibitory receptor. Similarly, use of Fc regions or domains from IgG isotypes known to preferentially bind C1q or Fc\u03b3RIIIA, e.g., IgG3 (Br\u00fcggemann et al., 1987, J. Exp.

The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences.","Further, the diabody molecules of the invention (i.e., polypeptides) may be conjugated to a therapeutic agent or a drug moiety that modifies a given biological response. As an alternative to direct conjugation, owing to the multiple epitope binding sites on the multivalent, e.g., tetravalent, diabody molecules of the invention, at least one binding region of the diabody may be designed to bind the therapeutic agent or desired drug moiety without affecting diabody binding.","Therapeutic agents or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin (i.e., PE-40), or diphtheria toxin, ricin, gelonin, and pokeweed antiviral protein, a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, interferons including, but not limited to, \u03b1-interferon (IFN-\u03b1), \u03b2-interferon (IFN-\u03b2), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), an apoptotic agent (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, AIM I as disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM II (see, PCT Publication No. WO 97\/34911), Fas ligand (Takahashi et al., 6:1567-1574, 1994), and VEGI (PCT Publication No. WO 99\/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent (e.g., angiostatin or endostatin), or a biological response modifier such as, for example, a lymphokine (e.g., interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), interleukin-2 (\u201cIL-2\u201d), interleukin-6 (\u201cIL-6\u201d), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (\u201cGM-CSF\u201d), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\u201cG-CSF\u201d), macrophage colony stimulating factor, (\u201cM-CSF\u201d), or a growth factor (e.g., growth hormone (\u201cGH\u201d); proteases, or ribonucleases.","The diabody molecules of the invention (i.e., polypeptides) can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., 198986:821-824, for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., 37:767 1984) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag (Knappik et al., , 17(4):754-761, 1994).","Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of molecules of the invention (e.g., epitope binding sites with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Pat.

The diabody molecules of the invention, or the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention, may be further altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. One or more portions of a polynucleotide encoding a molecule of the invention, may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","The present invention also encompasses diabody molecules of the invention conjugated to or immunospecifically recognizing a diagnostic or therapeutic agent or any other molecule for which serum half-life is desired to be increased\/decreased and\/or targeted to a particular subset of cells.

See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Such diagnosis and detection can be accomplished designing the molecules to immunospecifically recognize the detectable substance or by coupling the molecules of the invention to detectable substances including, but not limited to, various enzymes, enzymes including, but not limited to, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; prosthetic group complexes such as, but not limited to, streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; fluorescent materials such as, but not limited to, umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; luminescent material such as, but not limited to, luminol; bioluminescent materials such as, but not limited to, luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; radioactive material such as, but not limited to, bismuth (Bi), carbon (C), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), fluorine (F), gadolinium (Gd, Gd), gallium (Ga, Ga), germanium (Ge), holmium (Ho), indium (In, In, In, In), iodine (I, I, I, I), lanthanium (La), lutetium (Lu), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), palladium (Pd), phosphorous (P), praseodymium (Pr), promethium (Pm), rhenium (Re, Re), rhodium (Rh), ruthemium (Ru), samarium (Sm), scandium (Sc), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), sulfur (S), technetium (Tc), thallium (Ti), tin (Sn, Sn), tritium (H), xenon (Xe), ytterbium (Yb, Yb), yttrium (Y), zinc (Zn); positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions.","The diabody molecules of the invention may immunospecifically recognize or be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin (e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent), a therapeutic agent or a radioactive element (e.g., alpha-emitters, gamma-emitters, etc.). Cytotoxins or cytotoxic agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells.

Such linker molecules are commonly known in the art and described in Denardo et al., 19984:2483-90; Peterson et al., 199910:553; and Zimmerman et al., 199926:943-50 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moieties to polypeptides, including e.g., Fc domains, are well known; see, e.g., Arnon et al., \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy\u201d, in , Reisfeld et al.

Where administered alone, at least one epitope of a multivalent, e.g., tetravalent, diabody molecule may be designed to immunospecifically recognize a therapeutic agent, e.g., cytotoxic factor(s) and\/or cytokine(s), which may be administered concurrently or subsequent to the molecule of the invention. In this manner, the diabody molecule may specifically target the therapeutic agent in a manner similar to direct conjugation. Alternatively, a molecule of the invention, can be conjugated to an antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Diabody molecules of the invention may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.","5.4 Characterization of Binding of Diabody Molecules","The diabody molecules of the present invention may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular, molecules of the invention may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to an antigen, e.g., FcRIIIA or FcRIIB, or, where the molecule comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof) for the ability to exhibit Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions, i.e. specific binding of an Fc domain (or portion thereof) to an Fc\u03b3R. Such an assay may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten, 13:412-421, 1992), on beads (Lam, 354:82-84, 1991, on chips (Fodor, 364:555-556, 1993), on bacteria (U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on spores (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), on plasmids (Cull et al., 89:1865-1869, 1992) or on phage (Scott and Smith, 249:386-390, 1990; Devlin, 249:404-406, 1990; Cwirla et al., 87:6378-6382, 1990; and Felici, 222:301-310, 1991) (each of these references is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Molecules that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to an antigen, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for the antigen.","Molecules of the invention that have been engineered to comprise multiple epitope binding domains may be assayed for immunospecific binding to one or more antigens (e.g., cancer antigen and cross-reactivity with other antigens (e.g., Fc\u03b3R)) or, where the molecules comprise am Fc domain (or portion thereof) for Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding, cross-reactivity, and Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","The binding affinity and the off-rate of antigen-binding domain interaction or Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen, such as tetrameric Fc\u03b3R (e.g., H or I, see Section 5.4.1) with a molecule of interest (e.g., molecules of the present invention comprising multiple epitope binding domains in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled epitope, such as tetrameric Fc\u03b3R(see Section 5.4.1), and the detection of the molecule bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the molecule of the present invention for an antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the saturation data by Scatchard analysis.","The affinities and binding properties of the molecules of the invention for an antigen or Fc\u03b3R may be initially determined using in vitro assays (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for antigen-binding domain or Fc-Fc\u03b3R, interactions, including but not limited to ELISA assay, surface plasmon resonance assay, immunoprecipitation assays. Preferably, the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc\u03b3R mediator effector cell functions, as described in section 5.4.2. In most preferred embodiments, the molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.","In some embodiments, screening and identifying molecules comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, Fc domains (or portions thereof) are done functional based assays, preferably in a high throughput manner. The functional based assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more Fc\u03b3R mediated effector cell functions such as those described herein in Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3. Non-limiting examples of effector cell functions that can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, cell binding, rosetting, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.","In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of molecules of the present invention to an antigen or and Fc\u03b3R. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of an antigen or Fc\u03b3R from chips with immobilized molecules (e.g., molecules comprising epitope binding domains or Fc domains (or portions thereof), respectively) on their surface. BIAcore analysis is described in Section 5.4.3.","Preferably, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), using any of the techniques known to those skilled in the art, is used for immunological or functional based assay to characterize molecules of the invention. Flow sorters are capable of rapidly examining a large number of individual cells that have been bound, e.g., opsonized, by molecules of the invention (e.g., 10-100 million cells per hour) (Shapiro et al., 1995). Additionally, specific parameters used for optimization of diabody behavior, include but are not limited to, antigen concentration (i.e., Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complex, see Section 5.4.1), kinetic competition time, or FACS stringency, each of which may be varied in order to select for the diabody molecules comprising molecules of the invention which exhibit specific binding properties, e.g., concurrent binding to multiple epitopes. Flow cytometers for sorting and examining biological cells are well known in the art. Known flow cytometers are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,347,935; 5,464,581; 5,483,469; 5,602,039; 5,643,796; and 6,211,477; the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Other known flow cytometers are the FACS Vantage\u2122 system manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company, and the COPAS\u2122 system manufactured by Union Biometrica.","Characterization of target antigen binding affinity or Fc-Fc\u03b3R binding affinity, and assessment of target antigen or Fc\u03b3R density on a cell surface may be made by methods well known in the art such as Scatchard analysis or by the use of kits as per manufacturer's instructions, such as Quantum\u2122 Simply Cellular\u00ae (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Fishers, IN). The one or more functional assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more Fc\u03b3R mediated effector cell function as known to one skilled in the art or described herein. In specific embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, and Fc domain (or portion thereof) are assayed in an ELISA assay for binding to one or more target antigens or one or more Fc\u03b3Rs, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA; followed by one or more ADCC assays. In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention are assayed further using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay, e.g., BIAcore. Surface plasmon resonance-based assays are well known in the art, and are further discussed in Section 5.4.3, and exemplified herein, e.g., in Example 6.1.","In most preferred embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, and Fc domain (or portion thereof) is further characterized in an animal model for interaction with a target antigen (e.g., an Fc\u03b3R) or for Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction. Where Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions are to be assessed, preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for example, transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,397, and 6,676,927 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Further transgenic mice for use in such methods include, but are not limited to, nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIA; nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIA; nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA and nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB.","5.4.1 Binding Assays Comprising Fc\u03b3R","Characterization of binding to Fc\u03b3R by molecules comprising an Fc domain (or portion thereof) and\/or comprising epitope binding domain specific for an Fc\u03b3R may be done using any Fc\u03b3R, including but not limited to polymorphic variants of Fc\u03b3R. In some embodiments, a polymorphic variant of Fc\u03b3RIIIA is used, which contains a phenylalanine at position 158. In other embodiments, characterization is done using a polymorphic variant of Fc\u03b3RIIIA which contains a valine at position 158. Fc\u03b3RIIIA 158V displays a higher affinity for IgG1 than 158F and an increased ADCC activity (see, e.g., Koene et al., 199790:1109-14; Wu et al., 1997100: 1059-70, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties); this residue in fact directly interacts with the lower hinge region of IgG1 as recently shown by IgG1-Fc\u03b3RIIIA co-crystallization studies, see, e.g., Sonderman et al., 2000100: 1059-70, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Studies have shown that in some cases, therapeutic antibodies have improved efficacy in Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158V homozygous patients. For example, humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab was therapeutically more effective in Fc\u03b3RIIIA158V homozygous patients compared to Fc\u03b3RIIIA 158F homozygous patients (See, e.g., Cartron et al., 2002 99(3): 754-8). In other embodiments, therapeutic molecules comprising this region may also be more effective on patients heterozygous for Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158V and Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158F, and in patients with Fc\u03b3RIIA-131H. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, selection of molecules of the invention with alternate allotypes may provide for variants that once engineered into therapeutic diabodies will be clinically more efficacious for patients homozygous for said allotype.","An Fc\u03b3R binding assay was developed for determining the binding of the molecules of the invention to Fc\u03b3R, and, in particular, for determining binding of Fc domains to Fc\u03b3R. The assay allowed detection and quantitation of Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions, despite the inherently weak affinity of the receptor for its ligand, e.g., in the micromolar range for Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA. The method is described in detail in International Application WO04\/063351 and U.S. Patent Application Publications 2005\/0037000 and 2005\/0064514, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, the method involves the formation of an Fc\u03b3R complex that may be sued in any standard immunoassay known in the art, e.g., FACS, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, etc. Additionally, the Fc\u03b3R complex has an improved avidity for an Fc region, relative to an uncomplexed Fc\u03b3R. According to the invention, the preferred molecular complex is a tetrameric immune complex, comprising: (a) the soluble region of Fc\u03b3R (e.g., the soluble region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB); (b) a biotinylated 15 amino acid AVITAG sequence (AVITAG) operably linked to the C-terminus of the soluble region of Fc\u03b3R (e.g., the soluble region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB); and (c) streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE); in a molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complex (preferably in a 5:1 molar ratio). The fusion protein is biotinylated enzymatically, using for example, the Bir A enzyme, a biotin ligase which specifically biotinylates a lysine residue in the 15 amino acid AVITAG sequence. The biotinylated soluble Fc\u03b3R proteins are then mixed with SA-PE in a 1X SA-PE:5X biotinylated soluble Fc\u03b3R molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complex.","Polypeptides comprising Fc regions have been shown to bind the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes with at least an 8-fold higher affinity than the monomeric uncomplexed Fc\u03b3R. The binding of polypeptides comprising Fc regions to the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes may be determined using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as for example, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), radioimmunoassays, ELISA assays, etc.","The invention encompasses the use of the immune complexes comprising molecules of the invention, and formed according to the methods described above, for determining the functionality of molecules comprising an Fc region in cell-based or cell-free assays.","As a matter of convenience, the reagents may be provided in an assay kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents for assaying the ability of molecules comprising an Fc regions to bind Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes. Other forms of molecular complexes for use in determining Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions are also contemplated for use in the methods of the invention, e.g., fusion proteins formed as described in U.S. Provisional Application 60\/439,709, filed on Jan. 13, 2003; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","5.4.2 Functional Assays of Molecules with Variant Heavy Chains","The invention encompasses characterization of the molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, Fc domains (or portions thereof) using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effector cell function of the molecules. In particular, the invention encompasses characterizing the molecules of the invention for Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector cell function. Additionally, where at least one of the target antigens of the diabody molecule of the invention is an Fc\u03b3R, binding of the Fc\u03b3R by the diabody molecule may serve to activate Fc\u03b3R-mediated pathways similar to those activated by Fc\u03b3R-Fc binding. Thus, where at least one eptiope binding domain of the diabody molecule recognizes an Fc\u03b3R, the diabody molecule may elicit Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector cell function without containing an Fc domain (or portion thereof), or without concomitant Fc-Fc\u03b3R binding. Examples of effector cell functions that can be assayed in accordance with the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Any cell-based or cell free assay known to those skilled in the art for determining effector cell function activity can be used (For effector cell assays, see Perussia et al., 2000121: 179-92; Baggiolini et al., 1998 44(10): 841-8; Lehmann et al., 2000 243(1-2): 229-42; Brown E J. 199445: 147-64; Munn et al., 1990 172: 231-237, Abdul-Majid et al., 2002 55: 70-81; Ding et al., 19988:403-411, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes. Alternatively, the Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention may be assayed in other phagocytes, e.g., neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leuckocytes; PMN); human peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, which can be obtained using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art (e.g., see Brown E J. 199445: 147-164). In one embodiment, the function of the molecules of the invention is characterized by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described (Tridandapani et al., 2000275: 20480-7).","Another exemplary assay for determining the phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention is an antibody-dependent opsonophagocytosis assay (ADCP) which can comprise the following: coating a target bioparticle such as -labeled FITC (Molecular Probes) or -FITC with (i) wild-type 4-4-20 antibody, an antibody to fluorescein (See Bedzyk et al., 1989264(3): 1565-1569, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), as the control antibody for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP; or (ii) 4-4-20 antibody harboring the D265A mutation that knocks out binding to Fc\u03b3RIII, as a background control for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP (iii) a diabody comprising the epitope binding domain of 4-4-20 and an Fc domain and\/or an epitope binding domain specific for Fc\u03b3RIII; and forming the opsonized particle; adding any of the opsonized particles described (i-iii) to THP-1 effector cells (a monocytic cell line available from ATCC) at a 1:1, 10:1, 30:1, 60:1, 75:1 or a 100: 1 ratio to allow Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis to occur; preferably incubating the cells and -FITC\/antibody at 37\u00b0 C. for 1.5 hour; adding trypan blue after incubation (preferably at room temperature for 2-3 min.) to the cells to quench the fluorescence of the bacteria that are adhered to the outside of the cell surface without being internalized; transferring cells into a FACS buffer (e.g., 0.1%, BSA in PBS, 0.1%, sodium azide), analyzing the fluorescence of the THP1 cells using FACS (e.g., BD FACS Calibur). Preferably, the THP-1 cells used in the assay are analyzed by FACS for expression of Fc\u03b3R on the cell surface. THP-1 cells express both CD32A and CD64. CD64 is a high affinity Fc\u03b3R that is blocked in conducting the ADCP assay in accordance with the methods of the invention. The THP-1 cells are preferably blocked with 100 \u03bcg\/mL soluble IgG1 or 10% human serum. To analyze the extent of ADCP, the gate is preferably set on THP-1 cells and median fluorescence intensity is measured. The ADCP activity for individual mutants is calculated and reported as a normalized value to the wild type chMab 4-4-20 obtained. The opsonized particles are added to THP-1 cells such that the ratio of the opsonized particles to THP-1 cells is 30:1 or 60:1. In most preferred embodiments, the ADCP assay is conducted with controls, such as -FITC in medium, -FITC and THP-1 cells (to serve as Fc\u03b3R-independent ADCP activity), -FITC, THP-1 cells and wild-type 4-4-20 antibody (to serve as Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP activity), -FITC, THP-1 cells, 4-4-20 D265A (to serve as the background control for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP activity).","In another embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc\u03b3R-mediated ADCC activity in effector cells, e.g., natural killer cells, using any of the standard methods known to those skilled in the art (See e.g., Perussia et al., 2000121: 179-92; Weng et al., 2003, J. Clin. Oncol. 21:3940-3947; Ding et al., 1998, 8:403-11). An exemplary assay for determining ADCC activity of the molecules of the invention is based on a Cr release assay comprising of: labeling target cells with [Cr]NaCrO(this cell-membrane permeable molecule is commonly used for labeling since it binds cytoplasmic proteins and although spontaneously released from the cells with slow kinetics, it is released massively following target cell necrosis); opsonizing the target cells with the molecules of the invention comprising variant heavy chains; combining the opsonized radiolabeled target cells with effector cells in a microtitre plate at an appropriate ratio of target cells to effector cells; incubating the mixture of cells for 16-18 hours at 37\u00b0 C.; collecting supernatants; and analyzing radioactivity. The cytotoxicity of the molecules of the invention can then be determined, for example using the following formula: % lysis=(experimental cpm\u2212target leak cpm)\/(detergent lysis cpm\u2212target leak cpm)\u00d7100%. Alternatively, % lysis=(ADCC\u2212AICC)\/(maximum release\u2212spontaneous release). Specific lysis can be calculated using the formula: specific lysis=% lysis with the molecules of the invention\u2212% lysis in the absence of the molecules of the invention. A graph can be generated by varying either the target: effector cell ratio or antibody concentration.","Preferably, the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention are peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that are preferably purified from normal human blood, using standard methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g., using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Preferred effector cells for use in the methods of the invention express different Fc\u03b3R activating receptors. The invention encompasses, effector cells, THP-1, expressing Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, and monocyte derived primary macrophages derived from whole human blood expressing both Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, to determine if heavy chain antibody mutants show increased ADCC activity and phagocytosis relative to wild type IgG1 antibodies.","The human monocyte cell line, THP-1, activates phagocytosis through expression of the high affinity receptor Fc\u03b3RI and the low affinity receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA (Fleit et al., 1991, J. Leuk. Biol. 49: 556). THP-1 cells do not constitutively express Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB. Stimulation of these cells with cytokines effects the FcR expression pattern (Pricop et al., 2000 J. Immunol. 166: 531-7). Growth of THP-1 cells in the presence of the cytokine IL4 induces Fc\u03b3RIIB expression and causes a reduction in Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RI expression. Fc\u03b3RIIB expression can also be enhanced by increased cell density (Tridandapani et al., 2002277: 5082-9). In contrast, it has been reported that IFN\u03b3 can lead to expression of Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Pearse et al., 1993 90: 4314-8). The presence or absence of receptors on the cell surface can be determined by FACS using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Cytokine induced expression of Fc\u03b3R on the cell surface provides a system to test both activation and inhibition in the presence of Fc\u03b3RIIB. If THP-1 cells are unable to express the Fc\u03b3RIIB the invention also encompasses another human monocyte cell line, U937. These cells have been shown to terminally differentiate into macrophages in the presence of IFN\u03b3 and TNF (Koren et al., 1979279: 328-331).","Fc\u03b3R dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models (Clynes et al., 199895: 652-656). The invention encompasses the use of elutriated monocytes from donors as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in both phagocytosis and ADCC assays. Expression patterns of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIIB are affected by different growth conditions. Fc\u03b3R expression from frozen elutriated monocytes, fresh elutriated monocytes, monocytes maintained in 10% FBS, and monocytes cultured in FBS+GM-CSF and or in human serum may be determined using common methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, cells can be stained with Fc\u03b3R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine FcR profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc\u03b3R expression is then used for the methods of the invention.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of mouse cells especially when human cells with the right Fc\u03b3R profiles are unable to be obtained. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7(ATCC) which can be transfected with human Fc\u03b3RIIIA and stable transfectants isolated using methods known in the art, see, e.g., Ralph et al., 119: 950-4). Transfectants can be quantitated for Fc\u03b3RIIIA expression by FACS analysis using routine experimentation and high expressors can be used in the ADCC assays of the invention. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses isolation of spleen peritoneal macrophage expressing human Fc\u03b3R from knockout transgenic mice such as those disclosed herein.","Lymphocytes may be harvested from peripheral blood of donors (PBM) using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Within the isolated mononuclear population of cells the majority of the ADCC activity occurs via the natural killer cells (NK) containing Fc\u03b3RIIIA but not Fc\u03b3RIIB on their surface. Results with these cells indicate the efficacy of the mutants on triggering NK cell ADCC and establish the reagents to test with elutriated monocytes.","Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include, but are not limited to, breast cancer cell lines, e.g., SK-BR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-30 (see, e.g., Tremp et al., 197633-41); B-lymphocytes; cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma, e.g., Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL-86 (see, e.g., Epstein et al., 196534: 231-240), and Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL-213 (see, e.g., Klein et al., 196828: 1300-10). The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the diabody molecule to be assayed.","The ADCC assay is based on the ability of NK cells to mediate cell death via an apoptotic pathway. NK cells mediate cell death in part by Fc\u03b3RIIIA's recognition of an IgG Fc domain bound to an antigen on a cell surface. The ADCC assays used in accordance with the methods of the invention may be radioactive based assays or fluorescence based assays. The ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises labeling target cells, e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji, Daudi cells, opsonizing target cells with an antibody that recognizes a cell surface receptor on the target cell via its antigen binding site; combining the labeled opsonized target cells and the effector cells at an appropriate ratio, which can be determined by routine experimentation; harvesting the cells; detecting the label in the supernatant of the lysed target cells, using an appropriate detection scheme based on the label used. The target cells may be labeled either with a radioactive label or a fluorescent label, using standard methods known in the art. For example the labels include, but are not limited to, [Cr]NaCrO; and the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (TDA).","In a specific preferred embodiment, a time resolved fluorimetric assay is used for measuring ADCC activity against target cells that have been labeled with the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (TDA). Such fluorimetric assays are known in the art, e.g., see, Blomberg et al., 1996193: 199-206; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, target cells are labeled with the membrane permeable acetoxymethyl diester of TDA (bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate, (BATDA), which rapidly diffuses across the cell membrane of viable cells. Intracellular esterases split off the ester groups and the regenerated membrane impermeable TDA molecule is trapped inside the cell. After incubation of effector and target cells, e.g., for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% CO, the TDA released from the lysed target cells is chelated with Eu3+ and the fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallace).","In another specific embodiment, the ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding sites and, optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof) comprises the following steps: Preferably 4-5\u00d710target cells (e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji cells) are labeled with bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-t-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (DELFIA BATDA Reagent, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). For optimal labeling efficiency, the number of target cells used in the ADCC assay should preferably not exceed 5\u00d710. BATDA reagent is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. preferably under 5% CO, for at least 30 minutes. The cells are then washed with a physiological buffer, e.g., PBS with 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole, and media containing 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole. The labeled target cells are then opsonized (coated) with a molecule of the invention comprising an epitope binding domain specific for Fc\u03b3RIIA and, optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof). In preferred embodiments, the molecule used in the ADCC assay is also specific for a cell surface receptor, a tumor antigen, or a cancer antigen. The diabody molecule of the invention may specifically bind any cancer or tumor antigen, such as those listed in section 5.6.1. The target cells in the ADCC assay are chosen according to the epitope binding sites engineered into the diabody of the invention, such that the diabody binds a cell surface receptor of the target cell specifically.","Target cells are added to effector cells, e.g., PBMC, to produce effector:target ratios of approximately 1:1, 10:1, 30:1, 50:1, 75:1, or 100:1. The effector and target cells are incubated for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% CO. Cell supernatants are harvested and added to an acidic europium solution (e.g., DELFIA Europium Solution, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). The fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). Maximal release (MR) and spontaneous release (SR) are determined by incubation of target cells with 1% TX-100 and media alone, respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity (AICC) is measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of a test molecule, e.g., diabody of the invention. Each assay is preferably performed in triplicate. The mean percentage specific lysis is calculated as: Experimental release (ADCC)\u2212AICC)\/(MR\u2212SR)\u00d7100.","The invention encompasses assays known in the art, and exemplified herein, to characterize the binding of C1q and mediation of complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by molecules of the invention comprising Fc domains (or portions thereof). To determine C1q binding, a C1q binding ELISA may be performed. An exemplary assay may comprise the following: assay plates may be coated overnight at 4C with polypeptide comprising a molecule of the invention or starting polypeptide (control) in coating buffer. The plates may then be washed and blocked. Following washing, an aliquot of human C1q may be added to each well and incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature. Following a further wash, 100 uL of a sheep anti-complement C1q peroxidase conjugated antibody may be added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate may again be washed with wash buffer and 100 ul of substrate buffer containing OPD (O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma)) may be added to each well. The oxidation reaction, observed by the appearance of a yellow color, may be allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of 100 ul of 4.5 NH2 SO4. The absorbance may then read at (492-405) nm.","To assess complement activation, a complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay may be performed, e.g as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, various concentrations of the molecule comprising a (variant) Fc domain (or portion thereof) and human complement may be diluted with buffer. Cells which express the antigen to which the diabody molecule binds may be diluted to a density of about 1\u00d710cells\/ml. Mixtures of the diabody molecules comprising a (variant) Fc domain (or portion thereof), diluted human complement and cells expressing the antigen may be added to a flat bottom tissue culture 96 well plate and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at 37 C. and 5% CO2 to facilitate complement mediated cell lysis. 50 uL of alamar blue (Accumed International) may then be added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 C. The absorbance is measured using a 96-well fluorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The results may be expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU). The sample concentrations may be computed from a standard curve and the percent activity as compared to nonvariant molecule, i.e., a molecule not comprising an Fc domain or comprising a non-variant Fc domain, is reported for the variant of interest.","5.4.3 Other Assays","The molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding domain and, optionally, an Fc domain may be assayed using any surface plasmon resonance based assays known in the art for characterizing the kinetic parameters of an antigen-binding domain or Fc-Fc\u03b3R binding. Any SPR instrument commercially available including, but not limited to, BIAcore Instruments, available from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden); IAsys instruments available from Affinity Sensors (Franklin, Mass.); IBIS system available from Windsor Scientific Limited (Berks, UK), SPR-CELLIA systems available from Nippon Laser and Electronics Lab (Hokkaido, Japan), and SPR Detector Spreeta available from Texas Instruments (Dallas, Tex.) can be used in the instant invention. For a review of SPR-based technology see Mullet et al., 200022: 77-91; Dong et al., 200282: 303-23; Fivash et al., 19989: 97-101; Rich et al., 200011: 54-61; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Additionally, any of the SPR instruments and SPR based methods for measuring protein-protein interactions described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,373,577; 6,289,286; 5,322,798; 5,341,215; 6,268,125 are contemplated in the methods of the invention, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Briefly, SPR based assays involve immobilizing a member of a binding pair on a surface, and monitoring its interaction with the other member of the binding pair in solution in real time. SPR is based on measuring the change in refractive index of the solvent near the surface that occurs upon complex formation or dissociation. The surface onto which the immobilization occur is the sensor chip, which is at the heart of the SPR technology; it consists of a glass surface coated with a thin layer of gold and forms the basis for a range of specialized surfaces designed to optimize the binding of a molecule to the surface. A variety of sensor chips are commercially available especially from the companies listed supra, all of which may be used in the methods of the invention. Examples of sensor chips include those available from BIAcore AB, Inc., e.g., Sensor Chip CM5, SA, NTA, and HPA. A molecule of the invention may be immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip using any of the immobilization methods and chemistries known in the art, including but not limited to, direct covalent coupling via amine groups, direct covalent coupling via sulfhydryl groups, biotin attachment to avidin coated surface, aldehyde coupling to carbohydrate groups, and attachment through the histidine tag with NTA chips.","In some embodiments, the kinetic parameters of the binding of molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding sites and, optionally, and Fc domain, to an antigen or an Fc\u03b3R may be determined using a BIAcore instrument (e.g., BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). As discussed supra, see section 5.4.1, any Fc\u03b3R can be used to assess the binding of the molecules of the invention either where at least one epitope binding site of the diabody molecule immunospecifically recognizes an Fc\u03b3R, and\/or where the diabody molecule comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof). In a specific embodiment the Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIIA, preferably a soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA. For example, in one embodiment, the soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA is the extracellular region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA joined to the linker-AVITAG sequence (see, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/439,498, filed on Jan. 9, 2003 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/456,041 filed on Mar. 19, 2003, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). In another specific embodiment, the Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIB, preferably a soluble dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB. For example in one embodiment, the soluble dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB protein is prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional application No. 60\/439,709 filed on Jan. 13, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","For all immunological assays, Fc\u03b3R recognition\/binding by a molecule of the invention may be effected by multiple domains: in certain embodiments, molecules of the invention immunospecifically recognize an Fc\u03b3R via one of the multiple epitope binding domains; in yet other embodiments, where the molecule of the invention comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof), the diabody molecule may immunospecifically recognize an Fc\u03b3R via Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions; in yet further embodiments, where a molecule of the invention comprises both an Fc domain (or portion thereof) and an epitope binding site that immunospecifically recognizes an Fc\u03b3R, the diabody molecule may recognize an Fc\u03b3R via one or both of an epitope binding domain and the Fc domain (or portion thereof). An exemplary assay for determining the kinetic parameters of a molecule comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, and Fc domain (or portion thereof) to an antigen and\/or an Fc\u03b3R using a BIAcore instrument comprises the following: a first antigen is immobilized on one of the four flow cells of a sensor chip surface, preferably through amine coupling chemistry such that about 5000 response units (RU) of said first antigen is immobilized on the surface. Once a suitable surface is prepared, molecules of the invention that immunospecifically recognize said first antigen are passed over the surface, preferably by one minute injections of a 20 \u03bcg\/mL solution at a 5 \u03bcL\/mL flow rate. Levels of molecules of the invention bound to the surface at this stage typically ranges between 400 and 700 RU. Next, dilution series of a second antigen (e.g., Fc\u03b3R) or Fc\u03b3R receptor in HBS-P buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) are injected onto the surface at 100 \u03bcL\/min Regeneration of molecules between different second antigen or receptor dilutions is carried out preferably by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4; 3M NaCl. Any regeneration technique known in the art is contemplated in the method of the invention.","Once an entire data set is collected, the resulting binding curves are globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the SPR instrument manufacturer, e.g., BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). These algorithms calculate both the Kand Kfrom which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants (i.e., K\/K). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). The analysis of the generated data may be done using any method known in the art. For a review of the various methods of interpretation of the kinetic data generated see Myszka, 19978: 50-7; Fisher et al., 19945: 389-95; O'Shannessy, 19945:65-71; Chaiken et al., 1992201: 197-210; Morton et al., 1995227: 176-85; O'Shannessy et al., 1996236: 275-83; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","In preferred embodiments, the kinetic parameters determined using an SPR analysis, e.g., BIAcore, may be used as a predictive measure of how a molecule of the invention will function in a functional assay, e.g., ADCC. An exemplary method for predicting the efficacy of a molecule of the invention based on kinetic parameters obtained from an SPR analysis may comprise the following: determining the Kvalues for binding of a molecule of the invention to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB (via an epitope binding domain and\/or an Fc domain (or portion thereof)); plotting (1) K(wt)\/K(mut) for Fc\u03b3RIIIA; (2) K(mut)\/K(wt) for Fc\u03b3RIIB against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to wild type; and possess and enhanced ADCC function.","5.5 Methods of Producing Diabody Molecules of the Invention","The diabody molecules of the present invention can be produced using a variety of methods well known in the art, including de novo protein synthesis and recombinant expression of nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins. The desired nucleic acid sequences can be produced by recombinant methods (e.g., PCR mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant of the desired polynucleotide) or by solid-phase DNA synthesis. Usually recombinant expression methods are used. In one aspect, the invention provides a polynucleotide that comprises a sequence encoding a CD16A VH and\/or VL; in another aspect, the invention provides a polynucleotide that comprises a sequence encoding a CD32B VH and\/or VL. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences encode each immunoglobulin amino acid sequence, and the present invention includes all nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins described herein.","5.5.1 Polynucleotides Encoding Molecules of the Invention.","The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the molecules of the invention, including the polypeptides and antibodies. The polynucleotides encoding the molecules of the invention may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence of the molecules that are identified by the methods of the invention is determined, the nucleotide sequence may be manipulated using methods well known in the art, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 20013rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate, for example, antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example by generating amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In one embodiment, human libraries or any other libraries available in the art, can be screened by standard techniques known in the art, to clone the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention.","5.5.2 Recombinant Expression of Molecules of the Invention","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies) has been obtained, the vector for the production of the molecules may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequences for the molecules of the invention and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. (See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 19902d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds., 1998, John Wiley & Sons, NY).","An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of a molecule identified by the methods of the invention can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation) and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the molecules of the invention. In specific embodiments, the expression of the molecules of the invention is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible or a tissue, specific promoter.","The host cells used to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention may be either bacterial cells such as , or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Foecking et al., 199845:101; Cockett et al., 19908:2).","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the molecules of the invention may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express the molecules of the invention in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., and ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baclovirus) containing the sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 293T, 3T3 cells, lymphotic cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715), Per C.6 cells (human retinal cells developed by Crucell) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 19832:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, 198513:3101-3109; Van Heeke & Schuster, 198924:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (e.g., the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (e.g., the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, 198481:355-359). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., 1987153:51-544).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. For example, in certain embodiments, the polypeptides comprising a diabody molecule of the invention may be expressed as a single gene product (e.g., as a single polypeptide chain, i.e., as a polyprotein precursor), requiring proteolytic cleavage by native or recombinant cellular mechanisms to form the separate polypeptides of the diabody molecules of the invention. The invention thus encompasses engineering a nucleic acid sequence to encode a polyprotein precursor molecule comprising the polypeptides of the invention, which includes coding sequences capable of directing post translational cleavage of said polyprotein precursor. Post-translational cleavage of the polyprotein precursor results in the polypeptides of the invention. The post translational cleavage of the precursor molecule comprising the polypeptides of the invention may occur in vivo (i.e., within the host cell by native or recombinant cell systems\/mechanisms, e.g. furin cleavage at an appropriate site) or may occur in vitro (e.g incubation of said polypeptide chain in a composition comprising proteases or peptidases of known activity and\/or in a composition comprising conditions or reagents known to foster the desired proteolytic action). Purification and modification of recombinant proteins is well known in the art such that the design of the polyprotein precursor could include a number of embodiments readily appreciated by a skilled worker. Any known proteases or peptidases known in the art can be used for the described modification of the precursor molecule, e.g., thrombin (which recognizes the amino acid sequence LVPR^GS (SEQ ID NO:91)), or factor Xa (which recognizes the amino acid sequence I(E\/D)GR^ (SEQ ID NO:92) (Nagani et al., 1985, PNAS USA 82:7252-7255, and reviewed in Jenny et al., 2003, Protein Expr. Purif. 31:1-11, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)), enterokinase (which recognizes the amino acid sequence DDDDK^ (SEQ ID NO:93) (Collins-Racie et al., 1995, Biotechnol. 13:982-987 hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)), furin (which recognizes the amino acid sequence RXXR^, with a preference for RX(K\/R)R^ (SEQ ID NO:94 and SEQ ID NO:95, respectively) (additional R at P6 position appears to enhance cleavage)), and AcTEV (which recognizes the amino acid sequence ENLYFQ^G (SEQ ID NO:96) (Parks et al., 1994, Anal. Biochem. 216:413 hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)) and the Foot and Mouth Disease Virus Protease C3. See for example, section 6.4, supra.","Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, WI38, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the molecules of the invention.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., 197711: 223), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 199248: 202), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., 198022: 817) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt- cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., 198077:357; O'Hare et al., 198178: 1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 198178: 2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 12: 488-505; Wu and Wu, 1991, 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 199332:573-596; Mulligan, 1993260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson, 199362:191-217; May, 199311(5):155-215). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), 1993, John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, Stockton Press, NY; and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colberre-Garapin et al., 1981150:1; and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., 198430:147).","The expression levels of a molecule of the invention can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, , Vol. 3 (Academic Press, New York, 1987). When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of a polypeptide of the diabody molecule, production of the polypeptide will also increase (Crouse et al., 19833:257).","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding the first polypeptide of the diabody molecule and the second vector encoding the second polypeptide of the diabody molecule. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of both polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both polypeptides. The coding sequences for the polypeptides of the molecules of the invention may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once a molecule of the invention (i.e., diabodies) has been recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of polypeptides, polyproteins or diabodies (e.g., analogous to antibody purification schemes based on antigen selectivity) for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen (optionally after Protein A selection where the diabody molecule comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof)), and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of polypeptides, polyproteins or diabodies.","5.6 Prophylactic and Therapeutic Methods","The molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment and\/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection where an effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by Fc\u03b3R is desired (e.g., cancer, infectious disease). As discussed supra, the diabodies of the invention may exhibit antibody-like functionality in eliciting effector function although the diabody molecule does not comprise and Fc domain. By comprising at least one epitope binding domain that immunospecifically recognizes an Fc\u03b3R, the diabody molecule may exhibit Fc\u03b3R binding and activity analogous to Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions. For example, molecules of the invention may bind a cell surface antigen and an Fc\u03b3R (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA) on an immune effector cell (e.g., NK cell), stimulating an effector function (e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc.) against said cell.","In other embodiments, the diabody molecule of the invention comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof). In such embodiments, the Fc domain may further comprise at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc domain (or portion thereof) and\/or may comprise domains from one or more IgG isotypes (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4). Molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc domains may exhibit conferred or altered phenotypes relative to molecules comprising the wild type Fc domain such as an altered or conferred effector function activity (e.g., as assayed in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay). In said embodiments, molecules of the invention with conferred or altered effector function activity are useful for the treatment and\/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection where an enhanced efficacy of effector function activity is desired. In certain embodiments, the diabody molecules of the invention comprising an Fc domain (or portion thereof) mediate complement dependent cascade. Fc domain variants identified as altering effector function are disclosed in International Application WO04\/063351, U.S. Patent Application Publications 2005\/0037000 and 2005\/0064514, U.S. Provisional Applications 60\/626,510, filed Nov. 10, 2004, 60\/636,663, filed Dec. 15, 2004, and 60\/781,564, filed Mar. 10, 2006, U.S. Pat. No. 7,632,497, and United States Patent Publication 2006\/0177439, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment, prevention or management of a cancer in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising one or more epitope binding sites, and optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof) engineered in accordance with the invention, which molecule further binds a cancer antigen. Molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the prevention, inhibition, reduction of growth or regression of primary tumors, metastasis of cancer cells, and infectious diseases. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, molecules of the invention mediate effector function resulting in tumor clearance, tumor reduction or a combination thereof. In alternate embodiments, the diabodies of the invention mediate therapeutic activity by cross-linking of cell surface antigens and\/or receptors and enhanced apoptosis or negative growth regulatory signaling.","Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the diabody molecules of the invention exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy relative to therapeutic antibodies known in the art, in part, due to the ability of diabody to immunospecifically bind a target cell which expresses a particular antigen (e.g., Fc\u03b3R) at reduced levels, for example, by virtue of the ability of the diabody to remain on the target cell longer due to an improved avidity of the diabody-epitope interaction.","The diabodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for antigens (e.g., Fc\u03b3Rs) are particularly useful for the treatment, prevention or management of a cancer, or another disease or disorder, in a subject, wherein the Fc\u03b3Rs are expressed at low levels in the target cell populations. As used herein, Fc\u03b3R expression in cells is defined in terms of the density of such molecules per cell as measured using common methods known to those skilled in the art. The molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding sites and, optionally, and Fc\u03b3R (or portion thereof) preferably also have a conferred or an enhanced avidity and affinity and\/or effector function in cells which express a target antigen, e.g., a cancer antigen, at a density of 30,000 to 20,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 20,000 to 10,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 10,000 molecules\/cell or less, at a density of 5000 molecules\/cell or less, or at a density of 1000 molecules\/cell or less. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population.","The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with other therapeutic agents known in the art for the treatment or prevention of diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammatory disorders, and infectious diseases. In a specific embodiment, molecules of the invention may be used in combination with monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, lymphokines, or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), which, for example, serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the molecules and, increase immune response. The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with one or more drugs used to treat a disease, disorder, or infection such as, for example anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents or anti-viral agents, e.g., as detailed in Section 5.7.","5.6.1 Cancers","The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising multiple epitope binding domains. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject with Fc\u03b3R polymorphisms such as those homozygous for the F\u03b3RIIIA-158V or Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158F alleles. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering at least one epitope binding domain of the diabody molecule to immunospecifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA (158F). In other embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering at least one epitope binding domain of the diabody molecule to immunospecifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA (158V).","The efficacy of standard monoclonal antibody therapy depends on the Fc\u03b3R polymorphism of the subject (Carton et al., 2002 99: 754-8; Weng et al., 2003 21(21):3940-7 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). These receptors are expressed on the surface of the effector cells and mediate ADCC. High affinity alleles, of the low affinity activating receptors, improve the effector cells' ability to mediate ADCC. In contrast to relying on Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions to effect effector function, the methods of the invention encompass engineering molecules to immunospecifically recognize the low affinity activating receptors, allowing the molecules to be designed for a specific polymorphism. Alternately or additionally, the molecule of the invention may be engineered to comprise a variant Fc domain that exhibits enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3R (relative to a wild type Fc domain) on effector cells. The engineered molecules of the invention provide better immunotherapy reagents for patients regardless of their Fc\u03b3R polymorphism.","Diabody molecules engineered in accordance with the invention are tested by ADCC using either a cultured cell line or patient derived PMBC cells to determine the ability of the Fc mutations to enhance ADCC. Standard ADCC is performed using methods disclosed herein. Lymphocytes are harvested from peripheral blood using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Target cells, i.e., cultured cell lines or patient derived cells, are loaded with Europium (PerkinElmer) and incubated with effectors for 4 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. Released Europium is detected using a fluorescent plate reader (Wallac). The resulting ADCC data indicates the efficacy of the molecules of the invention to trigger NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and establish which molecules can be tested with both patient samples and elutriated monocytes. Diabody molecules showing the greatest potential for eliciting ADCC activity are then tested in an ADCC assay using PBMCs from patients. PBMC from healthy donors are used as effector cells.","Accordingly, the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen by engineering the diabody molecule to immunospecifically recognize said cancer antigen such that the diabody molecule is itself cytotoxic (e.g., via crosslinking of surface receptors leading to increased apoptosis or downregulation of proliferative signals) and\/or comprises an Fc domain, according to the invention, and\/or mediates one or more effector function (e.g., ADCC, phagocytosis). The diabodies that have been engineered according to the invention are useful for prevention or treatment of cancer, since they have an cytotoxic activity (e.g., enhanced tumor cell killing and\/or enhanced for example, ADCC activity or CDC activity).","Cancers associated with a cancer antigen may be treated or prevented by administration of a diabody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic, and\/or has been engineered according to the methods of the invention to exhibit effector function. For example, but not by way of limitation, cancers associated with the following cancer antigens may be treated or prevented by the methods and compositions of the invention: KS 1\/4 pan-carcinoma antigen (Perez and Walker, 1990142:32-37; Bumal, 19887(4):407-415), ovarian carcinoma antigen (CA125) (Yu et al., 199151(2):48-475), prostatic acid phosphate (Tailor et al., 199018(1):4928), prostate specific antigen (Henttu and Vihko, 198910(2):903-910; Israeli et al., 199353:227-230), melanoma-associated antigen p97 (Estin et al., 198981(6):445-44), melanoma antigen gp75 (Vijayasardahl et al., 1990171(4):1375-1380), high molecular weight melanoma antigen (HMW-MAA) (Natali et al., 198759:55-3; Mittelman et al., 199086:2136-2144)), prostate specific membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Foon et al., 199413:294), polymorphic epithelial mucin antigen, human milk fat globule antigen, Colorectal tumor-associated antigens such as: CEA, TAG-72 (Yokata et al., 199252:3402-3408), CO17-1A (Ragnhammar et al., 199353:751-758); GICA 19-9 (Herlyn et al., 19822:135), CTA-1 and LEA, Burkitt's lymphoma antigen-38.13, CD19 (Ghetie et al., 199483:1329-1336), human B-lymphoma antigen-CD20 (Reff et al., 199483:435-445), CD33 (Sgouros et al., 199334:422-430), melanoma specific antigens such as ganglioside GD2 (Saleh et al., 1993, J.

Immunotoxicotherapy in accordance with the methods of the invention can be used to treat overdoses or exposure to drugs including, but not limited to, digixin, PCP, cocaine, colchicine, and tricyclic antidepressants.","5.7 Combination Therapy","The invention further encompasses administering the molecules of the invention in combination with other therapies known to those skilled in the art for the treatment or prevention of cancer, autoimmune disease, infectious disease or intoxication, including but not limited to, current standard and experimental chemotherapies, hormonal therapies, biological therapies, immunotherapies, radiation therapies, or surgery. In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more agents, therapeutic antibodies or other agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer, autoimmune disease, infectious disease or intoxication.","In certain embodiments, one or more molecule of the invention is administered to a mammal, preferably a human, concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer. The term \u201cconcurrently\u201d is not limited to the administration of prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same time, but rather it is meant that a molecule of the invention and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the molecule of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each prophylactic or therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy or biological therapy) may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. In various embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered less than 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In preferred embodiments, two or more components are administered within the same patient visit.","In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered at about 2 to 4 days apart, at about 4 to 6 days apart, at about 1 week part, at about 1 to 2 weeks apart, or more than 2 weeks apart. In preferred embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a time frame where both agents are still active. One skilled in the art would be able to determine such a time frame by determining the half life of the administered agents.","In certain embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second agent and\/or third agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and\/or improves the efficacy of the treatment.","In certain embodiments, prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a cycle of less than about 3 weeks, about once every two weeks, about once every 10 days or about once every week. One cycle can comprise the administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent by infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle, about 1 hour every cycle, about 45 minutes every cycle. Each cycle can comprise at least 1 week of rest, at least 2 weeks of rest, at least 3 weeks of rest. The number of cycles administered is from about 1 to about 12 cycles, more typically from about 2 to about 10 cycles, and more typically from about 2 to about 8 cycles.","In yet other embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents of the invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimens, either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration can involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically the therapeutic agents, in particular cytotoxic agents, are used at lower doses. Such dosing regimens encompass the chronic daily administration of relatively low doses for extended periods of time. In preferred embodiments, the use of lower doses can minimize toxic side effects and eliminate rest periods. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents are delivered by chronic low-dose or continuous infusion ranging from about 24 hours to about 2 days, to about 1 week, to about 2 weeks, to about 3 weeks to about 1 month to about 2 months, to about 3 months, to about 4 months, to about 5 months, to about 6 months. The scheduling of such dose regimens can be optimized by the skilled oncologist.","In other embodiments, courses of treatment are administered concurrently to a mammal, i.e., individual doses of the therapeutics are administered separately yet within a time interval such that molecules of the invention can work together with the other agent or agents. For example, one component may be administered one time per week in combination with the other components that may be administered one time every two weeks or one time every three weeks. In other words, the dosing regimens for the therapeutics are carried out concurrently even if the therapeutics are not administered simultaneously or within the same patient visit.","When used in combination with other prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents, the molecules of the invention and the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In one embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more therapeutic agents in the same pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents in separate pharmaceutical compositions. In still another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another prophylactic or therapeutic agent. The invention contemplates administration of a molecule of the invention in combination with other prophylactic or therapeutic agents by the same or different routes of administration, e.g., oral and parenteral. In certain embodiments, when a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with another prophylactic or therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including, but not limited to, toxicity, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent can advantageously be administered at a dose that falls below the threshold that the adverse side effect is elicited.","The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered, the severity and type of cancer, the route of administration, as well as age, body weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following, for example, dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the (56ed., 2002).","5.7.1 Anti-Cancer Agents","In a specific embodiment, the methods of the invention encompass the administration of one or more molecules of the invention with one or more therapeutic agents used for the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer.

conjunction with other treatment agents. Examples of immunomodulatory agents include, but are not limited to, methothrexate, ENBREL, REMICADE\u2122, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., FK506 (tacrolimus)), methylprednisolone (MP), corticosteroids, steriods, mycophenolate mofetil, rapamycin (sirolimus), mizoribine, deoxyspergualin, brequinar, malononitriloamindes (e.g., leflunamide), T cell receptor modulators, and cytokine receptor modulators.","Anti-inflammatory agents have exhibited success in treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and are now a common and a standard treatment for such disorders. Any anti-inflammatory agent well-known to one of skill in the art can be used in the methods of the invention. Non-limiting examples of anti-inflammatory agents include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-agonists, anticholingeric agents, and methyl xanthines. Examples of NSAIDs include, but are not limited to, aspirin, ibuprofen, celecoxib (CELEBREX\u2122), diclofenac (VOLTAREN\u2122), etodolac (LODINE\u2122), fenoprofen (NALFON\u2122), indomethacin (INDOCIN\u2122), ketoralac (TORADOL\u2122), oxaprozin (DAYPRO\u2122), nabumentone (RELAFEN\u2122), sulindac (CLINORIL\u2122), tolmentin (TOLECTIN\u2122), rofecoxib (VIOXX\u2122), naproxen (ALEVE\u2122, NAPROSYN\u2122), ketoprofen (ACTRON\u2122) and nabumetone (RELAFEN\u2122). Such NSAIDs function by inhibiting a cyclooxgenase enzyme (e.g., COX-1 and\/or COX-2). Examples of steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include, but are not limited to, glucocorticoids, dexamethasone (DECADRON\u2122), cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone (DELTASONE\u2122), prednisolone, triamcinolone, azulfidine, and eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes.","A non-limiting example of the antibodies that can be used for the treatment or prevention of

embodiments, the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or additional therapeutic agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of an infectious disease. The invention contemplates the use of the molecules of the invention in combination with antibiotics known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and or prevention of an infectious disease. Antibiotics that can be used in combination with the molecules of the invention include, but are not limited to, macrolide (e.g., tobramycin (Tobi\u00ae)), a cephalosporin (e.g., cephalexin (Keflex\u00ae), cephradine (Velosef\u00ae), cefuroxime (Ceftin\u00ae), cefprozil (Cefzil\u00ae), cefaclor (Ceclor\u00ae), cefixime (Suprax\u00ae) or cefadroxil (Duricef\u00ae)), a clarithromycin (e.g., clarithromycin (Biaxin\u00ae)), an erythromycin (e.g., erythromycin (EMycin\u00ae)), a penicillin (e.g., penicillin V (V-Cillin K\u00ae or Pen Vee K\u00ae)) or a quinolone (e.g., ofloxacin (Floxin\u00ae), ciprofloxacin (Cipro\u00ae) or norfloxacin (Noroxin\u00ae)), aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g., apramycin, arbekacin, bambermycins, butirosin, dibekacin, neomycin, neomycin, undecylenate, netilmicin, paromomycin, ribostamycin, sisomicin, and spectinomycin), amphenicol antibiotics (e.g., azidamfenicol, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, and thiamphenicol), ansamycin antibiotics (e.g., rifamide and rifampin), carbacephems (e.g., loracarbef), carbapenems (e.g., biapenem and imipenem), cephalosporins (e.g., cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefamandole, cefatrizine, cefazedone, cefozopran, cefpimizole, cefpiramide, and cefpirome), cephamycins (e.g., cefbuperazone, cefinetazole, and cefminox), monobactams (e.g., aztreonam, carumonam, and tigemonam), oxacephems (e.g., flomoxef, and moxalactam), penicillins (e.g., amdinocillin, amdinocillin pivoxil, amoxicillin, bacampicillin, benzylpenicillinic acid, benzylpenicillin sodium, epicillin, fenbenicillin, floxacillin, penamccillin, penethamate hydriodide, penicillin o-benethamine, penicillin 0, penicillin V, penicillin V benzathine, penicillin V hydrabamine, penimepicycline, and phencihicillin potassium), lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin, and lincomycin), amphomycin, bacitracin, capreomycin, colistin, enduracidin, enviomycin, tetracyclines (e.g., apicycline, chlortetracycline, clomocycline, and demeclocycline), 2,4-diaminopyrimidines (e.g., brodimoprim), nitrofurans (e.g., furaltadone, and furazolium chloride), quinolones and analogs thereof (e.g., cinoxacin, clinafloxacin, flumequine, and grepagloxacin), sulfonamides (e.g., acetyl sulfamethoxypyrazine, benzylsulfamide, noprylsulfamide, phthalylsulfacetamide, sulfachrysoidine, and sulfacytine), sulfones (e.g., diathymosulfone, glucosulfone sodium, and solasulfone), cycloserine, mupirocin and tuberin.","In certain embodiments, the molecules of the invention can be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more antifingal agents. Antifungal agents that can be used in combination with the molecules of the invention include but are not limited to amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, intrathecal, flucytosine, miconazole, butoconazole, clotrimazole, nystatin, terconazole, tioconazole, ciclopirox, econazole, haloprogrin, naftifine, terbinafine, undecylenate, and griseofuldin.","In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention can be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more anti-viral agent. Useful anti-viral agents that can be used in combination with the molecules of the invention include, but are not limited to, protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside analogs. Examples of antiviral agents include but are not limited to zidovudine, acyclovir, gangcyclovir, vidarabine, idoxuridine, trifluridine, and ribavirin, as well as foscarnet, amantadine, rimantadine, saquinavir, indinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, the alpha-interferons; adefovir, clevadine, entecavir, pleconaril.","5.8 Vaccine Therapy","The invention further encompasses using a composition of the invention to induce an immune response against an antigenic or immunogenic agent, including but not limited to cancer antigens and infectious disease antigens (examples of which are disclosed infra). The vaccine compositions of the invention comprise one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents to which an immune response is desired, wherein the one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents is coated with a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIIA. The vaccine compositions of the invention are particularly effective in eliciting an immune response, preferably a protective immune response against the antigenic or immunogenic agent.","In some embodiments, the antigenic or immunogenic agent in the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a virus against which an immune response is desired. The viruses may be recombinant or chimeric, and are preferably attenuated. Production of recombinant, chimeric, and attenuated viruses may be performed using standard methods known to one skilled in the art. The invention encompasses a live recombinant viral vaccine or an inactivated recombinant viral vaccine to be formulated in accordance with the invention. A live vaccine may be preferred because multiplication in the host leads to a prolonged stimulus of similar kind and magnitude to that occurring in natural infections, and therefore, confers substantial, long-lasting immunity. Production of such live recombinant virus vaccine formulations may be accomplished using conventional methods involving propagation of the virus in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo followed by purification.","In a specific embodiment, the recombinant virus is non-pathogenic to the subject to which it is administered. In this regard, the use of genetically engineered viruses for vaccine purposes may require the presence of attenuation characteristics in these strains. The introduction of appropriate mutations (e.g., deletions) into the templates used for transfection may provide the novel viruses with attenuation characteristics. For example, specific missense mutations which are associated with temperature sensitivity or cold adaptation can be made into deletion mutations. These mutations should be more stable than the point mutations associated with cold or temperature sensitive mutants and reversion frequencies should be extremely low. Recombinant DNA technologies for engineering recombinant viruses are known in the art and encompassed in the invention. For example, techniques for modifying negative strand RNA viruses are known in the art, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,057, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Alternatively, chimeric viruses with \u201csuicide\u201d characteristics may be constructed for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. Such viruses would go through only one or a few rounds of replication within the host. When used as a vaccine, the recombinant virus would go through limited replication cycle(s) and induce a sufficient level of immune response but it would not go further in the human host and cause disease. Alternatively, inactivated (killed) virus may be formulated in accordance with the invention. Inactivated vaccine formulations may be prepared using conventional techniques to \u201ckill\u201d the chimeric viruses. Inactivated vaccines are \u201cdead\u201d in the sense that their infectivity has been destroyed. Ideally, the infectivity of the virus is destroyed without affecting its immunogenicity. In order to prepare inactivated vaccines, the chimeric virus may be grown in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo, purified by zonal ultracentrifugation, inactivated by formaldehyde or \u03b2-propiolactone, and pooled.","In certain embodiments, completely foreign epitopes, including antigens derived from other viral or non-viral pathogens can be engineered into the virus for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. For example, antigens of non-related viruses such as HIV (gp160, gp120, gp41) parasite antigens (e.g., malaria), bacterial or fungal antigens or tumor antigens can be engineered into the attenuated strain.","Virtually any heterologous gene sequence may be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations. Preferably, heterologous gene sequences are moieties and peptides that act as biological response modifiers. Preferably, epitopes that induce a protective immune response to any of a variety of pathogens, or antigens that bind neutralizing antibodies may be expressed by or as part of the chimeric viruses. For example, heterologous gene sequences that can be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention include, but are not limited to, influenza and parainfluenza hemagglutinin neuraminidase and fusion glycoproteins such as the HN and F genes of human PIV3. In yet another embodiment, heterologous gene sequences that can be engineered into the chimeric viruses include those that encode proteins with immuno-modulating activities. Examples of immuno-modulating proteins include, but are not limited to, cytokines, interferon type 1, gamma interferon, colony stimulating factors, interleukin-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -12, and antagonists of these agents.","In yet other embodiments, the invention encompasses pathogenic cells or viruses, preferably attenuated viruses, which express the variant antibody on their surface.","In alternative embodiments, the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a fusion polypeptide wherein an antigenic or immunogenic agent is operatively linked to a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Engineering fusion polypeptides for use in the vaccine compositions of the invention is performed using routine recombinant DNA technology methods and is within the level of ordinary skill.","The invention further encompasses methods to induce tolerance in a subject by administering a composition of the invention. Preferably a composition suitable for inducing tolerance in a subject, comprises an antigenic or immunogenic agent coated with a variant antibody of the invention, wherein the variant antibody has a higher affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIB. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, such compositions are effective in inducing tolerance by activating the Fc\u03b3RIIB mediatated inhibitory pathway.","5.9 Compositions and Methods of Administering","The invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions comprising molecules of the invention (i.e., diabodies) comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof). The invention also provides methods of treatment, prophylaxis, and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention. In a preferred aspect, an antibody, a fusion protein, or a conjugated molecule, is substantially purified (i.e., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). In a specific embodiment, the subject is an animal, preferably a mammal such as non-primate (e.g., cows, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, rats etc.) and a primate (e.g., monkey such as, a cynomolgous monkey and a human). In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. In yet another preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is from the same species as the subject.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a composition comprising molecules of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or fusion protein, receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987262:4429-4432), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of administering a molecule of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural, and mucosal (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In a specific embodiment, the molecules of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92\/19244; WO 97\/32572; WO 97\/44013; WO 98\/31346; and WO 99\/66903, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention also provides that the molecules of the invention, are packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of antibody. In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g., with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized molecules of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8\u00b0 C. in their original container and the molecules should be administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, molecules of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the molecule, fusion protein, or conjugated molecule. Preferably, the liquid form of the molecules of the invention are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg\/ml, more preferably at least 2.5 mg\/ml, at least 5 mg\/ml, at least 8 mg\/ml, at least 10 mg\/ml, at least 15 mg\/kg, at least 25 mg\/ml, at least 50 mg\/ml, at least 100 mg\/ml, at least 150 mg\/ml, at least 200 mg\/ml of the molecules.","The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For diabodies encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.75 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg to 0.25 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg\/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg\/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. The dosage and frequency of administration of diabodies of the invention may be reduced or altered by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the diabodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","In one embodiment, the dosage of the molecules of the invention administered to a patient are 0.01 mg to 1000 mg\/day, when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the molecules of the invention are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a molecule of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the molecule does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (See Langer, 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in , Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 3 17-327; see generally ibid.).","In yet another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more molecules of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; PCT publication WO 91\/05548; PCT publication WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996, \u201cIntratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel,\u201d & 39:179-189, Song et al., 1995, \u201cAntibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long-Circulating Emulsions,\u201d & 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 1997, \u201cBiodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application,\u201d 24:853-854; and Lam et al., 1997, \u201cMicroencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery,\u201d 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, a pump may be used in a controlled release system (See Langer, supra; Sefton, 198714:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; and Saudek et al., 1989321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled release of antibodies (see e.g., , Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 198323:61; See also Levy et al., 1985228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 19897 1:105); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,679,377; 5,916,597; 5,912,015; 5,989,463; 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99\/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99\/20253). Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target (e.g., the lungs), thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). In another embodiment, polymeric compositions useful as controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,155). This particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another embodiment, a non-polymeric sustained delivery system is used, whereby a non-polymeric implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in the body, the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate, disperse, or leach from the composition into surrounding tissue fluid, and the non-polymeric material will gradually coagulate or precipitate to form a solid, microporous matrix (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,533).","Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; International Publication Nos. WO 91\/05548 and WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996& 39:179-189; Song et al., 1995& 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 199724:853-854; and Lam et al., 199724:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In a specific embodiment where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a diabody of the invention, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded diabody, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (See e.g., Joliot et al., 199188:1864-1868), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.","Treatment of a subject with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of molecules of the invention can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with molecules of the invention in the range of between about 0.1 to 30 mg\/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered once a week, twice a week, once every two weeks, once a month, once every six weeks, once every two months, twice a year or once per year. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of the molecules used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment.","5.9.1 Pharmaceutical Compositions","The compositions of the invention include bulk drug compositions useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., impure or non-sterile compositions) and pharmaceutical compositions (i.e., compositions that are suitable for administration to a subject or patient) which can be used in the preparation of unit dosage forms. Such compositions comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agent disclosed herein or a combination of those agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, compositions of the invention comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a diabody molecule of the invention and a therapeutic antibody (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibody) that is specific for a particular cancer antigen, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant (e.g., Freund's adjuvant (complete and incomplete), excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.","Generally, the ingredients of compositions of the invention are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","5.9.2 Gene Therapy","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding molecules of the invention, are administered to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection, by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or fusion protein that mediates a therapeutic or prophylactic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., 199312:488-505; Wu and Wu, 19913:87-95; Tolstoshev, 199332:573-596; Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, 199362:191-217; May, 1993, TIBTECH 11(5):155-215. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), , John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, , Stockton Press, NY (1990).","In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding a diabody of the invention, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, 198986:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al., 1989342:435-438).","In another preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding a fusion protein, said nucleic acids being a part of an expression vector that expresses the fusion protein in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the coding region of a fusion protein, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the coding sequence of the fusion protein and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the fusion protein.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a subject may be either direct, in which case the subject is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the subject. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a an antigen subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987262:4429-4432) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-an antigen complexes can be formed in which the an antigen comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (See, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; WO92\/20316; WO93\/14188; WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, 198986:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al., 1989342:435-438).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding a molecule of the invention (e.g., a diabody or a fusion protein) are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (See Miller et al., 1993217:581-599). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody or a fusion protein to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the nucleotide sequence into a subject. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., (19946:291-302), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., 199493:644-651; Klein et al., 199483:1467-1473; Salmons and Gunzberg, 19934:129-141; and Grossman and Wilson, 19933:110-114.","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson (3:499-503, 1993, present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., (5:3-10, 1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., 1991252:431-434; Rosenfeld et al., 199268:143-155; Mastrangeli et al., 199391:225-234; PCT Publication WO94\/12649; and Wang et al., 19952:775-783. In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (see, e.g.,Walsh et al., 1993204:289-300 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a subject.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to, transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector, containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcellmediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (See, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, 1993217:599-618, Cohen et al., 1993217:618-644; and 29:69-92, 1985) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a subject by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the subject.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or a fusion protein are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (See e.g., PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, 19927 1:973-985; Rheinwald, 198021A:229; and Pittelkow and Scott, 198661:771).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","5.9.3 Kits","The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with the molecules of the invention. Additionally, one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included in the pharmaceutical pack or kit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises one or more molecules of the invention. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer, in one or more containers. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more cytotoxic antibodies that bind one or more cancer antigens associated with cancer. In certain embodiments, the other prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic. In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a biological or hormonal therapeutic.","5.10 Characterization and Demonstration of Therapeutic Utility","Several aspects of the pharmaceutical compositions, prophylactic, or therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, in a cell culture system, and in an animal model organism, such as a rodent animal model system, for the desired therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example, assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is desired, include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, and the effect of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule(s) for each individual patient. In various specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., T cells), to determine if a pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.","Combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include, but are not limited to, rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, pigs, dogs, rabbits, etc. Any animal system well-known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention, combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well-known to the skilled artisan. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be administered repeatedly. Several aspects of the procedure may vary. Said aspects include the temporal regime of administering the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents, and whether such agents are administered separately or as an admixture.","Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for example, transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs on mouse effector cells, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,396 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) can be used in the present invention. Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIA. Preferably, mutations showing the highest levels of activity in the functional assays described above will be tested for use in animal model studies prior to use in humans. Sufficient quantities of antibodies may be prepared for use in animal models using methods described supra, for example using mammalian expression systems and purification methods disclosed and exemplified herein.","Mouse xenograft models may be used for examining efficacy of mouse antibodies generated against a tumor specific target based on the affinity and specificity of the epitope being domains of the diabody molecule of the invention and the ability of the diabody to elicit an immune response (Wu et al., 2001, Trends Cell Biol. 11: S2-9). Transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs on mouse effector cells are unique and are tailor-made animal models to test the efficacy of human Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions. Pairs of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mouse lines generated in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch (Through a licensing agreement with Rockefeller U. and Sloan Kettering Cancer center) can be used such as those listed in the Table 11 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0430","num":"0429"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00025","num":"00025"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Mice Strains"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Strain Background","Human FcR"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","None"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3RIIIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3R IIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3R IIA and IIIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD32B KO","None"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD32B KO","Fc\u03b3R IIB"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be determined by using various experimental animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L., \u201cArthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals\u201d, in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et al.(eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993). Experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases can also be used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention. The following are some assays provided as examples, and not by limitation.","The principle animal models for arthritis or inflammatory disease known in the art and widely used include: adjuvant-induced arthritis rat models, collagen-induced arthritis rat and mouse models and antigen-induced arthritis rat, rabbit and hamster models, all described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L., \u201cArthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals\u201d, in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be assessed using a carrageenan-induced arthritis rat model. Carrageenan-induced arthritis has also been used in rabbit, dog and pig in studies of chronic arthritis or inflammation. Quantitative histomorphometric assessment is used to determine therapeutic efficacy. The methods for using such a carrageenan-induced arthritis model is described in Hansra P. et al., \u201cCarrageenan-Induced Arthritis in the Rat,\u201d 24(2): 141-155, (2000). Also commonly used are zymosan-induced inflammation animal models as known and described in the art.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can also be assessed by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema in the rat, using a modification of the method described in Winter C. A. et al., \u201cCarrageenan-Induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti-inflammatory Drugs\u201d 111, 544-547, (1962). This assay has been used as a primary in vivo screen for the anti-inflammatory activity of most NSAIDs, and is considered predictive of human efficacy. The anti-inflammatory activity of the test prophylactic or therapeutic agents is expressed as the percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weight of the test group relative to the vehicle dosed control group.","Additionally, animal models for inflammatory bowel disease can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention (Kim et al., 1992, Scand. 27:529-537; Strober, 198530(12 Suppl):3S-10S). Ulcerative cholitis and Crohn's disease are human inflammatory bowel diseases that can be induced in animals. Sulfated polysaccharides including, but not limited to amylopectin, carrageen, amylopectin sulfate, and dextran sulfate or chemical irritants including but not limited to trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) and acetic acid can be administered to animals orally to induce inflammatory bowel diseases.","Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. Animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid autoimmunity, systemic lupus eruthematosus, and glomerulonephritis have been developed (Flanders et al., 199929:235-246; Krogh et al., 199981:511-515; Foster, 199919:12-24).","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for autoimmune and\/or inflammatory diseases.","Toxicity and efficacy of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic protocols of the instant invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","The anti-cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model or transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts, animal models, such as hamsters, rabbits, etc. known in the art and described in (1999, eds. Fiebig and Burger); (1999, Karger); (1991, eds. Boven and Winograd); and (1997 ed. Teicher), herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Preferred animal models for determining the therapeutic efficacy of the molecules of the invention are mouse xenograft models. Tumor cell lines that can be used as a source for xenograft tumors include but are not limited to, SKBR3 and MCF7 cells, which can be derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both erbB2 and prolactin receptors. SKBR3 cells have been used routinely in the art as ADCC and xenograft tumor models. Alternatively, OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma can be used as a source for xenograft tumors.","The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. Therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and\/or growth; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H-thymidine incorporation, by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers; cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining, differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology, decreased growth and\/or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation, etc.","Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in humans, including but not limited to in rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits, hamsters, etc., for example, the animal models described above. The compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for treatment or prevention of cancer, inflammatory disorder, or autoimmune disease.","6.1 Design and Characterization of Covalent Bispecific Diabodies","A monospecific covalent diabody and a bispecific covalent diabody were constructed to asses the recombinant production, purification and binding characteristics of each. The affinity purified diabody molecules that were produced by the recombinant expression systems described herein were found by SDS-PAGE and SEC analysis to consist of a single dimerc species. ELISA and SPR analysis further revealed that the covalent bispecific diabody exhibited affinity for both target antigens and could bind both antigens simultaneously.","Materials and Methods:","Construction and Design of Polypeptide Molecules: Nucleic acid expression vectors were designed to produce four polypeptide constructs, schematically represented in .

Comparison with the elution profiles of a full length IgG (\u02dc150 kDa), an Fab fragment (\u02dc50 kDa) and a single chain Fv (\u02dc30 kDa) were used as controls).","ELISA: The binding of eluted and purified diabodies was characterized by ELISA assay, as described in 5.4.2. 50 ul\/well of a 2 ug\/ml solution of sCD32B-Ig was coated on 96-well Maxisorp plate in Carbonate buffer at 4\u00b0 C. over night. The plate was washed three times with PBS-T (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked by 0.5% BSA in PBS-T for 30 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, h2B6-h3G8 CBD, h2B6 CMD, or h3G8 CMD were diluted into the blocking buffer in a serial of two-fold dilutions to generate a range of diabody concentrations, from 0.5 \u03bcg\/ml to 0.001 \u03bcg\/ml. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T three times, 50 ul\/well of 0.2 ug\/ml sCD16A-Biotin was added to each well. The plate was again incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T three times, 50 ul\/well of a 1:5000 dilution of HRP conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for detection. The HRP-streptavidin was allowed to incubate for 45 minutes at room temperature. The plate was washed with PBS-T three times and developed using 80 ul\/well of TMB substrate. After a 10 minute incubation, the HRP-TMB reaction was stopped by adding 40 ul\/well of 1% HSO. The OD450 nm was read by using a 96-well plate reader and SOFTmax software, and results plotted using GraphPadPrism 3.03 software.","BIAcore Assay: The kinetic parameters of the binding of eluted and purified diabodies were analyzed using a BIAcore assay (BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) and associated software as described in section 5.4.3.","sCD16A, sCD32B or sCD32A (negative control) were immobilized on one of the four flow cells (flow cell 2) of a sensor chip surface through amine coupling chemistry (by modification of carboxymethyl groups with mixture of NHS\/EDC) such that about 1000 response units (RU) of either receptor was immobilized on the surface. Following this, the unreacted active esters were \u201ccapped off\u201d with an injection of 1M Et-NH2. Once a suitable surface was prepared, covalent bispecific diabodies (h2B6-h3G8 CBD) or covalent monospecific diabodies (h2B6 CMD or h3G8 CMB) were passed over the surface by 180 second injections of a 6.25-200 nM solution at a 70 mL\/min flow rate. h3G8 scFV was also tested for comparison.","Once an entire data set was collected, the resulting binding curves were globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the manufacturer, BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). These algorithms calculate both the Kand K, from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants (i.e., K\/K). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.).","Association and dissociation phases were fitted separately. Dissociation rate constant was obtained for interval 32-34 sec of the 180 sec dissociation phase; association phase fit was obtained by a 1:1 Langmuir model and base fit was selected on the basis Rand chicriteria for the bispecific diabodies and scFv; Bivalent analyte fit was used for CMD binding.","Results","SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions revealed that the purified product of the h3G8 CMD, h2B6 CMD and h2B6-h3G8 CBD expression systems were each a single species with an estimated molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa (, lanes 4, 5 and 6, respectively). Under reducing conditions, the product purified from either of the CMD expression systems ran as a single band (lanes 1 and 2), while the product purified from the h2B6-h3G8 CBD system was revealed to be 2 separate proteins (, lane 3). All polypeptides purified from the expression system and visualized by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions migrated at approximately 28 kDa.","SEC analysis of each of the expression system products also revealed a single molecular species (), each of which eluted at the same approximate time as an Fab fragment of IgG (\u02dc50 kDa) (). The results indicate that affinity purified product was a homogenous covalent homodimer for the case of CMD expression system and a homogenous covalent heterodimer for the case of the h2B6-h3G8 CBD.","An ELISA sandwich assay was used to test binding of the h2B6-h3G8 CBD for specificity to either or both of CD32B and\/or CD16A (). CD32B served as the target antigen and CD16A was used as the secondary probe. The positive signal in the ELIZA revealed that the heterodimeric h2B6-h3G8 CBD had specificity for both antigens. Similar testing of the h3G8 CMD (which should not bind CD32B) showed no signal.","SPR analysis indicated that h3G8 CMD immunospecifically recognized sCD16 but not sCD32B, that h2B6 CMD immunospecifically recognized sCD32B but not sCD16, and that h2B6-h3G8 CBD immunospecifically recognized both sCD16 and sCD32B ().

The heterodimeric bispecific molecule would then contain an Fc domain that will dimerize with a homologous molecule, forming a tetrameric IgG-like molecule with tetravalency (i.e, formed by dimerization via the Fc domains of the heterodimeric bispecific molecules). Interestingly, such tetrameric molecules were not detected in the conditioned media of recombinant expression systems using functional assays, e.g., testing the conditioned media for immunospecific binding to target antigens. Instead, only a dimeric molecule, comprising monomers consisting of a VL, VH and Fc domain, were detected in such functional assays. To test whether stability of the theoretical tetrameric structure was at issue, polypeptides comprising the Fc domain were engineered to further comprise a hinge region while the polypeptides comprising the \u2018lighter\u2019 chain were engineered to further comprise the 6 C-terminal amino acids of the constant domain of the human kappa light chain. When such reengineered \u2018heavier\u2019 and \u2018lighter\u2019 chains were co-expressed in the recombinant expression systems, functional assays detected diabody molecules that were able to immunospecifically bind both of the target antigens and anti-Fc antibodies.","Materials and Methods","Construction and Design of Polypeptide Molecules: Nucleic acid expression vectors were designed to produce modified versions of constructs 1 and 2 presented in Example 6.1.

The additional cysteine residues provide for additional disulfide bonds between the \u2018heavier\u2019 and \u2018lighter\u2019 chains. Additionally, domain order on binding activity was investigated by moving the Fc domain or the hinge-Fc domain from the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain to the N-terminus. Although the binding activity of the molecule comprising the additional disulfide bonds was not altered relative to earlier constructed diabody molecules with such bonds, transferring the Fc or hinge-Fc domain to the N-terminus of the \u2018heavier\u2019 polypeptide chain comprising the diabody surprisingly improved binding affinity and\/or avidity of the bispecific molecule to one or both of its target antigens.","Materials and Methods","Construction and Design of Polypeptide Molecules: Nucleic acid expression vectors were designed to produce modified versions of constructs 5, 6 and 8 presented in Example 6.2.

Murine CD32B was used to coat the plate, i.e., as the target protein, and HRP-conjugated CD16A was used as the probe for the product of the co-transfection of constructs 15 and 16. mCD32B was used as the target protein and biotin-conjugated CD16A was used as the probe for the recombinant system comprising construct 13.","Results","Conditioned media from the recombinant expression systems comprising constructs 13 was analysed by sandwich ELISA. The ELISA assay tested the binding of the CBD for specificity to either or both of mCD32B and\/or CD16 (). CD32B served as the target antigen and CD16A was used as the secondary probe. The positive signal in the ELISA revealed that the heterodimeric h2.4G2-h3G8 CBD produced from the polyprotein precursor had specificity for both antigens.","Similarly, the purified product generated by cotransfection of the vectors encoding constructs 15 and 16 was tested in an ELISA assay and compared to the product comprised of constructs 1 and 2 (Example 6.1). CD32B served as the target antigen and CD16A was used as the secondary probe. As with the product comprised of constructs 1 and 2, the product of constructs 15 and 16 was found to be capable of simultaneously binding CD32B and CD16A. In fact, the product of constructs 15 and 16 showed slightly enhanced affinity for one or both of the target antigens, i.e. CD32B or CD16A. This is perhaps due to increased stability and or fidelity (relative to a wild type VH-VL domain interaction) of the interchain association afforded by the interaction of the lambda chain region, FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23) and hinge region VEPKSC (SEQ ID NO:79), which is absent in the product comprised of constructs 1 and 2.","Many modifications and variations of this invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
