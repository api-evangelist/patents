{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention relates to a method for reading an RFID token, to an RFID card and to an electronic device, in particular a portable, battery-operated electronic device.","Various methods for reading RFID tokens are known from the prior art, for example for payment functions, in particular \u201celectronic ticketing\u201d, access control systems or for authentication purposes, in particular government applications.","RFID-token-based authentication methods are disclosed in DE 10 2008 000 67 A1, EP 2 041 729 B1 and in patent application DE 10 2009 001 959.6-31, which belongs to the same applicant and was unpublished on the application date, these documents being fully incorporated hereby into the disclosure of the present patent application.","A memory card having a memory card interface and an RFID function unit for receiving radio frequency signals is known per se from DE 20 2006 020 843 U1.","By contrast, the object of the invention is to create an improved method for reading an RFID token as well as to create a corresponding RFID card and an electronic device for such an RFID card.","The objects on which the invention is based are each achieved by the features of the independent patent claims. Embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.","According to embodiments of the invention, a method for reading an RFID token is created, wherein an RFID read command for read access to the RFID token is converted into a memory card command. This may occur such that a store command to store the RFID read command on a memory card is generated on the basis of the RFID read command. Instead of a memory card however, an RFID card with a memory card interface is located in a memory card reader of the electronic device. The store command is executed by the RFID card as a result of the RFID read command contained in the store command being sent in the form of an RFID read signal to the RFID token.","The RFID read command can be generated by the electronic device itself, in particular by an application program of the electronic device, or by an external device, for example a first computer system, which can be coupled to the electronic device via a communication connection.","According to embodiments of the invention, the RFID read command is converted into the memory card command by the electronic device, for example by a driver program for the memory card interface, wherein the driver program can be integrated into the operating system of the electronic device. This is particularly advantageous since a virtual RFID interface for receiving RFID read commands is thus created by the memory card interface in combination with the driver program. The electronic device can thus be used for RFID communication with an RFID token, even though the electronic device does not contain an RFID reader.","The user can thus access an electronic device already in his possession having no RFID interface in order to communicate with an RFID token by introducing an RFID card according to the invention into the memory card reader of the electronic device instead of a conventional memory card and by installing the corresponding driver software to convert RFID read commands into memory card commands on the electronic device.","The RFID token may be a document for example, in particular a value document or a security document.","In accordance with the invention, a \u201cdocument\u201d is understood to mean paper-based and\/or plastic-based documents, such as identification documents, in particular passports, identification cards, visas and driver's licenses, vehicle registration certificates, vehicle registration documents, corporate identification cards, health cards or other ID documents and also smart cards, payment means, in particular bank notes, bankers' cards and credit cards, waybills or other credentials, into which a data memory for storing information, in particular at least one attribute, and an RFID interface for RFID communication with an RFID reader are integrated.","In this case, \u201cRFID communication\u201d is understood to mean any communication method in a radio frequency range, wherein carrier waves of the frequencies 125 KHz, 134 KHz or 13.56 MHz can be used for example. In particular, the RFID communication can be carried out in accordance with standard ISO\/IEC 14443.","In particular, the RFID read command can thus be formed as what is known as an application protocol data unit (APDU), and the RFID response of the RFID token can be formed as what is known as a response APDU.","In this case, a \u201cmemory card reader\u201d is preferably understood to mean a card reader integrated into the electronic device for accessing electronic memory cards, in particular what are known as secure digital (SD) memory cards. Such SD memory cards exist as standard in various formats, memory capacities, with various file systems and access speeds, such as SD high capacity memory cards, SD extended capacity (SDXC), MiniSD, and Micro SD.","According to embodiments of the invention, the electronic device has at least one printed circuit, for example what is known as a printed circuit board, which at least partially covers the memory card reader, integrated into the housing, of the device. In particular, the memory card reader may be assembled on the printed circuit board.","So as to still ensure a sufficiently strong radiation of the RFID read command and the receipt of the RFID response by the RFID card in the memory card reader, the RFID antenna of the RFID card has a directional lobe that is directed away from the printed circuit board. By way of example, the directional lobe of the RFID antenna may be oriented in the direction of insertion of the RFID card into the memory card reader.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the RFID response is buffered by the RFID card and is read out by the memory card reader as a result of a subsequent read command of the electronic device. This has the advantage that the memory card interface of the electronic device can also be used to read the RFID response.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the receipt and\/or the storage of the RFID response by the RFID card is signaled to the electronic device via the memory card interface, for example in the form of a bus signal via the data bus via which the memory card interfaces of the RFID cards and of the electronic device communicate with one another. On the basis of this signalization, the driver program of the electronic device then generates the memory card read command for reading the RFID response from the memory of the RFID card.","Alternatively, the memory card read command is generated by the driver after a predetermined period of time. To this end, a timer, which for example is started with the output of the RFID read command and which runs out after a predetermined period of time that is sufficiently long to send the RFID read command and to receive and store the RFID response thereto by the RFID card, can be provided in the electronic device.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the same memory area of the RFID card is used as a buffer memory for sending RFID read commands and for receiving RFID responses thereto. The buffer memory is then always read at the latest before a further RFID read command is output by the electronic device to the RFID card so as to prevent overwriting of the RFID response and therefore a data loss as a result of the subsequent RFID read command.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a cryptographic protocol for reading at least one attribute from the RFID token is executed, wherein the APDUs required for this purpose are preferably transmitted to the RFID card with the aid of memory card commands and the corresponding response APDUs are received by the electronic device with the aid of memory card read commands. In particular, a method claimed in DE 10 2008 000 67 B4 can be carried out in this manner.","According to a further embodiment, the invention relates to a method for reading at least one attribute stored in the RFID token, wherein the RFID token is associated with a user, and wherein the RFID token has an RFID interface, said method comprising the following further steps: authenticating the user to the RFID token, establishing a communication connection, in particular a mobile communication connection, between the electronic device, which in particular may be embodied as a mobile communication device, and a first computer system, wherein the electronic device has a second interface that contains the memory card interface, establishing a protected connection via the communication connection and via the first and second interfaces between the first computer system and the RFID token, authenticating the first computer system to the RFID token via the protected connection, granting the first computer system read access to the at least one attribute stored in the RFID token, following successful authentication of the user and of the first computer system to the RFID token, in order to transmit the at least one attribute via a network once said attribute has been signed, wherein, to implement the read access, one or more RFID read commands is\/are generated by the first computer system and\/or the electronic device.","In a further aspect the invention relates to an RFID card having a memory card interface for a memory card reader of an electronic device and having a memory card housing, in which the memory card interface and an RFID reader that can be address via the memory card interface are integrated, and having a processor for controlling an RFID interface of the RFID card to send an RFID read command on the basis of the receipt of a memory card command, wherein the memory card command is preferably a command to store an RFID read command.","In this case, an RFID card is understood in particular to mean any smart card that has a memory card housing, for example an SD memory card housing, with a corresponding memory card interface. Either instead of an electronic data memory or in addition thereto, the RFID card contains an RFID reader, which can be addressed by a memory card reader via the memory card interface.","In a further aspect the invention relates to an electronic device, in particular a portable, battery-operated electronic device, such as a mobile phone, a laptop computer, an electronic camera, a smartphone, in particular an iPhone or iPad, or another electronic appliance or a computer system, such as a PC, with an integrated memory card reader for an RFID card according to the invention. The electronic device preferably has a driver program, which may be part of the operating system and by means of which a virtual RFID interface, via which an application program can communicate with the RFID token via the RFID card, is formed in combination with the memory card reader of the electronic device.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the RFID reader of the RFID card is formed as a base smart card reader (Cat B), more specifically for example in accordance with the technical guideline BSI TR-03119, Version 1.1 \u201cRequirements of Smart Card Readers with ePA Support\u201d.","Corresponding elements in the subsequent embodiments are denoted by like reference signs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The user computer system  has an interface , which is formed as a virtual RFID interface for communication with an RFID token  via an RFID card .","The user computer system  has at least one processor  for executing a driver program , which may be part of an operating system of the user computer system . The user computer system  also has an integrated memory card reader  with a memory card interface  for receiving a memory card, such as an SD memory card. The driver program  contains a conversion routine for converting an RFID protocol into a memory card protocol and vice versa, either alternatively or additionally to the standardized functions of a driver for a memory card reader. It is thus made possible for the user computer system  to access the RFID card  via the memory card interface  in order to send an RFID read command  to the RFID token .","The RFID read command  may be formed for example as what is known as a command APDU. The RFID read command  may be generated by the execution of program instructions , which form an application program, wherein the application program has an RFID programming interface, for example what is known as an application programming interface. Alternatively, the RFID read command  from the user computer system  may be received by an ID provider computer system  via a network  for example (see ).","The RFID card  has a memory card housing , which may be extremely identical to a standardized SD memory card housing. The memory card housing  carries a memory card interface  with electrical contacts for contacting the memory card interface  of the memory card reader . The memory card interface  may in turn be formed as with a conventional SD memory card with regard to the embodiment of the electrical contacts and the voltage level used.","In contrast to a conventional memory card, the RFID card  contains an RFID interface  for communication with a corresponding RFID interface  of the RFID token . The RFID card  further has a processor  for executing a program , by means of which the RFID interface  is controlled. The program  is used in particular to convert the memory card protocol into the RFID protocol and vice versa.","An RFID reader, which enables information, such as an attribute, stored in a memory  of the RFID token  to be read out, is thus formed by the RFID interface  and the processor .","The user computer system  has a power supply circuit . The memory card interface  is preferably connected to this power supply circuit  so that the RFID card  is supplied with electrical energy via the memory card interface , in particular for RFID communication with the RFID token .","The RFID read command  is generated during operation, for example by executing the program instructions , and is input into the driver program . The driver program  then generates a store command  to store the RFID read command  in accordance with the memory card protocol. This store command  is transmitted via the memory card interface  to the memory card interface  of the RFID card . The store command  is then processed by the program , the RFID read command  contained in the store command  being sent via the RFID interface  to the RFID token  in accordance with the RFID protocol so as to read the information from the memory .","The RFID token  then responds with an RFID response , such as what is known as a response APDU.","The RFID response  is processed by the program , the response APDU  being transmitted via the memory card interface  to the memory card interface  in accordance with the memory card protocol so that it can be further processed by execution of the program instructions .","To this end, the RFID card  preferably has an electronic memory  for buffering the RFID response . Once the RFID response  has been received, it is stored in the memory  by a store command  by means of the program , for example in accordance with the memory card protocol. The RFID response  is then read out from the memory  via the memory card interfaces  and  by means of a read command  in accordance with the memory card protocol of the driver program .","The read command  can be sent by the program , for example after a predefined period of time after the store command . Alternatively, it may be signaled by means of the RFID card  via the memory card interface , for example by means of a bus signal, that the RFID response  has been stored in the memory , whereupon the read command  is then generated. By way of example, the memory card interfaces  and  may be coupled to one another by a data bus, such as a USB bus, via which the bus signal can be transmitted.","It is particularly advantageous in this case that the application program formed by the program instructions  can be used without modification, that is to say there is no need for any adaptation of the application program to the user computer system , which does not have an RFID interface. This is made possible because a virtual RFID interface  is formed by the driver program  and the memory card reader  and has the same functionality as a conventional RFID interface, and therefore the user computer system  actually appears to have an RFID interface from the perspective of the application program.","In this case, it is also of particular advantage that the user computer system  can be equipped for RFID communication merely by replacing a conventional memory card with the RFID card  and installing the driver program .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","100","2","3"]},"This memory card command is then transmitted in step  from the driver program to the memory card reader so that the RFID card receives the store command from the memory card reader in step . The RFID card then sends the RFID read command contained in the memory card command to the RFID token in step  and receives an RFID response from the RFID token in step . This RFID response is then transmitted in step  from the RFID card to the application program, for example via the memory card reader.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","7","1","7"]},"In step , the RFID response is stored temporarily on the RFID card so that the RFID response can be read out from the RFID card by a read command. For this purpose, it is necessary for the read command to only be directed to the RFID card in accordance with the memory card protocol once the RFID response has been stored.","In order to ensure this timing of the read command, a timer may be started in step  on the basis of the RFID read command by the user computer system. By way of example, the timer may be started once the memory card command has been output to the memory card reader in step  or at an earlier moment in time, for example even in steps ,  or , wherein the duration of the timer is to be selected so as to be longer accordingly.","When, in step , the user computer system establishes that the timer has run out, the read command is then directed to the memory card reader in step  so as to read the RFID response stored on the RFID card. In step , the RFID response is then transmitted from the RFID card to the user computer system so that the RFID response can be further processed for example by the application program of the user computer system. Depending on a result of the further processing, the application program generates a further RFID read command, that is to say the sequence control system then returns to step .","Steps  and  may be implemented in the driver program for example (see ).","Alternatively, the read command may also be delayed if, in step , the RFID card signals the storage of the RFID response to the user computer system, whereupon the read command is then generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["107","187","194","106"]},"In this case, the processor  is used to execute program instructions , which implement a decision logic.","When a store command  reaches the RFID card  via the memory card interface  thereof, it is thus checked, by executing the program instructions , whether or not the address specified in the store command  is present within the address space. If the address in the store command  is present within the address space, the user data of the store command  are thus stored within this address space of the memory . If not, the store command  is thus interpreted as a command to send the user data of the store command , in this case therefore of the RFID read command , and therefore the RFID read command  is sent via the RFID interface . To this end, the RFID read command  may be buffered outside the predefined address space of the memory .","Accordingly, an RFID response  received by the RFID interface  is stored by the program  in the electronic memory  outside this address space by means of a store command . With a subsequent read command of the memory card reader, which specifies an address outside this address space, the RFID response  is read out form the memory . The memory  is thus divided into a memory area for reading and storing data with the freely addressable predefined address space and a buffer memory area outside this address space for RFID communication.","This has the specific advantage that the user can use the RFID card not only for RFID communication, but also as a memory card. The driver program  (see ) is formed accordingly since an address outside the predefined address space is specified in the store command  or no address is specified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["100","198","182","100","100","199"]},"In this case, the RFID antenna of the RFID interface  (see ) has an antenna lobe , which is directed away from the printed circuit board  since the printed circuit board  constitutes a shield with respect to the RFID signals to be sent and received by the RFID antenna, thus leading to attenuation of the signals to be sent and received. In the embodiment considered in this instance, the antenna lobe  is oriented in a manner protruding from the housing of the user computer system  approximately in the direction of insertion  so that no attenuation can be caused by the printed circuit board .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1 to 5"],"b":["100","102","100","104","106","108"]},"The user computer system  has at least one processor  for executing program instructions  as well as a network interface  for communication via a network . The program instructions  may contain the driver program . The network  may be a computer network, such as the Internet. The network  contains a mobile communication network or is connected to a mobile communication network.","The RFID token  has an electronic memory  with protected memory areas ,  and . The protected memory area  is used to store a reference value, which is required for authentication of the user  to the RFID token . By way of example, this reference value is what is known as a personal identification number (PIN), or reference data for a biometric feature of the user , which can be used for authentication of the user to the RFID token .","The protected area  is used to store a private key and the protected memory area  is used to store attributes, for example of the user , such as the users name, place of residence, date of birth, sex, and\/or attributes concerning the RFID token itself, such as the institution that produced or issued the RFID token, the period of validity of the RFID token, or an identifier of the RFID token, such as a passport number or a credit card number.","The electronic memory  may also have a memory area  for storing a certificate. The certificate contains a public key which is associated with the private key stored in the protected memory area . The certificate may have been produced on the basis of a public key infrastructure (PKI) standard, for example on the basis of the X.509 standard.","The certificate does not necessarily have to be stored in the electronic memory  of the RFID token . Alternatively or in addition, the certificate may also be stored in a public directory server.","The RFID token  has a processor . The processor  is used for executing program instructions ,  and . The program instructions  are used for user authentication, that is to say for authenticating the user  to the RFID token.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["101","102","101","101","105","108","106","104","105","108","105","104","113","180","107","104","105"]},"The mobile communication device  has at least one processor  for executing program instructions  and a mobile communication interface  for communication via the network .","In an embodiment using PINs, the user  inputs his PIN, in order to authentic himself, into the RFID token , for example via the mobile communication device . By way of example, the user  inputs his PIN via a keyboard of the mobile communication device ; the PIN is then transmitted from the mobile communication device , via the interface , to the RFID token .","By executing the program instructions , the RFID token  then accesses the protected memory area  in order to compare the input PIN with the reference value of the PIN stored there. If the input PIN matches the reference value of the PIN, the user  is deemed to have been authenticated.","Alternatively, a biometric feature of the user  is captured. By way of example, the RFID token  has a fingerprint sensor for this purpose, or a fingerprint sensor is connected to the mobile communication device  or integrated therein. The biometric data captured from the user  are compared with the biometric reference data stored in the protected memory are  by executing the program instructions  in this embodiment. If there is a sufficient match between the biometric data captured from the user  and the biometric reference data then the user  is deemed to have been authenticated.","The program instructions  are used for executing the steps of a cryptographic protocol which relate to the RFID token  in order to authenticate an ID provider computer system  to the RFID token . The cryptographic protocol may be a challenge\/response protocol based on a symmetric key or on an asymmetric key pair.","By way of example, the cryptographic protocol implements an extended access control method, as is specified for machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) by the international aviation authority (ICAO). Successful execution of the cryptographic protocol authenticates the ID provider computer system  to the RFID token, thus proving its read authorization for reading the attributes stored in the protected memory area . The authentication may also be reciprocal, that is to say the RFID token  then also needs to authenticate itself to the ID provider computer system  on the basis of the same or a different cryptographic protocol.","The program instructions  are used for the end-to-end encryption of data transmitted between the RFID token  and the ID provider computer system , but at least of the attributes read by the ID provider computer system  from the protected memory area . For the end-to-end encryption, it is possible to use a symmetric key which is agreed between the RFID token  and the ID provider computer system  when the cryptographic protocol is executed, for example.","The ID provider computer system  has a network interface  for communication via the network . The ID provider computer system  also has a memory  which stores a private key  for the ID provider computer system  and also the appropriate certificate . This certificate may also be a certificate based on a PKI standard, for example, such as X.509.","The ID provider computer system  also has at least one processor  for executing program instructions  and . By executing the program instructions , the steps of the cryptographic protocol which relate to the ID provider computer system  are executed. Overall, the cryptographic protocol is thus implemented through execution of the program instructions  by the processor  of the RFID token  and also through execution of the program instructions  by the processor  of the ID provider computer system .","The program instructions  are used to implement the end-to-end encryption on the ID provider computer system , for example on the basis of the symmetric key which has been agreed between the RFID token  and the ID provider computer system  when the cryptographic protocol is executed. In principle, it is possible to use any method for agreeing the symmetric key for the end-to-end encryption which is known per se beforehand, such as a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.","The ID provider computer system  is preferably situated in a particularly protected environment, particularly in what is known as a trust center, so that the ID provider computer system  forms the confidence anchor for the authenticity of the attributes read from the RFID token  in combination with the need for authentication of the user  to the RFID token .","A service computer system  may be designed to take an order or a commission for a service or a product, particularly an online service. By way of example, the user  can open an account at a bank or use another financial or banking service online via the network . The service computer system  may also be in the form of an online warehouse, so that the user  can purchase a mobile telephone or the like online, for example. In addition, the service computer system  may also be designed to deliver digital content, for example for the download of music data and\/or video data.","To this end, the service computer system  has a network interface  for connection to the network . In addition, the service computer system  has at least one processor  for executing program instructions . Execution of the program instructions  generates dynamic HTML pages for example, which the user  can use to input his commission or his order.","Depending on the nature of the commissioned or ordered product or the service, the service computer system  needs to check one or more attributes of the user  and\/or of his RFID token  using one or more prescribed criteria. Only if this check is passed is the order or the commission from the user  taken and\/or performed.","By way of example, opening a bank account or purchasing a mobile telephone with an associated contract requires the user  to disclose his identity to the service computer system  and requires this identity to be checked. In the prior art, the user  must do this by presenting his identification card, for example. This process is replaced by the reading of the digital identity of the user  from his RFID token .","Depending on the instance of application, however, the user  does not need to disclose his identity to the service computer system , but rather it suffices to communicate only one of the attributes, for example. By way of example, the user  can use one of the attributes to provide evidence that he belongs to a particular group of people which is authorized to access data held on the service computer system  for download. By way of example, such a criterion may be a minimum age of the user  or the association of the user  with a group of people which has access authorization for particular confidential data.","To use the service provided by the service computer system , the procedure is as follows:\n\n","The user  authenticates himself to the RFID token . In an implementation using PINs, the user  does this by inputting his PIN into the RFID token , for example via the user computer system  or the mobile communication device . By executing the program instructions , the RFID token  then checks the correctness of the input PIN. If the input PIN matches the PIN's reference value stored in the protected memory area , the user  is deemed to have been authenticated. The procedure may be similar if a biometric feature of the user  is used to authenticate him, as described above.\n\n","To this end, a protected connection  is set up between the RFID token  and the ID provider computer system  via a network connection, in particular a mobile communication connection, and via the interfaces  and . A mobile IP protocol, more specifically according to the standard of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), can be used for example to set up the mobile communication connection between the mobile communication device  and the ID provider computer system  via the network . In particular, the mobile communication device  may have a web browser or another TCP\/IP-capable application, which is used to set up the mobile communication connection. The protected connection  is shown in  as a dashed line.","By way of example, the ID provider computer system  transmits its certificate  via this connection  to the RFID token . The program instructions  then generate what is known as a challenge, that is to say a random number, for example. This random number is encrypted using the public key of the ID provider computer system , which is contained in the certificate . The resulting cipher is sent from the RFID token  via the connection  to the ID provider computer system . The ID provider computer system  decrypts the cipher using its private key  and in this way obtains the random number. The random number is returned by the ID provider computer system  to the RFID token  via the connection . By executing the program instructions , said RFID token checks whether the random number received from the ID provider computer system  matches the originally generated random number, that is to say the challenge. If this is the case, the ID provider computer system  is deemed to have been authenticated to the RFID token . The random number can be used as a symmetric key for the end-to-end encryption.\n\n","The need to authenticate the user  to the RFID token  and to authenticate the ID provider computer system  to the RFID token  provides the necessary confidence anchor, so that the service computer system  can be certain that the attributes of the user  which have been communicated to it by the ID provider computer system  are correct and not falsified.","Depending on the embodiment, the order of the authentication may be different. By way of example, provision may be made for the user  to have to authenticate himself to the RFID token  first of all, followed by the ID provider computer system . In principle, however, it is also possible for the ID provider computer system  to have to authenticate itself to the RFID token  first of all, followed only then by the user .","In the first case, the RFID token  is designed, by way of example, such that it is unlocked only through input of a correct PIN or a correct biometric feature by the user . Only this unlocking allows the program instructions  and  to start and hence the ID provider computer system  to be authenticated.","In the second case, it is also possible to start the program instructions  and  even when the user  has not yet authenticated himself to the RFID token . In this case, by way of example, the program instructions  are in a form such that the ID provider computer system  cannot perform read access to the protected memory area  for the purpose of reading one or more of the attributes until after the program instructions  have signaled that the user  has also been successfully authenticated.","Of particular advantage is the utilization of the RFID token  for e-commerce and e-government applications, for example, specifically without media disruption and legally on the basis of the confidence anchor formed by the need for the user  and the ID provider computer system  to be authenticated to the RFID token . Of particular advantage is also the fact that central storage of the attributes of various users  is not necessary, which means that the data protection problems which exist in the prior art are solved hereby. As far as the convenience of the application of the method is concerned, it is of particular advantage that prior registration of the user  in order to use the ID provider computer system  is not necessary.","The ID provider computer system  is preferably designed for use by a multiplicity of users. In this case, the user computer system  of the user  is associated with the mobile communication device  of said user  so that the ID provider computer system  sends the attributes read from the RFID token  of the user  to the user computer system  of this user  and not to another user.","The following approach is adopted for example in order to produce such an association:","A service request  is first sent via the network  from the user computer system  to the service computer system . The service computer system  responds to the service request  with the request of at least one attribute of the user  of the user computer system , for example that is to say with an attribute specification . The service computer system  sends this attribute specification  to the user computer system  via the network .","A first connection is then set up between the user computer system  and the ID provider computer system  via the network , for example as a result of the user  inputting the URL of the ID provider computer system  into a browser program of the user computer system . The attribute specification  is then sent in the form of a message via this first connection from the user computer system  to the ID provider computer system .","The ID provider computer system  then generates an identifier, which is associated with the user computer system . The identifier may be a unique identifier such as a GUID or a key, for example a symmetric or asymmetric key. The ID provider computer system  sends such an identifier  back to the user computer system  via the first connection.","The identifier  is then transmitted from the user computer system  to the mobile communication device . By way of example, the user computer system  sends the identifier  from its interface  to the corresponding interface  of the mobile communication device  for this purpose.","A mobile communication connection is then set up via the network  from the mobile communication device  to the ID provider computer system , for example as a result of the user  of the mobile communication device  inputting the URL of the ID provider computer system  into a web browser program of the mobile communication device , which is formed by the program instructions . A second connection is thus produced by the mobile communication connection.","The mobile communication device  sends the identifier  to the ID provider computer system  via the second connection. Since this identifier  is identical to the identifier  associated with the user computer system , the ID provider computer system  sets up the protected connection  with the aid of this second connection so as to read out the attribute(s)  specified in the attribute specification  from the RFID token .","Once the ID provider computer system  has received the attributes  from the RFID token  via the protected connection , it thus signs this attribute  with the aid of its certificate . The ID provider computer system  then sends a response  to the user computer system  via the first connection, wherein the response contains the attributes  and the signature thereof. The response  may also comprise a signature of the identifier  and\/or the identifier  itself and\/or a signature formed by interlinking the attributes  and the identifier .","The response  can then be forwarded from the user computer system  to the service computer system , which thus obtains knowledge in a trustworthy manner of the attributes and possibly the identifier specified in the attribute specification  and can then provide the service specified in the service request .","Alternatively, the response  may also be transmitted directly from the ID provider computer system  to the service computer system  via the network .","According to an embodiment, the identifier  is stored in a non-volatile memory of the user computer system , such as in a hard disc memory of the user computer system , for example in the form of what are known as cookies . The response  is also stored in a non-volatile memory of the service computer system .","If the user  later again directs a further service request  to the service computer system  by means of his user computer system , the service computer system  can thus access the cookie  via the network  and thus read out the identifier  from the user computer system . If this identifier is also part of the response , which is stored in the service computer system , the service computer system  then already possesses the attributes necessary to provide the desired service for the user  since it can associate this stored response with the user  via the identifier.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the identifier  has limited validity with regard to the term or number of uses of the stored response . The maximum validity of the identifier  may be provided in the response , for example in the form of an expiry date. Once this expiry date has been reached or is exceeded, the service computer system  can no longer use the response stored in the service computer system , and has to respond to a subsequent further service request  with the attribute specification , such that the above-described process for reading out the attribute(s) from the RFID token  is carried out again.","Instead of the user computer system  and the mobile communication device , the respective functions can also be implemented in a single electronic device, for example in what is known as a smartphone or another network-capable device. A different network connection may then also be used for communication instead of a mobile communication connection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"200"},"In step , the service computer system  then specifies one or more attributes, which it requires in order to check the user's authorization for the service request. In particular, the service computer system may specify attributes that determine the digital identity of the user . This specification of the attributes by the service computer system  may be predefined in a fixed manner or can be determined by the service computer system  on the basis of predefined rules depending on the service request in the individual case.","In step , the attribute specification, that is to say the specification of the one or more attributes carried out in step , is transmitted from the service computer system to the ID provider computer system, more specifically either directly or via the user computer system.","By way of example, the user computer system receives the attribute specification from the service computer system and then sets up a first connection to the ID provider computer system via the network. The user computer system then sends the attribute specification to the ID provider computer system via the first connection. In step , the ID provider computer system then generates an identifier, which it associates with the user computer system from which it has obtained the attribute specification. This association is stored by the ID provider computer system. In step , the identifier is sent from the ID provider computer system to the user computer system, for example via the first connection, which for example may be formed as what is known as a session.","In step , the identifier is transmitted from the user computer system to the mobile communication device. This can occur automatically, for example via NFC communication between the user computer system and the mobile communication device or over a different communication channel, for example optically. By way of example, the identifier is displayed on a monitor of the user computer system and is captured optically by a camera of the mobile communication device.","In step , a mobile communication connection is set up between the mobile communication device and the ID provider computer system, and the identifier is transmitted from the mobile communication device to the ID provider computer system via the mobile communication connection. Since the identifier, which the ID provider computer system receives in step  via the mobile communication connection, is identical to the identifier generated in step  and associated with the user computer system, the mobile communication connection and the RFID token that can be read out from the ID provider computer system via the mobile communication connection are likewise associated with the user computer system and the user thereof.","In order to provide the ID provider computer system with the opportunity to read attributes from his RFID token, the user authenticates himself to the RFID token in step .","In step , a protected connection is set up between the RFID token and the ID provider computer system (see connection  in ). This is preferably a connection with end-to-end encryption in this case, for example on the basis of what is known as a secure messaging method.","In step , the ID provider computer system is at least authenticated to the RFID token via the protected connection which has been set up in step . In addition, there may also be provision for the RFID token to be authenticated to the ID provider computer system.","When both the user and the ID provider computer system have been successfully authenticated to the RFID token, the ID provider computer system is provided with the access authorization for reading the attributes by the RFID token. In step , the ID provider computer system sends one or more read commands for reading the attributes required according to the attribute specification from the RFID token. The attributes are then transmitted using end-to-end encryption via the protected connection to the ID provider computer system, where they are decrypted.","The attribute values which have been read are signed by the ID provider computer system in step . In step , the ID provider computer system sends the signed attribute values via the network. The signed attribute values reach the service computer system either directly or via the user computer system. In the latter case, the user may have the opportunity to take note of the signed attribute values and\/or to add further data to them. Provision may be made for the signed attribute values, possibly with the added data, to be forwarded from the user computer system to the service computer system only following release by the user. This provides the greatest possible transparency for the user in terms of the attributes sent from the ID provider computer system to the service computer system.","In addition, the identifier can also be signed by the ID provider computer system in step  and can be sent via the network to the service computer system or the user computer system in step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["102","100","102","102","100","150"]},"The service computer system  responds to the service request with an attribute specification, that is to say for example a list of attribute names. Once the attribute specification has been received, the user computer system  asks the user  to authenticate himself to the RFID token , for example by means of an input request.","The user then switches on his mobile communication device  and authenticates himself firstly to his mobile communication device . The user  then authenticates himself to the RFID token , for example by inputting his PIN into a keyboard of the mobile communication device . The mobile communication device  transmits the PIN input by the user  from its interface  (see ) to the RFID token .","The attribute specification is forwarded from the user computer system  to an ID provider computer system . The ID provider computer system  then generates an identifier, which associates the ID provider computer system with the user computer system , and sends it to the user computer system . The association of the identifier with the user computer system  is stored by the ID provider computer system .","The identifier is then transmitted from the user computer system  to the mobile communication device . This can occur manually as a result of the user  reading off the identifier displayed on a display of the user computer system  and inputting it via a keyboard of the mobile communication device  into the mobile communication device . The transmission can also take place in a fully automated manner without the involvement of the user , or in a partly automated manner, more specifically for example by radio transmission of the identifier from the user computer system  to the mobile communication device  via the network  (see ) or via an NFC communication connection, which is set up between the user computer system  and the mobile communication device .","Furthermore, the identifier may also be transmitted optically between the user computer system and the mobile communication device , for example by optically capturing, with the aid of a camera of the mobile communication device , the identifier displayed in plain text on the display of the user computer system  or the identifier displayed in the form of a 2D barcode.","A mobile communication connection, via which the identifier is transmitted from the mobile communication device  to the ID provider computer system , is set up between the mobile communication device  and the ID provider computer system . Due to the association stored in the ID provider computer system  of the identifier with user computer system , this mobile communication connection is therefore also associated with the user computer system .","The ID provider computer system  then communicates with the RFID token  via the mobile communication connection and the mobile communication device  in order to authenticate itself to the RFID token  and in order to direct to the RFID token  a read request to read the attributes in accordance with the attribute specification.","Assuming the prior successful authentication of the user  and of the ID provider computer system , the RFID token  responds to the read request with the desired attributes.
