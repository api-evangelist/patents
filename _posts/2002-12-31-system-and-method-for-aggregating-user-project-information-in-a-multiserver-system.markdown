Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a system and method for aggregating information descriptive of a users projects in a multi-server environment.","2. Background Art","One of the most perplexing issues for users of applications such as the IBM Lotus QuickPlace\u00ae application has been that the user must remember the exact place name and the name of the server it resides on, or else create and thereafter select a project bookmark for it from a favorites drop down list, to access the place. For example, to access a place named \u201chaikuteam\u201d residing on server qp.iris.com, the user has had to enter the following URL in the browser:","http:qp.iris.com\/haikuteam","When the number of places a user has to remember or select from a favorites list gets into the tens or hundreds, this access become quite difficult. This also requires that the user know that he has been granted access to a place, in order to know to create the bookmark. In the past this has generally been done by an administrator or manager of the place sending a note to the user, who must then recognize that he has been granted access to a place for which he can create the bookmark.","Further, entering such places often requires that the user \u201csign-on\u201d, including password authentication.","Consequently, there is a need in the art for an improved and simple procedure for enabling a user to enter a place selected from many places and to do so without repeated sign on challenges.","It is therefore an object of the invention provide an improved system and method for aggregating user project information.","In accordance with a method of the invention, aggregating user information on a plurality of projects and servers includes configuring a catalog database server to a host catalog database and as accessible to a plurality of project servers; configuring each project server for accessing the catalog database server; providing for each project server and each project a separate entry in the host catalog database, including catalog database indicia describing each project server and project indicia describing each project; generating to a servers list and a projects list markup language representations from the host catalog database of entries for the specified member; generating from the servers list and the projects list a combined list in markup language representation conforming to an object model; and processing the combined list into a presentation format for display at a user terminal.","In accordance with a system of the invention, aggregating user information on a plurality of projects and servers is provided by a project catalog; a project catalog server; a plurality of project servers; a plurality of project databases; a project database being associated with each project server; an entry in the project catalog for each project server and each project database; and a my projects procedure responsive to user entry of a my projects request for accessing the project catalog server to obtain markup language representations of entries in the project catalog for the user for display at a terminal.","In accordance with an aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program product configured to be operable to for aggregating user information on a plurality of projects and servers includes configuring a catalog database server to a host catalog database and as accessible to a plurality of project servers; configuring each project server for accessing the catalog database server; providing for each project server and each project a separate entry in the host catalog database, including catalog database indicia describing each project server and project indicia describing each project; generating to a servers list and a projects list markup language representations from the host catalog database of entries for the specified member; generating from the servers list and the projects list a combined list in markup language representation conforming to an object model; and processing the combined list into a presentation format for display at a user terminal.","Other features and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention, access to projects (in the context of Lotus QuickPlace, to places) of which the user is a member, either explicitly or as a member of a group with membership in the project or place, is facilitated. The user is able to reduce to one the number of project bookmarks in his browser: that of the home page on the project server. From this home page, the user can initiate project sessions by signing in and accessing his projects, sorted by title (e.g., \u201cJoe's wonderful place\u201d). In the exemplary embodiment of QuickPlace, because QuickPlace supports multi-server \u201csingle sign-on\u201d authentication, users can visit their QuickPlaces without further password challenges, simply by clicking on the Place title. Switching to another place then becomes a matter of clicking on a My Places link which is present in the table of contents (TOC) on most pages, unless this feature is disabled, and then clicking on the title of the place to be visited.","In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, implementation of the My Places feature includes four components: (1) a place catalog, (2) place catalog configuration and operation, (3) a My Places query, and (4) a rendering of a My Places user interface.","In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a place catalog is an IBM Lotus Domino\u00ae database used to aggregate information about all places in an enterprise. Two views defined in the catalog are a place servers view and a places by member view. The places by member view uses a Notes formula to generate a table that is indexed by the unique combination of a member name and a place name. Table entries are sorted by the member names such that places belonging to the same member are grouped together in the list sorted alphabetically.","The place catalog is configured for each server that interacts with through a configuration file (qpconfig.xml) which is formatted in XML. Table 1 is an example of such a configuration file. Table 2 presents a second example and provides for clustering, as will be described hereafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0032"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PLACE SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE"},{"entry":"(qpconfig.xml)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","<place_catalog enabled=\u201ctrue\u201d log_level=\u201c0\u201d>"]},{"entry":["2","\u2003\u2003<connection_pool size=\u201c8\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":["3","\u2003\u2003<place_catalog_servers>"]},{"entry":["4","\u2003\u2003\u2003<server>"]},{"entry":["5","\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<domino_server_name>qpcat\/IBM<\/"]},{"entry":[{},"domino_server_name>"]},{"entry":["6","\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<nsf_filename>PlaceCatalog.nsf<nsf_filename>"]},{"entry":["7","\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/server>"]},{"entry":["8","\u2003\u2003<\/place_catalog_servers>"]},{"entry":["9","\u2003<\/place_catalog>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The setting in Table 1 that controls the place catalog is the place_catalog setting at line , which allows an administrator to enable or disable the use of the place catalog on this server, to specify the place catalog server name, to specify the place catalog filename, and other options as well. Specifying the place catalog server name in qpconfig.xml effectively makes all the places in this place server accessible to the My Places feature.","Referring to , catalog  is a database, such as a QuickPlace catalog, for aggregating information about projects, such as QuickPlaces , , , , in a multi-server system environment, including service \/server , \/, \/, and \/, communications link , and one or more client terminals, such as user browsers . Throughout this specification, the generic term \u201cproject\u201d and more specific terms \u201cplace\u201d or \u201cQuickPlace\u201d are used substantially interchangeably. Place and QuickPlace are specific examples of projects. Similarly, \u201chost catalog\u201d and \u201cQuickPlace catalog\u201d are equivalent terms.","The functionality available to each user via remote terminals  may be customized in accordance with the needs and authorization of the user and\/or entity. Terminals  may access the system using, for example, browser software technology or other electronic accessing methods as my be known to one of skill in the art. Reports and other information displayed to the end user at terminal  may be displayed using known web page formatting techniques.","Communication link  links remote terminals  to server . Link  may be a hardwired link, such as a telephone line, coaxial cable, digital data line, or the like, or a wireless link such as a radio frequency or infrared communications link, or the like.","As illustrated in , a QuickPlace service  represents a group a servers that are able to communicate with each other through a network, and work together to provide function (such as project creation, search across projects and servers, and get aggregate view across all servers and projects).","In a preferred embodiment, this service is implemented in an abstract sense, in that each server  implements a notion of service, which in this sense is a multi-server deployment of QuickPlace servers  that can be treated as a consistent unit of service for administration and in the user interface.","A QuickPlace service  comprises multiple QuickPlace servers  and\/or QuickPlace clusters, which: (1) are in the same Domino domain; (2) share the same user directory and authentication system; (3) are on the same user network (i.e., are not separated by a firewall); and (4) are administered by the same administration team. These constraints are enough to ensure across the service that: (1) servers  can be configured consistently; (2) servers  can communicate and share data with each other; (3) user identities are in the same name space and do not collide; and (4) single sign on authentication can be implemented.","Referring to , host catalog  includes a place servers view  and a places by member view . Catalog  collects data about places and provides administrators with a central point of control across multiple QuickPlace application servers  and clusters. Administrators can generate reports from catalog  to set management policies. A My Places end-user feature also depends on catalog . The Host catalog has two audiences: administrators and users. Administrators can use a QPTool command line tool or an XML interface to the QuickPlace Java\u2122 XML API to access the host catalog  to query information. Users access catalog indirectly, through features such as My Places, which allows them to see the places they belong to, and Search Places, which allows them to search in places across the enterprise. In an exemplary embodiment, catalog  is a centralized database in which to collect information about all a users QuickPlaces ,  and QuickPlace servers , .","Referring to , information ,  stored in host catalog  includes in place server view  for each QuickPlace server , , ,  in the enterprise:","PlaceServerName ,","PlaceServerAccessProtocol ,","PlaceServerAccessTCPPort ,","PlaceServerAccessURLPrefix ,","PlaceServerIsMaster ,","PlaceServerIsVirtual ,","PlaceServerClusterName ;","and in place by member view  for each place , , ,  in the enterprise:","PlaceName ,","PlaceTitle ,","PlaceServerName ,","PlaceManagers ,","PlaceAuthors ,","PlaceReaders ,","PlaceSize ,","PlaceLastAccessed ,","PlaceLastModified ,","PlaceIsLocked ,","PlaceServerIsMaster , and","PlaceServerIsVirtual .","Host catalog  contains data on the QuickPlace servers  in a service , the places  that live on those servers, and the members of those places. Each server  and each place  in the service  has a separate entry in catalog . In an exemplary embodiment, a catalog entry is implemented as a Lotus Notes\u00ae document. The enterprise administrator may decide to have one catalog  for the enterprise or to have several catalogs servicing separate areas of the enterprise.","Host catalog database  may be created using a place catalog or Notes template (.ntf file).","Referring to , host catalog server  is a Domino server with QuickPlace installed which has been configured as is represented by line  to host catalog database  and which is accessible as is represented by lines ,  to QuickPlace servers  in the enterprise through the Notes RPC (tcp port ) and http protocols. A typical project, or QuickPlace, cluster  includes a load balancer LBA server , a plurality of other servers , , and project databases , . A project cluster  is treated as a single virtual server in the service model.","Some entries -, - are created or updated in the Host catalog  in real time\u2014the moment an event happens. Other entries are created or updated manually by a server task, or on a scheduled basis.","As is represented by line , is essential that certain data be sent in real time to avoid conflicts. For example, in a QuickPlace service  there cannot be two places ,  with the same name. The creation of a new place  is an event that creates a new Catalog entry in real time. When a user creates a new place, QuickPlace server  first checks the Catalog  for that name before creating a new entry. If it finds an existing place with that name, the user is prompted to choose a different name. If the creation of a place  did not immediately create an entry, it would be possible for two users to successfully create two places with the same name, which would cause a conflict when QuickPlace attempted to create entries for both in the catalog . For this reason, it is essential that a Host catalog server  a QuickPlace server  is configured to use remains available. To increase availability of host catalog , the Domino clustering feature can be used to make several host catalog servers available (not shown).","Data can be updated in catalog  using the QPTool placecatalog-push command or on a schedule on the QuickPlace server .","Host catalog  contains information in servers view  about servers and in places view  about places. Thus, in host catalog , there is an entry  for server A . For simple case aggregation, or data update, projects ,  are preconfigured as is represented by line  to point to host catalog server  immediately when changes occur, or as is represented by line  at a particular time (say, each day at 2:00 a.m.) Immediate changes may thus be made when changes occur such as place create, place remove, place lock, change access (add\/remove readers, authors, managers), and change title. Scheduled updates may be made, for example, for changes such as last modified, title, size, last accessed.","Complex aggregation is required when working with clusters.","Each entry in catalog  has a virtual indicia entry ,  and master indicia entry , . A master entry, such as entry , is the entry through which all access to the catalog occur for a given cluster of servers , , . In , servers A  and LB are master servers, and columns  and  are set for corresponding entries , , and -.","A virtual server is a server that does not have project (aka, place) data, but knows how to connect place users to the project servers ,  which do have place data , . Server LB is a virtual server because it does not have place data in a database. Project servers A , B , and C  are not virtual servers because they do have place data in databases X , Y , and Z , . Databases Z ,  are clustered, so they are identical; a change to one is immediately replicated to the other.","Complex aggregation for clusters is done by sending immediate updates as are represented by lines  and  to master entries , . All other updates as are represented by lines  and  to the corresponding place entry ,  for the respective servers B , C . For scheduled update, host catalog server  executes a process to merge entries from the virtual master LB (see entry , which as virtual field  and master field  set) to merge entries from the virtual master entry  to entries ,  for other servers B , C .","The Host catalog feature is enabled by the administrator creating a host catalog database  and a configuration file.","The Host catalog may be created by using a PlaceCatalog.ntf template to create a Notes database. The template should be found in the Domino data directory where QuickPlace was installed. Access control on the catalog  is granted only to all the project servers , etc. and to administrators of the system.","The PlaceCatalog feature is configured for each server , etc. that interacts with the PlaceCatalog server  through a configuration file formatted as xml. That is, each quickplace server , etc. that wishes to operate with a PlaceCatalog  must have its own configuration file. The name of the file is qpconfig.xml, and is set forth in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0075"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PLACE SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE FOR CLUSTERING"},{"entry":"(qpconfig.xml)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d standalone=\u201cyes\u201d?>"]},{"entry":["2","<server_settings>"]},{"entry":["3","\u2003<place_catalog_settings enabled=\u201ctrue\u201d>"]},{"entry":["4","\u2003\u2003<log_level>4<\/log_level>"]},{"entry":["5","\u2003\u2003<domino_server_name>cat1\/acme<\/domino_server_name>"]},{"entry":["6","\u2003\u2003<nsf_filename>PlaceCatalog.nsf<\/nsf_filename>"]},{"entry":["7","\u2003<\/place_catalog_settings>"]},{"entry":["8","\u2003<cluster_settings>"]},{"entry":["9","\u2003\u2003<master virtual=\u201ctrue\u201d>"]},{"entry":["10","\u2003\u2003\u2003<hostname>qp.acme.com<\/hostname>"]},{"entry":["11","\u2003\u2003<\/master>"]},{"entry":["12","\u2003<\/cluster_settings>"]},{"entry":["13","<\/server_settings>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Place_catalog_settings (Table 1, lines -) contain settings related to the host catalog feature as it relates to the server associated with this configuration file.

The PlaceCatalog feature must understand the clustering configuration so it can make the proper decisions when registering places with the Host catalog. This cluster_settings section includes the following sections:","master","In QuickPlace clustering there is a concept of a \u201cmaster\u201d server . It specifies which server in the cluster  acts as the \u201centry point\u201d to a quickplace , . It can be a quickplace server or it can be a network dispatcher which acts as a \u201cvirtual\u201d server. The following argument is available in this section:","virtual=\u201cyes\u201d","virtual=\u201cno\u201d (default)","which specifies if the master server is a device other than a quickplace server such as a network dispatcher or local director . This section includes the following sections:","hostname","which specifies the hostname in tcpip format of the master server  in a quickplace cluster  (ie. qp.acme.com). This would be the host name of a network dispatcher or local director (virtual must be \u201cyes\u201d above) or the hostname of a quickplace server (virtual must be \u201cno\u201d above)","A QuickPlace server  may already contain existing places, such as place , which were created prior to configuring host catalog  or which were added there from a different server. In this case, the host catalog  must be told of the existence of these other places. This is done by using a qptool utility function \u201cregister\u201d. By default, the register function will register the place with the server that hosts it and also with the PlaceCatalog if one is configured.","Since catalog  must uniquely identify a place by its name, no two different places can have the same name. This must be accommodated when upgrading an existing quickplace installation where two different places can have the same name on two different servers. In this case the administrator must first resolve the conflict by unregistering one of the places, renaming its directory and then registering the place with the new name.","Each time a place is created, it is registered in real-time with Host catalog server . This means that PlaceCatalog is configured on a QuickPlace server, then the Host catalog server must be operational for users to be able to create places.","Everytime a place is deleted, it is un-registered in real-time with host catalog server .","When a QuickPlace manager adds, removes or changes a member's access level, an update is done to the Host catalog .","Host catalog  may be queried to retrieve a list of places in which a user, or one of the groups of which the user is a member, is a member.","When a user performs a search scoped to a number of quickplaces on one or more servers, the system uses a search domain server to perform the search and it also uses the Host catalog server to properly construct the URLs to the places found in the search request. For this reason, the search domain server must be configured to recognize the Host catalog server .","Last accessed  updates may be made in real time (every 1 minute) to the Host catalog .","Certain information maintained in host catalog  may not updated in real-time. Examples include place size  and the last time it was accessed  or modified . This information must be updated in batch mode. This is accomplished by running a qptool utility function \u201cUpdatePlaceCatalog\u201d on, for example, a daily basis. This can be automated as a Domino program entry similar to the QuickPlaceNightly tool.","When using quickplace clusters , the host catalog  data is maintained for each node . ,  in the cluster as well as for a virtual place representing the combination of all nodes if and only if a network dispatcher or local director has been configured and the proper settings reflect it in the qpconfig.xml configuration file. In this case, real-time updates to the catalog are done to the virtual place entry  and the non-real time updates are done to each of the cluster node entries , . This allows the administrator flexibility in knowing differences in access and size for each of the nodes in the cluster.","The last accessed time  updates may present a problem in large installations. For this reason, a replica of the Host catalog  may be created for each quickplace server. This replica should use a replication formula so that only those entries that match the quickplace server are replicated. This saves space and time as each QuickPlace server will have a copy with only the entries for places that it contains. In this case, the last accessed updates occur on the local replica of the PlaceCatalog and the Domino replication schedule dictates when they are made to the central Host catalog .","There are two QuickPlace server cluster environment alternatives for storing QuickPlace server cluster data in Host catalog .\n\n","A QPTool placecatalog command with the -update flag set synchronizes the place entries ,  that correspond to the physical servers , , and the place entries  that correspond to the virtual server .","To set up a virtual server  for a QuickPlace cluster , a network dispatcher is configured, such as IBM Network Dispatcher Version 3.6, with proper settings configured in the QPCONFIG.XML file (Table 1) on each server , ,  in the cluster .","Referring to  in connection with , in step  My Places feature  can be invoked through a My Places link  in a QuickPlace user interface, or a My Places query  of the QuickPlace application programming interface (API).

In step , place catalog  returns from place servers view  place servers XML  which in step  is stored in data collection  servers table . In step , place catalog  returns from places by members view  places by member XML  which in step  is stored in data collection  places table . Steps  get a place,  test for new name, and step  add to table are executed to eliminate duplicate places XML from being added in step  to table . In steps  and , QP object model  is applied to XML data collected in data collection tables  to generate servers QOM XML  and places QOM XML , which in step  are combined into combined XML  which is fed to XSL processor along with XSL style sheet  to generate in step  (X)HTML  which is fed in step  on communication link  for display in step  to the user at browser .","Referring to , a QuickPlace serve home page  includes a welcome banner , selection buttons for actions including create a place , My Places , and search places .

This skin component request includes information about the user's identity and time zone. It instantiates a QPService object (one of the objects in the QOM, or QuickPlace Object Model ), and calls a method in that object to get a QOM XML representation of all the places listed in the place catalog of which the user is a member, either explicitly or implicitly, through group membership.","Through this method, the QPService object makes two queries ,  to the place catalog. The first query  is for all the place servers represented in the place catalog. This query returns the data in the place servers view , as XML  formatted according to a Domino ReadViewEntries DTD. The second query  is for all the places of which the user is a member. If the user can be represented by more than one name, the query checks the places for all user's aliases. The query reads the PlacesByMember view  from place catalog , searches through the returned list for each alias of the user, and returns in step  all the places and their associated data in XML format.","This view XML ,  for both servers and places is then parsed, and the data extracted is stored into separate collection (QPCollection)  objects , , with one entry per server and one per place, respectively.
