{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. HR0011-09-3-0002, awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Examples of the present invention relate generally to systems for performing molecular analysis, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), enhanced fluorescence, enhanced luminescence, and plasmonic sensing, among other systems.","With specific regard to SERS, Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique used in condensed matter physics and chemistry to study vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in molecular systems. In a Raman spectroscopic experiment, an approximately monochromatic beam of light of a particular wavelength range passes through a sample of molecules and a spectrum of scattered light is emitted. The spectrum of wavelengths emitted from the molecule is called a \u201cRaman spectrum\u201d and the emitted light is called \u201cRaman scattered light.\u201d A Raman spectrum can reveal electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy levels of a molecule. Different molecules produce different Raman spectra that can be used like fingerprints to identify molecules and even to determine the structure of molecules.","Raman spectroscopy is used to study the transitions between molecular energy states when photons interact with molecules, which results in the energy of the scattered photons being shifted. The Raman scattering of a molecule can be seen as two processes. The molecule, which is at a certain energy state, is first excited into another (either virtual or real) energy state by the incident photons, which is ordinarily in the optical frequency domain. The excited molecule then radiates as a dipole source under the influence of the environment in which it sits, at a frequency that may be lower (i.e., Stokes scattering) or that may be higher anti-Stokes scattering) compared to the excitation photons. The Raman spectrum of different molecules or species (such as virus encapsulations) has characteristic peaks that can be used to identify the species. Accordingly, Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique in a variety of chemical or biological sensing and identification applications. However, the intrinsic Raman scattering process is very inefficient, and rough metal surfaces, various types of nano-antennas, as well as waveguiding structures have been used to enhance the Raman scattering processes (i.e., the excitation and\/or radiation processes described above).","The Raman scattered light generated by molecules or species adsorbed on or within a few nanometers of a structured metal surface can be 10to 10times greater than the Raman scattered light generated by the same species in solution or in the gas phase. This scattering cross section amplification process is called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (\u201cSERS\u201d). In recent years, SERS has emerged as a routine and powerful tool for investigating molecular structures and characterizing interfacial and thin-film systems, even enabling single-molecule detection. Engineers, physicists, and chemists continue to seek improvements in systems and methods for performing SERS.","Reference is now made in detail to specific examples of the disclosed hybrid nanostructure and specific examples of ways for creating the disclosed hybrid nanostructures. When applicable, alternative examples are also briefly described.","It is noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.","As used in this specification and the appended claims, \u201cabout\u201d means a \u00b110% variance caused by, for example, variations in manufacturing processes.","Additionally, this discussion has been presented in terms of SERS analysis for the sake of convenience. However, it is noted that the same hybrid nanostructures can be employed in other analytical techniques, including, but not limited to, enhanced fluorescence, enhanced luminescence, plasmonic sensing, optical scattering, or absorption.","A new class of rationally engineered SERS structures is disclosed, including a plurality of nanofingers, pillar or pole-like structures that can undergo a self-closing process when exposed to micro-capillary forces, and at least one nanoparticle, which can become trapped in the cavity formed between the nanofingers after they have undergone self-closing. These hybrid nanostructures can be mass fabricated by first using 3-D imprinting methods or roll-to-roll processes to create the nanofingers and then exposing the nanofingers to a nanoparticle dispersion. An array of groups of these hybrid nanostructures may also be fabricated.","Identifying the optimal, rationally engineered nanostructure for SERS applications and finding an easy way to manufacture them has always been an important goal for researchers in the field of chemical or biological sensing. In the past, bottom-up synthesized nanocrystals of various shapes, such as wires, cubes, multi-pods, stars, core-shells, or bowties, and top-down fabricated nanostructures, such as nanocones, nanograss, or grating\/antenna hybrid structures, have been extensively studied. However, the top-down fabrication method has high overhead costs and requires the use of heavy and expensive equipment with inflexible critical dimensions. Additionally, the bottom-up method relies on natural assembly processes such as chemical bonding, which can be hard to control, particularly in the fabrication of structures with complex geometries such as the hybrid nanostructures described herein.","SERS nanostructures including a plurality of nanofingers and at least one analyte have also been studied. In these nanostructures, the nanofingers also undergo a self-closing process, during which at least one analyte becomes trapped in the \u201cgaps\u201d between the nanofingers, or where the bent nanofingers come close to each other. For these nanostructures to be useful in sensing applications, it is important that the presence of analytes or other molecules on the nanofingers be easily detectable. Therefore, in order to maximize detectability in sensing applications, nanostructures that are capable of amplifying the intensity of the Raman signals of analytes and other target molecules or allowing detection of analytes and other target molecules in alternative ways have been studied.","The hybrid nanostructure disclosed herein includes a plurality of nanofingers and at least one nanoparticle. The nanoparticle can enhance the intensity of the Raman signals of target molecules on the nanostructures used in SERS applications and can facilitate the use of an alternative sensing method for detecting certain target molecules. Additionally, the hybrid nanostructure can be easily mass-manufactured in a variety of different geometries that include different sized nanoparticles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","110","105"]},"In one example, a method of fabricating nanofingers  on a substrate  may include first designing the desired pattern of nanofingers  on a mold using methods such as e-beam lithography, photolithography, laser interference lithography, Focused on Beam (FIB), or self-assembly of spheres. Then, the pattern may be transferred onto silicon, glass, or another suitable substrate. In some examples, suitable polymer substrates may include polyimide, polycarbonate, or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).","Next, the nanofingers  may be fabricated using a number of different methods such as 3-D imprinting methods, embossing, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth, etching, or roll-to-roll processes. In some examples, the nanofingers  may be fabricated from one or more organic materials, Using organic materials may render the nanofingers  sufficiently flexible such that the neighboring nanofinger tips  can bend toward each other. In some examples, the nanofingers  may include one or more monomers, oligomers, or polymers of thermoplastic or ultraviolet (UV) curable materials, such as photoresist, polycarbonate, PDMS, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), or nanoimprint resist. In one example, each nanofinger  in a single hybrid nanostructure may include the same composition of organic materials. In other examples, the nanofingers  in a single hybrid nanostructure need not include the same composition of organic materials.","Alternatively, the nanofingers  may be fabricated using one or more flexible inorganic materials. In some examples, suitable inorganic materials may include silicon oxide, silicon, silicon nitride, alumina, diamond, diamond-like carbon, aluminum, copper, or other like materials. In one example, each nanofinger  in a single hybrid nanostructure (as depicted in ) may include the same composition of inorganic materials. In other examples, the nanofingers  in a single hybrid nanostructure need not include the same composition of inorganic materials.","In some examples, the height of the nanofingers  may range from about 50 nm to 2 \u03bcm, and the diameter may range from about 10 nm to 1 \u03bcm. Additionally, in some examples, the nanofingers  may be spaced apart at the base (the end of the nanofinger attached to the substrate) by a distance ranging from about 10 to 500 nm. The cross-section of the nanofingers  at the base may take on a variety of different shapes including circles or non-symmetrical shapes, such as ovoids.","Next, the nanofingers  may be coated with various types of SERS-active material which support \u201ctense\u201d surface plasmons, such as noble metals or aluminum. \u201cIntense\u201d as used herein means that the magnitude of the surface electromagnetic field generated by incident light on the nanofingers  is at least 100 times greater when the SERS-active material is present than when the SERS-active material is absent. In some examples, the nanofingers  may be coated with aluminum, gold, silver, copper, platinum, or an alloy thereof. The metal may be coated over the entire nanofinger  or it may be selectively coated on the nanofinger tips . The nanofinger  may also be coated with multiple layers of metals or metal alloys. In some examples, the nanofinger  may be coated with a 10 to 100 nm thick layer of silver metal with a 1 to 50 nm gold metal over-coating. In other examples, the nanofinger  may be coated with a 10 to 100 nm thick layer of gold metal with a 1 to 50 nm silver metal over-coating. In some examples, the nanofinger  may be further coated with a thin dielectric layer, which may serve as a functional coat capable of selectively trapping and sensing analytes or other molecules.","In some examples, analytes may be introduced to a nanostructure  including nanofingers  having a functional coat. In these examples, while the analytes may be trapped anywhere on the nanostructure , the analytes are much more likely to be trapped around the nanofinger tips  due to the surface plasmon effect, which tends to concentrate the analytes at the nanofinger tips  under laser Illumination. Additionally, if only the nanofinger tips  are coated with SERS-active metal or metals, as discussed above, the analytes will also mainly be drawn to the nanofinger tips .","After the nanostructure , including the metal-coated nanofingers  and substrate , as described above, has been fabricated, the hybrid nanostructure -, as depicted in , can be formed by exposing the nanostructure to nanoparticles dispersed in a dispersion medium .","In some examples, the nanoparticles  may include one or more metallic semiconducting materials and may have a diameter ranging from a few sub-nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. In some examples, quantum dots that are 5 to 20 nm in diameter may be used. Some examples of quantum dots include cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium sulfide (CdS), cadmium selenide sulfide (CdSeS), cadmium telluride sulfide (CdTeS), indium arsenide (InAs), indium phosphide RIP zinc selenide (ZnSe), zinc sulfide (ZnS or any combination thereof.","In some examples, the nanoparticles  may be further functionalized to allow the specific binding of particular target molecules. In one example, the target molecules are analytes. Accordingly, the nanoparticles  may be capable of capturing the analytes from a dispersion and bringing the analytes to the surface of the nanofingers for sensing.","The nanoparticles  may be dispersed in the dispersion medium  before being exposed to the nanostructure , The dispersion medium  used may vary depending on the composition of the nanoparticles . However, the choice of the dispersion medium  is not important, so long as the nanoparticles  can be dispersed in it. In one example, if the nanoparticles  are composed of gold, the dispersion medium  used may be water or DMSO. In another example, gold nanoparticles may be dispersed in alcohols. In yet another example, if the nanoparticles  are composed of quantum dots, the dispersion medium  used may be water.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 3A"],"b":["200","205","210","215","200","205","210","215","110","105","115","115","325"]},"More specifically,  shows an example hybrid nanostructure  including three nanofingers , bent at their tips  to form a teepee-like shape, and a trapped nanoparticle . Likewise,  shows an example hybrid nanostructure  including four nanofingers , bent at their tips  to form a teepee-like shape, and a trapped nanoparticle ;  shows an example hybrid nanostructure  including five nanofingers , bent at their tips  to form a teepee-like shape, and a trapped nanoparticle ; and  shows an example hybrid nanostructure  including six nanofingers , bent at their tips  to form a teepee-like shape, and a trapped nanoparticle .","These example hybrid nanostructures , , ,  may be formed when a nanostructure  is exposed to the dispersed nanoparticles . After exposure, the dispersion medium  may be removed and the nanostructure  may be dried, triggering a self-closing process. In some examples, the nanostructure  may be air dried. In other examples, the nanostructure  may be dried by other methods, including heating the nanostructure , pumping most of the dispersion medium  out and allowing the remainder of the dispersion medium  to evaporate, and blowing gas, such as nitrogen gas, over the nanostructure .","During this drying process, the nanostructure  may undergo self-closing. During self-closing, micro-capillary forces may cause the nanofinger tips  to bend towards each other at an angle, forming a teepee-like structure at the tips  with an empty space, known as a cavity , in the middle of the nanofinger tips . In other examples, methods such as e-beam, ion-beam or the electric charge effect or magnetic force or mechanic agitation effect may be used to induce self-closing.","In some examples, during self-closing, nanoparticles , as discussed above, may become trapped in the cavity  formed in the middle of the nanofinger tips . In some examples, smaller nanoparticles  may facilitate formation of hybrid nanostructures with fewer nanofingers  because geometries with less nanofingers  have smaller cavities  that can trap smaller nanoparticles . In other examples, larger nanoparticles  may facilitate formation of hybrid nanostructures with more nanofingers  because geometries with more nanofingers  have larger cavities  that can trap larger nanoparticles . However, the nanoparticle  need not be in the exact same shape and size as the cavity ; the nanoparticle  only needs to be similar in shape and size.","It is noted that the arrangements depicted in  are examples only, and other configurations of nanofingers , including configurations with a different number of nanofingers , may be employed. As discussed above and as can be seen in , after self-closing, fewer nanofingers  in a hybrid nanostructure result in a geometry with a smaller cavity , suitable for trapping smaller nanoparticles . Likewise, as can be seen in , after self-closing, more nanofingers  in a hybrid nanostructure result in a geometry with a larger cavity , suitable for trapping larger nanoparticles .","In some examples, the formation of hybrid nanostructures may be permanent and may rely on van der Waals interactions to hold the nanofingers  together at their tips . In other examples, the formation of the hybrid nanostructures may be reversible. For example, using a repelling electromagnetic force, mechanical force, or electric charge may open the nanofinger tips  back up, such that the nanofingers  revert to their original vertical, free-standing state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3D","FIG. 3A","FIG. 313","FIG. 30","FIG. 3D"],"b":["300","305","310","315","300","110","125","305","110","125","310","110","125","315","110","125"]},"As seen in  and , as the number of nanofingers  increases, different arrangements, such as a polygonal arrangement of nanofingers , may be employed, so long as the nanofinger tips  in the particular arrangement all bend toward each other such that they almost touch, separated by only a small \u201cfinger gap\u201d  (as shown in ). In some examples, the nanofinger tips  may be separated by a finger gap  of only 0.5 to 1 nm.","In some examples, there may be an enhanced electromagnetic field formed in the finger gaps . The magnitude of the enhancement of the electromagnetic field may depend on the size of the finger gap . As the size of the finger gap  decreases, the electromagnetic field may increase. For example, the electromagnetic field may increase in strength by 1,000 times as the finger gap  is decreased from 10 nm to less than 1 nm between two nanofinger tips . Since the SERS effect is a function of the 4th power of electromagnetic field enhancement, an increase in electromagnetic field strength by 10as the finger gap  decreases may result in a 10improvement in Raman signal strength.","In some examples, the size of the nanoparticle used in the formulation of a hybrid nanostructure may control the size of the finger gaps  on a nanometer scale, affecting the electromagnetic field formed in the finger gaps  as well.","In other examples, the finger gaps  between the nanofinger tips  may be further fine-tuned by heating processes, such as thermal heating or heating under a laser at a particular wavelength or pulse. In one example, the nanostructure  includes two nanofingers  composed of rubber and separated at the tips  by 10 nm. Because rubber has a linear thermal expansion of \u02dc10\/C.\u00b0 at 20\u00b0 C., if the nanofingers  are heated from 20\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C., the finger gap  or separation between the nanofinger tips  may be decreased to 1 nm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","405","400","110","410","410","105","410","410","400","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["410","110","415","415","105","410","105"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","500","510","500","105","505","510","515","520","505","500","515","525","505","520"],"i":["a","b ","a ","a "],"sub":"em"},"In another example,  shows an example integrated sensor including the same elements as . However, in , the light source  of the example integrated sensor is positioned beneath the Raman-active substrate  such that the Raman-excitation light passes through the substrate .

First, an enhanced electromagnetic field may be produced at the nanofinger tips on the Raman-active substrate. In one example, conduction electrons in the metal surfaces of the nanofingers may enter an extended surface excited electronic state called a \u201csurface plasmon polariton\u201d or \u201clocalized surface plasmon.\u201d This state may be caused by the interactions between the analytes on the surface of the hybrid nanostructure and the nanofingers. The intensity of the surface plasmon polariton resonance may depend on a variety of factors, including the composition of the metal coating on the nanofingers, the size and the shape of the nanofingers, and the separation distance between the nanofingers. Second, charge transfer may occur as a result of the formation of a charge-transfer complex between the surfaces of the nanofingers and the analytes. In some examples, the electronic transitions of the charge transfer complexes are visible in the range of the electromagnetic spectrum.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6C","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C"]},"As seen in , a representative optical scattering spectrum of an array of nanostructures with open nanofingers  and a representative optical scattering spectrum of an array of nanostructures with open nanofingers including analytes  appear very similar. There is virtually no difference between the two plasmonic resonance curves , . Accordingly, it appears that the presence of analytes in the nanostructure is undetectable using optical scattering if the nanostructure is not a hybrid nanostructure including a nanoparticle. As seen in , a representative optical scattering spectrum of an array of hybrid nanostructures with dosed nanofingers including a target-linked nanoparticle and analytes, the presence of a target-linked nanoparticle will alter the plasmonic resonance curve , creating two peaks. Because target-linked nanoparticles may bind with analytes, as further discussed above, using optical scattering spectra to determine the presence of those nanoparticles can indirectly determine the presence of analytes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A-7C","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7C"],"sup":"\u22121"},"As can be seen from comparing  and , representative Raman spectra of an array of nanostructures with open nanofingers  and an array of nanostructures with open nanofingers including analytes , the analytes will cause two small resonance peaks in the Raman spectra . As can be seen from , the representative Raman spectrum for an array of hybrid nanostructures with closed nanofingers including a target-linked nanoparticle and analytes , the presence of a target-linked nanoparticle greatly amplifies the intensity of the signal that the analytes give off. In other words, the resonance peaks of the analytes  from nanostructures without a target-linked nanoparticle are much smaller than the resonance peaks of the analytes  from hybrid nanostructures with a target-linked nanoparticle. In one example, in sensing applications, having amplified resonance peaks may allow for easier and more accurate detection of analytes and other molecules bonded to a hybrid nanostructure.","The foregoing discussion has been presented in terms of symmetrical nanostructures and symmetrical hybrid nanostructures for the sake of convenience. It should be appreciated that nanostructures and hybrid nanostructures may also be asymmetrical or less-symmetrical. Asymmetrical or less-symmetrical nanostructures and asymmetrical or less-symmetrical hybrid nanostructures are structures that lack inversion, rotational or mirror plane symmetry. In some examples, these asymmetrical or less-symmetrical nanostructures and asymmetrical or less-symmetrical hybrid nanostructures are formed naturally during the self-closing process, as described herein. In other words, during the self-closing process, the polygon shapes that are formed by the leaning nanofingers may sometimes be asymmetrical, less symmetrical, or symmetrical. A hybrid nanostructure is asymmetrical when there is a complete lack of any symmetrical elements in the structure, including an inversion center, a rotation axis, and a mirror plane. Less-symmetry (or low symmetry) is relative with respect to high symmetry. A hybrid nanostructure with less-symmetry is a hybrid nanostructure including only a subset of the symmetrical elements present in a hybrid nanostructure with high symmetry.","In some examples, the lack of symmetry in hybrid nanostructures may result in an improvement of the electromagnetic field distribution in these structures, which in turn, may result in an improvement in the SERS performance of the structures. In one example, the Raman signal from analytes on an asymmetrical hybrid nanostructure may be greater than the Raman signal from analytes on a symmetrical hybrid nanostructure.
