{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/272,363, \u201cAPPLICATION OF COMMENTS IN MULTIPLE APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY CONTENT\u201d, filed Oct. 13, 2011, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Since the advent of computers and computer systems, a multitude of software applications have been developed to allow users to create and utilize a variety of electronic content items. For example, users create and utilize word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, presentation documents, Internet-based content, and the like. Often, a user desires to mix or combine content from a variety of application functionality sources in a single document. For example, a user may want to add a spreadsheet chart to a word processing-based letter or memo, or the user may want to incorporate information from an Internet-based web site into the example letter or memo. Typically, the user must launch a first document, copy or cut content from the first document and associated application and functionality, followed by pasting the content into a second document. For example, the user may copy a chart from a spreadsheet application into a word processing document. Such a process is time consuming and cumbersome, and the functionality associated with the first application\/document content item may be limited when the content item is copied to or pasted into the second document and associated application functionality.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by providing application of content and associated functionality from multiple content sources to an electronic content item. According to embodiments, content from a first document may be displayed over a second document via a user interface component. For example, supporting content may be shown transparently in a document in relation to document content it supports. For another example, a paragraph from an Internet-based web page that is linked to a sentence contained in a word processing document may be shown in the word processing document in proximity to the content to which it is linked. If desired, such content may be inserted into the second document, and application functionality associated with the inserted content may be retained after it is inserted into the second content item (e.g., second document). For example, content inserted into a word processing document from a spreadsheet document may be utilized in association with the spreadsheet document application functionality after it is inserted into the word processing document.","According to other embodiments, one or more navigation means may be provided for conveniently navigating inside a content item, (e.g., a document) for adding new content or for reviewing or editing existing content. In addition, a number of content views may be provided. For example, alternate views of a section of a document may be shown where one is ordered alphabetically and another ordered by importance. A highlighting of portions of a content item, (e.g., document) one or more users have reviewed or edited may be shown. A highlighting of portions of a content item not reviewed by one or more users may be shown, and a highlighting of portions of a content item that may have changed since a last review or edit by a given user may be shown. Such portions of a content item may be assembled into a single separate document if desired, and one or more structural visual mappings of one or more components of a content item may be shown. As such portions of a content item are generated for the various views, semantic information and metadata may be applied to the portions to allow for identifying the portions for pivoting among the various views and for optimizing the portions of the content item for use with different device types (e.g., mobile phones, tablet computers, wall-type computer devices\/displays, etc.).","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.

For example, if a word processing-type document, for example, a letter or memorandum receives a spreadsheet application chart or other object between two paragraphs of the example word processing document, the multiple content functionality application  may be operative for providing both software application functionality associated with the word processing-type document or content and functionality required for entering, editing, displaying, or otherwise utilizing the spreadsheet application chart or object.","The multiple content functionality application  may be operative for calling each of these disparate software applications for obtaining the functionality required under the circumstances. For example, if the user is utilizing a word processing application for entering and editing a word processing document, and the user inserts a spreadsheet application object (e.g., chart) into the word processing document, the multiple content functionality application  may be operative for calling the spreadsheet application via an application programming interface to request functionality from the spreadsheet application such that when a user subsequently interacts with the spreadsheet application object that has been inserted into the word processing document, functionality from the associated software application will be available for use in editing or otherwise manipulating the software application object that has been inserted into the word processing document or content item.","Referring still to , navigation components  are illustrated for navigating from one page of displayed content to another page of displayed content. For example, selection of the lower right hand navigation component  may be used for navigating in a forward direction from a first displayed page to a second displayed page, and the left hand navigation component  may be used for navigating from a first displayed page to a previously displayed page.","A navigation component  is illustrative of a light weight navigation component that may travel with a displayed document as the displayed document is navigated by a user. For example, as the displayed document illustrative in  is moved up, down, right or left, the navigation component  may remain disposed over the displayed document in the location and orientation, illustrated in . As should be appreciated, the navigation component  may be disposed in other locations on a displayed document, as desired. Referring to the navigation component , a number of navigation buttons or controls , , , ,  are provided for allowing navigation through a document in a non-linear way. That is, typical document navigation includes movement of a cursor to a specific location in a document by scrolling\/moving the cursor up, down, right or left, or by moving a navigation bar operative for moving the document up, down, right or left. According to embodiments, the navigation component  allows for navigation of the document in any direction and allows for movement of the document, for example, rotation of the document for viewing content contained in the document according to different display orientations. For example, the control  may be used for moving to the right, the control  may be used for moving to the left, the control  may be used for moving upward, the control  may be used for moving downward, and the control  may be used for rotating the content illustrated in the document into a variety of rotated orientations.","In addition, the navigation component  allows for zoom in\/zoom out navigation of content items (e.g., documents). According to embodiments, zoom in\/zoom out may include traditional optical zoom where a display of a given portion of content is brought closer or is moved away from view. In addition zoom in\/zoom out may include semantic zooming. For example, semantic zooming on the chart , illustrated in , may allow a user to view a spreadsheet from which the chart object is built.","Referring now to , an alternate navigation means for navigating through a document or other content item is illustrated and described. A navigation map  is illustrated for displaying a mapping of portions of content items contained in or associated with a given computer-enabled document. As illustrated in , the navigation map includes a semi-transparent section bordering a listing of components of a document or other content item for which the navigation map  may be used for navigating through the document or content item. For example, the navigation map illustrated in  includes sections or components of a document , and selection of the listed components may be used for automatically navigating to the various components. For example, the navigation map  illustrated in  shows example document components of \u201cEconomy Article\u201d  (e.g., a title of a displayed document), \u201cAbstract,\u201d \u201cBody\u201d , \u201cCharts,\u201d \u201cData\u201d  and \u201cConclusion.\u201d As should be appreciated, the components , ,  illustrated in the navigation map  are for purposes of example only and are not limiting of the vast number of document components sections or associations that may be listed in a given navigation map . In addition, the user interface components illustrated herein are likewise for purposes of example only and are not limiting of various UI components and configurations that may be used. For example, the navigation map  could appear in a dedicated pane with or without the use of transparency, as illustrated in .","According to embodiments, selection of one of the listed components in the navigation map  may allow for automatic navigation to and display of the selected component. For example, selection of the \u201cEconomy Article\u201d title  may cause navigation to the title of a displayed document. Likewise, selection of the \u201cAbstract\u201d component may allow for navigation to a paragraph or other section of the example document titled \u201cAbstract.\u201d Selection of the \u201cCharts\u201d component from the navigation map  may cause navigation to the first of a number of charts or other chart-type objects contained in the example document.","If a component type listed in the navigation map  is associated with a number of components of that type, selection of that component type from the navigation map  may cause a display of all those components associated with that component type. For example, if a document  is being edited, and the document  includes spreadsheet application charts  disbursed throughout the document, selection of the \u201cCharts\u201d component from the navigation map  may cause a navigation to the first of the numerous charts contained in the document, and subsequent selection of the \u201cCharts\u201d component type may cause navigation to the second of the charts contained in the document, and so on. Alternatively, selection of the \u201cCharts\u201d component from the navigation map  may cause a display of all charts contained in the document  to allow the user a quick view of all charts or chart-like objects contained in the document. As should be appreciated, such navigation map components may be available for other document components\/objects. For example, if a given document included a number of photographs, then a navigation map component of \u201cPhotographs\u201d may be provided in the navigation map  to allow the user to quickly navigate to photographs included in the document either one at a time, or as a collection of photographs.","Referring now to , another navigation means for navigating through a given document in a non-linear way is illustrated and described. As illustrated in , a navigation gallery  is displayed over the document  and chart . According to one embodiment, the gallery  may include a collection of different visuals to navigate the document, for example, a gallery of user interface (UI) choices. For example, the gallery  may include one or more different ways to visualize the navigation of the document, such as a navigation bar on the left of the document, a table of contents in the middle of the document, a geographic map where different states let you navigate to information about each state, and the like. According to other embodiments, the navigation gallery  may include a selectable listing of one or more components of a displayed content item including links to associated content items, data, remotely located\/operated information sources, and the like. As should be appreciated, the listings illustrated in the navigation gallery  are for purposes of illustration only and are not exhaustive of the listings of various components or linked content or resources that may be displayed in the navigation gallery  for selection by a user in navigating through a document and to content and resources associated with the document in a non-linear manner.","Referring to the navigation gallery , an \u201cImages\u201d list  is illustrated, a \u201cHeaders\u201d component  is illustrated, \u201cNews Feeds\u201d  is illustrated, \u201cText\u201d  is illustrated, \u201cCharts\u201d  is illustrated, \u201cForward\/Back\u201d navigation  is illustrated, a Navigation UI , and \u201cOther\u201d components or associations  are illustrated. According to embodiments, selection of any of the listed components or associations in the navigation gallery  may cause navigation to selected components in the displayed document , or may cause navigation outside the document to linked or associated content. For example, an \u201cImages\u201d list  may be selected for navigating to images, for example, photographs, clip art, and the like that may be included in a given document . For example, if the user wishes to edit all images contained in a given document, selection of the \u201cImages\u201d list  from the navigation gallery  may allow the user to navigate to each document-contained image one at a time, or the user may be provided an editable display of all images contained in the document  to allow the user to review and edit the images, as desired.","Selection of the \u201cHeaders\u201d listing  likewise may allow the user to navigate to each header contained in a given document one at a time, or the user may receive a listing of headers contained in a document in an outline or bullet format or other suitable format to allow the user to review and\/or edit headers contained in the document. Selection of the \u201cText\u201d component  may allow the user to navigate through various portions of text contained in a document, selection of the \u201cCharts\u201d component may be allow the user to navigate to one or more charts contained in the document, and selection of the \u201cForward\/Back\u201d listing  may allow the user to navigate in a forward or back orientation of the document, as desired. Another similar listing not illustrated may be a \u201cZoom\u201d listing that may allow both content zooming and semantic zooming as described above with reference to .","Selection of the \u201cNews Feeds\u201d listing  is an example of a navigation means for navigating to linked content or resources otherwise associated with the document. For example, an item such as \u201cLinks\u201d may be provided to allow the user to navigate to any content or resources links contained in a given document either one at a time, or may allow a user to navigate to a listing of all links. Likewise, selection of the \u201cNews \u201cFeeds\u201d listing  may allow the user to navigate to news feed links contained in a document, navigate to a collection of news feeds links contained in a document, or selection of the \u201cNews Feeds\u201d listing  may allow a user to navigate to an outside resource, for example, an Internet-based news service that contains information linked to or otherwise associated with the document .","The Navigation UI  is illustrative of one or more of a collection of different visuals to navigate the document, for example, a gallery of user interfaces (UI) choices, as described above. The \u201cOther\u201d  listing may be associated with a variety of other categories of content. For example, these listings may include such content categories as stock prices, maps, research content, author biographical information, and the like. Selection of these types of content items may cause navigation to content and resources available through one or more third party or external sources which may be linked to the present document as described above.","Referring now to , according to an embodiment, a navigation component  may be displayed for allowing navigation between various versions and\/or views of a given document or other content item and for allowing navigation of a document by document area or section. For example, selection of the navigation component  may cause display of a \u201cView 1 vs View 2\u201d navigation component , a \u201cBy Area\u201d navigation component , and the like. As should be appreciated, the components ,  are illustrated for purposes of example only, and are not limiting of other types of navigation components that may be provided for allowing navigation between two or more versions of a given document or content item or for navigating a given content item according to areas or components of the content item.","For example, selection of the \u201cView 1 vs View 2\u201d component  may cause a display for review by a user of a first view of a given document  and a display of a second view of the document  to allow the user a quick review of differences between the two views. For example, a user may be working in a collaborative workspace in which multiple users are responsible for editing a set of documents. A first view  of the document may have been generated by one user having a bar graph  illustrating a set of data, and a second view  of the same document content and data may have been generated by another user having a pie chart  illustrating the same set of data. By selection of the \u201cView 1 vs View 2\u201d user interface component , the user may see a display of the two views to allow the user to decide which view he\/she prefers. For another example, a first few may show document content items ordered alphabetically, and a second view may show the same document content items ordered by importance levels applied to each content item.","Referring to , according to embodiments, documents or other content items displayed by the application  may be formatted according to a variety of formats for providing different views to a requesting user. As illustrated in , a document  is illustrated in a standard indented paragraph structure as might be used in a letter or memorandum. Upon command, the formatting of the document  may be automatically changed to a different format, for example, the bullet list format, illustrated in the document version  displayed on the computing device . Such a display of the two formatting versions of the document  may be accomplished by the navigation component  illustrated and described with reference to  upon selection of an appropriate \u201cVersion 1 vs Version 2\u201d type of navigation function in the same manner as described above with reference to .","According to embodiments, the differences between the two views  and , illustrated in  are more than just the addition of bullet points to the second view. That is, changes in the text, links between portions of the text to various sources, and the like may have to change in order to produce the second view  of the document versus the first view .","Referring back to , the \u201cBy Area\u201d component  may allow a user to navigate a given document  by document components, areas or sections. For example, a given document , as illustrated in , may contain a variety of rich components, for example, text, images, charts, photographs, inserted Internet-based web pages, and the like. According to one embodiment, the focus of the \u201cBy Area\u201d navigation is to allow navigation based on content as opposed to content types (e.g., images, charts, photos, etc.) where the navigation is based on the content associated with those types as opposed to navigation based on types. Selection of the \u201cBy Area\u201d component  may allow for a listing of the areas or components of a given document, for example, via the navigation map  illustrated with respect to , or the navigation gallery illustrated with respect to , for allowing the user to navigate a given document by area or component of the given document. Alternatively, selection of the \u201cBy Area\u201d component  may allow non-linear navigation through the document  on an area-by-area, component-by-component, section-by-section, and so on. For example, if the user chooses to navigate the document  by imbedded photographs, the \u201cBy Area\u201d navigation function may allow for navigation of the document on a photograph-by-photograph basis.","According to embodiments, the multiple content functionality application  and\/or associated software applications from which the application  obtains functionality may be utilized for providing a variety of views of displayed document and\/or other content items. According to one embodiment, \u201cheat map\u201d views of documents may be generated where different views show or highlight subsets of document portions fitting a particular attribute. That is, different views may show only those portions or highlight only those portions of a document fitting a particular attribute. For example, one view may show only those portions of a document or may highlight only those portions read by one or more users. Another view may show only those portions of a document or may highlight only those portions liked or disliked by one or more users. Another view may show only those portions of a document or may highlight only those portions commented on by one or more users. Another view may show only those portions of a document or may highlight only those portions marked for interest by one or more users. Marking a portion of a document for interest may include annotating a portion of a document to show that a given user is interested in the portion which may be valuable information for subsequent users or reviewers of the document.","Referring to , one view that may be provided includes a highlighting of content viewed, reviewed, edited or otherwise interacted with by a given user having access to the document or content item. According to embodiments, interaction with content may not require edits or comments on the content, but may include simply viewing the content for a period of time. For example, it may be important to one or more users to know who has viewed one or more portions of a content item and how long they spent viewing those portions in addition to knowing whether edits or comments were made with respect to those portions.","As illustrated in , the document  includes a first highlighting , a second highlighting , and a third highlighting . The first highlighting  is illustrative of a highlighting that may be applied to one or more sections or components of a given document  that previously have been reviewed, edited, or otherwise interacted with by a given user. For example, if the document  is a document that is accessible to a variety of users working in a collaborative workspace, the document may be opened, reviewed, edited, or otherwise utilized by a number of different users. A first user may open the document and may edit five different paragraphs of the document before saving the document back to a storage medium accessible by other users working in the example collaborative workspace. Subsequently, when the document is opened, other users having access to the document may cause a highlighting  to be applied to all sections of the document that were edited or otherwise interacted with by the previous user when the previous user accessed the document. Thus, the previous user, or other users having access to the document may quickly review those components or portions of the document possibly affected by the previous user's access to the document. For another example, as set out above, the highlighting may show that the first user simply opened the document and viewed various portions for various periods of time which may be important to other users involved in preparing or editing the document.","The second highlighting  is illustrative of a highlighting that may be associated with components or portions of the document edited by a second user, and the third highlighting  is illustrative of a highlighting that may be applied to components or portions of the document edited or interacted with by a third user, and so on. According to embodiments, content that may be highlighted, as illustrated in , may include words, sentences, paragraphs, sections, or other identifiable portions or components of a document receiving edits, manipulation, or navigation by a given user. For example, if a given user changes a word in a given sentence, then the sentence, paragraph in which it is included, or section in which it is included may be highlighted to show that the word, sentence, paragraph, section, or the like has been affected by the user's access to the document. In addition to editing, simple navigation in a portion of a document may likewise cause a highlighting of the portion. For example, if a user accesses the document and moves a mouse cursor through a given portion of the document or focuses a mouse cursor or other input means on a portion of the document, then that portion in which the user navigated may be highlighted, as illustrated in .","As described above, highlighting of portions or components of a document may be utilized to show those portions reviewed, edited, or otherwise interacted with by one or more users. According to other embodiments, other means may be employed for highlighting potentially affected content. For example, portions of the document accessed by a given user may be displayed, while all other portions of the document may be \u201cgrayed out\u201d so that only those portions accessed by a given user may be legible for showing those portions that were accessed and potentially edited by a given user. As should be appreciated, one display of the document may show only those portions accessed by one user, another display of the document may show only those portions accessed by a second user, and another display of the document may show those portions accessed by a third user, and so on. Alternatively, a single display of the document, as illustrated in , may show just those portions accessed by various users, wherein the highlighting for accessed portions may be customized for each accessing user (e.g., different highlighting color for different users) to distinguish those portions accessed by one user from those portions of the document accessed by another user. And, as discussed above, accessing a given portion of the document may include viewing the portion for a period of time as evidenced by a display of the portion for an extended period of time, a mouse focus on the portion for an extended period of time, and the like.","Referring to , highlighting ,  is illustrated showing portions or components of a displayed document that have not been accessed, for example, reviewed, edited, or otherwise interacted with by one or more users having access to the subject document or content item. That is, the highlighting ,  may show any user having access to the document those portions of the document that have not been accessed by one or more other users having access to the document so that a given user having access to the document may quickly review any portions that have not been reviewed to determine whether those portions may require editing or other manipulation.","Referring to , a highlighting  is illustrated for showing users having access to the document  those portions of the document that have changed since last access to the document . That is, the highlighting  may quickly expose any content or portions of content contained in the document  that have been revised by one or more other users having access to the document. As should be appreciated, the highlighting illustrated and described with reference to ,  and  may be applied to non-text portions of a given document or content item. For example, if a chart, image or other object contained in a given document or content item has been accessed, not accessed, or changed or otherwise revised or altered, such content types likewise may be highlighted to indicate the type of access associated with each content type. According to embodiments, the highlighting  may be performed automatically without user action as would be required to activate a \u201ctrack changes\u201d feature for showing changes to the document since a last access of the document.","Referring to , components or portions of a given document or content item that have been accessed, not accessed, or edited may be displayed together in a single document to provide a user a quick review of components or portions of a document that have been reviewed by one or more users, not reviewed by one or more users or revised by one or more users. For example, a user may desire to see a document containing only those portions of a given document he\/she has previously reviewed, or he\/she may desire to see a document containing only those components or portions previously reviewed by one or more other users.","As illustrated in , each of the displayed components may be provided in sequential order, or may be provided according to a variety of other orders or orientations, as desired. For example, portions or components , ,  may be displayed in the order in which they occur in a given document, or those portions or components may be displayed according to the order in which they were accessed or revised, or the portions may be ordered in association with users who accessed and\/or revised the displayed portions. For example, all portions accessed and\/or revised by a first user may be displayed together, all portions accessed and\/or revised by a second user may be displayed together, and so on.","In addition, portions may be ordered based on a variety of attributes associated with the content or associated with users accessing the content. For example, portions may be ordered based on how many comments have been applied to the various portions, or portions may be ordered based on hierarchy of the users commenting on various portions (e.g., portions accessed by executives first, portions accessed by managers second, and so on). As should be appreciated portions or components of a content item may be ordered based on almost a limitless number of ordering attributes that may be associated with the various portions or components.","As should be appreciated, the display of components or portions of a document illustrated in  is not limited to text portions or components, but may include a display of other objects, for examples, charts, images, and the like that have been accessed and\/or revised or otherwise interacted with by one or more users. By way of example, the text components , ,  correspond to the portions of text , ,  reviewed by one or more users and illustrated in .","As described above with reference to , according to embodiments, a document or other content item may contain a variety of components or portions. For example, a word processing document such as a memorandum may include numerous parts and subparts. For example, a memorandum document may include an abstract of the document, an introduction, a body, a data section, a charts section, a conclusion, a bibliography, and the like. In each of such sections, the document may contain one or more subparts, subcomponents or parenthetical portions. For example, the body of a memorandum may include tens or even hundreds of paragraphs. The body may contain a number of images, tables, data components, and the like. In addition, such a document or component may include annotations, for example, user-entered comments, revisions, changes tracking, and the like.","Referring to , the multiple content functionality application  may generate a navigable mapping of a document or content item showing components of the document or content item. For purposes of illustration and explanation,  illustrates a document , for example, a word processing document, spreadsheet application document, a slide presentation application document and the like, comprised of a variety of parts, subparts and other components. The example document  includes three parts ,  and . Each of the three parts may correspond to one or more major components of the document, for example, the introduction, body, and conclusion of a document, as described above. For another example, the three parts , ,  may include three different sections of a quarterly sales report, wherein a first section includes a word processing document, a second section includes one or more spreadsheet application worksheets or charts, and a third section includes one or more slide presentation slides.","Under each part , , , a mapping of any subparts or components contained within the main part  is illustrated. For example, under the part  a subpart  and a subpart  are illustrated beneath the main part . A parenthetical  is illustrated which may be in the form of parenthetical data or information that may be displayed \u201cin line\u201d or \u201cbetween the lines\u201d in the part  of the document, as described below. A comment  is shown beneath the part  and is illustrative of one or more user entered comments entered into or associated with the part  of the document . Second and third parts ,  are illustrated along with various subparts, parenthetical items, comments, and the like. As should be appreciated, one or more subparts, parenthetical items, and comments contained under a given main part  may also be structured in a hierarchical order, wherein for example, each subpart ,  may include their own subparts, parenthetical items, comments, and the like. The subparts ,  may include individual paragraphs within a section associated with the first part , or the subparts may include such items as data tables, spreadsheets, images, and the like.","The mapping  may provide users with a visual representation of the structure of the associated document or content item. According to one embodiment, the mapping  is navigable. That is, each representation of each part, subpart, parenthetical, comment, or other component of the document in the mapping  may be a selectable functionality control, which when selected allows for navigation to that portion of the associated document. For example, selection of the graphical representation of \u201cPart 1\u201d () may allow navigation to that part of the document and followed by display of that part of the document on a display surface of the computing device , as illustrated above with reference to .","Similarly, selection of a subpart, for example, \u201cSubpart 1.1\u201d () may cause navigation to that portion of the document followed by display of that portion of the document for review by the selecting user. For example, if \u201cSubpart 1.1\u201d () is associated with a given spreadsheet application chart embedded in the document , a user may first launch the mapping  to determine where in the document such spreadsheet components are located relative to each other. After determining which parts, subparts, or others are associated with spreadsheet components, the user then may select one or more of the representations for those components from the mapping  in order to navigate to the actual spreadsheet components in the document and to display those components for review, editing, or other manipulation or interaction.","Referring to , an alternative document or content item mapping embodiment is illustrated and described. According to the mapping embodiment illustrated in , components of a given document or content item are illustrated in association with a specified user\/reviewer, and the components of the document or content item of interest to the specified user\/reviewer are illustrated in the form of a path or story associated with the specified user\/reviewer. For example, referring to , consider a document prepared by a software developer in a software development department includes four parts of an abstract, an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. A developer  may desire a version of the document he\/she has created containing each of the parts , , ,  associated with the document. On the other hand, the software developer's manager  may desire a shortened version of the document that includes only the abstract , the body  and the conclusion . Finally, an executive  of the software developer's company may want a summary version of the document that contains only the abstract  and the conclusion .","According to embodiments, the paths\/stories mapping  illustrated in  may be generated for the example document such that each of the paths may be created and may be associated with the specific users interested in those paths. Thus, the path  generated for the developer  may be associated with his\/her desired version of the document, the path  generated for the manager  may be structured for his\/her version of the document, the path  generated for the executive  may be structured for his\/her version of the document, and so on. According to embodiments, the graphical representations of the paths and of the components of the paths may be navigable. That is, selection of each of the components of the paths may allow navigation to those components for display of those components for review by a given user.","In addition, selection of the component identifying the specified user , , and  may cause a display of each of the components or portions of the document associated with that specified user. For example, selection of the manager component  from the mapping  may cause an automatic display of a document containing only those portions or components of the document associated with that specified user. For example, selection of the manager component  may cause generation and display of a document containing only the abstract , the body , and the conclusion . Likewise, selection of the executive component  may cause automatic generation of a document containing only the abstract  and the conclusion  as desired by the specified user, in this example, the software developer's executive. Alternatively, selection of a particular user component , ,  may not be required. For example, if a particular user accesses the mapping , and his\/her identity is known as the manager  (e.g., based on log-in credentials), then the \u201cmanager\u201d document may be automatically generated having only those components mapped to the manager component . As should be appreciated, the components illustrated in  and the specific users illustrated in  are for purposes of example only and are not limiting of the vast numbers of paths and document component stories that may be generated in association with different users desiring different versions of a given document or content item.","As illustrated in , a content component sorter view  of the components or portions of a given document is illustrated. According to this view, components , , , , , and  may be illustrated as thumbnail content components in which are shown all or a portion of the text, data, images or other content contained in each of those components or portions of a given document. In a similar manner as described above with reference to , different combinations of the content components may be assembled for specified users or user groups. For example, six content components are illustrated in  including the abstract, the introduction, the body, data, charts, and a conclusion in association with an example \u201cDeveloper's Story.\u201d On the other hand, only two content components including an abstract and a conclusion are assembled and identified as the example \u201cExecutive's Story.\u201d Each of the assembly of content components may be developed and may be presented to interested users, for example, the software developer, or the software developer's executive manager for review by each user.","According to an embodiment, each content component assembled for each specified user's story may be navigable such that selection of one of the assembled and displayed content components may cause navigation to the corresponding portion of the document followed by display of the corresponding portion of the document for review, edit, manipulation or other interaction by the user. In addition, selection of the overall story, for example, the \u201cDeveloper's Story\u201d or the \u201cExecutive's Story,\u201d may cause a display of a document comprised of the portions specified in the associated content components. For example, selection of the example \u201cExecutive's Story\u201d view may cause a document to be generated and displayed having only the abstract  and the conclusion .","Referring now to , a mind-map view  is illustrated. In similar manner to the content component sorter view , illustrated above with respect to , the mind-map view is a mapping and display of selectable components or portions of a given document. Each of the selectable components , , , and the like is associated with one or more components or portions of a given document. According to an embodiment, the mind-map view  may illustrate components of a given document in a hierarchical or relational view where the components are organized relative to each other based on a relationship between the components. For example, as illustrated in , the example \u201cDeveloper's Story\u201d includes an abstract , an introduction , a body , a data section , charts , and a conclusion . The body  is shown beneath the introduction , and the data section  is shown on the same level as the body . Charts  are shown beneath the data section  indicating that the charts may be hierarchically beneath the data section. The conclusion  component is shown to the right of all other sections indicating that it follows from each of the previously identified and mapped component. For the example \u201cExecutive's Story,\u201d only two components are illustrated, for example, an abstract  and a conclusion . The conclusion  component is shown following from the abstract .","As with the other mappings illustrated above, each of the displayed representations of components of the document or content item may be navigable such that selection of one of the components may cause navigation to and display of the corresponding component of the associated document or content item. Similarly, selection of an identification of the specified user may cause generation and display of a document containing the components mapped in association with the specified user. For example, selection of the example \u201cExecutive's Story\u201d identification may cause generation and display of a document containing only the abstract  and conclusion  components of the associated document.","According to embodiments, each of the various content item or document components, illustrated and described with reference to , ,  and , may be mapped relative to each other and may be visually represented owing to metadata applied to those components during document creation, editing or other interaction. For example, some components may be automatically identified and annotated with metadata based on a portion of a document in which they reside. For example, if a document component resides in an \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d section of a document, that component may be annotated with metadata identifying it as part of the \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d section. For another example, if a document component resides in a \u201cBody\u201d section of a document, then that component may be annotated with metadata identifying it as part of the \u201cBody\u201d section. Such metadata may be annotated based on a structuring language, for example, the Extensible Markup Language, used to structure the document where various portions of the document are tagged with identifying metadata.","Alternatively, various components may be annotated with identifying metadata by user action during the creation, editing or other interaction with the components. For example, if a user is adding a new component to a document, a command such as \u201cnew part,\u201d \u201cnew section,\u201d \u201cnext parenthetical,\u201d \u201cnew comment,\u201d \u201cnext paragraph,\u201d and the like may be selected for creating a new document component, and the selection of such a command function may cause annotation of the associated document content such that the associated document content may be identified and isolated for mapping, as illustrated in , ,  and . Other methods may include highlighting a portion of a content item or document, followed by selection of various command functions, such as a formatting functions or other content annotation or manipulation functions. Application of such functions to a given portion of content may allow for annotation of the portion with identifying metadata that may be used for mapping the given portion with portions, as described herein.","In addition, such components may be annotated with identifying metadata and may be mapped based on user interaction with the various document components. Thus, some mappings may be self-created based on user interaction. For example, portions or components of a document viewed by various users may be mapped together as a document mapping and resulting document where a resulting document may include only those portions viewed by the various users. Similarly, portions of documents edited, commented on, read or not read, and the like may be used for generating a document mapping and resulting document. In addition, feedback received for various portions, for example, \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d may be used to generate a document mapping and resulting document where, for example, a document may be generated having only those portions \u201cliked\u201d by its reviewers.","As briefly described above, according to embodiments of the present invention, the multiple content functionality application  may be operative to receive and incorporate content generated in and associated with a variety of software application functionalities into a single document where components of the single documents may be assembled from a variety of other documents or content items, and wherein various components of the document may be operated according to different software functionalities. For example, a given document may be comprised of word processing type components, spreadsheet application type components, slide presentation type components, and the like. And, according to embodiments of the invention, each of those components may continue to enjoy use of an operation in accordance with software functionalities associated with the software applications with which they were generated and from which they were received.","For example, a word processing type document having an embedded spreadsheet application component, such as a worksheet or chart, may operate according to the functionalities of both the word processing application and the spreadsheet application. That is, when a user is focusing on, editing, manipulating, or otherwise interacting with portions of the document associated with the word processing application, the word processing application functionalities will be available to the user for operating on that portion of the document. However, when the user is focusing on, editing, manipulating or otherwise interacting with the example spreadsheet application component embedded in the document, then the functionalities of the spreadsheet application with which that component was generated and from which that component was received will be available to the user for operating on that component.","As described above, according to embodiments, the multiple content functionality application  may be operative to provide each of the functionalities associated with each component contained in a given document or content item by assembling those functionalities from each associated software application when a content item is retrieved from a document having been generated by a given software application, or the multiple content functionality application  may provide various types of functionality by calling the associated software applications, for example, word processing applications, spreadsheet applications, slide presentation applications, each time functionality for an associated component or portion of the application is required. For example, if a user focuses on, edits, manipulates or otherwise interacts with an Internet-based web page embedded in a word processing document, the multiple content functionality application  may be operative to provide Internet browser application functionality, or the application  may be operative to call an Internet browser application to retrieve the needed functionality to allow for the desired interaction with the given web page component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIGS. 13-17","FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1305","105","100","1305","1920","105","1920"]},"For example, referring to , a transparent user interface component  including information from which the phrase \u201crising prices\u201d  was obtained or for which that phrase is supported is displayed over the document . Use of the transparent user interface component  is for allowing a viewing of the document information over which the user interface component is displayed if and how to use the displayed information. As should be appreciated, the use of a transparent user interference component  is for purposes of aesthetics and effect and is not limiting of other types of user interface components that may be utilized for providing the example information.","The information illustrated in the user interface component  may be the result of a search on the phrase \u201crising prices\u201d by the multiple content functionality application  for definitional information for the subject phrase. For example, if a user of the document  is interested in knowing whether the paragraph concerning rising prices is accurate, the user may highlight the phrase \u201crising prices\u201d and pass the highlighted phrase via the application  to a local or remote source for obtaining information on the subject phrase. For example, the subject phrase may be passed to an encyclopedia-type resource for gathering definitional information on the subject phrase. The subject phrase may be passed to a dictionary for obtaining definitions of the terms comprising the phrase, or the phrase may be passed to a remote information site, for example, an Internet-based news service or library for obtaining information on the subject phrase.","Once information responsive to the subject phrase is returned, the information may be displayed in a user interface component, for example, the transparent user interface component  in proximity to the subject phrase, as illustrated in . According to one embodiment, the user interface  and the displayed information may be displayed as a parenthetical display \u201cin line\u201d immediately after the subject phrase, or the user interface component may be inserted between lines in the document immediately after the subject phrase, or in any other orientation to allow a user to review the information retrieved for the subject phrase.","According to one embodiment, the user may review the returned information for informational, definitional, or research purposes, followed by dismissing the displayed information out of view.

Alternatively, upon command to the multiple content functionality application , the returned information may be inserted into the document at a location desired by the user so that the returned information may be incorporated into the document as desired by the user. If the retrieved information is incorporated into the document , then the incorporated information may be treated as a component of the document, for example, a parenthetical component, and the component may then be mapped as a part or subpart of the document, as described above with reference to .","Referring to , an example display of Internet-based information in association with a content item is illustrated. As described above with reference to , selection of a given portion of a document or content item, for example, the phrase \u201crising prices\u201d  may be used for obtaining information on the selected content item from a variety of sources. As illustrated in , the selected phrase \u201crising prices\u201d has been used for obtaining information from an Internet-based web site\/page  associated with the selected phrase.
