title: Methods and apparatus for auditing and tracking changes to an existing configuration of a computerized device
abstract: A change controller application, process and system tracks modification to a configuration of a computerized device by receiving a change request indicating a requested change to an existing configuration of the computerized device and preparing a change notification message identifying the requested change to the existing configuration of the computerized device. The change controller transmits the change notification message to at least one change notification recipient and determines if a change acknowledgement is provided in response. If a change acknowledgement is provided from a change notification recipient that indicates confirmation of receipt of the change notification message, the system allows the requested change to the configuration of the computerized device to take place. If the change acknowledgement is not provided from a change notification recipient, the system conditionally operates the computerized device so that a monitoring device networked to the computerized device perceives that a configuration change to the computerized device may have taken place.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Computerized devices such as computer systems, workstations, data communications devices (e.g., routers, switches, hubs, and the like) or other electronic devices often contain existing configurable state information within the device that controls some aspect of the operation of the computerized device. As an example, a computerized device such as a personal computer includes (e.g., stores) software modules that collectively form an operating system. In addition, conventional computerized devices may maintain a set of associated configuration parameter values that may determine how the operating system modules operate when executed. The software modules and configuration parameter values collectively form a configuration state for that computerized device. The configuration state of a device may further include a current or existing hardware profile of the device identifying current components (e.g., cards, memory, processors and the like) that currently are installed within the device.","An operator, manager or administrator of a computerized device may at some point in time determine a need to modify the existing configuration of the device, for example to upgrade software or change configuration parameter values or hardware within the device in order to cause that device to operate differently or to fix problems in the current device operation and configuration. In many instances, computerized devices that contain changeable configuration state information (e.g., replaceable software modules or modifiable configuration parameters) are equipped to communicate over a computer network such as the Internet or a local area network and may allow remote modifications to be made to the existing configuration information in those devices through a remote management software application programming interfaces (APIs) under control, for example, of a remote management software application.","Conventional mechanisms and techniques that support remote management and modification of existing configuration information within computerized devices usually include various security and access control mechanisms in an attempt to ensure that only authorized users (i.e., device administrators and systems managers) are allowed to modify the existing configuration information within the device. As an example, conventional device management techniques include such features as requiring a valid username and password combination in order to allow access to configuration management capabilities within the device. Once a user that desires to change a configuration of a conventional device supplies the proper username and password for full access to configuration management of the device (e.g., the user supplies the root or administrator password), then he or she can change any configuration parameter, software or hardware that they desire.","Some conventional configuration management systems provide for more robust security features including authentication mechanisms that can operate to validate the identity of a computer system requesting the change to the configuration of the device or that may provide separate usernames and passwords in order to change different configuration areas of the device. Designers of conventional protocols, management software and protection mechanisms that operate as noted above to allow changes to device configuration have equipped such mechanisms to control what happens to the configurations of devices before (e.g., access control), during (e.g., authentication) and after (e.g., logging mechanisms) changes are made.","Conventional mechanisms and techniques for providing configuration change auditing, tracking and control of computerized device configuration changes suffer from a variety of deficiencies. In particular, conventional configuration change control and tracking systems fail to protect against threats that are currently occurring within computer networks such as the Internet such as denial of service attacks during which the configuration of a device is changed in a manner that is not readily apparent after the denial of service attack is complete. As an example, a typical common technique for circumventing security mechanisms within networked computerized devices includes providing a denial-of-service attack in conjunction or simultaneously with a penetration attack in order to prevent configuration-protected devices from communicating with their management devices during the penetration attack during which the device configuration is subtly changed. As a specific example, one type of denial-of-service attack might be for a malicious individual to intentionally crash or bring-down a particular data communications device to a non-communicating state within the computer network. During the device down-time, a malicious individual gains access to sensitive configuration information within the device in order to install or replace, for example, a software module with a malicious software module that contains destructive code or code that is capable of intercepting privileged communications. After the device is compromised in this manner, the malicious individual allows the device to regain communications on the computer network and the replacement of the former configuration information (i.e., the manufacturers software module) with the malicious configuration information (i.e., a compromised or modified version of the manufacturers software) may be unknown to the manager or administrator of the device.","In other words, conventional mechanisms and techniques for managing security and access control issues with respect to modifying the configuration of the computerized device are susceptible to security lapses that temporarily paralyze the infrastructure of the computerized device while performing username\/password penetration that allows malicious individual to obtain super-user (e.g., root user privilege) within the device to install software or otherwise modify the existing configuration of the device in a malicious manner. Once the change is complete, the device is again allowed to operate in the network and network managers and administrators may have no way of detecting the device underwent a configuration change.","The result of these deficiencies in conventional configuration change management systems is that even in very well-managed network environments, a vulnerability exists when devices are unexpectedly or unknowingly removed from communication with supervisory (e.g., management) devices and then compromised during their isolation. Since a malicious individual can reload a computerized device such as a router or switch with a modified version of software for that device that may behave in an atypical manner and that can hide or disguise the fact that data or other information passing through the device is intercepted or copied to a remote destination, detection of such intrusions has proved difficult and is not supported in conventional configuration change management systems.","There are conventional systems that operate to securely verify the integrity of the configuration of the device at startup or boot time when the device is first powered on but such techniques require complex and elaborate data collection and authentication mechanisms and are thus difficult to implement and require significant upfront coordination by software vendors and operators in order to have such boot-time verification techniques operate properly. In addition, such techniques essentially amount to requiring a secure hardware authentication module in every device and thus costs of the device significantly increase when equipped with such capabilities. In addition, it is difficult to guarantee in such systems that the original fingerprint or other verifiable information calculated across the current configuration of the device has not already been tainted by being calculated upon configuration of the device that already contains a previously installed malicious data siphoning mechanism.","Further still, conventional mechanisms for reading a current configuration of the device and reporting this current configuration to a remote monitoring station provide some defense against configuration changes. However, such mechanisms are not sufficient against malicious device attacks where the malicious attacker has either already replaced the software on the device, or in situations in which the malicious attacker changes the configuration of the device so that all incoming management and configuration change requests are relayed to another agent operating on another computerized device. This other device can provide an emulation of the management interface that is adequate enough to transmit the original unchanged and legitimate configuration to the remote monitoring station in a fake or contrived response, thus fooling the monitoring station into assuming that the original device has not been compromised.","Embodiments of the invention provide mechanisms and techniques which significantly overcome the aforementioned deficiencies of conventional change management, auditing and tracking systems used to monitor, detect, audit and control configuration changes made within network accessible computerized devices such as computer systems, data communications devices or the like. Generally, embodiments of the invention limit the potential for a malicious individual or attacker to make a change to an existing configuration of a computerized device without notification of the change being provided to or detected by a monitoring device such as a remote computer system. Embodiments of the invention operate in such a way that if a malicious attacker such as a person or a software program (e.g., a virus or worm) attempts to alter an existing configuration of the device using any conventionally known, but unauthorized manner, the monitoring device is capable of detecting at least the possibility that a change has been made to that device due to the device conditionally operating in response to the attempted change. By conditionally operating, embodiments of the invention can cause the computerized device to, for example, shutdown for a predetermined amount of time that is sufficiently long enough for the monitoring device to detect that the device performed the shutdown sequence.","Embodiments of the invention cause a device that receives a change request to change its existing configuration to attempt to obtain a change acknowledgement from a change notification recipient. The change request may be received from a legitimate manager of the device (e.g., a program or person authorized to change the device) or may be a malicious attempt to corrupt the device that is being attempted by a malicious individual or other attacker, such as an automated agent, virus, worm, or other maliciously implemented software that is attempting to change the device in some manner so as to compromise the operational integrity or security of the device. The change acknowledgement is generally an authenticated authorization for the device to allow the change to the existing configuration of the device to take place. Different attempts may be made to different change notification recipients to obtain a valid change acknowledgement. Change notification recipients can include automated monitoring devices configured according to embodiments of the invention (to be explained) as well as the user submitting the change request.","In the case of a user operating as the change notification recipient, the user must use an alternate communications channel such as a phone call in order to provide change notification information (i.e., information produced from the device in response to the change request that is presented to the user, such as in a message displayed on the user's computer display) to a monitoring station. The monitoring station then produces a valid change acknowledgement (assuming the user provided valid change notification information) communicated to the user over the alternate communications channel (e.g,. back to the user via automated voice prompts over the same telephone call that the user placed to provide the change acknowledgement information). The user can then provide valid change acknowledgement information (e.g., a sequence of alphanumeric information such as a change validation code) back to the change controller (e.g., via a return message provided in a graphical user interface) operating in the computerized device. If no valid change acknowledgement information is received from any change notification recipient, and the user attempting to make the change to the configuration persists (e.g., overrides a decision by embodiments of the invention to not make the change), the device configured to this invention is forced (by embodiments of the invention) to conditionally operate, such as by shutting down for a predetermined period of time prior to allowing the change, in order for a monitoring device to detect that the device may have been subject to a configuration change (e.g., via the monitoring device detecting the device shutdown or absence of the device during a periodic poll to the device to determine its operational state).","In operation of embodiments of the invention, initially, a change controller configured to operate according to embodiments of the invention receives a change request indicating a requested change to an existing configuration of the computerized device. In response, during a first attempt or first sequence to attempt to obtain a change acknowledgement, the change controller prepares a change notification message identifying the requested change to the existing configuration of the computerized device and transmits the change notification message to at least one change notification recipient. In the first sequence, the change notification recipient is a monitoring device such as another computer system that is networked to the computerized device upon which the change is being attempted. The change controller in the computerized device thereafter determines if a change acknowledgement is provided from the change notification recipient (i.e., the monitoring device in the first sequence) in response to transmitting the change notification message. The change acknowledgement, if received, indicates confirmation of receipt of the change notification message (e.g., by the monitoring device in this first sequence). As an example, the change acknowledgement may be a code that can validate proper receipt of the change notification message by the change notification recipient (i.e., the monitoring device). If a change acknowledgement is provided from the change notification recipient (i.e., the monitoring device in a first sequence) that indicates confirmation of receipt of the change notification message (and hence authorizes the change), and thus the change controller allows the change to the configuration of the device to take place.","If, in the first sequence, no change acknowledgement is received from the change monitoring device (e.g, perhaps because a malicious individual or software process or program or another hardware device has attempted to block the change notification message from reaching the change monitor), then the change controller performs steps of preparing and transmitting a second change notification message (e.g., a second change notification message) and determining if a change acknowledgement is provided for a second change notification recipient in a second sequence. The second change notification recipient may be the user (or the user's computer) that submitted the change request (as either a legitimate change requester or possibly operating as a malicious attacking individual or program). In either case, the second change notification message may request the change acknowledgement from the second change notification recipient. The user may view the contents of the second change notification message on a display of the user computer and the message contents may instruct the user that he or she must contact an appropriate change authorization entity such as the monitoring system via another alternate communications mechanism, such as via a telephone call or an email message, in order to input or otherwise provide (e.g., via telephone keypad in response to automated voice prompts, or in a forwarded email) the change notification information obtained from viewing the change notification message. In other words, if attempts by the change controller to retrieve an automated change acknowledgement fail (i.e. possibly due to block communications with the first change notification recipient that is the monitoring device) then the user (i.e., who is now in the position of the second change notification recipient) is presented with change notification information (e.g, a code requiring a specific validate answer) and this user must contact the appropriate change authorization entity (i.e., another change notification recipient, which may also be the monitoring device contacted using an interface such as an automated voice response system), in order to enter the change notification information (e.g., the change information containing a code that must be validated). After valid entry of the proper change notification information to the second change notification recipient via the alternate communications channel, the user will receive a proper change acknowledgement (e.g, a return code via automated voice prompt, or in an automated reply email or other message) that that user can then enter into his or her user computer (e.g., via a web based or other graphical user interface) in response to the change notification message.","If properly entered, then the change controller will receive this change acknowledgement and thus allow the requested change to take place to the existing configuration of the device. Alternatively, if the second change notification recipient (i.e., the user or an attacker program or device, who or which may be attempting to maliciously change the configuration of the device), cannot obtain and\/or provide a valid change acknowledgement back to the change controller, then the device that received the change request can conditionally operate (e.g., shutting down for a predetermined amount of time) so that the monitoring device networked to the computerized device is capable of detecting that a configuration to the device may have taken place.","In this manner, the change controller of this invention can first attempt to obtain a valid change acknowledgement from one or more automated monitoring devices via network communications. If none is received (e.g., after a time out period for each), then the change controller can present the user (a second change notification recipient) with a change notification message as well, to which that user must obtain, (i.e., via an alternative communications path to the monitoring device) and supply in response, a valid change acknowledgement. If none is supplied, one embodiment allows the user to be able to continue with the change to the existing configuration of the device, but in such cases of allowing a change without receipt of a valid change acknowledgement, the change controller causes the device to conditionally operate, such as by shutting down for a predetermined time period. This time period (i.e., shutdown time) is enough for the monitoring device to determine that the computerized device is out of communication in an abnormal manner and thus the monitoring device is able to perceive that the computerized device has somehow been maliciously compromised and its configuration can no longer be trusted. This perception can be translated into processing operations within the monitoring device, for example, by emailing, instant messaging, or otherwise notifying a network administrator of the occurrence of the detected conditional operation of the device (detected by the monitoring device) thus placing the administrator on notice that the computerized device may be compromised in some manner.","In other embodiments of this invention, to prepare the change notification message, the change controller can generate a challenge request for the change notification message. The challenge request corresponds to an associated challenge response that, if received by the computerized device, can confirm receipt of the challenge request by the monitoring device. The change controller produces change notification signature information based on new configuration information specified within the change request that is to modify the existing configuration of the computerized device. The change notification signature information may including i) a signature of the new configuration information within the change request, ii) an identity of a user that provides the change request to the device, iii) an identity of the computerized device that received the change request, and\/or iii) a timestamp associated with the change request. As such, the change notification signature information can uniquely identify the change requested as related to the existing configuration. The change controller combines the challenge request and the change notification signature information within the change notification message in preparation for transmission to the change notification recipient(s). Since this information is then sent to the monitoring device, the monitoring device tracks all authorized changes made to the device.","In all cases, if the change acknowledgement is not provided from the change notification recipient, the change controller operates the device so that a monitoring device networked to the computerized device perceives (i.e., detects) that a configuration change to the device may have taken place. Thus embodiments of the invention significantly limit damage that can occur due to human error and security lapses during the administration of programmable, configurable, and re-loadable software and\/or hardware-operated computerized devices or other devices operating in a networked computer environment.","In another embodiment, the requested change to the existing configuration of the device indicated within the change request includes either a change to a configuration setting of the device that controls operation of the device, and\/or a replacement of software code in the device or replacement of a hardware component within the device. As such, embodiments of the invention provide significant deterrence from individuals hacking into a device, since the invention will cause a remote monitoring device to detect such activities indirectly via suspicion raised when the device conditionally operates, such as by shutting down, due to not receiving a valid change acknowledgement.","In yet another embodiment, the change controller operates to transmit the change notification message and determine if a change acknowledgement is provided from the change notification recipient in a first sequence for a first change notification recipient such as a monitoring device. If the change acknowledgement is not provided from the first change notification recipient, the operations of transmitting the change notification message and determining if a change acknowledgement is provided are performed again in a second sequence for a second change notification recipient such as a user of a device that provided the change request to the computerized device.","In a further embodiment, in the first sequence, the step of transmitting the change notification message transmits the change notification message containing the challenge request to the monitoring device networked to the computerized device. User interaction is thus not required at this point. In addition, in this embodiment, the step of determining if a change acknowledgement is provided from the at least one change notification recipient comprises the steps of determining if a change acknowledgement containing a valid challenge response, based on the challenge request, is received in a predetermined amount of time. The valid challenge response, if received, indicates that the monitoring device successfully received the change notification message identifying the requested change to the existing configuration of the computerized device. If the change acknowledgement containing a valid challenge response is received in a predetermined amount of time, the change controller performs the steps of allowing the change to the configuration of the device to take place and acknowledging receipt of the change acknowledgement containing the valid challenge response. Alternatively, if a change acknowledgement containing a valid challenge response is not received in a predetermined amount of time, the change controller performs the steps of transmitting the change notification message and determining if a change acknowledgement is provided in a second sequence for a second change notification recipient. The second change notification recipient is a user of the device that provided the change request to the computerized device.","In still another embodiment, in the second sequence, the step of transmitting the change notification message to the second change notification recipient comprises the steps of transmitting the change notification message for visual display of at least a portion of the change notification message to the user of the device that provided the change request to the computerized device. In this manner, the user attempting the change is presented, for example, with a challenge and must obtain and then provide, in response, a proper change acknowledgement containing a proper challenge response. Also in this embodiment, the step of determining if a change acknowledgement is provided from the second change notification recipient (i.e., the user attempting the change) comprises the steps of determining if a change acknowledgement containing a valid challenge response, based on the challenge request, is received from the user of the device. The valid challenge response, if received, indicates that user of the device successfully communicated the requested change to the existing configuration of the computerized device to the monitoring device. If a change acknowledgement containing a valid challenge response is received from the user of the device, the change controller performs the step of allowing the change to the configuration of the device to take place. Alternatively, if a change acknowledgement containing a valid challenge response is not received from the user of the device that provided the change request, the change controller performs the step of conditionally operating the device so that a monitoring device networked to the computerized device perceives that a configuration change to the device may have taken place.","In one embodiment, the step of conditionally operating the device so that a monitoring device networked to the computerized device perceives that a configuration change to the device may have taken place comprises the steps of performing a mandatory shutdown sequence of the device during which the monitoring device attempts to contact the device to verify operation of the device but cannot do so thus allowing the monitoring device to detect the mandatory shutdown sequence of the device. In this manner, but forcing or otherwise mandating the shutdown of a device before allowing the unauthorized change to proceed, embodiment of the invention ensure that the monitoring device will at least perceive that a change may have been made, due to the shutdown.","In yet another embodiment, the step of conditionally operating the device so that a monitoring device networked to the computerized device perceives that a configuration change to the device may have taken place comprises the steps of querying the user of the device that provided the change request to the device to determine if the user desires to approve the requested change to the existing configuration of the computerized device even though a valid challenge response was not received by the device. If the user of the device desires to approve the request change to the existing configuration of the device, the change controller performs a mandatory shutdown sequence of the device during which the monitoring device attempts to contact the device to verify operation of the device but cannot do so thus allowing the monitoring device to detect the mandatory shutdown sequence of the device and hence perceive (i.e., indicate to a network administrator) the possibility that a malicious change to the device may have taken place since not change acknowledgement was ever received before the conditional operation (e.g., before the mandatory shutdown).","Other embodiments provide a computerized device comprising a communications interface, a memory, a processor and an interconnection mechanism coupling the communications interface, the memory and the processor. In the computerized device, the memory is encoded with change controller application that when performed on the processor, produces a change controller process that causes the computerized device to track modification to a configuration of the computerized device by performing the processing steps outlined above and explained in detail herein.","The computerized device may be any type of computer or electronic device (e.g., personal computer, workstation, server, web proxy, load balancer, etc.), hardware device, peripheral device, data communications device (e.g., switch, router, hub, bridge, network access server, etc.) or other device configured with software and\/or circuitry to process and perform all of the method operations noted above and disclosed herein as embodiments of the invention that are related to the computerized device. In other words an electronic device such any computer or data communications device that is programmed with a change controller application and\/or process configured to operate as explained herein is considered an embodiment of the invention.","Other arrangements of embodiments of the invention that are disclosed herein include software programs to perform the method embodiment steps and operations summarized above within any type of computerized device. More particularly, a computer program product is disclosed which has a computer-readable medium including computer program logic encoded thereon that, when executed on at least one processor with a computerized device, causes the processor to perform the operations (e.g., the methods and processing steps) indicated herein that are considered embodiments of the invention for the computerized device. Software programs that perform the functions of the change controller process are considered embodiments of the invention. Such embodiments of the invention are typically embodied as software, logic instructions, code and\/or other data (e.g., data structures) arranged or encoded on a computer readable medium such as an optical medium (e.g., CD-ROM), floppy or hard disk (e.g., magnetic medium) or within another computer readable medium such as firmware or microcode in one or more ROM or RAM or PROM chips or as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). These software, firmware or other such configurations can be installed onto a computer system or other device (e.g, switch, router, etc.) to provide a change controller that causes such devices to perform the techniques explained herein as embodiments of the invention.","The embodiments of the invention may be implemented by computer software and\/or hardware mechanisms within any computing apparatus. It is to be understood that the embodiments of the invention can be embodied strictly as a software program, as software and hardware, or as hardware and\/or circuitry alone. The features of the invention, as explained herein, may be employed in computerized devices and\/or software systems for such devices such as those manufactured by Cisco Systems, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.","Embodiments of the invention provide mechanisms and techniques which significantly overcome the aforementioned deficiencies of conventional change management systems used to monitor, detect and control configuration changes made within network accessible computerized devices such as computer systems, data communications devices or the like. Generally, embodiments of the invention limit the potential for a malicious individual or software program (e.g., virus, worm, etc.) to make a change to an existing configuration of a computerized device without notification of the change being provided to or being detectable by a monitoring device such as a remote computer system. Embodiments of the invention operate in such a way that if a malicious attacker (e.g., person or program) attempts to alter an existing configuration of the device using any conventionally known, but unauthorized manner, a monitoring device configured according to embodiments of the invention is capable of detecting at least the possibility that a change has been made to that computerized device due to the computerized device (also configured according to embodiments of the invention) conditionally operating in response to the attempted change.","By conditionally operating, what is meant, for example, is that embodiments of the invention operating as a change controller can cause the computerized device to shutdown or otherwise conditionally operate for a predetermined amount of time that is sufficient enough for the monitoring device to detect that the device performed the shutdown sequence. In response to receipt of a change request, embodiments of the invention cause a computerized device that is to validly undergo a change to its existing configuration to attempt to obtain a change acknowledgement from a change notification recipient.

In this example, the computerized device  is a router, switch or other data communications device that is capable of transferring or routing data within the computer network . Operation of the computerized device  is governed or controlled by the existing configuration . The existing configuration  thus represents any configurable or replaceable hardware or software items within the computerized device  such as software images (e.g., operating system, control programs, routing software and the like), hardware modules (e.g., circuit boards, blades, firmware images, microprocessor or memory chips, or any other replaceable circuit or hardware components), configuration state settings (e.g., jumper settings), software parameter settings and\/or any other modifiable or changeable configuration information or data or componentry.","The change controller  is any type of software and\/or hardware or a combination thereof within the computerized device  that operates according to embodiments of the invention to control auditing of any modifications made to the existing configuration  by, for example, any user  or  or by a software management program or system such as the user computer . As will be explained with respect to this example illustrated in , the user  may or may not be a malicious user who operates the user computer  to supply a change request  to the computerized device  in order to carry out an attempt to change some aspect of the existing configuration . The change request  may be, for example, a request to reload or replace a software module or image within the computerized device with a different or newer version.","Prior to allowing the requested change within the change request  to take place, the change controller  operates according to embodiments of the invention to forward change notification messages  and\/or  (in a sequence to be explained) in an attempt to obtain a valid change acknowledgment message  or  (both to be explained) from a change notification recipient such as the monitoring device  or the user  requesting the change. The contents of the change notification messages  and  and the change acknowledgements is such that the change notification recipient such as the monitoring device  (i.e., the change monitor process ) can log or otherwise identify the requested change within the configuration state database .

As a result of this conditional operation  (i.e., a shutdown in this example) the change monitor process  operating within the monitoring device  detects the conditional operation  of the computerized device . This may be done, for example, when the change monitor  detects a loss of a heartbeat or other communications signal periodically sent (e.g., every 20 seconds) as shown by communications ,  between the computerized device  and the monitoring device . The conditional operation  may occur for a period of time (e.g., greater than 20 seconds) that is sufficient for the monitoring device  to perceive the computerized device  may have undergone an unauthorized change to its existing configuration  (e.g., because there is a loss of communications). In other words, in the example in , the monitoring device may poll  the computerized device  at certain predetermined time intervals. The computerized device  can respond to each poll  with a response  indicating that the computerized device  is operating properly. Alternatively, the device  may periodically send a heartbeat  every N seconds which the change monitor  will detect. During a conditional operation however, the device  with not engage in the polling protocol ,  (or send a heartbeat signal, etc.) and thus the monitoring device  is capable (assuming it is operating properly) of detecting the conditional operation. Note that there may be more than one monitoring device  operating in the system  for redundancy and\/or load sharing purposes.","The change monitor  can save this condition (i.e., the loss of communication with the device  due to its conditional operation) within the configuration state database . As a result of the conditional operation , the network administrator  of the computerized device  can review the configuration state database  or may be automatically notified of the conditional operation (i.e., by the change monitor  via email, for example) in order to investigate the conditional operation  that occurred with respect to the computerized device . The network administrator can examine the existing configuration  to see if it has been modified and may no longer trust this computerized device  for authenticity of proper operation. In secure environments, if a conditional operation of a computerized device occurs, the condition  can serve as a security signal to identify devices  that may have been compromised by malicious users  (i.e., hackers).","In addition to processing change notification and acknowledgement messages as explained above, in step , a monitoring device equipped with a change monitor in accordance with embodiments of the invention includes the ability to detect a conditional operation of the computerized device  that may indicate that an unauthorized configuration change may have taken place to the computerized device .

The requested change within the change request  may specify that a specific user  (via operation of, for example, computerized device configuration management software operating within the user computer ) desires to change any type of information, data, parameters or the like within the existing configuration . As a specific example, suppose the user  is a malicious user and is attempting to replace a portion of the operating system that controls the computerized device  in order to monitor or snoop data packets to siphon usernames and passwords for forwarding to a remote computer located elsewhere in the network .","In response to receiving the change request , the change controller  prepares a change notification message  that identifies the requested change (e.g., a replacement of the operating system module) to the existing configuration  of the computerized device .

The change notification message can include identity of the user , a user computer identity  (e.g., a hostname and\/or network address), a timestamp, and other information. The change controller  may have computed the software checksum of the existing configuration  upon initial installation of the existing configuration . The change controller  may also digitally sign the change notification message  using a private key associated with or assigned to the change controller  or to the computerized device . In this manner, the change notification message  identifies or indicates the particular change that is being requested to the existing configuration  and further contains complete authentication information that uniquely identifies this change notification message  as originating from the computerized device  (i.e., the message  cannot be forged).","Next, in step , the change controller  transmits the change notification message  to at least one change notification recipient . In the example illustrated in , the change controller  first attempts to transmit the change notification message  to the change monitor  operating within the monitoring device . As such, the monitoring device  in this example is the first change notification recipient to which the first change notification message  is transmitted.","If the monitoring device  successfully receives and processes the change notification message , the change monitor process  operating within the monitoring device  will store the information within the change notification message  in the configuration state database . In addition, the change monitor process  will prepare a proper change acknowledgment  and will transmit the change announcement  onto the computer network  for receipt by the change controller  operating within the computerized device .","Directing attention to step  in , the change controller  awaits receipt of the change announcement  after transmission of the first change notification message . Accordingly, in step , the change controller  determines if a change acknowledgment is provided from the change notification recipient (to which the most recent change notification message was transmitted). The change announcement  indicates confirmation of receipt of the change notification message  and if received, processing proceeds to step .","In step , assuming the change controller  received the change acknowledgment message , the change controller  allows the requested change specified within the change request message  to the existing configuration  of the device to take place.","Returning attention to step , if no change announcement is received from the change notification recipient (i.e., the monitoring device  in this first sequence to which the change notification message was transmitted in step ) processing proceeds to step . One reason for which no change acknowledgment  is received from the monitoring device , in response to the change controller  transmitting the change notification message , is that the user  is a malicious user and has cut off or otherwise compromised or isolated communications between the computerized device  and the monitoring device  in an attempt to circumvent any security mechanisms in place related to auditing of changes to the existing configuration . The user  may have, for instance, installed a mechanism within the computer network  to intercept and capture the change notification message  transmitted to the monitoring device  in an attempt to prevent the monitoring device from recognizing or logging the fact that the user  is changing the existing configuration .","In step  the change controller  determines if other change notification recipients exist from which there is a potential to obtain a valid change acknowledgment message. As an example, the change controller  can maintain a list of multiple monitoring devices  that are capable of providing valid change acknowledgment messages -, - and so forth in response to receiving a change notification message -, - and so forth. In addition to maintaining a list of multiple monitoring devices , in this example, there is no other such monitoring device. However, another change notification recipient may be the user computer  under control of the user  that submitted the original change request message . In other words, a valid change notification recipient may be the user  that submits the change request. Accordingly, since in the example illustrated in  the user  is a valid change notification recipient (i.e., the user's computer  which submitted the original change request ), at least one other change notification recipient exists (i.e., to which a change notification message is not yet been sent) and thus processing proceeds to step .","In step , the change controller  selects the next change notification recipient (e.g., from a list of valid change notification recipient. In this example, the next change notification recipient is the user  operating the user computer  since no other monitoring devices  exist within the computer network . After processing of step  is complete, processing returns to step  to again prepare a change notification message  (in ). Note that if the change notification recipient is a user  of the user computer  that submitted the change request , the specific format of the change notification message  may be text or other information (e.g., graphics) that can be graphically displayed on the display  for viewing by the user . This is contrasted with the format of the change notification message  sent to the monitoring device  which may be formatted for optimal storage within the configuration state database . Specific details with respect to example formats of the change notification messages  and  and the change acknowledgment messages  and  will be explained shortly with respect to .","After again processing steps  and , the change controller  has performed a second sequence of preparing the change notification message and transmitting this message  to a second change notification recipient that in this example is the user computer  under control of the user . The display  of the user computer can display message indicating to the user  that they must now contact a valid monitoring device  via an alternative communication channel  in order to supply change notification information  to the monitoring device  which then returns valid change acknowledgement information  that is then processed (e.g., placed into a message) by the user computer into a change acknowledgement  that is returned to the computerized device  before allowing the authorized change to take place. Note that the change notification information  the a user provides to the monitoring device  in  may be same content as contained in the change notification message  displayed to that user, for example, on a display  of the user's computer .","In other words, after the change controller  transmits the second change notification message  to the user computer , the user computer  can display the contents of this message on the display  and can include, for example, information instructing the user  to place a telephone call using the telephone  to a monitoring device facility containing the monitoring device . Upon placing such a call, the monitoring device  can answer the call via communications line  (the alternative communications channel to the monitoring device ) and the monitoring device  can provide automated voice response to prompt the user  to enter the contents of the change notification message , as the change notification information , letter by letter or digit by digit into the telephone keypad of the telephone .","In this manner, the second change notification message  can cause the user  to provide the contents of the change notification message as change notification information  (i.e., which may be the same data or contents as , but without packet headers, etc.) to the monitoring device via the alternate communications channel . If the user  enters the change notification information  from the change notification message  in a valid and accurate manner, the change monitor process  will generate a proper change acknowledgement response  which a voice synthesis processing system in the monitoring device  can automatically read back to the user . The user  can then enter this information  into the user computer  in the form of the change acknowledgment message  (i.e., containing the change acknowledgement response information, data or content ) that the user computer  then transmits back to the computerized device  for receipt by the change controller .","In this manner, embodiments of the invention allow the change controller  to receive the change acknowledgement  containing change acknowledgement information  that the monitoring device  receives from an alternate communications channel . Accordingly, returning attention to step  for this second sequence, assuming the user  properly enters the change acknowledgement information  into the user computer  and causes the user computer  to transmit this information as a valid change acknowledgment  back to the change controller , then in step  the change notification recipient provides a valid change acknowledgement  and processing proceeds to step  in order to allow the change to the configuration  of the device  to take place, as previously explained.","Alternatively, in step  if the user  ignores the change notification message  and does not operate the communications mechanism  (i.e., the telephone in this example) in order to obtain change acknowledgement information  and thus does not provide a valid change acknowledgement  back to the change controller , processing step  proceeds again in this second sequence to step .","In this example, since there are no other change notification recipients that exist other than the monitoring device  and the user computer  under control of the user  (to which change notification messages  and  have already been sent in an attempt to obtain a valid change announcement  or ), then processing proceeds to step .","In step , the change controller  conditionally operates the computerized device  so that the monitoring device  networked to the computerized device  perceives that a configuration change to the existing configuration  of the computerized device  may have taken place. In the illustrated example, the change controller  causes a device shutdown of the computerized device  for a period of time that is long enough for the change monitor process  operating within the monitoring device  to detect that the computerized device  is not functioning properly. As a result of detection of the conditional operation , the change monitor  can indicate, within the configuration state database , that an unscheduled shutdown of the computerized device  has occurred in thus there is a possibility that the existing configuration  of the device has been changed or compromised in some manner. Accordingly, the change monitor  can automatically notify (e.g., via email or an instant message) the network administrator  that the conditional operation  of the computerized device  has taken place thus indicating to the network manager  that he or she should investigate situation to determine if an unauthorized existing configuration change has taken place.","In this manner, embodiments of the invention operate to attempt to obtain change acknowledgment messages from multiple change notification recipients in response to a requested change . Since one of the change notification recipients can be the user  requesting the change, and this user  must use an alternate communications mechanism to contact a monitoring facility to obtain valid change acknowledgement information  in order to prevent conditional operation  of the device . Accordingly, a malicious user  attempting to perform an unauthorized change to the existing configuration  will not be permitted to do so without the change controller  at least providing the perception to the monitoring device  that the possibility of such a change may have taken place. It is noted that embodiments of the invention are not necessarily designed to prevent the change to the existing configuration  from being at all possible, but rather provide mechanisms to at least identify situations in which the existing configuration  may have become compromised.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["110","110","111","112","113","115","112","120","120","112","113","110"]},"The processor  may be any type of central processing unit, microprocessor, controller of other circuitry that can access the change controller application  over the interconnection mechanism  in order to execute, run, interpret, operate or otherwise perform the change controller application  thus forming a change controller process  that operates according to embodiments of the invention as explained herein.

This can be done, for example, by detecting an unscheduled shutdown of the computerized device  using the periodic polling technique ,  () to ensure the computerized device is operating properly during non-scheduled maintenance times.","In particular, in step  the change monitor  detects a conditional operation of the device that may indicate that an unauthorized configuration change may have taken place to the computerized device by transmitting a periodic operational check  of the computerized device  to the computerized device, as shown in . This can be a poll  in a polling protocol to ensure that the computerized device  is not in a shutdown state. As noted above, in alternative arrangements, the computerized device  may be responsible for periodically sending a heartbeat or other \u201ckeep alive\u201d signal or message  for periodic detecting by the change monitor . In this example however, a poll  and response  technique are described, but it is to be understood that the invention is not limited as such.","In step , the change monitor  awaits receipt of a periodic operational response  from the computerized device  for a period of time is sufficient to detect and thus indicate (i.e., infer or deduce) that the computerized device  has performed a mandatory shutdown sequence. If the change monitor  receives the periodic operational response , then it can infer that no conditional operation of the device  has occurred (and thus the device  is not undergoing an unauthorized change).","In step , if no periodic operational response  is received after awaiting receipt of a periodic operational response for the predetermined time period (e.g., a time period greater than the amount of time between two of more periodic operational polls, but less than a total conditional operation or shutdown time), the change monitor  provides an indication (e.g., into the configuration state database , and\/or to a network manager or security operator ) that the computerized device  has potentially performed a mandatory shutdown sequence and thus may have experienced an unauthorized configuration change (i.e., may be compromised).","To this end, embodiments of the invention provide a system to perform robust auditing and tracking of configuration changes to existing configurations  of the computerized device  and make it difficult if not impossible for a user  to perform or carry out a change to the existing configuration  without causing the system of the invention to provide some notification to a change monitoring device  of the possibility that such a malicious change may have taken place. During the processing of step , the monitoring device  can for example, provide notification such as an e-mail message to the network administrator  to indicate that the existing configuration  may have experienced change since the computerized device  perform the conditional operation . The network administrator  can then investigate the existing configuration  of the computerized device  in an attempt to ascertain whether or not this configuration was changed.","It is to be understood that embodiments of the invention can include the change controller  as software (e.g., logic instructions, data and code in a computer readable medium), or as an executing or otherwise operating process, or configured within a computerized device . Embodiments of the invention also include the change monitor  as software, or as a process, or configured within a monitoring device . Either one of the change controller  and\/or the change monitor  can be considered separate embodiments of the invention. Embodiments of the invention further include a system that includes a computerized device operating a change controller  and a monitoring device  operating a change monitor  in conjunction with each other, as explained herein.","Those skilled in the art will understand that there can be many variations made to the embodiments explained above while still achieving the same objective of those embodiments and the invention in general. As an example, rearrangement of the processing steps in the flow charts may be performed by those skilled in the art while still achieving the objectives of embodiments of the invention as explained herein.","In addition, it is to be understood that modifications to the content of change notification messages  and  and change acknowledgment messages  and  may be made while still being within the scope of embodiments of the invention. Further still, the existing configuration  can contain a limited set of configuration parameters, software modules or other settings for which unauthorized change causes the computerized device  to become compromised. As an example, embodiments of the invention might be applied, in some circumstances, only to certain configurable aspects of the computerized device  such as when a user attempts to while other configuration changes may not be subject to such scrutiny.","Further still, changes to the aforementioned configurations can be made such as alterations to the duration of time of the conditional operation such as during shutdown time periods of the device can be made while still being within the scope of the present invention. It is also to be understood that any type of digital signature and public key encryption techniques can be used to transmit and verify authenticity of the change notification and change announcement messages between the computerized device  in the monitoring device .","Further still, for installations containing large numbers of computerized devices , many monitoring devices  can be provided in order to distribute the load and processing burdens presented by transferring and processing change notification and change announcement messages. By forcing a prolonged shutdown or outage of the device prior to allowing unaudited upgrades or other changes allows a monitoring device  to detect the lack of device operation. The total time of device shutdown or other conditional operation (e.g., halting of the periodic operational polling or heartbeat protocol , ) can be selected by the network administrator  in order to choose a trade-off between how long such an unaudited upgrade may take (i.e., how long it may take to make a compromising change to the device ) in contrast with how long the computer network  can sustain correct operation without utilizing the operation of the computerized device . Accordingly, any device outage caused either by operation of embodiments of the invention or by some other act such as an act of nature (e.g., a power failure) can cause the monitoring device  to treat the condition as a worst-case scenario and indicate to the network administrator  the conditional operation  of the device may have occurred.","Such variations and concepts are intended to be covered by the scope of this invention.
