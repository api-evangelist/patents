title: Apparatus and method for expedited virtual machine (VM) launch in VM cluster environment
abstract: Method and apparatus for expedited virtual machine (VM) launch in VM cluster environment. In one embodiment, at least one VM is launched within a host platform. Once initialized, a VM may issue a hypercall to a VM monitor (VMM) of a VM host platform. In response, the VMM may capture a runtime image of the VM. In one embodiment, the VMM loads the runtime image of the VM within a node of the host platform as a child VM. In an alternative embodiment, the VMM issues a VM clone command to a VMM of a next host platform including the runtime image of the VM. In response, the VMM of the next platform loads the runtime image of the first VM within a node of the second host platform as a cloned VM. Other embodiments are described and claimed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present patent application is a non-provisional application claiming priority to International Application No. PCT\/CN2005\/001623, filed Sep. 29, 2005, currently pending.","One or more embodiments relate generally to the field of computer system design. More particularly, one or more of the embodiments relate to a method and apparatus for expedited virtual machine (VM) launch in a VM cluster environment.","A virtual machine architecture logically partitions a physical machine, such that the underlying hardware of the machine is time-shared and appears as one or more independently operating virtual machines (VMs). A virtual machine monitor (VMM) creates the VM and runs on a computer to facilitate for other software the abstraction of one or more VMs. Each VM may function as a self-contained platform, running its own operating system (OS) and application software. The software running in a VM is collectively referred to herein as \u201cguest software.\u201d","The guest software expects to operate as if it were running on a dedicated computer rather than in a VM. That is, the guest software expects to control various events and have access to hardware resources on the computer (e.g., physical machine). The hardware resources of the physical machine may include one or more processors, resources resident on the processors (e.g., control registers, caches and others), memory (instructions residing in memory, e.g., descriptor tables), and other resources (e.g., input\/output devices) that reside in the physical machine. The events may include interrupts, exceptions, platform events (e.g., initialization) (NIT) or system management interrupts (SMIs), and the like.","Hence, a VMM presents to other software (\u201cguest software,\u201d \u201cguests\u201d or simply \u201cguest\u201d) the abstraction of one or more VMs. The VMM can provide the same or different abstractions to the various guests. Each guest expects the full facilities of the hardware platform presented in the VM to be available for its use. For example, the guest expects to have access to all registers, caches, structures, I\/O devices, memory and the like according to the architecture of the processor and platform presented in the VM. Further, each guest expects to handle various events, such as exceptions, interrupts and platform events (e.g., initialization) (INIT) and system management interrupts (SMIs).","Some of these resources and events are privileged because they are managed by the VMM to ensure proper operation of VMs and to protect the VMM and other VMs. For the privileged resources and events, the VMM facilitates functionality desired by guest software, while retaining ultimate control over these resources and events. The act of facilitating the functionality for the guest software may include a wide variety of activities on the part of the VMM. The activities of the VMM, as well as its characteristics, do not limit the scope of various embodiments described herein.","A method and apparatus for expedited virtual machine (VM) launch in a VM cluster environment are described. In one embodiment, the method includes the launch of at least one VM within a host platform. Once initialized, a VM may issue a hypercall to a VM monitor (VMM) of the VM host platform. As described herein, the host platform including the VM that issued the hypercall, may be referred to herein as the \u201cVM host platform.\u201d In response to detection of a hypercall issued by the VM, in one embodiment, the VMM may capture a runtime image of the VM. In one embodiment, the VMM may load the runtime image of the VM within at least the VM host platform of a VM cluster environment. In one embodiment, the VMM may issue a VM clone command to a VMM of a next host platform including the runtime image of the VM. In response to the VM clone command, the VMM of the next host platform may load the runtime image of the VM as a cloned VM. In one embodiment, a copy-on-write technique is used to manage shared memory between a parent VM and a child VM.","In the following description, numerous specific details such as logic implementations, sizes and names of signals and buses, types and interrelationships of system components, and logic partitioning\/integration choices are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding. It will be appreciated, however, by one skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without such specific details. In other instances, control structures and gate-level circuits have not been shown in detail to avoid obscuring the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art, with the included descriptions, will be able to implement appropriate logic circuits without undue experimentation.","System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["100","100"]},"Accordingly, the expedited VM launch of the various VMs within a VM cluster environment provides enhanced availability by reducing the amount of time required for VM launch. However, it should be recognized by those skilled in the art that the techniques for expedited VM launch, as described herein, may be applied to standalone platforms in which multiple VMs may operate, as well as chip multiprocessor (CMP) systems, which may support the simultaneous operation of multiple guest operating systems.","Referring again to , VM cluster environment  may include host platform , host platform  and host platform , which may be referred to as \u201chost platform clusters.\u201d In the embodiments described, VM cluster environment  may include any number of host platforms as desired, according to the final system configuration. Representatively, host platforms ,  and  are coupled together via a communications link . In one embodiment, the communications link may include, but is not limited to, gigabit (GB) Ethernet, fiber channel, or other like communications links. Representatively, host platform clusters \/\/ are illustrated according to a standalone virtual machine monitor (VMM) configuration, including VMMs ,  and  within host platform clusters ,  and , respectively, of VM cluster environment .","As shown in , VM cluster environment  is illustrated as a nine node VM cluster environment, wherein each platform includes three nodes for loading guest operating systems ,  and . Representatively, guest OS  (-, -, -) are loaded within host platform ; guest OS  (-, -, -) are loaded within host platform ; and guest OS  (-, -, -) are loaded within host platform . As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the embodiments described for the expedited VM launch are not limited to the nine node VM cluster environment , as shown in , and may include any number of nodes while remaining within the scope of the described embodiments.","As described herein, in one embodiment, the configuration of VM cluster environment  is based on the following presumptions: (1) VMM \/\/ can be different, but at least comply with the same VMM application programming interface (API) and provide the same hypercall interfaces for the various guest operating systems (OS); (2) the VM interface for the clustered guest OSs \/\/ is the same; (3) clustered guest OS kernel and software configurations are identical for the guest OS \/\/; and (4) the VMs in one cluster have the same usage; and therefore, operate as VM workers, in accordance with one embodiment.","In VM cluster environments, for example, as shown in , the creation time for loading the VMs, including guest OS \/\/ and other required applications can vary depending on the cluster size and specifically, the number of nodes within the VM cluster environment. Generally, the creation time for a VM may include the time required for booting the guest OS, initialization of the guest OS, and any application launched by the guest OS or other required services. In one embodiment, as shown in , a VMM hypercall interface of VMMs \/\/ is modified to support a VM fork ( ) hypercall. As described herein, a hypercall may refer to a command issued by a VM, such as a guest OS, to request a host platform service or access a host platform resource.","Referring again to , VMM  launches guest OS on platform . After the necessary initialization, guest OS - may issue a VM fork ( ) hypercall to the hypercall interface of VMM , as indicated by arrow . In response to the VM fork ( ) hypercall issued by guest OS -, VMM  may capture a runtime image of guest OS -. By using the runtime image of guest OS -, expedited VM launch of, for example, guest OS -, is achieved by minimizing the guest OS creation time; specifically, the time required for booting of the guest OS, initialization of the guest OS and application launch of the guest OS is eliminated.","Referring again to , once VMM  has captured a runtime VM image of guest OS -, VMM  has the option (Option 1 as indicated by arrow ) of launching a clone VM of guest OS - within another platform, such as platform , or loading a child VM (Option 2 as indicated by arrow ) according to the runtime image of guest OS - within a next node of platform . In accordance with Option 1, the launch of a VM on another platform is performed, in one embodiment, by VMM  issuing a VMM API VM clone command to another platform, such as platform , as shown in  and indicated by arrow .","In one embodiment, the VM clone command issued to host platform  includes the runtime image of guest OS - from host platform . Accordingly, in response to detection of a VM clone command issued by another platform, platform  will launch a VM clone, such as guest OS - according to the runtime VM image of guest OS -. As described herein, \u201cVM clone\u201d may refer to a VM that is created according to a runtime image of a VM loaded within a different host platform cluster.","In one embodiment, the expedited launch of a VM child within a node of host platform  (see arrow labeled ) may result in the sharing of memory between the parent VM - and the child VM -. In other words, because child VM - is loaded with the runtime image of parent VM -, parent VM - and child VM - share the same VMM configuration, the same VM definition, the same kernel definition, the same software configuration and the same runtime configuration. As a result, parent VM - and child VM - share memory  as parent\/child processes do. In one embodiment, the VM fork ( ) hypercall process is supplemented by a copy-on-write technique, for example, as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["270","220","1","220","2","274","220","1","276","220","1","272","274","276"]},"In one embodiment, pages may be shared between a parent VM - and a child VM -. In one embodiment, a read\/write (R\/W) attribute in each page table (for x86 environment) or a R\/W attribute in TLB (for Itanium platform) may be used to protect shared pages, as manufactured by the INTEL\u00ae Corporation.
