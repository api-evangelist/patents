Field","The following description relates to streaming service technology, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for providing a smart streaming service using composite context information, which can effectively provide the most suitable service at the present time according to the change in environment.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recently, users are surrounded by a communication environment of various terminals and services. In the future, various types of devices or terminals will use a large number of services based on various kinds of networks such as a personal area network (PAN) and a body area network (BAN), in addition to wired\/wireless terminals and home networks. Further, users will want such a variety of devices or terminals to use seamless services anytime or anywhere, and more various user experiences than those at the present time will be demanded.","However, in current streaming services, a unique streaming service is provided by each provider through an independent codec and platform. The current streaming services work passively and do not flexibly deal with users and network situation changes. Since unit services should be selected directly from a terminal and executed through negotiation or combination, a large number of additional overheads for the services occur. Since redundant development cost is excessively high due to independent service development for each service provider, it is very disadvantageous in terms of cost.","A conventional system for controlling a streaming service manages content information and service user information serviced in a media gateway or the like, and individually provides a streaming service to a user who requested the service, using a web-based service broker. In such a manner, it is difficult to create various streaming services, and users have difficulty receiving the same service regardless of networks and terminals. Streaming services to provide Internet-based VOD and Internet TV transmission services also have similar problems in a broadband convergence network. IPTV serviced in recent years is also provided based on a provider-centered closed service structure in which broadcast, VOD, basic bi-directional TV services are provided through the wired Internet. Therefore, in a case where the situation of a user or network is changed, most current services are passive in recognizing and reacting to the change in situation, and do not flexibly deal with the change in situation.","Exemplary embodiments provide an apparatus and method for a smart streaming service using composite context information, which can effectively provide the most suitable service at the present time according to the change in environment.","According to an exemplary aspect, there is provided an apparatus for providing a smart streaming service connected to a plurality of unit service servers each providing a unit service through a network, the apparatus including: a service route selector configured to select at least one unit service server for providing at least one unit service suitable for composite context of a current user from the plurality of unit service servers, using composite context information including information on users, user terminals and unit services, and create service route information that indicates a combination of the at least one selected unit service server; and a service route processor configured to process unit service information provided by the at least one selected unit service server, based on the created service route information, and provide a smart streaming service to the user.","According to another exemplary aspect, there is provided a method for providing a smart streaming service connected to a plurality of unit services each providing a unit service through a network, the method including: selecting at least one unit service server for providing at least one unit service suitable for composite context of a current user from the plurality of unit service servers, using composite context information including information on users, user terminals and unit services; creating service route information that indicates a combination of the at least one selected unit service server; and processing unit service information provided by the at least one selected unit service server, based on the created service route information to provide a smart streaming service to the user.","Other objects, features and advantages will be apparent from the following description, the drawings, and the claims.","Elements, features, and structures are denoted by the same reference numerals throughout the drawings and the detailed description, and the size and proportions of some elements may be exaggerated in the drawings for clarity and convenience.","The detailed description is provided to assist the reader in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the methods, apparatuses and\/or systems described herein. Various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the systems, apparatuses, and\/or methods described herein will likely suggest themselves to those of ordinary skill in the art. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted to increase clarity and conciseness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The system  for providing a streaming service using composite context information is configured to provide the most suitable service at the present time through resource management according to the change in environment so as to satisfy a user's requirements. To this end, the system  dynamically searches and combines a user's requested services and then provides the user's requested services. The system  senses an event caused by a user's context change, recombines services and then provides the recombined services, as necessary. As such, the system  is configured to provide users with an environment in which the users can easily and simply receive streaming services anytime and anywhere using any terminal.","Referring to , the system  includes an apparatus  for providing a smart streaming service based on composite context information, an application server , a unit service server group  and a user terminal . The apparatus  is hereinafter referred to as an apparatus  for providing a smart streaming service.","The user terminal  refers to a user terminal of various environments including various kinds and shapes of the user terminal, setup states of the user terminal, and the like. In , the user terminal  may include a first user terminal , a second user terminal  and a third user terminal . In , the first, second and third user terminals ,  and  refer to user terminals used by the same user. The first, second and third user terminals ,  and  may be user terminals in different situations or may be heterogeneous user terminals. For example, the first user terminal  may be a personal computer in a state in which a sound signal is output, and the second user terminal  may be the personal computer of the first user terminal  in a sound cancellation environment. The third user terminal  may be a portable terminal used by the same user of the first and second user terminals  and .","The first, second and third user terminals ,  and  may request a smart streaming service through the application server .","The unit service server group  may include a plurality of servers each providing a unit service. Referring to , the unit service server group  may include a video streaming service server  for providing video streaming as a unit service, an advertisement service server  for providing advertisement information as a unit service, an online caption service server  for providing online caption information as a unit service, and a transcoding service server  for providing a transcoding service as a unit service. In addition, servers for providing various types of unit services may be included in the unit service server group .","Each of the video streaming service server , the advertisement service server , the online caption service server  and the transcoding service server  may be included in the unit service server group . Alternatively, a plurality of servers for the same kind of unit service may be included in the unit service server group . The video streaming service server , the advertisement streaming service server , the online caption service server  and the transcoding server  may be operated by different service and content providers, respectively.","If the application server  sends a smart streaming service start request to the apparatus  using a smart streaming application programming interface (API), the apparatus  may adaptively select at least one unit service suitable for a composite context occupied by a current user using composite context information including information on users, user terminals and unit services, and provide a smart streaming service to the user using at least one selected unit service. The composite context information may include a user profile including information on users, a device profile including information on user terminals, and a service profile including unit services.","To this end, the apparatus  may select at least one unit service server capable of providing the most suitable streaming service in the user's environment, generate service route information to indicate a combination of the selected unit services, and provide the streaming service to the user based on the generated service route information. If the user's environment is changed and a context information event related to the change occurs, the apparatus  may newly create a service route capable of providing the most suitable streaming service corresponding to the composite context information based on the context information event, and provide the streaming service to the user according to the newly selected service route.","For example, if the first user terminal  requests a streaming service through the application server , the application server  may send the streaming service request of the user terminal  to the apparatus . Accordingly, the apparatus  identifies authority for the streaming selected through the user profile by the user. Then, if the authority is identified, the apparatus  may extract a kind of advertisement preferred by the user, and extract screen display capacity information on the first user terminal  through the device profile.","It is assumed that the screen display capacity information on the first user terminal , extracted through the device profile, represents that the apparatus  can immediately receive original video streaming. In this case, the apparatus  inserts an advertisement corresponding to the kind of preferred advertisement extracted through the user profile received from the advertisement service server  into original video streaming data provided from the video streaming service server , so as to provide the video streaming service having the advertisement inserted therein as a smart streaming service to the first user terminal .","Then, if the user changes the first user terminal  to be in a sound cancellation environment, the first user terminal  becomes the second user terminal . The apparatus  can sense the sound cancellation environment using the device profile. In this case, the apparatus  receives an online caption related to video streaming provided from the online caption service server , and inserts the online caption into the provided video streaming service, so as to provide the video streaming service having the caption inserted therein to the second user terminal  in the sound cancellation environment.","Subsequently, if the user changes the second user terminal  into the third user terminal  that is a portable terminal, the apparatus  can sense the terminal change state through the device profile. In this case, the apparatus  receives codec information corresponding to the screen display capacity information on the terminal from the transcoding service server , converts the provided video streaming data into codec capable of being processed by the third user terminal  using the received codec information, and continuously or seamlessly provides the video streaming service with the converted codec as a smart streaming service to the third user terminal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The apparatus  may include a smart streaming request receiver , a unit service register , a service route selector , a context information event processor , a service route processor , a user profile , a device profile  and a service profile . The user, device and service profiles ,  and  may be configured as various types of storage apparatuses for storing information.","The smart streaming request receiver  receives a smart streaming service request from the application server  and processes the smart streaming service request. For example, if the user terminal  transmits a smart streaming service request to the application server , the application server  may call a smart streaming API based on the smart streaming service request, and transmit the called smart streaming API to the smart streaming request receiver . The smart streaming request receiver  determines whether or not the user who transmits the smart streaming API is a user having the authority of the smart streaming service using the user profile  including the information on users.","The unit service register  receives information on unit services related to the smart streaming service from the unit service server group  and creates the service profile .","The service route selector  selects a service route based on the composite context information including information on users, user terminals and unit services, and generates service route information that indicates the selected service route. The service route selector  selects at least one unit service server for providing at least one unit service suitable for the composite context information on the current user, and generates service route information that indicates a combination of the at least one selected unit service server.","The context information event processor  processes a context information event based on a change in context.","The service route processor  processes at least one unit service using the service route information generated based on the service route selected by the service route selector , and provides the at least one unit service to the user terminal . The service route processor  receives service information for at least one unit service from at least one unit service server in the unit service server group  using the service route information generated by the service route selector , processes the service information for the at least one unit service, and provides the processed service information to the user terminal . For example, the service route processor  may generate integrated smart streaming service by combining service information for at least one unit service.","Information constituting each of the user, device and service profiles ,  and  will be described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["260","270","280"]},"Referring to , the user profile  may include information on a plurality of users. The user profile  may include a user's personal information such as age, sex and occupation for each user, streaming authority information, preferred advertisement information, and the like.","The device profile  may include information on a kind of terminal used for each user, screen display capacity information on the terminal, state information on the terminal, and the like. The state information on the terminal may include setup information on a current terminal such as a sound cancellation environment, available network capacity information on the terminal, network state information, and the like.","The service profile  is configured as information on registered unit services, and may include information on a service category (e.g., video streaming, advertisement, online caption, transcoding or the like), a kind of unit service related to each category (e.g., advertisement unit service , advertisement unit service  or the like, related to the advertisement service category), the availability of use of each unit service, and the like.","Referring back to , the smart streaming request receiver  of the apparatus  can identify whether or not the user who has requested the smart streaming service has authority for the corresponding streaming service through the user profile . If the user does not have the authority, the apparatus  immediately responds to the application server that the user does not have the authority of the corresponding service. If the user has the authority of the corresponding service, the smart streaming request receiver  requests a service route to indicate at least one unit service that constitutes the smart streaming service to the service route selector .","When assuming that the current user uses the first user terminal , the service route selector  can identify whether or not the first user terminal  directly receives the original video streaming using the screen display capacity information on the terminal  in the device profile . If it is identified that the first user terminal  directly receives the original video streaming, the service route selector  may select the video streaming service server  to provide the original video streaming. The service route selector  may select the advertisement service server  belonging to the preferred advertisement category in the service profile  configured as the registered unit service information using the advertisement information obtained through the preferred advertisement information in the user profile . Here, the service route selector  may select a current available server among a plurality of servers for each service category.","Thus, the service route selector  can generate service route information that indicates a service route having a combination of the video streaming service  and the selected advertisement service server . The service routine selector  sends the service route information configured as described above to the service route processor . The service route processor  may execute a unit service based on the service route information, and send, to the terminal user , the video streaming obtained by inserting the user's preferred advertisement into the original video streaming received from the video streaming server  and the selected advertisement service server .","Then, if the user changes the terminal to be in a sound cancellation environment, the first user terminal  becomes the second user terminal .","If the user terminal environment or the kind of terminal is changed, the device profile  may be configured to renew and register the changed item. If the terminal environment of the user to use a current smart streaming service is changed, the device profile  may be configured to generate a context information event that indicates a change in user terminal environment. Alternatively, the context information event processor  may be configured to sense a change in information stored in the device profile , to determine whether or not the user terminal environment is changed and to generate a context information event. Then, the service route selector  recreates service route information that indicates a combination of at least one unit service based on the sensed context information event. Here, the service route information provides at least one unit service suitable for the composite context occupied by the current user.","When the user changes the terminal to be in a sound cancellation environment, the context information event processor  senses the context information event that indicates a change in sound cancellation environment information among information in the device profile , and requests the service route selector  to selects a new service route based on the context information event.","For example, the service route selector  selects the online caption service server  in the service profile , and generates service route information that indicates a service route configured by the video streaming service server , the advertisement service server  and the online caption service server . Here, the service route selector  may select a current available server from a plurality of unit servers for each service category in the selection of the online caption service server .","The service route selector  sends the service route information configured as described above to the service route processor . The service route processor  executes a unit service based on the service route information, and processes and combines unit service information received from the video streaming service server , the advertisement service server  and the online caption service server , so as to send the video streaming having the caption inserted thereinto to the video streaming having the user's preferred advertisement inserted thereinto.","Subsequently, if the user changes the second user terminal  into the third user terminal  that is a portable terminal, the context information event processor  of the apparatus  senses a context information event that indicates terminal change context information in the device profile .","The context information event processor  requests the service route selector  to select a new service route. The service route selector  may select the transcoding service server  registered in the service profile , and generate service route information that indicates a service route configured by the video streaming service server , the advertisement service server  and the transcoding service server . Here, the service route selector  may select a current available server from a plurality of servers for each service category using information in the service profile  in the selection of the transcoding service server . The service route selector  sends the service route information configured as described above to the service route processor .","The service route processor  executes a unit service based on the service route, and performs transcoding with respect to the video streaming having the user's preferred advertisement inserted thereinto. Then, the service route processor  converts the transcoded video streaming to be displayed in the third user terminal , and sends the converted video streaming to the user.","As described above, the apparatus  can adaptively execute and control a service, dealing with a change in composite context information on the service based on a user's streaming service request, using the composite context information including the user's streaming authority information, preferred advertisement in the user profile, screen display capacity information on a terminal and state information on the terminal in the device profile, and current available unit service information in the service profile, and the like. Thus, the apparatus  can provide a streaming service optimized to the user based on the composite context information automatically recognized by the apparatus , even when the intervention of the user is minimized, regardless of ambient environment, terminal capacity, network change and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The apparatus  of  selects at least one unit service server for providing at least one unit service most suitable in the composite context of a current user from a plurality of unit service servers, using composite context information including information on users, user terminals and unit services ().","The apparatus  generates service route information that indicates a combination of the at least one selected unit service server ().","The apparatus  processes unit service information provided by the at least one selected unit service server based on the generated service route information, and provides a smart streaming service to a user ().","According to this embodiment, opportunities to easily develop and share various streaming services are provided to service providers, so that it is possible to create an open service development environment capable of overcoming limitations of a conventional close service development environment.
