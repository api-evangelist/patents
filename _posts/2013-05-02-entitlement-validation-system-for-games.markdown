{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS SHOWN IN THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["THIS INVENTION relates to an entitlement validation system for games, and in particular but not limited thereto, the system is for a laser tag game.","A large number of games such as laser tag games are played with a game equipment such as a laser tag vest, which must be activated by a responsible personnel of a business. The personnel will need to check that the customer has paid for the game before activating the game equipment. In all current laser tag game systems known to the applicant, the processes of customer payment and activation of game equipment are completely separate.","The game equipment will work, even if the customer has not paid. Fraud prevention (if any) can only be done after the fact by reconciling the number of games played against the number of games paid for.","To minimise game leakage due to people playing without payment or continuing to play after completion of paid for games, resources including additional personnel must be extended to do the reconciliation processes for the equipment being used by customers. The reconciliation processes therefore add substantial costs to businesses.","An object of the present invention is to provide an entitlement validation system for games, which alleviates or reduces to a certain level one or more of the above mentioned prior art problems.","In one aspect therefore, the present invention resides in an entitlement validation system for games having a game equipment arranged to be activable for enabling game play. The system comprises a ticketing module arranged to issue a ticket with a machine readable identification code upon payment made for a selected game, and to update a game entitlement database having identification codes matched with corresponding selected games, a ticket reader arranged to read the identification code of a ticket presented for game activation, a game controller arranged to receive the identification code transferred from the ticket reader and to activate the game equipment upon verifying of entitlement by matching the received identification code with the corresponding selected game in the database.","Preferably, said game is a laser tag game and the game equipment is a laser tag vest.","The ticketing module may have selectors for different games and\/or services. The ticketing module may also have one or more slots for insertion of coins and\/or notes and\/or transaction cards such as credit cards and debit cards. The ticketing module is preferably a point-of-sale (POS) terminal.","The identification code on the issued ticket may be in the form of a barcode or carried on a magnetic strip or RFID tag or other mechanism.","The system may have a base station arranged as a communications link between the ticket reader and the game controller. Preferably, the base station is arranged to receive data representing the identification code and selected game from the ticket reader and to transfer the received data to the game controller. The ticket reader may be integrated into the game equipment or installed in a validation activation station such as a booth where the customer stands.","In preference, the game controller upon verifying a match of the data representing the received identification code with the corresponding selected game which has not been marked as consumed in the database is arranged to transfer an activation signal to the game equipment. The activation signal may be transferred directly to the game equipment or via the base station.","The game controller may be arranged to update the database by inserting data representing consumption of the game corresponding to the identification code following transfer of the activation signal.","The game controller may also be arranged to transfer a rejection signal to the game equipment where entitlement of the identification code cannot be verified. Preferably, the game equipment has an indication unit arranged to provide a visual and\/or audio indication upon receiving an activation signal and\/or the rejection signal.","Desirably, the link between the game equipment and the base station is a wireless link.","Referring to the drawings, and initially to , there is shown an embodiment of the game entitlement verification system  according to the present invention. The system  in this embodiment is for a laser tag game having a laser tag vest (game equipment) , activation of which is to be controlled depending on verification of entitlement of a machine readable ticket .","The ticket  is issued by a ticketing module  which is a POS terminal in this embodiment. Upon receiving an appropriate payment for a game or service, an operator can press a ticket issue button (not shown) for issuing a machine readable ticket  for the selected game\/service. The module  may be a fully automated POS terminal which has selection buttons for selection of a game or service and payment slots where cash or a transaction card can be inserted for making payment. The selection buttons may be in the form of icons on a monitor.","As shown in , the ticket  for this embodiment is in the form of a plastic card with a substantially rectangular shaped plastic body A and a magnetic strip B where an identification code (not shown) is stored. The ticket can be in any other form having an identification code which can be read by a machine. Examples of such identification codes are a barcode, RFID tag, text\/numeral reference and other mechanism.","The ticketing module  has a data storage  where a database containing identification codes of issued tickets and selected games for the issued tickets are stored. The database also has markings for consumed games. An example of the database is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Ticket ID","Game Type","No. of games","Consumed"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"00017321","2","2","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},"00017322","1","2"]},{"entry":[{},"00017323","4","1","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},"00017324","1","1"]},{"entry":[{},"00017325","3","2","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"14"},"The vests (game equipment)  has a ticket reader  and is in wireless communication with a game controller  via a wireless base-station .","To play a game, the laser tag vest  (game equipment) must receive an activation signal from the controller . The system  requires an issued ticket  to be verified for determining whether the customer presenting the ticket read by the reader  does or does not have entitlement to play. In the determining process, the base station  retrieves the data representing the identification code on the read ticket and transfers the data to the controller . The controller then searches the database in the storage  for a match with any of the ticket IDs in the database. If a match is found and the game for this ID has not been consumed, the controller sends an activation signal for the game type and number of games listed for this ID. The base station  transfers the activation signal to the vest  which on receiving this signal provides a verbal indication that the selected game is ready to be played. If a match is not found, the controller  sends an invalid signal to the vest . The vest than provides a verbal message to inform customer that the ticket is not valid.","The laser-tag game controller  communicates with the POS terminal  by way of an application programming interface (API).
