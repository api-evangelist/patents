{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile computing devices, such as smart phones, may provide a wide array of processing capabilities such as digital assistant (PDA) features, including word processing, spreadsheets, synchronization of information (e.g., e-mail) with a desktop computer, and so forth. In addition, such devices may have wireless communications capabilities to provide features, such as mobile telephony, mobile e-mail access, web browsing, and content (e.g., video and radio) reception. Exemplary wireless communications technologies include cellular, satellite, and mobile data networking technologies.","As the functionality and processing power provided by mobile computing devices continues to increase, programs, applications and user interactions with the devices continue to become more dynamic and responsive to touch and\/or gestures. Wallpapers and desktop backgrounds, however, remain non-dynamic or static. As a result, it may be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for dynamically managing wallpapers for a mobile computing device. For example, it may be advantageous to manage wallpapers using multi-touch gestures on a multi-touch-sensitive display of a mobile computing device. Consequently, there exists a substantial need for techniques to improve the dynamic management of wallpaper images.","Various embodiments may be generally directed to methods and apparatus for multi-touch wallpaper management. Some embodiments may be particularly directed to dynamically changing wallpaper and\/or background images on the desktop of a mobile computing device using multi-touch gestures.","In one embodiment, for example, a mobile computing device may be configured to display a first wallpaper image on a multi-touch-sensitive display, receive a multi-touch gesture indicating a request to change the first wallpaper image, and display at least a portion of a second wallpaper image in response to the multi-touch gesture. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Changing wallpaper images on current mobile computing devices requires multiple steps to open preferences or settings menus and drill down through various folders to locate a desired image, select the image and confirm that the selected image is appropriate. Providing for the dynamic management of wallpaper images or applications may result in a more interesting and interactive user experience. For example, users may be able to simply and efficiently change wallpapers and add to their enjoyment of their mobile computing device experience. Furthermore, increased functionality and simplicity may distinguish one mobile computing device from another mobile computing device that does not offer similar functionality.","Various embodiments may comprise one or more elements. An element may comprise any structure arranged to perform certain operations. Each element may be implemented as hardware, software, or any combination thereof, as desired for a given set of design parameters or performance constraints. Although an embodiment may be described with a limited number of elements, nodes or modules in a certain topology by way of example, the embodiment may include other combinations of elements, nodes or modules in alternate arrangements as desired for a given implementation. It is worthy to note that any reference to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. It should also be understood that the use of the term control to refer to data and\/or signals throughout the application can refer to data flowing in any direction as control and\/or status data or signals. Other embodiments are described and claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A-1","FIG. 1A-2","FIG. 1A-3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","102","102","102","102","120","130","140","100"]},"The mobile computing device  may be generally configured to support or provide cellular voice communication, wireless data communication and computing capabilities. The mobile computing device  may be implemented as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone, sometimes referred to as a smart phone. Examples of smart phones include, for example, Palm\u00ae products such as Palm\u00ae Pre\u2122 or Palm\u00ae Treo Pro\u2122 smart phones. Although some embodiments may be described with the mobile computing device  implemented as a smart phone by way of example, it may be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context. For example, the mobile computing device  may comprise, or be implemented as, any type of wireless device, mobile station, or portable computing device with a self-contained power source (e.g., battery) such as a laptop computer, ultra-laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular telephone, combination cellular telephone\/PDA, mobile unit, subscriber station, user terminal, portable computer, handheld computer, palmtop computer, wearable computer, media player, pager, messaging device, data communication device, and so forth. Additional details for a mobile computing device may be described in more detail with reference to .","Display  may comprise a multi-touch-sensitive display in some embodiments. The multi-touch-sensitive display may consist of a touch screen or touchpad that when configured with appropriate software is capable of recognizing multiple simultaneous touch points or gestures as well as individual touch points and gestures. The gestures may be recognized through a variety of means, including but not limited to: heat, finger pressure, high capture rate cameras, infrared light, optic capture, tuned electromagnetic induction, ultrasonic receivers, transducer microphones, laser rangefinders, and shadow capture. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, mobile computing device  may be configured to display a first wallpaper image  on a multi-touch-sensitive display  of a mobile computing device  as illustrated at . To change or transition the wallpaper image, a multi-touch gesture  indicating a request to change the first wallpaper image  may be received. The multi-touch gesture is illustrated as a finger touch  in . In various embodiments, the gesture may include a multi-finger touch, a sliding gesture, a twisting gesture, a pinch-in gesture, a pinch-out gesture or any other gesture with one or more figures sufficient to indicate a desire to change the first wallpaper image . Additionally, the gesture may be recognized if performed by any suitable pointing device other than a finger in various embodiments, such as a stylus or mouse, for example.","As shown in , -, the multi-touch gesture  may be a diagonal sliding motion in a direction  in some embodiments. In various embodiments, the multi-touch gesture  indicating a request to change the first wallpaper image  may comprise a left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top or corner-to-corner diagonal scrolling gesture beginning at one of four edges of the first wallpaper image  and ending at an opposite edge of the first wallpaper image  or beginning at one of four corners of the first wallpaper image  and ending at an opposite corner of the first wallpaper image . In some embodiments, the multi-touch gesture  indicating a request to change the first wallpaper image  may comprise a pinch-in gesture or a pinch-out gesture to resize the first wallpaper image. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, in response to the multi-touch gesture , at least a portion of a second wallpaper image  may be displayed. The scrolling gesture  may result in a proportional portion of the second wallpaper image  being displayed along with a proportional portion of the first wallpaper image  based on a position of the scrolling gesture  on the multi-touch-sensitive display  in some embodiments. For example, as shown in , as the user moves a finger (e.g. ) from the top left corner of the display  in  in a direction indicated by  to a point near the middle of the display  in , a proportional portion of the second wallpaper image  is displayed or revealed while a proportional portion of the first wallpaper image  remains visible. Likewise, as the user continues to move their finger from the position illustrated in  to a position near the bottom right corner of the display  in , a greater portion of the second wallpaper image  is revealed.","In some embodiments, the second wallpaper image  may be selected and retained by completing the multi-touch gesture . For example, as shown in , the second wallpaper image  may be retained and may replace the first wallpaper image  if the user completes the multi-touch gesture  by sliding their finger completely from the top left corner of the display  to the bottom right corner of the display  or making another gesture defined as a complete gesture. In some embodiments, a multi-touch gesture revealing a predefined portion of the second wallpaper image , more than half of the image  for example, may result in the second wallpaper image  replacing the first wallpaper image . Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, the multi-touch gesture  may be recognized in a plurality of directions. For example, the multi-touch gesture need not be made in a straight line. A user may, for example, move their finger from the wallpaper transition starting point to any other point on the screen to reveal a corresponding portion of the next wallpaper image. Additionally, just as a multi-touch gesture  in one direction, e.g. direction , may reveal a portion of the second wallpaper image , a multi-touch gesture  in an opposite direction may conceal the previously revealed second wallpaper image  thereby returning to the first wallpaper image . Other embodiments are described and claimed.","While the multi-touch gesture is shown in  as beginning in the top left corner of the display , it should be understood that any suitable point or points on the display  may be selected as a hot position or starting position for initiating the wallpaper transition process. For example, in some embodiments, the position for initiating transition to the next wallpaper image may be in the top left, middle left, or bottom left portion of the display and may require a multi-touch gesture  in a direction toward the right side of the display . Additionally, the position for initiating transition to a previous wallpaper image may be in the top right, middle right or bottom right portion of the display  and may require a multi-touch gesture  in a direction toward to the left side of the display . Also, the position for initiating the transition may be in the middle top or middle bottom portion of the display  and require a downward or upward multi-touch gesture respectively.","In some embodiments, the position for initiating the transition may be identified by a ribbon, icon or other small and substantially unobtrusive indicator on the display  such that the user simply begins a multi-touch gesture at the identified position to begin the wallpaper transition process. The position may be user selected during a device setup process or in the device settings. In some embodiments, the position may be determined in advance and placed in a default location.","Once the initiation position is selected or determined, the wallpaper transition process can be completed without revisiting the user or system preferences, menus or settings. Additionally, in some embodiments, the location is not identified by any indicator on the display  and simply acts as a hot spot or other position suitable for initiating the wallpaper transition. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, repeated complete multi-touch gestures  may result in the revealing of consecutively different wallpaper images. For example, if a user swipes or performs a multi-touch gesture  from the top left to the bottom right of the screen, as shown in , a second wallpaper image  may be revealed. If additional similar multi-touch gestures are performed and completed, additional wallpaper images may be revealed. Similarly, if repeated multi-touch gestures are performed in the opposite direction, previously revealed wallpaper images may again be displayed. For example, consecutive wallpaper images may be displayed in response to consecutive multi-touch gestures .","In some embodiments, the consecutive wallpaper images may be retrieved from an image or application database. In various embodiments, the consecutive wallpaper images may be retrieved from a database located remote from the mobile computing device . For example, wallpaper images may be purchased or downloaded for free from a remote source directly to the mobile computing device . In some embodiments, the order of the wallpaper images may be defined or random and the order or randomness may be user selectable. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","The selection of a wallpaper image does not require any confirmation in some embodiments. For example, the selection of the second wallpaper image  may be initiated and completed by simply completing the multi-touch gesture . In this manner, obtrusive notifications such as OK\/SAVE\/CONFIRM\/etc. can be avoided.","In some embodiments, after all wallpaper image options are exhausted, the next wallpaper in the queue may comprise application wallpapers contained on the mobile computing device  corresponding to applications on the mobile computing device . In various embodiments, exhaustion of wallpaper image options may result in the presentation of suggested, popular or other wallpaper images for download or purchase. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, the wallpaper image may comprise an application wallpaper that is dynamically updated in response to changes in a corresponding application. In some embodiments, changes that occur in the corresponding application may be reflected in the application wallpaper. For example, the wallpaper may comprise a weather, stock market, social networking or other suitable theme corresponding to an associated application. For example, if a weather application is selected, a corresponding weather wallpaper application may also be selected that dynamically displays relevant information in the background, such as the sun if the local forecast call for sunny skies. In some embodiments, the corresponding application wallpaper may be automatically selected based on a selected application.","In some embodiments, the wallpaper transition process may be animated or include transitions to create a more appealing user experience. For example, in , the first wallpaper image  may appear to roll up like a rolled piece of paper as the multi-touch gesture  moves from the top left corner to the bottom right corner and unrolled if the multi-touch gesture were to reverse and move in the opposite direction. It should be understood that any suitable animation or transition may be used and still fall within the described embodiments. For example, blending, rolling, sliding, compressing, dissolving or any other animation or transition may be used.","In various embodiments, different multi-touch gestures such as pinching-in or pinching-out may be used to resize a wallpaper image. Additionally, multi-touch gestures not originating in the specified transition initiation position may be used to move or drag a wallpaper image to a new location. For example, a user may hold their finger to the display  for a set amount of time, thereby initiating the ability to relocate the wallpaper image. Additionally, in some embodiments, methods other than use of a hot spot or initiation point for starting the transition process may be used. For example, holding a finger on a display in a fixed position for a specified period of time, taping a finger multiple times, or any other recognizable and simple gesture may be used to initiate the dynamic wallpaper interaction capability. For example, two, three, four or any number of taps on the screen may be configured to activate dynamic wallpaper interactions and subsequent scrolling motions may be used to select an appropriate wallpaper image. Additionally, in some embodiments, multi-touch gestures such as tapping may also be used to confirm selection of a desired wallpaper image. Other embodiments are described and claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["150","100","102","120","130","140","108","110","145","145","102","102"]},"In various embodiments, as shown in , the one or more application windows or cards  may be displayed on top of the first  or second  wallpaper images. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the first  or second  wallpaper images are displayed behind the one or more application windows or cards  and the dynamic wallpaper interactions described above with respect to  may still be implemented despite the presence of the cards . For example, in response to the multi-touch gesture  that may or may not overlap the one or more application windows or cards , the dynamic wallpaper interactions may be completed as described above. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In some embodiments, an auditory queue may be sounded indicating that one or more application windows or cards  are associated with a second  or other wallpaper image. For example, as a user transitions from the first wallpaper image  to the second wallpaper image , a smacking or other sound may be used to indicate that the visible cards are associated with the predominantly displayed wallpaper image. In some embodiments, visual queues such as shacking the cards  when a new association is made or tactile queues such as vibrating the device when a new card  association is made may also be used and still fall within the described embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":["200","202","204","206","208","120","102","200","102"]},"In various embodiments, the wallpaper management module  may be operative to display a first wallpaper image on the multi-touch-sensitive display  and to display at least a portion of a second wallpaper image in response to a multi-touch gesture indicating a request to change the first wallpaper image. For example, the wallpaper management module  may be operative to manage the currently displayed wallpaper image and also to retrieve wallpaper images from an internal or external wallpaper image database or other source.","In some embodiments, the multi-touch management module  may be operative to receive multi-touch gestures from the multi-touch-sensitive display . For example, the multi-touch management module  may be operative to receive and interpret gestures or touches made by a user on the multi-touch-sensitive display . In some embodiments, at least one multi-touch gesture may indicate a request to change the first wallpaper image. In various embodiments, the multi-touch gesture may comprise a left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top or corner-to-corner diagonal scrolling gesture beginning at one of four edges of the first wallpaper image and ending at an opposite edge of the first wallpaper image or beginning at one of four corners of the first wallpaper image and ending at an opposite corner of the first wallpaper image.","In various embodiments, the scrolling gesture results in the wallpaper management module  displaying a proportional portion of the second wallpaper image along with a proportional portion of the first wallpaper image based on a position of the scrolling gesture on the multi-touch-sensitive display . For example, as shown in , the position of the multi-touch gesture  may dictate how much of each of the first  and second  wallpaper images is revealed. In some embodiments, the multi-touch gesture indicating a request to change the first wallpaper image comprises a pinch-in gesture or a pinch-out gesture to resize the first wallpaper image.","The application management module  may be operative to display one or more application windows on top of the first or second wallpaper images in some embodiments. For example, as shown in , application windows or cards  may be displayed over top of the first  and second  wallpaper images and the dynamic wallpaper interaction operations may still take place in the background without interfering with the application windows or cards . For example, at least a portion of the first  or second  wallpaper image may be displayed behind the one or more application windows  in response to the multi-touch gesture and the multi-touch gesture may overlap the one or more application windows . Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Operations for the above embodiments may be further described with reference to the following figures and accompanying examples.

The article of manufacture may include a computer readable storage medium arranged to store logic, data and\/or computer readable instructions for performing various operations of one or more embodiments when executed by a processor. Examples of storage media may include, without limitation, those examples as previously described. In various embodiments, for example, the article of manufacture may comprise a magnetic disk, optical disk, flash memory or firmware containing computer program instructions suitable for execution by a general purpose processor or application specific processor. The embodiments, however, are not limited in this context.","Various embodiments may be implemented using hardware elements, software elements, or a combination of both. Examples of hardware elements may include any of the examples as previously provided for a logic device, and further including microprocessors, circuits, circuit elements (e.g., transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and so forth), integrated circuits, logic gates, registers, semiconductor device, chips, microchips, chip sets, and so forth. Examples of software elements may include software components, programs, applications, computer programs, application programs, system programs, machine programs, operating system software, middleware, firmware, software modules, routines, subroutines, functions, methods, procedures, software interfaces, application program interfaces (API), instruction sets, computing code, computer code, code segments, computer code segments, words, values, symbols, or any combination thereof. Determining whether an embodiment is implemented using hardware elements and\/or software elements may vary in accordance with any number of factors, such as desired computational rate, power levels, heat tolerances, processing cycle budget, input data rates, output data rates, memory resources, data bus speeds and other design or performance constraints, as desired for a given implementation.","Some embodiments may be described using the expression \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected\u201d along with their derivatives. These terms are not necessarily intended as synonyms for each other. For example, some embodiments may be described using the terms \u201cconnected\u201d and\/or \u201ccoupled\u201d to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. The term \u201ccoupled,\u201d however, may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other.","It is emphasized that the Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R. Section 1.72(b), requiring an abstract that will allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, it can be seen that various features are grouped together in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as a separate embodiment. In the appended claims, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201cin which\u201d are used as the plain-English equivalents of the respective terms \u201ccomprising\u201d and \u201cwherein,\u201d respectively. Moreover, the terms \u201cfirst,\u201d \u201csecond,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d and so forth, are used merely as labels, and are not intended to impose numerical requirements on their objects.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above. Rather, the specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
