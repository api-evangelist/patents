title: Location signposting and orientation
abstract: A signposting and orientation technology is presented. This technology employs signposts superimposed on map images in order to convey otherwise undisplayable information on a map image. With signposting, zoomed-in maps can convey relationships between items on the map image, even though some of those item are not directly displayed on the map images. For example, a signpost can convey the distance between an anchoring object of reference and an item that is some distance and direction away from the object. Any relationships between objects and/or items can be dynamically maintained even though both the objects and item are moving about a map image. Additionally, orientation marks can be used in conjunction with signposts to orient users of the technology. Orientation marks may employ directional vectors, beginning at with the object of reference and ending with the orientation mark, whether the mark is celestial in nature or otherwise.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application relates to U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/998,081 filed Nov. 26, 2004, entitled \u201cLOCATION AWARE MOBILE-DEVICE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.\u201d","Mapping and location determination technology plays as increasing role in mobile device software applications. The ability to display dynamic maps on mobile devices and to draw spatial relationships between objects onto arbitrary maps (e.g. street maps, topographical maps, transportation system maps, indoor maps) is important to facilitate their effective usage. There are several conflicting priorities that make the effective use of maps on mobile devices difficult.","For example, there is a need for fitting high-resolution local maps and distant data on the same map. Usually users want zoomed in maps that show their immediate vicinity, or the immediate vicinity of an item they are interested in (e.g. is there parking spot near the movie theater I am going to?). At the same time, users are often interested in the relationship between the location they are looking at and items that do not fit on the current map (e.g. in what direction and how far is the closest exit to the shopping mall I am standing in?\u2014with the current map showing all the stores in my immediate vicinity).","This problem is exacerbated because mobile devices have much smaller screen surface areas than most desktop\/laptop computers and paper maps, and also have more limited input mechanisms for navigating maps. The problem exists even on a desktops which have relatively large screens and rich mouse (with buttons, roller wheels, drag\/drop capabilities) and keyboard inputs, but extremely difficult on a mobile phone with its screen being 5-10% the size of a desktop screen and having only a simple keypad (or sometime touch screen) for input.","Another example of the aforementioned conflicting priorities involves the need for orientation of maps displayed on mobile devices. Mobile devices can display maps on their screens, however it is problematic for end user's to understand which way they must orientate the maps. As above, this is greatly exacerbated by the relatively small screens of the devices. The utility of having a mobile device near-instantly display a convenient map is largely defeated if the device's user must walk around trying to look at street signs and other near-range markers in an effort to orientate themselves. For a stationary desktop computer people make abstract decisions about maps so the user's physical orientation to the map is not particularly important. On mobile devices people want to make instantaneous decisions and physically orientate themselves and the digital map just as they would a map printed on paper. They will want to turn their bodies and point the mobile devices in orientations where the maps match their surroundings.","Finally, a third example of the conflicting priorities is based on the need for orientation of others based on map information. A user of a mobile device may need to guide remote individuals and give them orientation information. It is difficult and frustrating to do this if the person giving these directions can not provide the other individual with useful distance and orientation cues. Allowing the viewer of the map to easily \u201cput themselves in the shoes of others\u201d and relate the directions they give them to the remote users' surroundings (e.g. \u201cDo you see the Eiffel tower in the distance in front of you? OK. Walk 4 blocks and keep the Eiffel tower on your left.)","These are but only three examples among a myriad of situations that arise when trying to display dynamic maps on mobile devices and to draw spatial relationships between objects onto arbitrary maps. Software developers building mobile applications for both indoor and outdoor usage (as well as hybrid usage indoors and outdoors) need to be able to provide the applications' users with easy to use and highly accurate distance and orientation information.","The various aspects of signposting and orientation technology discussed herein provide an applications' users and developers with easy to use and highly accurate distance and orientation data and tools, respectively. For example in one aspect, location and orientation is used for signposting information that could not otherwise be conveyed in a mobile device. Items that cannot be displayed on a mobile device display are signposted. These items can include people, places, or just about any object of interest. Such signposts contain a variety of information, including but not limited to, the distance between an object of reference and the item in question, the general direction of the item to the object, and even the name of the item.","In another aspect of signposting, signposts are dynamically updated when either the object or the item moves about the map. Moreover, the object can serve to anchor the item and other items of interest, thus keeping track of items that are not in the immediate view of a mobile device display. Anchoring can be dynamically changed depending on user or developer input. In the case of the user, that input may be made via the mobile device; in the case of the developer, a programming framework can be used to develop a desired signposting (and orientation) program. The framework allows signposting on any existing or dynamically rendered map; easy and dynamic designation of the anchor point form which signposts are measured and rendered in relation to; and easy and dynamic selection of any number of objects for signposting.","In one aspect of orientation, reference marks can be superimposed on a map (in addition to signposts) in order to help mobile device user to orient themselves. Various reference mark can be used, whether the sun, the moon, or the stars. Ground-and air-based marks can also be used, such a monuments, mountains, buildings, aircraft and the like. These marks can either be moving or stationary. Additionally, vectors from an object of reference to a reference mark can be used to help a user align with the proper geographical heading.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Signposting and orientation technology is presented. At the outset, a general description of signposting (for example, displaying information via a signpost for items that do not fit on a map image) and orientation information (for example, allowing users to orient themselves in a given environment) is presented. This general description is then fleshed out by focusing on the following aspects: directional vectors and orientation marks employed in unison with signposting; location signposting and orientation with stationary and moving items; dynamically changing the anchoring point (or center of attention) of signposted items; a varying environment for signposting and orientation (whether outdoor or indoor); centering of items on a given image map; various exemplary scenarios employing the technology; an exemplary implementation; a flexible programming framework; and finally a suitable computing environment.","Aspects of Location Signposting and Orientation","There are various aspects to location signposting and orientation. In one aspect,  illustrates typical areas of interest to a user on a map image . For example, a map image  of the city of Paris is shown with the following areas of interest: The Arch De Triomphe , the Eiffel Tower , Notre Dame , the Louvre , and Montmare . A typical user  (in the map image  referred to as \u201cJane\u201d) of the location signposting and orientation technology is located near the center of the map image , near the Jardin des Tuileries.","The user , when looking at a map image  in a mobile device, such as a cell phone or any other device capable of displaying map images, is usually confined to seeing a very limited portion  of the map image . This occurs because of the typical small size of the map image  that can be displayed in a mobile device.","Thus, in another aspect,  illustrates a typical limited portion  of the map image . In this limited display , only the user (\u201cJane\u201d)  can be seen and the other areas of interest cannot be fit unto the limited display  while maintaining the desired resolution. Thus, the Arch De Triomphe , the Eiffel Tower , Notre Dame , the Louvre , and Montmare  are no longer present in the limited image , and as a result, the user  has a more difficult time knowing where these areas of interest are located with respect to the user . A natural consequence of this is that the user  has a more difficult orienting himself or herself, and the displayed map is itself of limited use because while it displays zoomed in details it says nothing about important destinations the user cares about. Moreover, proper orientation lends support to signposting which helps a user to understand spatial relationship to off-map items.","In contrast to ,  uses signposting to help with the knowledge of relatively located landmarks (but not just landmarks, as will be discussed below) and orientation of the user . Thus, in another aspect, signposts  are used in an enhanced map image  (enhanced to the limited image  of ) when the areas of interest (or alternatively, \u201citems\u201d) are outside the limited digital map image .","A typical signpost  is shown: it has the name of the landmark, such as the \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d , the distance  of the user  from the landmark, and an direction arrow  showing in which direction the user  should head to get to the landmark. In , in one of the signposts , the user  is 2.3 kilometers (km) from the Arch De Triomphe. To get to the Arch, the user  should be heading to the left. In other words, the user  should be heading due East, if the Map is oriented towards the North and the user  is facing North\u2014but this is not required, since map orientation could vary (as could the orientation of the user ). This is just a simple example used herein for illustrative purposes, and those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the map orientation could easily be made to vary in directional orientation-and of course, the user orientation can vary almost constantly, as anyone (not even needing to be skilled in the art) can understand from personal life experience.","In , with signposting in place, some of the areas of interest discussed with reference to  are shown in  in the following manner: the Arch De Triomphe  is due west and 2.3 km away from the user ; the Eiffel Tower  is 2.5 km southwest of the user ; the Louve  is 0.9 km southeast of the user ; and finally, Montmarte  is 2.5 km northeast of the user .","Of course, these directional designations, such as \u201cwest\u201d or \u201cnortheast\u201d, etc., are merely exemplary, and other more accurate designation could be used such as \u201cnorth by northeast\u201d or \u201csouth by south east\u201d and so on. Also alternative descriptions could be used such as \u201cleft,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d \u201cup,\u201d \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cin the bottom left corner (of the screen)\u201d and so on. The directional arrow  attempts to substantially indicate the direction the user  should be heading to get to the area of interest.","Moreover, the display of signposts can vary also. For example, supposing there are twenty items of interest on mobile device screen map image , it would not be a good idea to display all twenty signposts\u2014at least for readability purposes. Therefore, selected signposts can be displayed. For example, in , only four signposts are displayed (signposts , , , and ), even though the user  may have specified five areas of interest\u2014as is shown in : areas , , , , and ). In comparison to ,  omits showing a signpost to Notre Dame . In short, the user  (or a developer using an interface to program this location signposting and orientation technology) can specify the display parameters, and assign them weights for display importance based on a variety of factors, such as, visibility, importance, closeness of distance, the desired density of signposts, and so on.","Likewise, it goes without saying that the information contained within the signposts can also be altered. The depicted signposts in  are merely exemplary. Thus, if for example, a user  wanted to fit in more information in a signpost he could easily do that. Thus, taking the Arch De Triomphe  signpost as an example, in addition to having the name, the distance, and the directional arrow, a user  or a developer could easily add a time display using a simple algorithm: The Arch De Triomphe is 2.3 km away, assuming a typical human walks 6.8 km per hour, the user should get to the Arch in about 30 minutes (distance divided by speed equals time, or, put another way: 2.3 km\u00f76.8 km per hr=30 minutes). Alternatively, miles instead of kilometers could be used, and so on. In short more or less information can be used depending on what is desired: if a lot of information is desirable to be displayed per signpost, fewer signposts will fit onto a screen.","Aspects of Directional Vectors and Orientation Marks in Unison with Signposting","Directional vectors and orientation marks may be used in unison with signposting in order to at least orient the user . Thus, in another aspect, in , the user  is near the \u201cJardin des Tuileries\u201d and sees on a display screen  that the Eiffel Tower is 2.5 km west-southwest of her position. Similarly, Notre Dame  is roughly southeast of her. However, the user  may have a problem figuring out how to align herself in the first place. She may not know which way is west-southwest.","Thus, orientation marks or \u201ccues\u201d may be used, such as the sun. Actually, any celestial body may be used, whether the sun, the moon, the stars (the kind visible at night, thus excluding the sun), etc. Likewise, ground-based marks can be used, such as the Eiffel Tower itself\u2014which, interestingly enough, may be both an area of interest and an orientation mark.","In , the sun  is used as an orientation mark. The user  can align herself with the sun  and then walk towards, for example, the Eiffel Tower by keeping the sun on her northwest side (or to the upper left of her as she is walking). Helpfully, directional vectors , , and  are provided that allow the user  to align the display screen or map image therein  with the subject of interest, such as the sun, thus aligning an imaginary line from the user  to the sun  with the directional vector . The directional vectors are not only available for the orientation marks  but also for the other signposts  and . Thus, the Eiffer Tower signpost  has its own directional vector  anchored to the user , and the Notre Dame signpost  has its own directional vector . These directional vectors and orientation marks can be display or not displayed depending on the needs and desires of the user  or a developer coding a location signposting and orientation program.","Aspects of Location Signposting and Orientation with Stationary and Moving Items","Thus far, the target areas of interest, such as those displayed in , for instance, the Arch De Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower, were stationary. These areas of interest (in other words, \u201citems\u201d on a display screen of a map image) were in one place and the user  was moving toward them. However, any items (even all items) that are displayed on a map image, can be moving about the map image, whether inside the displayable boundaries or outside the boundaries. These items can maintain dynamic relationships, such as a distance relationship between one item and another item that is dynamically update as the item move, either towards each other or away from each other.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","402","404"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIGS. 1","FIG. 5B"],"b":["404","406","500","406","2","2","502","404","406","502","406","502"]},"However, user one  keeps track of user two  via signposting. As either of the users moves about, their relationships are dynamically updated. For instance, the distance between the two users is dynamically updated. In , that distance is 2.2 km, as can be seen in the \u201cBrian\u201d (i.e. user two) signpost . The signpost tells user one  that user two  is 2.2 km northeast of user one . Likewise, stationary items on the display screen  are also tracked. The Eiffel Tower  is 3.1 km west by northwest from user one , and Notre Dame is 1.2 km east by northeast from user two . Of course, as user one  moves about, these latter distances are also dynamically updated.","Aspects of Dynamically Changing the Center of Attention of Signposted Items","Building on ,  illustrates that the center of attention (which can be an anchor point) or display can also be dynamically changed while maintaining signposted items relationships. Thus, in contrast to  where user one  is the center of attention (i.e. in the middle of the display screen ), now the second user is displayed preferentially near the center of the display screen . Thus, now the signposts are calculated from the second user's  point of view. This means that user two  is now the anchor to any related items.","For example, user two , or \u201cBrian\u201d, is 4.3 km away from the Eiffel Tower  and 1.2 km away from Notre Dame . Although the signpost for the first user  is not shown in , this could be easily accomplished in the manner discussed with reference to .","As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, numerous aesthetic improvements could be made to the display  in . For example, in the current configuration, both signposts  and  are at the edge of the display . However, one could easily move these signposts around, so that items further away, say, 100 km away appear on the edge of the screen, while those closer, say, 1 km away, appear close to the anchoring object of reference. Likewise, the size of any signpost could vary depending on the distance, as could the color\u2014say, faded color for objects far away and bold, conspicuous color for those near (yet off the display screen ). There are many such touches that may be implemented to make the relationships displayed on the screen  more intelligible for any user.","Furthermore, the image maps used so far have been two dimensional (2-D) image maps, because such maps are easier to visualize and discuss. However, the aforementioned and following aspects are also applicable to three dimensional (3-D) maps. Thus, not only horizontal, i.e., x and y coordinate relationships (in a Cartesian sense) may be maintained via signposting and orientation, but also vertical or z coordinate relationships may also be maintained. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that for such 3-D signposts, merely more information would have to be displayed in the signposts. Thus, a signpost might display that the Eiffel Tower is not only 4.3 km away , but also that to get there, user two  has to go uphill (or, additionally, climb 300.51 meters or 986 feet to get to the top of the tower). For the persnickety user, a signpost might even inform the user that the Eiffel tower changes in height by about 15 centimeters, depending on the temperature, thus there might be an extra, albeit small, climb in store for the user.","Aspects of a Varying Environment for Signposting and Orientation","The aspects of signposting and orientation technology discussed so far have been confined to an outside environment, but they could just as easily be used in an indoor environment (including transportation system environments).  illustrates an indoor signposting scenario. A user , \u201cJane\u201d, is at the center of a mobile device display , and the user  is 12 m (meters) away from the copier_X  and 28 m away from copier_C . Thus, if the user  wants to make copies, for instance, she can go the nearest copier, namely, copier_X . Likewise, the user  is shown the distance of other individuals (a subspecies of \u201citems\u201d) in the indoor environment. Thus, \u201cDoug\u201d  is located 10 m away from the user , \u201cJane\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A"],"b":["704","706","710","708","704","712","704","1","704","702","709","708","708","708","709","708","704"]},"Aspects of Centering of Items","The above discussion alluded to the notion that items do not have to be centered on any particular screen display. For example, with regard to , a display  has the same items as the previous figure, namely, , however, the difference is that neither of the items are in the center  of the display  (the center  of the display  is indicated by a dashed circle). Thus, as \u201cJane\u201d  moves closer to Copier_X , now only 5 m away from her, as an item on the display , she moves off center . Likewise, her distance relationship to the other copier, Copier_C , has now increased to 34 m.","Various Exemplary Scenarios","The aforementioned technology may be used in various exemplary (i.e. sample) scenarios. For example, with regard to orientation, a user may be looking at a detailed street-map in a neighborhood of Paris he is not familiar with. His location is displayed on the map because his mobile device as global positioning (GPS) hardware. However, he is disoriented because the streets are windy and not well signposted. He's trying to find his way to \u201cLe Petit Caf\u00e9\u201d to meet some people. It may be night-time, but he can see the Eiffel tower several miles away. He would like to know the orientation of the Eiffel tower relative to the \u201czoomed in\u201d map he's looking at. At the same time he wants the map to show the distance & orientation to \u201cLe Petit Caf\u00e9\u201d. Based on the line or vectors on the map pointing to the Eiffel tower, he's able to physically orientate himself and the device. He sees that \u201cLe Petit Caf\u00e9\u201d is \u201cup and to the left\u201d about 2.5 km. Based on this information he's able to start his walking journey going in the right direction.","As hinted already above, the present technology also assists in orientating others, remote from their location. Again, using the same example of a user as above, the user is in Paris and receives a phone call from his friend Sue. Sue is supposed to meet him at \u201cLe Petit Caf\u00e9\u201d but is currently at the Notre Dame church. Based on this information, the user can place her on a map of Paris (at Notre Dame). (Alternately, if she had a device that supported it, she could have electronically sent the user her location). The user is able to look at her location on a detailed (i.e. zoomed-in) street map, but at the same time see her distance and orientation to other landmarks (e.g. to the Eiffel Tower, to the Louvre, the Pompidou museum), to the sun, which is shining brightly this day. He can also see her location relative to \u201cLe Petit Caf\u00e9\u201d which is where he's currently standing. Based on this information he's able to tell her which way to face (based on landmarks she can see, and also based on the sun, e.g. \u201cthe sun should be to your right\u201d), and how far she should walk to come meet the user.","Furthermore, the aforementioned technology can assist in making location aware decisions, and pivoting orientation data, based on multiple locations. Again, focusing on the exemplary user, he's in London and speaking with a friend, Brian, on the phone who is somewhere several miles away. The user and Brian agree to meet for coffee, but have not decided on where yet to meet. The user is able to place both Brian and himself onto a map, and also bring up the locations of the coffee shops in the neighborhood. He's able to look at the coffee shops and see their relationship to himself and Brian. He's able also to see the locations of Tube stops (a.k.a subway stations) in the neighborhood. Very quickly he's able to visually pivot on several pieces of information: he can see his location and the coffee shops near him (displayed on the map if they are close, otherwise indicated by distance and direction with a signpost of they are off the map); he can see Brian's location and the coffee shops near him (displayed on the map if they are close, otherwise indicated by distance and direction with a signpost of they are off the map); he can pick a tube stop (quite possibly by switching rapidly from a street map to a tube schematic; both having appropriate signposts displayed on them as required), and see the coffee shops near it. He can see that there is a good coffee shop, \u201cThe Queen's Beans\u201d, near the \u201cNotting Hill\u201d station. The Notting Hill station however has four different exits on different street corners and can be confusing to navigate from. The user is able to choose the tube stop and see its distance to the coffee shop, and both its and the coffee shops orientation relative to the afternoon sun. He sees that the when exiting the tube stop it is necessary to walk three blocks with the \u201csun to his left\u201d (north) to arrive at the coffee shop. He's able to relay this information to Brian, and they agree to meet there in 30 minutes.","Another scenario involves orientating oneself while hiking in the mountains. A user may be hiking in the mountains and have a GPS receiver with him. Friends of his have indicated a GPS location where they would like to meet that evening. The user can see Mount Rainer off in the distance but is interested in looking at a much more zoomed in map that shows 15 km of hiking trails. His electronic map is able to show him the zoomed in map with three directional signposts, one shows the direction and distance to the meeting point. The second shows the direction to Mt. Rainier. The third shows the direction to the sun. Based on these cues, he is easily able to orientate himself and head to meet his friends.","In addition to these outdoor scenarios, there are various indoor scenarios. For example, a user may ask herself where there are multiple exits to a building relative to where she is standing? Which of these exits is closest? If the user is facing the elevators, which way does she need to spatially orientate her device in order to make sense of the map? If the user can see the sun outside the window of the office she standing in, what way should she orientate her device relative to this in order to have a correctly orientated map of the building she's in? If the user is speaking to someone on the phone in another building, and they have sent their indoor location to her, what exit of their building should she tell them to go out of to meet her outside? All of these questions can easily answered by the signposting and orientation technology.","It should be noted, that all of these features discussed in the exemplary scenarios above, such as the use of GPS technology in conjunction with the present signposting and orientation technology, is merely exemplary discussion but not limited to such technologies. Other equivalent and complementary technologies may also be employed, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","Aspects of an Exemplary Implementation","There are numerous implementations of the above discussed aspects. For example,  presents a flow chart that shows in block form how one, merely exemplary and in no way dispositive, implementation might be set-up. Thus, at block  a map image is acquired. The image may be acquired from a pre-stored source in the mobile device that displays the image, or from an outside source, whether some kind of memory device or a result of downloading (either from some map source or even from another user).","Block  addresses the notion that the acquired map  can be any arbitrary map image derived from any source\u2014as mentioned above. Thus, the maps that are displayed on a screen of a mobile device may have various resolutions and be stored in various formats. So long as signposting and orientation information can be superimposed on the map image, any arbitrary map will do.","At block , at least a portion of the acquired or dynamically rendered (by a rendering engine) map image is displayed on the mobile device. Since mobile devices, such as cell phones, pagers, or personal digital assistants, typically have small display screens, the entire map image cannot be displayed (although, it should be noted that if the display is big enough or the map small enough, the entire map image or a substantial portion thereof could potentially be displayed). Thus, a portion of the map is displayed, where that portion may have several items, such a people or landmarks, displayed on it.","At block , such an item is displayed on the map image. In one aspect, it can be superimposed on the map image, such that the item's relation to the surrounding geography can be seen. Also, as mentioned, multiple items, either those moving about the map image or those that are stationary, can be displayed. In another aspect, one item, the anchoring item with respect to other items on the map image, the so called \u201cobject of reference\u201d, can be displayed in the center of the map image, and any item that do not fit on the display can be signposted. It goes without saying, that the more a user of a mobile device zooms in on any given map, the more signposts will appear (if so desired), since signposts attempt to remedy at least the problem of maintaining a map at a certain level of particularity while maintaining information regarding relationships about items that could not fit on a display at that level of particularity.","At block , once the item of interest is displayed, an object of reference to anchor that item is established. Just to underscore that  is a mere exemplary implementation of the aspects discussed so far, the anchoring object of reference could be established first and then the item could be displayed (i.e. blocks  and  could switch temporal order). However, in this particular implementation, once the item is displayed it is anchored to an object of reference. This object can be located anywhere on the display screen (it can even be located outside the screen, if so desired, in which case it would have a signpost to it\u2014again, if a signpost were desired in the first place). The anchoring of the item to the object allows for signposting to maintain certain relationships between the item and the object. For example, a distance relationship and a directional relationship can be displayed. Interestingly, in one aspect, the anchoring is still maintained even though items and objects move about, or appear of disappear from the display screen.","At block , one the anchoring is complete, a decision is made whether the anchored item, for example, its on the display screen of the mobile device. Although, any one skilled in the art will quickly recognize that different decisions could be made at this point. For instance, a decision could be made as to whether the object of reference fits on a display screen. Alternative, a decision could be made as to whether both the item of interest and the object of reference fit on the display screen, and so on.","At block , if the answer to the question posed at block  was yes, namely, that the anchored item does indeed fit on the display screen, then the item is just displayed as before. And it is kept displayed as long as it fits onto the display screen. Now, it should be recognized that a user of a mobile device may change this situation by either zooming in or zooming out of a map image. For instance, suppose a user is looking at an item on the map image and suddenly decides to zoom in on a particular portion of the map away from where the item is displayed. If the user zooms in enough, the item will no longer fit onto the display (that is, it will still be located on the map image itself, but it may no longer be displayable of a mobile device screen).","In such a scenario, at block , once the item is no longer displayable, a signpost is maintained for it so long as it is off the screen. Signposting is either turned on or off depending whether the item is displayable for not, thus, with reference to the flow chart, the signposting and orientation system keeps alternating states between blocks  and .","Moreover, when the system is at block , there is the option of implementing block . At block , an orientation mark is created for the user, either upon request (as illustrated) or upon some other condition, such as a developer setting up the system to display orientation mark and corresponding direction vectors to help user to orientate themselves. As mentioned above, and as is discussed in more detail below, these orientation marks may take on a variety of forms, from celestial bodies to grounded bodies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"],"b":["914","914","1002"]},"Numerous choices abound, and in one case, at block , the name of the off-screen item is displayed. A name, of course, is just an example, and numbers could be used instead or just about any identifying symbol for an item. Moreover, at block  the distance of the item to an anchoring object of reference is also displayed, although other relationships could also be displayed, such as the temporal relationship between the object and the item. Finally, at block , an orientation reference is used to point in what direction an object of reference must be moving in order to reach the item. The orientation reference need not be pointing exactly in that direction, i.e., as would a vector, but can point substantially in that direction. Of course, as mentioned above, for a more accurate depiction, orientation mark with vectors to objects of reference could easily be used if the user or developer wished to do so.","At block , such a vector between an object of reference and an item and\/or an orientation mark can be created. This type of vector allows a user to use the vector to align himself with an orientation mark, such as the sun. It also helps to clarify special relationships between signposted items, orientation marks, and objects of reference.","Lastly, at block , any of the discussed or other relationships displayable in signposts can be dynamically updated. Thus, items could change names, if for example one item corresponds to a user with a mobile device and then hands off that mobile device to a second user who will be tracked via the mobile device (say, for example, \u201cJane\u201d hands of her mobile device to \u201cBrian\u201d, in which case the signpost name would have to be updated\u2014if the tracking is being done person-by-person). However, tracking can also be done mobile device-by-mobile device, so that even if the device is handed off from one person to the next, the name remains the same. All of this, of course, presupposes that the mobile device is the item on the map image\u2014and it could easily be so, especially if it can send its location information to another mobile device\u2014a feat easily accomplishable and knowable by those skilled in the art. But, additionally, a user could merely tell another user of her location and tracking could be done in this manner (although dynamic updating might be more challenging, since such updating would depend on the former user's updates).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"],"b":["916","1102","1104","1108","1110","1112"]},"In addition to some of the celestial bodies discussed above with reference to blocks , , and , at block  grounded bodies can also be used. As mentioned, on a moonless city night lighted towers can be used, but in reality any visible building or monument can be used. Thus, at block  buildings such as the Louvre museum can be used or at block  monuments such as the Eiffel tower can be used. In short, as far as orientation marks go, any visible object that can be leveraged by the user for orientation purposes can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 12A","FIG. 9","FIG. 12A"],"b":["904","1202","1204","1210","1212","1202","1210","1212"]},"What holds true for items, also may hold true for objects of reference. In , at block , once an object of reference is established and displayed, such an object can either be stationary (block ) and centered (block ) or stationary (block ) and off-center (block ). Similarly, an object can be moving (block ) can either be stationary (block ) and centered (block ) or stationary (block ) and off-center (block ).","Aspects of a Flexible Programming Framework","In one aspect of this signposting and orientation technology, a flexible programming framework can be implemented for use by application developers (and especially for the development of software running on mobile devices) in order to take advantage of this technology. With reference to , the framework  consists of a set of programming interfaces , , , and  for both application developers and software developers building map-rendering technology (but it can be used by end-users also through user interface elements that expose access to this interface). These interfaces allow for each item that can potentially be displayed on top of a map to be associated with data structures. For example, one data structure, such as \u201cMapItemDisplaylnfo\u201d , contains properties that describe the rendering characteristics (e.g. color and visibility) of the item if it is to be drawn onto the map. This data structure also has a property called \u201cSignpostWhenOffscreen\u201d  that determines if the item should have a signpost drawn to it if it cannot be displayed on the screen displayable portion of a map.","The following is a high level description of the code from \u201cMapItemDisplayInfo\u201d :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"MapItemDisplayInfo"},{"entry":"Namespace: using EMIC.LocationServices.LocationUIControls"},{"entry":"Assembly: EMIC.LocationServices.LocationUIControls.DLL"},{"entry":"EMIC.LocationServices.LocationUIControls"},{"entry":"This class wraps access to an ItemOfInterest or AreaOfInterest object"},{"entry":"and controls its display characteristics within a MapDisplay control."},{"entry":"An instance of this object is returned when an ItemOfInterest or"},{"entry":"AreaOfInterest is added to a MapDisplay control."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Properties that dicate how the map item will be visually displayed:"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Visible property"},{"entry":"TRUE = the items should be attempted to be rendered onto map images."},{"entry":"FALSE = do not render the item onto map images."},{"entry":"SignpostWhenOffscreen (1304) property"},{"entry":"If set to TRUE, if this item\/area can not fit into the screen of the"},{"entry":"current map, a signpost is drawn to indicate what direction and how"},{"entry":"far the item is."},{"entry":"Emphasis property"},{"entry":"Returns the visual emphasis of the item.

It then chooses the best resolution to use to render the map, and the best boundary areas of the map to ensure the most important items get displayed. When the right map as been selected, each of the Items (or Areas) of interest is attempted to be rendered onto this map image. If the Item or Area is found to be outside the bounds of the current map, but still relevant to the map, a \u201csignpost\u201d is rendered onto the map image indicating its relative distance and orientation to the designated item on the map.","To render this map, the direction vector drawn to it, and a compass icon the points in the direction of the object, vector mathematics are used to calculate the directional relationship between the SignpostBase object and the object whose signpost is being drawn. First a vector (v_direction) is calculated between the two objects. Second the \u201cdot product\u201d is calculated between this direction vector (v_direction) and the map's normalized North (v_north) and East (v_east) vectors (where the magnitude of both of these vectors should be the same, and the direction vector can be any magnitude. Thus, from this point, an x_component and a y_components can be determined relative to an object of reference (i.e. an anchoring point): x_component=v_direction*v_north; y_component=v_direction*v_east. From this, a compass heading is determined. Finally the signpost graphics and data are rendered onto the map image.","Furthermore, if a request is made that the sun's orientation is to be displayed on the map, this orientation is calculated by using the Universal Time (Greenwhich Mean Time) and the map objects Longitude and Latitude values. Based on these values, the correct position of the sun on the maps orientation can be determined.","Further flexibility is built into the system described above by: (a) allowing the providers of various maps to indicate whether their map knows which direction on their map corresponds to \u201cEarth's North\u201d. If the map does not know where Earth's North is, no reference to the sun's orientation will be drawn; (b) allowing the providers of various maps to indicate their orientation to a \u201crelative north\u201d that may be used on local coordinate systems such as indoor coordinate systems that may not care about Earth orientation (e.g. some indoor location systems may not care where \u201ctrue north\u201d is).","Aspects of a Suitable Computing Environment","The signposting and orientation technology can be employed in various computing environments, which may be implemented inside the aforementioned mobile devices or outside such devices but working in cooperation with them.
