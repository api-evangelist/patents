No. 60\/341,671, entitled \u201cQUALITY OF SERVICE SETUP ON A TIME RESERVATION BASIS\u201d, filed on 15 Dec. 2001.","The present invention generally relates to videoconferencing and, more particularly, to a method for setting up Quality of Service (QoS) contracts and traffic classification filters for videoconference sessions. The method employs time reservations in setting up the QoS contracts and the traffic classification filters. The traffic classification filters differentiate real-time traffic (videoconference traffic) from non-real-time traffic.","Typically, videoconferencing is implemented over dedicated Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and\/or T1\/T3 circuits. These circuits provide a dedicated path between two geographically separate locations. A drawback to such an arrangement is that dedicated circuits can be extremely expensive and underutilized. There is a lot of wasted bandwidth if the dedicated circuits are not being utilized because a videoconference session is not taking place. Many corporations that have geographically separate locations typically have dedicated circuits (e.g., T1 circuits) providing a data network between them. The dedicated circuits allow the Local Area Networks (LAN) of each location to be connected together creating a Wide Area Network (WAN). The primary use of these circuits is for data connectivity between the two locations.","The LANs at each location are connected locally by Ethernet switches. The LANs provide an infrastructure with large amounts of bandwidth. The typical connectivity bandwidth on a LAN is 100 Mbps (full-duplex). This typically translates into excess amounts of bandwidth available between the end nodes and the router that connects them to the WAN. There is almost always a bandwidth constraint on the WAN and never in the LAN, therefore, it is more important to provide a differentiation of the types of traffic (e.g., real-time traffic, such as videoconference traffic, versus non-real-time traffic) over the WAN interfaces. If prioritization of real-time traffic over non-real-time traffic does not take place, and the amount of information to be transferred across the WAN link is greater than the available bandwidth, then congestion will occur resulting in a non-selective dropping of packets. The LAN usually relies upon the excess amounts of bandwidth available to guarantee that congestion will not take place.","Accordingly, it would be desirable and highly advantageous to have way to provide a guaranteed amount of bandwidth for a videoconference session, so as to avoid undesirable effects such as, e.g., non-selective dropping of packets.","The problems stated above, as well as other related problems of the prior art, are solved by the present invention, using a method for setting up Quality of Service (QoS) contracts and traffic classification filters for videoconference sessions. The method employs time reservations in setting up the QoS contracts and the traffic classification filters. The traffic classification filters differentiate real-time traffic (videoconference traffic) from non-real-time traffic.","According to an aspect of the present invention, in a network having routing elements for routing information through the network, there is provided a method for providing an ability to set up a Quality of Service (QoS) contract for a videoconference session between clients. A reservation is received for a time period for the videoconference session. Configuration information, for filtering real-time traffic corresponding to the videoconference session from other traffic traversing the network, is sent to at least one of the routing elements after the time period is reserved.","According to another aspect of the present invention, in a network having routing elements for routing information through the network, there is provided a system for providing an ability to set up a Quality of Service (QoS) contract for a videoconference session between clients. The system includes means for receiving a reservation for a time period for the videoconference session. The system also includes means for sending configuration information, for filtering real-time traffic corresponding to the videoconference session from other traffic traversing the network, to at least one of the routing elements after the time period is reserved.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, in a network having routing elements for routing information through the network, there is provided a method for providing an ability to set up a Quality of Service (QoS) contract for a videoconference session between clients. An ability is provided to send a reservation for the videoconference session. The reservation specifies a time period for the videoconference session so that a client may participate in the videoconference session with a guaranteed level of service during the specified time period.","These and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention is directed to a method for setting up Quality of Service (QoS) contracts and traffic classification filters for videoconference sessions. The method employs time reservations in setting up the QoS contracts and the traffic classification filters. The traffic classification filters differentiate real-time traffic (videoconference traffic) from non-real-time traffic.","It is to be understood that the present invention may be implemented in various forms of hardware, software, firmware, special purpose processors, or a combination thereof.

PBNM is a technology that provides the ability to define and distribute policies to manage networks (an example network to which the present invention may be applied is described below with respect to ). These policies allow the coordinated control of critical network resources such as bandwidth and security. PBNM enables applications, such as IP based videoconferencing, that require differentiated treatment on the network. PBMN provides the basis for allowing different types of applications to co-exist on a single network and provide the required resources to each of these applications.","In further detail, PBNM defines policies for applications and users that consume network resources. For example, business critical applications can be given the highest priority and a percentage of the bandwidth on the network, videoconferencing and voice over IP can be given the next highest priority, and finally web traffic and file transfers that do not have strict bandwidth or time critical constraints can be given the remaining amount of resources on the network. This differentiation of users and applications can be accomplished using PBNM.","The videoconference system ties into a PBNM system by querying a network policy server for the policy that corresponds to the videoconference application. The videoconference server obtains the policy from the network policy server and determines the resources available in the network for videoconferencing based on the received parameters. The policy will typically correspond to, for example, the bandwidth available to this application during certain times of the day or only to certain users. The configuration is readily modified by, for example, adding, deleting, replacing, modifying, etc., policies and\/or portions thereof. As a result, the videoconference server will use the information provided in the policy to manage conferencing sessions on the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","205","210","215","220","225","240","230","235","245","250"],"i":["a","f","a","e"]},"A description will now be given of a server architecture, according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.  is a block diagram illustrating the videoconference server  of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The videoconference server  can be considered to include the following three basic entities: the database entity ; the network communications entity ; and the session management entity .","The session management entity  is responsible for managing videoconference session setup and teardown. The session management entity  also provides most of the main control for the videoconference server . The session management entity  includes a session manager  for implementing functions of the session management entity .","The network communications entity  is responsible for encapsulating the many different protocols used for the videoconference system. The protocols may include Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for remote administration and management, Common Open Policy Services (COPS) or another protocol such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for policy management, Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP) for multicast address allocation, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for videoconference session management, and Server to Server messaging for distributed videoconferencing server management. Accordingly, the network communications entity  includes: an SNMP module ; an LDAP client module ; a MADCAP client module ; a SIP module ; and a server-to-server management module . Moreover, the preceding elements -respectively communicate with the following elements: a remote administration terminal ; a network policy server (bandwidth broker) ; a MADCAP server ; desktop conferencing clients ; and other videoconferencing servers . Such communications may be implemented also using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Internet Protocol (IP), collectively represented by protocol module . It is to be appreciated that the preceding list of protocols and corresponding elements are merely illustrative and, thus, other protocols and corresponding elements may be readily employed while maintaining the spirit and scope of the present invention.","It is to be further appreciated that the architecture of the videoconference server  is also suitable for a user on a portable device to connect into the corporate infrastructure through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in order to send and receive content from a videoconference session.","The database entity  includes the following four databases: a scheduling database , an active session database , a member database , and a network architecture database .","The videoconference system server  further includes or, at the least, interfaces with, a company LDAP server (user information)  and an optional external database .

The network architecture database  includes a full mapping of the entire network. The network architecture database  includes information on each active network element (i.e., IP Routers, Ethernet switches, etc.) and information on links that connect the routers and switches together. To effectively manage the bandwidth and quality of service in the network, the videoconference server  needs to know this information.","Policy information concerning the number of videoconference sessions that are allowed to take place simultaneously, the videoconference session bit rates, and bandwidth limits can also be defined in the network architecture database . The network architecture could be represented as a weighted graph within the network architecture database . It is to be appreciated that the network architecture database  is an optional database in the videoconference server . The network architecture database  may be used to cache the policies that are requested from the policy server .","A description will now be given of the scheduling database  included in the database entity  of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The scheduling database  contains a schedule for users to reserve times to use the videoconference system. This is dependent on the policies that, for example, an Information Systems department has in place concerning the number of videoconference sessions that can take place simultaneously on certain links over the wide area network .","A description will now be given of the network communications entity  of . The network communications entity  includes: a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) module ; a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) client module ; a Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP) client module ; a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) module ; and a server-to-server management module ","A description will now be given of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) module included in the network communication entity  of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.  is a block diagram illustrating a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) client-server architecture , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The architecture  represents one implementation of the SNMP module ; however, it is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the architecture shown in  and, thus, other SNMP architectures may also be employed while maintaining the spirit and scope of the present invention. SNMP will be used for remote administration and monitoring of the videoconferencing server.","The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) client-server architecture  includes an SNMP management station  and an SNMP managed entity . The SNMP management station  includes a management application and an SNMP manager . The SNMP managed entity  includes managed resources , SNMP managed objects , and an SNMP agent . Moreover, each of the SNMP management station  and an SNMP managed entity  further include a UDP layer , an IP layer , a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer , and a physical layer .","The SNMP agent allows monitoring and administration from the SNMP management station . The SNMP agent is the client in the SNMP architecture . The SNMP agent basically takes the role of responding to requests for information and actions from the SNMP management station . The SNMP management station  is the server in the SNMP architecture . The SNMP management station  is the central entity that manages the agents in a network. The SNMP management station  serves the function of allowing an administrator to gather statistics from the SNMP agent and change configuration parameters of the SNMP agent ","Using the SNMP model, the resources in the videoconference server  can be managed by representing these resources as objects. Each object is a data variable that represents one aspect of the managed agent. This collection of objects is commonly referred to as a Management Information Base (MIB). The MIB functions as a collection of access points at the SNMP agent for the SNMP management station . The SNMP management station  is able to perform monitoring by retrieving the value of MIB objects in the SNMP agent . The SNMP management station  is also able to cause an action to take place at the SNMP agent or can change the configuration settings at the SNMP agent ","SNMP operates over the IP layer  and uses the UDP layer  for its transport protocol.","The basic messages used in the SNMP management protocol are as follows: GET; SET; and TRAP. The GET message enables the SNMP management station  to retrieve the value of objects at the SNMP agent . The SET message enables the SNMP management station  to set the value of objects at the SNMP agent . The TRAP message enables the SNMP agent to notify the SNMP management station  of a significant event.","A description will now be given of the SNMP managed resources included in the SNMP managed entity , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The remote administration could monitor and\/or control the following resources within the videoconference server : active sessions and associated statistics; session log; network policy for videoconferencing; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) parameters and statistics; and MADCAP parameters and statistics.","From the SNMP management station , the following three types of SNMP messages are issued on behalf of a management application: GetRequest; GetNextRequest; and SetRequest. The first two are variations of the GET function. All three messages are acknowledged by the SNMP agent in the form of a GetResponse message, which is passed up to the management application . The SNMP agent may also issue a trap message in response to an event that has occurred in a managed resource.","Referring again to , a description will now be given of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) client module included in the network communications entity  of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The LDAP module utilizes LDAP, which is a standard IP based protocol for accessing common directory information. LDAP defines operations for accessing and modifying directory entries such as: searching for entries meeting user-specific criteria; adding an entry; deleting an entry; modifying an entry; and comparing an entry.","A description will now be given of the Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP) client module included in the network communications entity of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The MADCAP module utilizes MADCAP, which is a protocol that allows hosts to request multicast address allocation services from multicast address allocation servers. When a videoconferencing session is setup to use multicasting services, the videoconference server  needs to obtain a multicast address to allocate to the clients in the session. The videoconference server  can dynamically obtain a multicast address from a multicast address allocation server using the MADCAP protocol.","A description will now be given of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) module included in the network communications entity  of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The SIP module utilizes SIP, which is an application layer control protocol for creating, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions with one or more participants on IP based networks. SIP is a text message based protocol.","In a SIP based videoconference system, each client and server is identified by a SIP URL. The SIP URL takes the form of user@host, which is in the same format as an email address, and in most cases the SIP URL is the user's email address.","A description will now be given of the server-to-server management module included in the network communications entity  of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The server-to-server management module utilizes messages for exchanging information between videoconference servers. The server-to-server management module is preferably utilized in a typical deployment wherein a unique videoconference server (e.g., videoconference server ) is set up locally to the network (e.g., LAN ) that it is supporting, therefore several videoconference servers may exist in a company wide network (e.g., network ). Some of the primary purposes of the messages for exchanging information include synchronizing databases and checking the availability of network resources.","The following messages are defined: QUERY\u2014query an entry in a remote server; ADD\u2014add an entry to a remote server; DELETE\u2014delete an entry from a remote server; and UPDATE\u2014update an entry on a remote server.","The server-to-server messaging can use a TCP based connection between each server. When the status of one server changes, the remaining servers are updated with the same information.","A description will now be given of operational scenarios of the videoconference server , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Initially, a description of operational scenarios corresponding to the setting up of a videoconference session is provided, followed by a description of operation scenarios corresponding to resolution and frame rate adjustment during the videoconference session. Session operational scenarios include SIP server discovery, member registration, session setup, session cancel, and session terminate.","A description will now be given of a session operational scenario corresponding to SIP server discovery, according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. A user (videoconference client application) can register with a preconfigured videoconference server (manually provisioned) or on startup by sending a REGISTER request to the well-known \u201call SIP servers\u201d multicast address \u201csip.mcast.net\u201d (224.0.1.75). The second mechanism (REGISTER request) is preferable because it would not require each user to manually configure the address of the local SIP server in their videoconference client application. In this case, the multicast addresses would need to be scoped correctly in the network to ensure that the user is registering to the correct SIP server for the videoconference. In addition to the previous methods, in another method to make the provisioning process simpler, the SIP specification recommends that administrators name their SIP servers using the sip.domainname convention (for example, sip.princeton.tce.com).","A description will now be given of a session operational scenario corresponding to member registration, according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.  is a diagram illustrating a method for registering for a videoconference session using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.

It is to be appreciated that the phrases \u201cclient application\u201d and \u201cclient\u201d are used interchangeably herein.","In the member registration function, the client  sends a SIP REGISTER request to the server  (step ). The server  receives this message and stores the IP address and the SIP URL of the client  in the member database .","The REGISTER request may contain a message body, although its use is not defined in the standard. The message body can contain additional information relating to configuration options of the client  that is registering with the server .","The server  acknowledges the registration by sending a  OK message back to the client  (step ).","Descriptions will now be given of unicast and multicast videoconference sessions, according to illustrative embodiments of the present invention.  are block diagrams respectively illustrating a unicast videoconference session and a multicast videoconference session, according to two illustrative embodiments of the present invention.

Such an approach can consume a large amount of bandwidth as more participants join the network. In contrast, in the multicast approach, only one stream is sent from each client. Thus, the multicast approach consumes less of the network resources such as bandwidth in comparison to the unicast approach.","A description will now be given of a session operational scenario corresponding to a unicast videoconference session set up, according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.  is a diagram illustrating a method for setting up a unicast videoconference session using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.

It is a more universal and efficient mechanism for terminating the session due to the lower amount of overhead associated with it.","A description will now be given of operation scenarios corresponding to resolution and frame rate adjustment, according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Videoconferencing involves transmitting live, two-way interactive video between several users at different locations on a computer network. Real-time interactive video requires transmission of large amounts of information with constrained delay. This requires that the computer network that the videoconference system is tied to must be able to provide an adequate amount of bandwidth and quality of service for each user involved in the session. Bandwidth can be a limited resource at times and quality of service cannot always be guaranteed in all networks, therefore some limitations will exist. In a private corporate network, it is possible to guarantee quality of service, but it is not always possible to guarantee large amounts of bandwidth.","The basic corporate computer network infrastructure includes several high speed local area networks (LANs) connected together through low speed links (see, e.g., ). Each of the high speed LANs usually represent the network infrastructure at a single geographical location and the low speed links are the long haul links that connect the multiple geographic locations together. The reason low speed links are used is because the cost of the long haul links are relatively high and also most of the network traffic is usually localized within a local area network, therefore large amounts of data are not usually exchanged over these long haul links.","Recent advances in quality of service over IP based networks are now providing a means for allowing other types of information to be transmitted across these networks. This opens the door for transmitting real-time information (i.e., audio and video) across the infrastructure in addition to the non-real-time data traffic. Video conferencing services that take advantage of network quality of service are well suited to overlay onto this infrastructure. It is now possible that two users at two different geographic locations can take place in a real-time videoconference session. One disadvantage of a videoconference session is that the transmission of real-time video can consume an extremely large amount of bandwidth and easily deplete available network resources. The bit rates of real-time video transmitted across a network mainly depend on the video resolutions and compression algorithms used. Typically, one videoconference session between two, three, or four users at different geographic locations can be properly supported on a network with a reasonable amount of bandwidth. However, it has been the case that, in general, additional users beyond four in a videoconference session could not be supported nor could a second videoconference session be supported due to bandwidth constraints. The limiting factors of the videoconference system are the low speed long haul links between the geographic locations.","One possible solution is to increase the bandwidth of the long haul links between the two geographic locations in order to support more users in the system. The drawback to this approach is that the bandwidth is very expensive. A second solution is to have a system where only a limited amount of users (i.e., the active users) in the videoconference session are allowed to transmit at a high resolution and high bit-rate, and the remaining users (i.e., the passive users) in the session can only transmit at a limited bit-rate and limited resolution. The videoconference session organizer will have control of which users will transmit in high resolution and which users will transmit in low resolution. If a user is not actively talking or interacting in the session, then there is no need to send their video in high resolution. Such an approach can provide a tremendous amount of savings in bandwidth.","Referring ahead to the videoconference client application  of , this approach involves having a user interface  in the videoconference client application  that supports various window sizes (i.e., different sized display windows to represent the high-resolution and low-resolution decoded video streams) and a messaging system  (included in the network entity  that, in turn, is included in the videoconference client application  of ) that specifies communication between the server  and the other client's applications. The messaging system  will include messages that control the encoding resolution and transmitting bit-rate of each of the client's applications.","A description will now be given of messages corresponding to resolution and frame rate adjustment, according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. In particular, an MSG_WINDOW_SWITCH message and a MSG_ADJUST_CODEC message will be described.","The MSG_WINDOW_SWITCH message is sent from the client to the server indicating a switch between an active user and a passive user; that is, the active user becomes passive, and the passive user becomes active.

The multimedia interface layer  includes a member database , a main control module , an audio mixer , and an echo cancellation module .","The user interface  provides the point of interaction for an end user with the videoconference client application . The user interface  is preferably but not necessarily implemented as an OS dependent module. Many graphical user interfaces are dependent on the particular OS that they are using.

It is to be appreciated that the preceding items are merely illustrative and, thus, other items in addition to or in place of some or all of the preceding items may also be kept in the member database , while maintaining the spirit and scope of the present invention. The information included in the member database  is used for controlling incoming information destined for the audio and video decoders . The media information incoming from the network needs to be routed to the correct audio and video decoders . Equally important, the media information coming from the audio and video encoders  needs to be routed to the correct unicast or multicast address for distribution. Basic information included in the member database  is also routed to the user interface  in order for the end user to be aware of the participants in the session and their capabilities. A user is added to the member database  as soon as an INVITE request is received from the videoconference server  and a user is removed as soon as a BYE request is received from the videoconference server . The member database  is flushed when a session is terminated.","A description will now be given of the main control module  included in the multimedia interface layer  of , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.","The main control module  is a very important part of the multimedia interface layer . The main control module  functions as the central management sub-system and provides the following key functions: synchronization mechanism for audio and video decoders and playback; connects destination of a decoder to screen or to file for recording purposes; and application layer Quality of Service.","The synchronization of audio and video playback is crucial for an optimal videoconferencing user experience. In order to accurately synchronize the two media streams, timestamps will need to be used and transmitted with the media content. Real Time Protocol (RTP) provides a generic header for including timestamps and sequence numbers for this purpose. The timestamps provided are NOT intended to synchronize the two network node clocks, but are intended to synchronize the audio and video streams for consistent playback. These timestamps will need to be derived from a common clock on the same node at the time of capture. For example, when a video frame is captured, the time when the video frame was captured must be recorded. The same applies to audio. Additional details and guidelines for using RTP are described elsewhere herein.","The function of the main control module  in synchronizing the audio and video is to make the connection between the network entity  and the codecs  in order for proper delivery of the metadata (including timestamps and sequence numbers) and multimedia data. If packets are late, then they can be dropped before or after decoding depending on the current conditions of the system. The RTP timestamps are subsequently used to create the presentation and playback timestamps.","The main control module  is also responsible for directing the output of the audio and video decoders  to the screen for playback, to file for recording, or to both. Each decoder  is treated independently, therefore this allows in an example situation for the output of one decoder to be displayed on the screen, the output of a second decoder to be recorded in a file, and the output from a third decoder to go both to a file and to the screen simultaneously.","In addition to the above-mentioned responsibilities, the main control module  is also involved in application layer quality of service. The main control module  gathers information regarding packet drops, bytes received and sent, and acts accordingly based on this information. This could involve sending a message to another client or to the videoconference server  to help remedy a situation that is occurring in the network.

In addition to this, functions must be provided for sending audio and video to the user interface  for display and reproduction. The network entity  interface provides functions for signaling incoming and outgoing messages for session control and security. The audio and video codecs provide a basic interface for configuration control as well as to send and receive packets for compression or decompression.","A description will now be given of the audio and video codecs , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.","There are several audio and video codecs available for use in videoconferencing. Preferably but not necessarily, the codecs employed in accordance with the present invention are software based. According to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention, H.263 is used for video compression and decompression due to the processing power constraints of typical desktop computers. As desktop computers become more powerful in the future, the ability to use a more advanced codec such as H.26L can be realized and taken advantage of. Of course, the present invention is not limited to the preceding types of codecs and, thus, other types of codecs may be used while maintaining the spirit and scope of the present invention.","A description will now be provided of the interface to the codecs , according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The description will encompass a DataIn function, callback functions, and codec options. The interface to the codecs should be flexible enough and defined in a general sense to allow interchangeability of codecs as well as to allow the addition of new codecs in the future. The proposed interface for implementing this flexible and general interface is a very simple interface with a limited number of functions provided to the user.","The DataIn function is simply used to store a frame or a packet of the encoder or decoder class.","In order to provide a simple connection between the multimedia interface layer  and the multimedia codecs , the data output function should be implemented as a callback. The multimedia interface layer  sets this callback function to the input function of the receiving entity. For example, when the codec has completed encoding or decoding a frame, this function will be called by the codec in order to deliver the intended information from the encode or decode process. Due to the constraints that the codec is not able to do anything while in this callback, this function should return as quickly as possible to prevent waiting and unnecessary delays in the system. The only additional wait that should be performed in this function should be a mutex lock when accessing a shared resource.","The range of options available to different types of codecs will vary. In order to satisfy the requirements for managing these options, a simple interface should be used. A text-based interface is preferred (but not mandated) because of the flexibility that it offers. There should be a common set of commands such as START and STOP, and then codec specific commands. This method offers a simple interface, but adds additional complexity to the codec because a simple interpreter is required. As an example, an Options function can be generic enough to read and write options.","Example: Result=Options(\u201cstart\u201d); Result=Options(\u201cresolution=CIF\u201d); etc.","For example, some of the common options between codecs should be standardized as follows: start; stop; pause; quality index (0-100); and resolution.","The quality index is a factor that describes the overall quality of the codec as a value between 0% and 100%.

It is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the preceding types of traffic classification filters and, thus, other types of traffic classification filters may be employed. That is, given the teachings of the present invention provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the related art will contemplate these and various other types of traffic classification filters and information corresponding thereto, while maintaining the spirit and scope of the present invention.","The videoconference session is conducted in accordance with the QoS contract, using the traffic classification filter to provide a guaranteed amount of bandwidth for the videoconference session (step ).","Upon the expiration of the reserved time period and date (step ), each of the routers ,  is contacted by the videoconference server  to remove the configuration information previously sent thereto (step ).","Alternatively, instead of removing the configuration information as soon as the time period has expired (per step ), the videoconference application governing the videoconference session can notify the videoconference server  when the videoconference session has finished (step ). Then, subsequent to step , step  is performed so that each of the routers ,  is contacted by the videoconference server  to remove the configuration information. This alternative can provide greater flexibility in the length of the videoconference session.","It is to be appreciated that while the method of  is described with respect to a single traffic classification filter for the videoconference session, more than one traffic classification filter can be used for a videoconference session. For example, one filter may be used to classify\/differentiate real-time traffic and another filter may be used to classify\/differentiate non-real-time traffic. Moreover, while the method of  is described with respect to routers, other routing elements of a network may also be used and thus, the present invention is not limited to simply routers. Given the teachings of the present invention provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the related art will contemplate these and various other configurations and implementations of the present invention, while maintaining the spirit and scope of the present invention.","Although the illustrative embodiments have been described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other changes and modifications may be affected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. All such changes and modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":"205"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","314"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["500","312","302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 2","FIG. 8A"],"b":["205","1","802","810"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 18A","b":"1800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 18B","FIG. 18A"],"b":["1899","1802"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 18C","FIG. 18A"],"b":["1898","1802"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1890","1804","1804"],"i":["a ","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":"2000"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":"2100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 18A"],"b":["2200","1808"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":"2300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":"2400"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":"2500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 26"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
