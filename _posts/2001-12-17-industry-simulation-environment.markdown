title: Industry simulation environment
abstract: An apparatus and method for simulating a global industrial environment. In one embodiment, the global industrial environment models a global economy as a set of interlinked economies, models a management framework as a set of interlinked management functionalities, and models both individual and organizational behaviors through a use of a set of interlinked agents. In another embodiment, operational data independent from the interlinked economies, interlinked management functionalities, and interlinked agents is customized at run-time. In another embodiment, individuals are electronically trained in a synthetic environment for analysis and simulation of a global industrial system. In this embodiment, the environment includes a virtual execution environment, a pre-exercise briefing, one or more rounds of exercise-time activity, and a post-game analysis.

Continuously expanding knowledge makes continuous learning, training, education, and consulting more important now than ever before. In the United States, an extraordinary amount of money is being spent in the area of education, and the corporate electronic learning (or e-Learning) market is expected to increase continually over the coming years.","In recent years, the concept of business war-gaming has emerged as a new source of e-Learning. Business war-gaming is the management counterpart of combat simulation, where battles are fought in marketplaces rather than battlefields, and where the main players are people and programs (manufacturers, distributors, resellers, and business customers), and jobs or organizations. Business war-gaming provides a forum for e-Learning by allowing experimentation of alternative management decision-making policies under pre-specified scenarios.","A major difference between business war-gaming and combat simulation is the technology used to build each. As opposed to the top-down, discrete event approach favored by combat simulations, business war-gaming uses bottom-up, agent-based simulation wherein software agents programmed with rules of engagement represent individuals or organizations. In this world, human players represent organizations, and the collective behavior of the individual software agents model markets and market forces.","Business war-gaming starts out today and plays into the future. It considers \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios impacted simultaneously by technological innovations, political and regulatory changes, business and economic decisions, and the evolution of consumer preferences due to social and competitive forces. By playing through those possible alternative scenarios, participants \u201cexperience the future\u201d of both\u2014the strategies as well as the results. By interacting amongst themselves in these different scenarios, the participants are able to construct accurate and robust strategies.","Recent models of business war-gaming simulations have attempted to model a global economic environment. These simulations, however, do not have a fully interlinked infrastructure that can be dynamically configured.","For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need for a global industrial simulation environment that can model interlinked economies, interlinked management functionalities, and interlinked agents that interact in the environment. There is also a need for operational data that can be easily customized in the simulation environment, so that rules of engagement can be dynamically configured.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific preferred embodiments in which the inventions may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the claims.","Overview","According to one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method and apparatus, including a computer-implemented method and apparatus, for creating a synthetic environment for analysis and simulation of a global industrial system. In one embodiment, the invention re-creates the business terrain with, for example, competitors, channels, suppliers, customers, workers, stocks, bonds, and currencies. The characteristics and capabilities of the various entities are based on current, accurate data. In addition, according to one embodiment, human beings control, or \u201cplay,\u201d key entities, such as competitors. By engaging with their competitors in a virtual domain, companies learn to anticipate the competitive reactions to their various moves, and using that information, choose the best strategy for itself. Companies use this embodiment of the present invention to introduce new products, try out different promotional or advertising strategies, and have an integrated view of the various possible options. Companies can also train their employees about the various nuances of their operations, and also to communicate the corporate vision. The methodology used by an embodiment of the present invention is called a LiveCase\u2122. LiveCases are used for strategic planning, training, education, and consulting.","One embodiment of the present invention creates a distributed, interactive, and real-time environment for conducting large-scale experiments and simulations in areas where interactions among agents need to be studied. There are two types of agents that interact with each other and with other elements of the real-time environment: human (or live) agents and artificial (or virtual) agents. Human agents represent people acting as buyers, sellers, regulators, and intermediaries. Artificial agents are intelligent software agents that mimic human actors in a problem domain. The real-time environment is dynamically configurable, and is structured around the interplay of human decisions and game events that require active involvement of participants. In this fashion, this embodiment of the present invention provides a forum for e-Learning in a simulated environment by providing an environment for business war-gaming that seamlessly incorporates all aspects of managerial decision-making to provide a complete and integrated view of economies, industries, and organizations.","One embodiment of the present invention provides business war-gaming simulation in a distributed computing environment that is robust and fault-tolerant. It employs networking, collaboration, data-warehousing and knowledge management technologies, and also genetic algorithms to allow re-configurable systems. One customizes the framework and rules of engagement (such as organizational behavior rules, trading rules, regulatory constraints, and foreign policy) to a user's exact needs using a high-level interface, and dynamically alter them during a LiveCase exercise.","On an economic level, an embodiment of the present invention models the global economy as a collection of interlinked economies, and each economy is governed independently. It models an arbitrarily large number of configurable and interlinked goods, services, stock, bond, labor, currency, and intellectual property markets. Production and demand processes can be arbitrarily complex and can be plugged in seamlessly. Features of the government, including the legislative, executive, and judicial branches are incorporated into the system, as well as external and environmental variables pertaining to technical change, growth, or societal shifts.","On an organizational level, an embodiment of the present invention accommodates arbitrarily large numbers of human and artificial agents that play in the same setting, and provides high-level decision making and analytical tools to every participant. Teams collaborate internally by sharing various decision-making functions across several different entities, and a highly evolved visualization and decision support system allows human players to rapidly assimilate and use large quantities of real-time information. The artificial agent technology is based on research into computational models of human behavior, and thousands of artificial agents can populate the environments and behave like fine segments of the customer, labor, or asset markets. Over time, the accumulated database of previous simulations allows leverage of the artificial agents and forecasting of behavior in critical situations.","On a management level, an embodiment of the present invention supports a full complement of management functionalities such as strategy, operations, marketing, finance, and human resources. One configures the environment to model any firm, in any industry, in any economy, at any level of detail. The environment also incorporates quantitative and qualitative relationships that are calibrated using actual data, and the environment can be updated in real-time as new data emerges either in the real world or in the simulation.","On an operational data level, an embodiment of the present invention provides data storage capabilities that are separate, and independent, from the functionalities of the run-time environment. That is, all functionalities at the economic, organizational, and management levels are separate from the data storage capabilities that support these functionalities. This provides an asynchronous environment in which customized information (including data, behaviors, scenarios, rules, and content) is used to change the operating functionality at run-time.","In summary, the software processes and interfaces of various different embodiments of the present invention replicate every essential aspect of running a modern company, including marketing, production, distribution, finance, accounting, human resources, quantitative methods, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic planning, and allow teams of human players to work with any combination of these activities.","Run-Time Simulation and the Virtual Execution Environment","One embodiment of the present invention provides war-gaming simulation in a run-time virtual execution environment (VEE).  is a block diagram illustrating a virtual execution environment of a computerized system in an embodiment of the present invention. The computational infrastructure allows the environment to include a series of one or more application servers to comprise a distributed system. The distributed system may include Active Server Pages, Java Server Pages, Enterprise Java Beans, Simple Java Classes, or Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents. As shown as an example in , computerized system  includes VEE . VEE  includes application servers  through . VEE , however, may include any number of one or more application servers in the distributed environment. In addition, there may be different classes of application servers, such as Agent Processing Servers, Economic Processing Servers, and Visualization Servers, in various different embodiments of the invention. Agent Processing Servers would be capable of running hundreds of thousands of different kinds of agents. Economic Processing Servers would be capable of representing different types of economic markets. Finally, Visualization Servers would be capable of generating advanced three-dimensional displays of data used during the simulation(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","101","102","20","100","110","120","130","110","120","130","120","130","20","140","100","140","110","120","130","100","140","20","140","100","140","150","160","170","180","190"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","100","140","200","100","140","200","100","140","200","100","100","200","140","140","100","200","100","140","200","210","220","230","240","250"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","110","120","130","110","110","120","120","130","120","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["260","260","330","340","350","360","370","310","320","260","310","320","270","290","270","290","310","320","330","370","270","280","290","300","310","311","320","321"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["310","320","310","311","312","310","310","311","312","321","322","320"]},"Software Interface Classes","The software environment is highly re-configurable.  is a block diagram illustrating an example of a software architecture of the virtual execution environment and a series of interface classes that are implemented in an embodiment of the present invention. On the VEE for this embodiment, there are three classes of active software objects called \u201cbots.\u201d VEE  shows ServBots , SysBots , and DataBots . ServBots  are autonomous agents that perform the business tasks. Examples of ServBots are BuyBot (agents that perform buying functions), SellBot, AcquireBot, ProduceBot, etc. ServBots  also function as an Application Programming Interface (API) for third-party game development. SysBots  are autonomous agents that perform system-level. Each ServBot includes SysBots that are individually replaceable. Inititate SysBots are the sensors for a given ServBot. When certain conditions are met, they trigger action from the ServBot. Search SysBots make the ServBots intelligent. With a Search SysBot, each ServBot can autonomously search the state space for an appropriate action in its specified domain. Evaluate SysBots enable the ServBot to evaluate different alternatives and select the most appropriate course of action. Execute SysBots execute the course of action need by the ServBot. Communicate SysBots have the knowledge of the work flow and the chain of command. After the action is taken, these bots communicate the appropriate message\/information to the appropriate parties. Update SysBots update the relevant information\/data at the appropriate times. These bots are critical for the system performance. Terminate SysBots are quality assurance bots that make sure that the tasks are completed satisfactorily.","The example embodiment of  also shows DataBots  that are developed to interface with enterprise systems so that firms can seamlessly integrate with the VEE to explore new strategy spaces or as a wind tunnel of corporate strategies. These DataBots  interact with the Data Base and Data Objects  for their data needs using Middleware . VEE  interacts with, and is operatively coupled to, re-configurable interface classes . Interface classes  includes eight different types of classes. These classes are Ticker , Display , System Control , Local Control , Global Control , User , Role , and Feedback . ServBots , SysBots , and DataBots  are dynamically assembled for each of these interface classes based on a participant's profiles, or on demand. This architecture provides the necessary flexibility to adapt the simulation environment to a wide variety of problem domains.","Game Play","The simulations can run anywhere from a few hours, to days, to a continuously running global game over the Internet. Shorter versions of the game consist of three distinct steps: pre-exercise briefing, exercise-time activity, and post-exercise analysis. These simulations are used for electronically training individuals in a synthetic environment for analysis and simulation of a global industrial system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"520"},"During the exercise-time activity , several rounds are played. Each round may represent a month, a quarter, or a year. The scenarios can be changed dynamically within an exercise. For example, depending upon the level of customization, regulations can be changed to reflect different options being considered by various local, national, and international regulatory authorities; the pace of technical progress can be altered; economic growth and the rate environment factors can be changed; staffing and service levels can be changed; and new products and competitors are introduced into various markets. Participants would have to respond to the changes in the environment by altering their current strategies or by devising new ones. The underlying market captures every move a player makes and generates the prices, quantities, market shares, revenue to expense ratios, and returns on investment and equity, exactly as they are determined in real life. The outcomes in these scenarios are available for post-game analysis.","The post-game analysis  is the most crucial and fun part of the simulation and experiential learning methodology since a significant part of the learning happens there. It is a team effort conducted using group dynamics and techniques. Senior executives with substantial business experience, the players, the consultants, the business professors and the students, and people with extensive experience will conduct these sessions. The strategies devised and tested, the idiosyncrasies of the markets and other lessons learned, are then formalized.","Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown.
