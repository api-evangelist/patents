{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED PATENT APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/190,933, entitled, \u201cMethod And System For Secure PIN Digit Retrieval,\u201d filed Sep. 4, 2008, the complete disclosure of which is hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates generally to payment card security, and more particularly to methods and systems for disclosing a personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d) associated with a financial account to an account holder and for allowing the account holder to set or modify the PIN.","With the explosion of electronic commerce and digital personal information, facilitated by the rapid growth of the Internet, focus has been placed on the protection of financial and personal data. One element in protecting these data is encryption. Encryption is the process of converting information into an unintelligible form except to holders of a specific cryptographic key. By encrypting the information, it is protected against unauthorized disclosure.","Encryption is accomplished through a cryptographic algorithm. The algorithm is used to \u201clock\u201d the information at one point and \u201cunlock\u201d it at another. Keys are used to lock and unlock the information. In a secret-key or symmetric key encryption, the same key is used to lock and unlock (encrypt and decrypt) the information. In public key or asymmetric key encryption, a public key is used to encrypt the information and a private key is used to decrypt the information. A key is often a numerical value. The length of the key generally determines the relative security of the key.","Many types of information use encryption. One example is the payment card industry, including credit card data and other financial information. Indeed, the credit card industry had taken great steps to ensure that financial data and transaction data is protected. For example, cardholder data must be encrypted when it is stored or transmitted over a public network. This requirement covers everything from producing the credit cards, including information stored on the magnetic strip or embedded chip on the card, to authenticating and authorizing transactions made with the card. One key piece of data that must be encrypted is a user's personal identification number (PIN).","Financial institutions employ Internet web sites to support customer transactions and account access. A customer can log into the web site and select links to navigate to web pages having content associated with the account. The customer can also complete certain transactions, such as transfers between multiple accounts and bill payments.","Financial institutions also employ interactive voice response (IVR) applications to support customer transactions. Typically, a customer will call a telephone number for the system. An automated system will provide recorded instructions to the user, such as, \u201cfor inquiries about a checking account, press 1.\u201d The customer uses the number key pad on a telephone to select menu items and enter alphanumeric data, such as an account number.","However, one option that is not available to customers using an Internet web site or an IVR application is for the customer to access a PIN or password associated with an account while providing a secure platform for the information. Current standards and best practices require that a PIN remain encrypted at all times, excepting when the PIN is in a hardware security module (\u201cHSM\u201d) or in a PIN mailer that is mailed to the customer when the customer opens an account or requests a new PIN. If a customer forgets a PIN associated with a financial card, such as a credit or debit card, the conventional solution is to generate a new PIN and mail the new PIN to the customer in a PIN mailer. This process is expensive and leaves the card unusable until the new PIN is received by the customer. With the advent of computers and online banking, such delay is unacceptable and frustrating to the customer. This process also leads to confusion as customers frequently forget that a new PIN has been issued and continue to attempt to use the old PIN, leading to even further administrative expense.","Accordingly, systems and methods are needed to provide customers with quick and secure access to a PIN associated with a financial account. Another need exists for systems and methods for allowing an account holder to quickly set or modify the PIN.","The present invention provides systems and methods for disclosing a personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d) associated with a financial account to an account holder and for allowing the account holder to set or modify the PIN. A PIN reveal application can interact with a hardware security module (\u201cHSM\u201d) to decrypt and disclose the PIN to the account holder one or more PIN character(s) at a time. A PIN set application can interact with the HSM to encrypt PIN characters received by the PIN set application from the account holder. The HSM can include a combination of hardware and software that provides a secure platform to encrypt and decrypt a PIN. An account holder can use a web browser interface or an interactive voice response (\u201cIVR\u201d) interface to retrieve or set a PIN in a secure manner.","One aspect of the present invention provides a method for disclosing a PIN associated with an account. The method includes the steps of: (a) receiving a request to disclose a PIN, the PIN including PIN characters stored in an encrypted form; (b) requesting with a PIN application executing on a computer a decrypted form of one of the PIN characters from an HSM; (c) receiving, at the PIN application, the decrypted form of the one PIN character; (d) outputting the decrypted form of the one PIN character, and (e) repeating steps (b) through (d) for each PIN character, wherein a previously requested PIN character is deleted from the PIN application prior to requesting another PIN character.","Another aspect of the invention provides a system for disclosing a PIN associated with a transaction account. A user interface can process a request for disclosure of a portion of the PIN in an unencrypted form, the PIN including PIN characters stored in an encrypted data element. A PIN module, logically coupled to the user interface and to an HSM, is operable to decrypt the encrypted data element. The PIN module can receive the request for disclosure from the user interface and interact with the HSM to decrypt the portion of the PIN and provide the decrypted portion for presentation via the user interface.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for setting a PIN of an account. The method includes the steps of (a) providing a user interface for a user to enter characters for including in the PIN; (b) receiving the characters entered at the user interface at a PIN application; (c) storing the received characters on a secure platform; (d) encrypting the received characters into an encrypted PIN data element comprising the PIN; and (e) transmitting the encrypted PIN data element to a card processing system. Each PIN character can be received by the user interface separately. The characters received at the user interface can be deleted prior to receiving any additional characters at the user interface.","These and other aspects, objects, features, and embodiments of the invention will become apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments exemplifying the best mode for carrying out the invention as presently perceived.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are provided. These embodiments include systems and methods for disclosing a secure personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d) associated with a financial account to an account holder and for allowing the account holder to set or modify the PIN. A PIN reveal application can interact with a hardware security module (\u201cHSM\u201d) to decrypt and disclose the PIN to the account holder one or more PIN character(s) at a time. A PIN set application can interact with the HSM to encrypt PIN characters received by the PIN set application from the account holder. The HSM can include a combination of hardware and software that provides a secure platform to encrypt and decrypt a PIN. The HSM may also provide validation for a received PIN. An account holder can use a web browser interface or an interactive voice response (\u201cIVR\u201d) interface to retrieve or set a PIN in a secure manner.","The invention can include one or more computer programs that embody the functions described herein and illustrated in the appended flow charts. However, it should be apparent that there could be many different ways of implementing aspects of the invention in computer programming, and these aspects of the invention should not be construed as limited to any one set of computer instructions. Further, a skilled programmer would be able to write such computer programs to implement an embodiment of the disclosed invention based on the flow charts and associated description in the application text. Therefore, disclosure of a particular set of program code instructions is not considered necessary for an adequate understanding of how to make and use the invention. The inventive functionality of the claimed invention will be explained in more detail in the following description read in conjunction with the figures illustrating the program flow. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more stages described may be performed by hardware, software, or a combination thereof, as may be embodied in one or more computing systems.","Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like elements throughout the figures, aspects of the exemplary embodiments are described in detail.  is a block diagram depicting a system architecture  in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. Referring to , the system architecture  includes a PIN application server  having a PIN reveal application  and a PIN set application . The PIN applications  and  are typically implemented by software modules that reside in a computer-readable memory storage device of a programmed computing device (e.g., PIN application server ) and can be executed by a processor via computer readable memory. The PIN applications  and  can comprise application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) that interact with a user, such as an account holder, via a user interface provided by a Web\/IVR interface server . The user interface can be provided by the Web\/IVR interface server  to a user device, such as mobile phone , computer , or kiosk . The PIN applications  and  can also interact with one or more HSMs, such as HSM  that the PIN application server  is connected to.","The HSM  is typically implemented as a combination of hardware and software modules embodied in a HSM server  having a computer readable storage medium for storing the software modules and a processor for executing the software modules. In certain exemplary embodiments, the HSM  may be embodied as software alone. The HSM  provides a secure platform to generate, store, and protect cryptographic keys. The HSM  component provides a secure platform to encrypt and decrypt account holder information, such as a PIN. The HSM  can include software code or hardware modules that allow the HSM to interact with the PIN reveal application  and the PIN set application .","The PIN reveal application  securely provides an account holder with a PIN associated with an account of the account holder. Current standards and best practices require that PINs associated with financial accounts are stored at a payment processor, such as card processing server , in an encrypted form. Typically, these PINs are stored in encrypted PIN blocks that can also include other account related information. The PINs, in their entirety, must remain encrypted at all times, excepting when the PIN is stored in an HSM  or in a PIN mailer that is mailed to the account holder. The PIN reveal application  provides a means for disclosing a PIN to an account holder by storing only a portion (typically, one PIN character) of the PIN in a decrypted format at a given time and disclosing only that portion to the account holder. The portion of PIN characters disclosed at a given time can include any number of PIN characters less than the entirety of the PIN to remain compliant. In certain exemplary embodiments, the PIN reveal application  operates to reveal the entire PIN, one PIN character at a time. In certain exemplary embodiments, the PIN reveal application  operates to reveal only a portion of the entire PIN, one character at time. For example, the PIN reveal application  may operate as a \u201cmemory jogger\u201d by only revealing up to the first two or three characters of the PIN, one character at a time. Although conventional financial account PINs typically include four numerical PIN characters, the PIN reveal application  can be adapted to reveal PINs having any number of characters or symbols and is not limited to just numerical characters. The PIN reveal application  is described in more detail below with reference to .","The PIN set application  allows an account holder to set or modify a PIN associated with an account. The PIN set application  can interact with the user via a user interface provided by the Web\/IVR interface server  to receive a PIN from the account holder one or more characters at a time. The PIN set application  can also interact with the HSM  to encrypt the PIN into an encrypted PIN block and send the encrypted PIN block to the card processing server  for storage in the PIN block repository . The PIN set application  is described in more detail below with reference to .","The Web\/IVR interface server  is connected to a network , such as the Internet or a telephone network. The Web\/IVR interface server  provides secure access between an account holder and a financial account, such as a bank account or credit card account. The Web\/IVR interface server  can include a web server application (not shown) that provides a user interface to the account holder in the form of an Internet web site (not shown). The web site can be provided via the network  (e.g., the Internet) to a user device having a web browser, such as mobile phone , computer , kiosk , or any other device having a web browser. The web site can provide secure access using a secure cryptographic network communication protocol, such as transport layer security (\u201cTLS\u201d) or secure sockets layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) protocols or the like. The PIN reveal application  and the PIN set application  can interact with the web site to provide a PIN to or receive a PIN from the account holder in a secure manner.","Additionally, or alternatively, the Web\/IVR interface server  can include an IVR application (not shown) that provides an automated user interface to the account holder via a telephone, such a mobile phone , or a conventional touch-tone telephone (not shown). The IVR application can solicit information (e.g., account number, password, etc.) and requests (e.g., available balance) from the account holder, typically by using a pre-recorded audio based menu. The IVR application can receive information and requests from the account holder in the form of speech or telephone touchtone keypad entries and decode this speech or tones representing the keypad entries. The IVR application can respond to requests using pre-recorded audio or a speech synthesizing application (not shown). In an IVR embodiment, the network  can comprise a cellular telephone network, a public-switched telephone network, the Internet (e.g., voice over Internet protocol) or any other telephone network. The PIN reveal application  and the PIN set application  can interact with the IVR application to provide a PIN to or receive a PIN from the account holder in a secure manner.","The Web\/IVR server  is connected to the card processing server . The card processing server  supports financial transactions involving an account for an account holder. For example, the card processing server  may authorize transactions for an account, such as a debit card account linked to a specific bank account, a pre-paid debit card, a credit card, or a retail card. Part of this process may be to verify a PIN supplied by an account holder in connection with a transaction. These cards may have a specific PIN or other security feature.","The card processing server  can store information associated with financial accounts, such as account number, balance, transaction history, or any other account information that may be used to authorize transactions or that an account holder may request. As discussed above, the card processing server  can also store a PIN for the account in a PIN block repository . For security purposes, the PIN can be stored in an encrypted PIN block. Typically, the PIN block includes the PIN and at least a portion of the account number.","Although the Web\/IVR interface server , the PIN application server , the HSM server , and the card processing server  are illustrated in  and described herein as being servers, one skilled in the art would appreciate that these servers could be embodied as various other types of computing devices, such as workstation and mainframe computers. Additionally, the connections between these servers may be implemented using a computer network, such as a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) or a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["200","205","140","140","110","140","105","140","140","140","170"]},"In step , the account holder makes a request at the user interface to view or hear a PIN associated with an account, such as a financial account. In an Internet web site embodiment, the account holder may use a pointing device to click on a link or tab displayed on a web page associated with the account. In an IVR embodiment, the account holder may press a key pad on the mobile phone  that corresponds with a \u201cRequest PIN\u201d selection.","In step , the Web\/IVR interface server  determines whether any additional security measures are required for the account holder to receive the PIN. This determination can be based on a status of the account holder or on the type of account that the PIN is associated with. Alternatively, all account holders and all account types may require additional security. If additional security is required, the method  proceeds to step . If no additional security is required, the method proceeds to step .","In step , the account holder is authenticated based on the additional security measures. The user interface may prompt the account holder for additional security information, such as a card verification value (\u201cCVV\u201d) number printed on a card associated with the account. The Web\/IVR interface server  may then compare information received from the account holder to account information stored at the Web\/IVR interface server  to authenticate the account holder. Alternatively, the Web\/IVR interface server  may send the information to a card processing server  for authentication. Step  is described in more detail below with reference to .","In step , the user interface proceeds to a secure Internet web page in an Internet embodiment or to a PIN reveal menu in an IVR embodiment. In an Internet embodiment, the web page for revealing a PIN to the account holder may include masked characters corresponding to characters of the PIN. The account holder can select the PIN characters to request that that PIN character be displayed on the web site. In an IVR embodiment, the PIN reveal menu may prompt the user to select which PIN character to reveal using a telephone keypad.","In step , the Web\/IVR interface server  requests an encrypted PIN block for the account from a card processing server  that stores the PIN block. In certain exemplary embodiments, whereby the card processing server  authenticates the account holder, the Web\/IVR interface server  may send a request for the encrypted PIN block with the additional security information obtained in step  to the card processing server . Thus, the Web\/IVR interface server  does not have to send two separate requests to the card processing server  to obtain the PIN block.","In step , the card processing server  sends the PIN block to the Web\/IVR interface server . In step , the Web\/IVR interface server  makes a call to a PIN reveal application  at a PIN application server  and sends the PIN block to the PIN reveal application .","In step , the PIN reveal application  sends the PIN block to an HSM  at an HSM server  and the HSM  stores the PIN block in memory.","In step , the PIN reveal application  requests one character of the PIN from the HSM . In certain exemplary embodiments, the requested character may be based on an input received at the user interface from the account holder. For example, with reference to an exemplary screen image of a user interface  provided in , each PIN character A-D may initially be masked using an asterisk or other symbol. The account holder can use a mouse or other pointing device to move a cursor  and select (e.g., click on or hover over) one of the masked characters to generate a request for that PIN character. In the screen image, the account holder has selected the first PIN character A having a value of 5. The other PIN characters B-D remain masked.","In IVR embodiments, the account holder can request a PIN character by pressing a key on a telephone keypad corresponding to one of the PIN characters. For example, the IVR may prompt the account holder to select PIN character one by pressing a \u201c1\u201d key on the telephone keypad.","In certain embodiments, the PIN characters may not be selectable by the user. Instead, the PIN characters may be requested from the HSM  sequentially.","In step , the HSM  decrypts the PIN block and returns the one requested PIN character to the PIN reveal application . That is, the decryption takes place on a secure platform. In step , the PIN reveal application  provides the received PIN character to the Web\/IVR interface server  and the user interface of the Web\/IVR interface server  reveals the PIN character to the account holder. In an Internet embodiment, the PIN character may be displayed on a web page. In an IVR embodiment, the PIN character may be communicated to the account holder using a pre-recorded message.","In step , the Web\/IVR interface server  determines whether to stop providing the PIN character to the account holder. Continuing the Internet example from step , if the account holder deselects the PIN character A, the web page can re-mask the PIN character A. The Web\/IVR interface server  can also determine to stop providing the PIN character based on a time period. For example, the Web\/IVR interface server  can stop providing the PIN character based on a period of inactivity. In an IVR embodiment, the PIN character may be verbalized a single time. If the Web\/IVR interface server  determines to stop providing the PIN character, the method  proceeds to step . Otherwise, the method  returns to step  to continue providing the PIN character.","In step , the PIN reveal application  and the Web\/IVR interface server  delete the previously displayed (or verbalized) PIN character. The PIN character can be deleted at both servers by overwriting memory used to temporarily store the PIN character with random data or by any other suitable means for clearing computer memory.","In step , the PIN reveal application  determines whether to request another PIN character from the HSM . For example, the account holder may request each PIN character, one at a time, until the entire PIN has been revealed via the user interface, one character at a time. Or, in the alternative, the PIN reveal application  may operate to request the remaining PIN characters in sequential fashion until each character is presented via the user interface, one character at a time. In another example, the PIN reveal application  may limit the account holder to retrieving a portion of the entire PIN only, such as the first two PIN characters, one character at a time. If another PIN character is requested, the method  returns to step . Otherwise, the method  proceeds to step .","In step , the HSM  deletes the PIN block from memory. Although this step is not necessary for security or compliance purposes, the HSM  can free the memory for other purposes. After step , the method  ends. Of course, the Web\/IVR interface server  may continue to interact with the account holder as necessary to complete the account holder's service.","Although the method  for providing an account holder with a PIN has been described in terms of presenting an account holder with a PIN, one character at a time, the method  can be adapted to present more than one PIN character at a time. For example, conventional financial account PINs typically include four numerical characters. Based on current standards and best practices prohibiting the storage of a decrypted PIN in its entirety outside of an HSM  or a PIN mailer, the method  could be adapted to present one, two, or three of the four PIN characters at a time via the user interface. However, displaying multiple characters can present security risks. For example, if a \u201chacker\u201d or packet sniffing program somehow gains access to the communication between the PIN reveal application  and the user interface, the hacker could access half or more of the account holder's PIN leaving only one or two PIN characters to resolve. If the PIN comprises a common pattern, such as \u201c1-2-3-4\u201d and the characters 1 and 2 are revealed, the hacker could easily determine the remaining PIN characters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","305","140","305","205"]},"In step , the account holder makes a request at the user interface to set or modify a PIN associated with an account, such as a financial account. In an Internet web site embodiment, the account holder may use a pointing device to click on a link or tab displayed on a web page associated with the account. For example, the account holder may use a mouse coupled to computer  to click the link or tab. In an IVR embodiment, the account holder may press a key pad on mobile phone  that corresponds with a \u201cSet PIN\u201d selection.","In step , the Web\/IVR interface server  determines whether any additional security measures are required for the account holder to receive the PIN. This determination can be based on a status of the account holder or on the type of account that the PIN is associated with.

The Web\/IVR interface server  may then compare information received from the account holder to account information stored at the Web\/IVR interface server  to authenticate the account holder. Alternatively, the Web\/IVR interface server  may send the information to a card processing server  for authentication. Step  may be substantially similar to that of step  described in detail below with reference to .","In step , the Web\/IVR interface server  makes a call to a PIN set application  at a PIN application server  and sends account information to the PIN set application . The account information can include any information that is included in a PIN block, such as an account number associated with the account. The account information may be stored at the Web\/IVR interface server . Alternatively, the account information may be stored at a card processing server  and the Web\/IVR interface server  may retrieve the account information from the card processing server  prior to sending the account information to the PIN set application .","In step , the PIN set application  sends the account information to an HSM  at an HSM server  along with a request to initialize a new PIN block for the account. The HSM  creates a new PIN block for the account and waits for PIN characters from the PIN set application .","In step , the PIN set application  calls the user interface of the Web\/IVR interface server  to prompt the account holder for a PIN character. In an Internet embodiment, an Internet web site provided by the Web\/IVR interface server  may provide a web page having a text entry box for entering a PIN character. In an IVR embodiment, an IVR application at the Web\/IVR interface server  may prompt the account holder for a PIN character using a pre-recorded message.","In step , the account holder provides the PIN set application  with a PIN character via the user interface of the Web\/IVR interface server . In the Internet embodiment of step , the account holder can enter a character into the text entry box using a keyboard coupled to the computer . In the IVR embodiment of step , the account holder can press a key on a mobile phone  keypad corresponding to the PIN character that the account holder selects.","In step , the PIN set application  receives the PIN character from the user interface and sends the received PIN character to the HSM . After sending the PIN character to the HSM , in step , the PIN set application  deletes the PIN character. In certain exemplary embodiments, the PIN set application  immediately deletes the PIN character after sending to the HSM.","In step , the PIN set application  determines if all PIN characters have been received by the HSM . If all PIN characters have been received, the method  proceeds to step . If there are additional PIN characters that are required from the account holder, the method returns to step  to request another PIN character.","In step , the HSM  validates the received PIN comprising the received PIN characters. That is, the HSM  determines if the PIN is a weak PIN or a strong PIN. This validation may be completed by comparing the received PIN to a list of PINs that are identified as \u201cweak PINS.\u201d For example, the PIN \u201c1-2-3-4\u201d may be classified as \u201cweak.\u201d The HSM  may then send a message to the PIN set application  to request that the account holder provide a new PIN. This validation step necessarily takes place before the PIN is encrypted. By having the HSM  perform this validation, the PIN is stored at a secure location, rather than on a server that could be vulnerable to security breaches.","In step , the HSM  encrypts the PIN characters into the PIN block created in step .
