title: Systems and methods for application programming interfaces for shipping services
abstract: Systems and methods provide shipping services information. In one implementation, a method is provided in which an e-commerce server receives a request for shipping information from an end-user. The e-commerce server generates an extensible markup language (XML) request based on the requested shipping information and sends the XML request to an application programming interface (API) server. The API server determines, based on the XML request, one of a plurality of API modules stored in the API server to process the XML request and generates an XML response based on data included in the XML request. The API server sends the XML response to the e-commerce server, which sends the XML response to the end-user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/344,992, filed Dec. 9, 2003, now abandoned which is a national stage filing under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 of PCT International Application No. PCT\/US01\/26656, filed Aug. 27, 2001, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/227,903, filed Aug. 25, 2000, by Stuart Willoughby and entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES FOR SHIPPING SERVICES, the entire disclosure of which is all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to providing an internet customer with information relative to shipping services using application programming interfaces (\u201cAPI's\u201d or \u201cWeb Tools API\u201d) supplied by the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d). The API's are designed to allow electronic commerce (\u201ce-commerce entities\u201d) to generate requests and to send them over the network to servers for access to USPS shipping information. E-commerce entities may include multi-carriers, electronic retailers (\u201ce-tailers\u201d), electronic shopping malls, auction houses, or third party vendors that buy in broker services over a network. The network is preferably the Internet; however, any type of network known to those skilled in the art may be used.","2. Background of the Invention","Currently, a person desiring to send a package to a recipient may take the package to a mailing point where she is provided information about the various shipping options and costs of shipping. The person selects a shipping option, pays the mailer for the cost of shipping, receives a label that is applied to the package, and the package is then placed into a mail stream. One such example of a mail stream is the mail stream provided by the USPS. Alternatively, a person may contact a mailing company. The mailing company provides to the person information about the various shipping options and costs of shipping. The person selects a shipping option, pays the mailing company for the cost of shipping, and gives the package to a mailer associated with the mailing company. The mailer then generates a label and applies it to the package. Thereafter, the mailer places the package into the mail stream. Either way, the person must wait to be informed of the cost of mailing the package and\/or wait to pay for the mailing label before the package may be sent.","With the advent of e-commerce, electronic shoppers (\u201ce-shoppers\u201d) may make purchases from e-commerce entities over the network. It is advantageous to the e-commerce entities to have e-shoppers to stay on their web sites and buy more items, instead of having to make separate arrangements for receiving information for shipping or returning a purchased item. It is advantageous to the e-shoppers to have the ability to receive shipping labels electronically for application to a packaged item or to request that an e-commerce entity package and ship a purchased item.","It is accordingly an object of an embodiment of the invention to provide e-commerce entities with access to USPS shipping services information. The e-commerce entities may in turn provide such information to e-shoppers, thereby allowing e-shoppers to request and receive information about the various shipping options and the cost of mailing an item. In addition, the e-shoppers may purchase mailing labels, delivery confirmation labels, or request merchandise return labels. The shipping options may include services such as Express Mail\u00ae, Priority Mail\u00ae, and Parcel Posts\u2122, etc. The shipping services information may include domestic and international postal rates, service standards, addressing information, mailing labels, merchandise return labels, delivery confirmation labels, etc.","This is achieved by providing to e-commerce entities a collection of API's, which provide access to servers having USPS shipping information. The servers may include, for example, one or more USPS servers. These API's may be coded in a language which is independent of operating system and hardware implementation. Preferably, the API's are implemented in Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d); however, they are not limited to language and could be written in any programming language known to those skilled in the art.","An e-commerce entity may utilize the API's to make a request to a USPS server over the network for shipping information. For convenience, the USPS server will be referred to herein as the \u201cWeb Tools API Server.\u201d The Web Tools API server receives the request, generates a response to the request, and sends the response over the network to the e-commerce entity. The response may include the requested shipping information.","In accordance with the invention, systems and methods are disclosed for providing shipping services information over a network by providing instructions to a first server from a second server which permits the first server to access the shipping services information residing on the second server over the network. The first server receives a request from a client for the shipping services information residing on the second server. Thereafter, the second server provides the requested shipping services information from the second server to the client through the first server.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.","Reference will now be made in detail to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. For convenience, an e-shopper will be described herein as an \u201cend-user.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","110","120","130","150","100","140","160","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["101","120","130","101","225","217","200","220","230","200","205","210","215"]},"Operation of end-user\/client system  is generally controlled and coordinated by operating system software .

Optionally, the Web Tools API server system  may communicate with one or more tracking servers  over network  through network interface module  to request and receive information from one or more tracking databases .","In one example, an e-commerce entity may make a request to an API provider for one or more API modules in the Web Tools API suite. The API provider may include, for example, the USPS. The e-commerce entity registers with the API provider and receives a username and password for connecting to a Web Tools API Server . The API provider may send the requested API modules to the e-commerce entity by any known delivery method. For example, the API provider may send the requested API modules by an email, or by placing the API modules on a CD or floppy disk and mailing them to the e-commerce entity. In another example, the API provider may access an API server module  on a Web Tools API server  to send the requested API modules over a network  to an e-commerce server  specified by the e-commerce entity. Thereafter, the e-commerce entity may integrate the API modules with its application software on one or more e-commerce servers  to generate Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) requests to the Web Tools API server  for shipping information. The API modules may provide for processing multiple requests within a single transaction.","Once the API modules are integrated with application software of an e-commerce server , an end-user  may access the e-commerce server  over a network  through a client system  and make a request for information, for example, a request for a merchandise return label. E-commerce server  generates an XML request based on the request from the end-user. Thereafter, ecommerce server  sends the request to the Web Tools API server . Web Tools API server  receives the request and calls an appropriate standard API module  to processes the request. Once the request is processed, Web Tools API server  sends an XML response back to e-commerce server . E-commerce server  may send the XML response back to the end-user at client system  through network . If e-commerce server  detects an error condition in the XML response, it may notify the end-user of the error condition. Otherwise, e-commerce server  retrieves the requested information from the XML response and sends it to the end-user, in this example, the merchandise return label is sent to the end-user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["120","130","120","101","300","120","310","285","120"]},"Next, e-commerce server  may make a network connection to a Web Tools API server  (stage ). The USPS may provide to an e-commerce entity example integration source code that may be used by an e-commerce server  to connect to a Web Tools API server .","Thereafter, e-commerce server  sends the XML request to a Web Tools API server  through network  (stage ). The Web Tools API server  receives the XML request and determines, based on the XML request, which API within the standard API modules  to call to process the request. Next, API server module  calls the applicable API in the standard API modules  to process the request, and sends an XML response to the e-commerce server  through network . E-commerce server  receives the XML response from the Web Tools API server  through network  (stage ). The XML response may include one or more tags that specify a type for the response, and one or more tags that include the requested information. The format of an XML response for each API is described below in detail.","E-commerce server  determines, based on the XML response, whether an error occurred during the processing of the XML request by the Web Tools API server  (stage ). If an error occurred (\u201cYes\u201d), e-commerce server  generates an error status, based on the XML response, and sends it to client system  through network  (stage ). Client system  may display the error status to the end-user through browser software module . Otherwise (\u201cNo\u201d), e-commerce server  may generate a reply response, based on the XML response, and send it to client system  through network  (stage ). Client system  may display the reply response to the end-user through browser software module  or user interface module .

E-commerce server  may provide to the end-user, based on information supplied by the end-user, a list of items that were purchased. The end-user may select from the list one or more items to return. For purposes of this example, the end-user selects a single item. Thereafter, e-commerce server  may determine whether the end-user has permission to return the selected item, and if so, whether the item requires insurance for shipping. If the end-user has permission to return the selected item to the retailer, e-commerce server  generates an XML request based on the information supplied by the end-user and the selected item.","The request includes, for example, the name and address of the customer who purchased the item, name and address of the retailer who sold the item, service type, permit information, Postage Due Unit (\u201cPDU\u201d) information, label image type, insurance value, package weight, return materials authorization (\u201cRMA\u201d), and mailing acknowledgement. The mailing acknowledgement is an optional service that provides a customer with an acknowledgement when an item is returned\/delivered to a retailer. The e-commerce entity may be required to register with the USPS to receive a user ID and password to allow e-commerce server  to provide a valid user ID and password in each XML request.","For example, the XML request includes the following tags:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Input","XML Tag","Values Allowed"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Request","<EMRSV2.0Request...","Input tag exactly as"]},{"entry":[{},{},"presented."]},{"entry":["User ID","...USERID=\u201duserid\u201d...","Use user ID provided with"]},{"entry":[{},{},"registration."]},{"entry":["Password","...PASSWORD=\u201dpassword\u201d>","Use password provided with"]},{"entry":[{},{},"registration."]},{"entry":["Customer's","<CustomerName>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Name",{},"allowed: 32"]},{"entry":["Customer's","<CustomerAddress>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Address",{},"allowed: 24"]},{"entry":["Customer's","<CustomerCity>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["City",{},"allowed: 21"]},{"entry":["Customer's","<CustomerState>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["State",{},"allowed: 2"]},{"entry":["Customer's","<CustomerZip5>","Input tag exactly as"]},{"entry":["ZIP Code\u2009\u00ae",{},"presented, not all caps."]},{"entry":[{},{},"Maximum characters"]},{"entry":[{},{},"allowed: 5"]},{"entry":["Retailer's","<RetailerName>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Name",{},"allowed: 32"]},{"entry":["Retailer's","<RetailerAddress>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Address",{},"allowed: 32"]},{"entry":["Post Office","<PermitNumber>","Input permit number provided"]},{"entry":["Permit",{},"by your local post office."]},{"entry":"Number"},{"entry":["City Issuing","<PermitIssuingPOCity>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Post Office",{},"allowed: 15"]},{"entry":"Permit"},{"entry":["State Issuing","<PermitIssuingPOState>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Post Office",{},"allowed: 2"]},{"entry":"Permit"},{"entry":["ZIP Code\u2009\u00ae of","<PermitIssuingPOZip5>","Input tag exactly as"]},{"entry":["Post Office",{},"presented, not all caps."]},{"entry":["Issuing Permit",{},"Maximum characters"]},{"entry":[{},{},"allowed: 5"]},{"entry":["Postage Due","<PDUPOBox>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Unit PO Box",{},"allowed: 24"]},{"entry":["Postage Due","<PDUCity>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Unit City",{},"allowed: 15"]},{"entry":["Postage Due","<PDUState>","Maximum characters"]},{"entry":["Unit State",{},"allowed: 2"]},{"entry":["Postage Due","<PDUZip5>","Input tag exactly as"]},{"entry":["Unit ZIP",{},"presented, not all caps."]},{"entry":["Code\u2009\u00ae",{},"Maximum characters"]},{"entry":[{},{},"allowed: 5"]},{"entry":["Postage Due","<PDUZip4>","Input tag exactly as"]},{"entry":["Unit ZIP",{},"presented, not all caps."]},{"entry":["Code\u2009\u00ae + 4",{},"Maximum characters"]},{"entry":[{},{},"allowed: 4"]},{"entry":["Service Type","<ServiceType>","Valid entries are: \u201cFirst"]},{"entry":["Requested",{},"Class,\u201d \u201cPriority,\u201d \u201cParcel"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Post,\u201d \u201cBound Printed"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Matter,\u201d \u201cSpecial Standard,\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},"or \u201cLibrary Rate.\u201d"]},{"entry":["Delivery","<DeliveryConfirmation>","The valid values are \u201cTrue\u201d or"]},{"entry":["Confirmation\u2009\u2122",{},"\u201cFalse\u201d"]},{"entry":"Service"},{"entry":["Insurance","<InsuranceValue>","Enter numeric currency with"]},{"entry":["Desired by",{},"dollars and cents (no dollar"]},{"entry":["Permit Holder",{},"sign).

An end-user may obtain, at no charge, a delivery confirmation barcode label and a package identification code (\u201cPIC\u201d). The PIC is a unique identifier associated with a delivery confirmation barcode. The delivery confirmation barcode allows a sender and a recipient of a Priority Mail\u00ae or a Standard B-mail item, such as a package to obtain delivery confirmation information about the package's delivery based on the PIC. As the package travels through a mail stream such as that provided by the USPS, the delivery confirmation barcode is scanned and the scanned information is stored in one or more tracking databases. Upon delivery of the package, the delivery confirmation barcode is scanned again, and the scanned information is stored in one of the tracking databases.","As shown in , an end-user accesses an e-commerce server  over a network  through a client system  and makes a request for a delivery confirmation barcode label, and supplies information about the package on which the delivery confirmation barcode label will be placed.
