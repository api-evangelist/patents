title: Methods and apparatus for assigning management responsibilities to multiple agents
abstract: A management control center identifies multiple remotely located agents and their corresponding abilities to manage devices in a storage area network on behalf of the management control center. In response to learning capabilities of the multiple agents, the management control center assigns a first agent of multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a first set of management functions associated with a given device in the storage area network. Additionally, the management control center assigns a second agent of multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a second set of management functions associated with the given device. This technique of assigning multiple agents (rather than a single agent) different management functions alleviates a management control center from having to coordinate direct communications with and control many different types of vendor devices in the storage area network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Information services and data processing industries in general have rapidly expanded as a result of the need for computer systems to manage and store large amounts of data. As an example, financial service companies such as banks, mutual fund companies and the like now, more than ever before, require access to many hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of data and files stored in high capacity data storage systems. Other types of service companies have similar needs for data storage.","Data storage system developers have responded to an increased need for storage by integrating high capacity data storage systems, data communications devices (e.g., switches), and computer systems (e.g., host computers or servers) into networks called \u201cstorage networks\u201d or \u201cStorage Area Networks\u201d (SANs.) In general, a storage area network is a collection of data storage systems that are networked via a switching fabric to a number of host computer systems operating as servers. The host computers access data stored in the data storage systems on behalf of client computers that request data from the data storage systems. For example, according to conventional applications, upon receiving a storage access request, a respective host computer accesses a large repository of storage through the switching fabric on behalf of the requesting client. Thus, a client has access to the shared storage system through the host computer. In many applications, storage area networks support hi-speed acquisitions of data so that the host servers are able to promptly retrieve and store data from the data storage system.","Conventional storage area network management applications typically include a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables a network manager to graphically manage, control, and configure various types of hardware and software resources associated with a corresponding managed storage area network. For example, one conventional network management storage application generates a graphical user interface utilized by a network manager to graphically select, interact with, and manage local or remote devices and associated software processes associated with the storage area network. Based on use of the graphical user interface in combination with an input device such as a hand operated mouse and corresponding pointer displayed on a viewing screen, a network manager is able to manage hardware and software entities such as file systems, databases, storage devices, peripherals, network data communications devices, etc., associated with the storage area network. Consequently, a network management station and associated management software enables a network administrator or systems manager (a person responsible for managing the storage network) to manage the storage area network and its resources. One purpose of managing storage area network resources is to maintain the storage area network so that it is properly configured to provide efficient data access to many users.","To manage devices such as switch devices in a fabric of the storage area network, a network administrator must have knowledge of operations supported by the devices as well as protocols used to communicate with the devices. A storage area network typically includes many different vendor types of devices that must be managed. Thus, to manage such devices in the storage area network, a network manager must typically communicate directly with the switch devices using many different communication protocols.","Conventional network management applications that support management of network resources in a storage area network typically suffer from a variety of deficiencies. For example, conventional manager applications potentially face a problem of having to learn management capabilities supported by many different types of vendor's switch devices in order to communicate with and control such switch devices. For example, being able to control switch devices in a storage area network may require that a centralized control system operated by a network administrator is able to support communication with each of different vendor types of devices in the storage area network. After learning of operations supported by the different types of devices (e.g., devices manufactured by different vendors) based on direct inquiries, conventional network manager applications have to maintain respective communication interfaces for the different protocols via different interfaces in order to be able to further communicate with and control the devices in the storage area network.","Techniques discussed in this application provide advantages over conventional network management applications. In particular, embodiments of the present application include mechanisms and techniques for offloading execution of management functions or operational control to multiple agents distributed in a storage area network environment. For example, a management control center identifies multiple agents and their corresponding abilities to manage devices in the storage area network on behalf of the management control center. In one application, the multiple agents reside on respective host entities (e.g., independent of the management control center) that execute management functions associated with the devices. In response to learning capabilities of the multiple agents, the management control center assigns a first agent of multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a first set of management functions associated with the device. Additionally, the management control center assigns a second agent of multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a second set of management functions associated with the device. The second set of management functions is exclusive of the first set of management functions. This technique of assigning different management functions to multiple agents (rather than a single agent) alleviates the management control center from having to coordinate direct communications with many different types of vendor devices in the storage area network in order to control the respective devices.","In one application, the management control center receives information collected by the multiple agents. The information includes an indication of the corresponding abilities of the multiple agents to perform management tasks associated with the device. Based on the corresponding abilities of the agents to perform management tasks, the management control center determines which agent in the storage area network to assign handling of a respective set of management functions.","The management control center notifies the agents of their respectively assigned management functions. For example, the management control center notifies a first agent of an assignment to support a first set of management functions associated with the device. The management control center also notifies a second agent of an assignment to support a second set of management functions associated with the device. Thus, responsibilities of executing management functions (e.g., control) associated with the device on behalf of the management control center are split amongst multiple agents.","The management control center may notify the agents that they are assigned as primary agents (as opposed to being backup agents) to support respective management functions. Providing notification to the agents that they are assigned as respective primary agents for supporting different management functions may prompt the agents to run management programs initiating communication with the device prior to the respective agents receiving user-generated commands from the management control center to perform management functions with respect to the device. In other words, after an agent learns that it is assigned to support certain management functions, an agent may respectively launch a management program to initiate handshaking with (e.g., to query) a target device (e.g., the device being controlled by the agent) so that the agent, when prompted to do so by a management control center, can immediately interrogate the device and prepare to execute management functions and control the device upon request of the management control center.","The management control center may assign different management tasks to the agents in a number of ways. For example, according to one technique, the management control center selects an agent to perform management functions depending on the respective host entities on which the agents reside. In such an application, the management control center identifies that a first agent resides on a respective first host entity in the storage area network as well as identifies that a second agent resides on a respective second host entity in the storage area network. The management control center receives information indicating performance capabilities associated with the respective first host entity and the respective second host entity. Based on a performance capability of the respective first host entity and second host entity on which the agents reside, the management control center assigns unique sets of management functions to the agents to control storage area network devices.","According to another technique, the management control center may assign agents in the storage area network to handle management functions in response to identifying a type associated with the device. For example, the management control center may select particular agents amongst multiple agents to handle execution of the management functions in response to determining which agents are suited to support a particular type of device. It should be noted that agents in the storage area network can be configured to perform management functions associated with a particular vendor type.","According to yet another technique herein, the management control center may determine which agents to assign different management functions depending on types of interfaces associated with the agents. For example, agents may include one or multiple interfaces supporting respective one or multiple communication protocols to communicate and control a target device in the storage area network. The management control center receives information from the agents about types of interfaces associated with each of the multiple agents. The information may include an indication of corresponding protocols such as i) SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), ii) FAL (Fabric Access Layer), iii) SMI (Storage Management Interface), and iv) FC_SWAPI (Fibre Channel SWitch Application Programming Interface), etc. supported by the agent interfaces.","According to still another technique herein, the management control center may assign an agent to be responsible for handling execution of a first set of management functions based on an ability of one agent to communicate with and control a target device compared to abilities of other agents to communicate with and control the target device. The abilities of the agents to communicate with the device may be based at least in part on a respective number of node hops required to communicate between a host entity on which a respective agent resides and the device. In this latter instance, agents located closer (e.g., requiring fewer hops to communicate) to the target devices being controlled are more likely to be assigned to perform the respective management functions.","Techniques of the present application are well suited for use in systems in which a management control center discovers management capabilities of multiple different vendor types of devices in a storage area network and the management control center assigns agents distributed in the storage area network duties of communicating with and controlling the devices. However, it should be noted that embodiments of the present application are not limited to use in such applications.","Other embodiments of the present application include a computerized device (e.g., a host computer, workstation, etc.) configured to support the aforementioned method operations disclosed herein as embodiments of the present application to assign management capabilities among multiple agents in a storage area network. In such embodiments, the computerized device includes a memory system, a processor (e.g., a processing device), a display, and an interconnect. The interconnect supports communications among the display, the processor, and the memory system. The memory system is encoded with an application that, when executed on the processor, produces a process that supports offloading execution of management operations to agents on behalf of a management control center.","Yet other embodiments of the present application disclosed herein include software programs to perform the method embodiment and operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below under the heading Detailed Description. More particularly, a computer program product (e.g., a computer-readable medium) including computer program logic encoded thereon may be executed on a computerized device to support management capability discovery and device management execution as explained herein. The computer program logic, when executed on at least one processor with a computing system, causes the processor to perform the operations (e.g., the methods) indicated herein as embodiments of the present application. Such arrangements of the present application are typically provided as software, code and\/or other data structures arranged or encoded on a computer readable medium such as an optical medium (e.g., CD-ROM), floppy or hard disk or other medium such as firmware or microcode in one or more ROM or RAM or PROM chips or as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or as downloadable software images in one or more modules, shared libraries, etc. The software or firmware or other such configurations can be installed onto a computerized device to cause one or more processors in the computerized device to perform the techniques explained herein as embodiments of the present application.","One more particular embodiment of the present application is directed to a computer program product that includes a computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon for supporting management of network resources. The instructions, when carried out by a processor of a respective computer device, cause the processor to perform the steps of: i) identifying multiple agents and their corresponding abilities to manage a device (e.g., a switch device in a storage area network) on behalf of a management control center that utilizes the multiple agents (e.g., agents that reside on respective at least one host entities independent of the management control center) to execute management functions associated with the device; ii) assigning a first agent of the multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a first set of management functions associated with the device; and iii) assigning a second agent of the multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a second set of management functions associated with the device, the second set of management functions being exclusive of the first set of management functions. Other embodiments of the present application include software programs to perform any of the method embodiment steps and operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below.","It should be understood that the system of the present application can be embodied as a software program or as a software program operating in conjunction with corresponding hardware. Example embodiments of the present application may be implemented in conjunction with EMC's Control Center (ECC) software application that provides graphical management functionality for storage area network resources and in computerized devices that operate the Control Center (ECC) software. Control Center software is manufactured by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass., USA.","A management control center identifies multiple remotely located SAN agents and their corresponding abilities to manage SAN equipment (e.g., switch devices in a SAN fabric) on behalf of the management control center. In response to learning capabilities of the multiple agents, the management control center assigns a first agent of multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a first set of management functions associated with a given device in the storage area network. Additionally, the management control center assigns a second agent of multiple agents in the storage area network to handle execution of a second set of management functions associated with the given device.","This technique of assigning multiple agents (rather than a single agent) different management functions alleviates a management control center from having to coordinate direct communications with and control many different types of devices (e.g., vendor devices) in the storage area network. Instead of relying on direct communications, the management control center indirectly controls the given network device through the agents. For example, in response to receiving a control command from a user at the management control center, the management control center transmits user-generated requests or commands to the respectively assigned SAN agents that, in turn, communicate with and control the given network device on behalf of the management control center.","One reason for assigning management functions associated with a given network device to multiple agents instead of a single agent is the ability of different agents to perform different management functions. That is, certain agents in a storage area network may be better suited for handling a first type of management function such as zoning management functions while other agents may be better suited for handling a second type of management functions such as low security management functions. Consequently, for a given network device, techniques herein involve assigning a first agent to handle a first type of associated management functions and assigning a second agent to handle a second type of management functions of the given device instead of assigning all storage area network management duties to a single agent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","304","1","304","2","304","340","350","375","1","375","2","375","110","125"]},"Network  includes switch device -, switch device - which themselves have corresponding switch ports  and .

Storage area network  can include any number of agents, each of which may operate on any computerized device in the storage area network environment . For example, agents can reside in respective devices in network , network , etc.","In general, and as will be more particularly discussed, computer system  assigns multiple agents in storage area network environment  duties of supporting exclusive sets of management functions associated with switch devices . Based on the assignments, agents , , and  act on behalf of computer system  to control switch devices . Proper configuration and control of switches  ensures that host entities  may efficiently access data from storage system resources  on behalf of clients.","Agents can be distributed throughout storage area network environment  as shown. In one application, agents , ,  run on respective host entities  that are not dedicated to serving data from storage area network environment  to corresponding clients. In other words, agents optionally run on host resources (e.g., host entities ) that are at least partially dedicated to executing agents but not serving clients. Agents may also run on host entities that do serve data retrieved from storage system resources  to respective clients.","For illustrative purposes, computer system  (e.g., a management control center) is configured, in this example, as a storage area network management station operated by a user  such as a network manager responsible for managing resources in the storage area network . For example, computer system  executes a resource manager application  (e.g., a software graphical user interface application) that generates and displays information in accordance with embodiments of the present application as will be explained herein. The resource manager  may be any type of network management software application that executes, performs, or otherwise operates within computer  such as a computerized management station.","The management station computer system  (e.g., a computer device) includes a corresponding display  (e.g., a monitor or other visual display device) that resource manager  controls to display a graphical user interface . In general, graphical user interface  presented by a software application (e.g., resource manager ) running on computer  enables user  to initiate execution of commands to associated devices such as switches  in storage area network environment . For example, a user  may provide input commands (e.g., selections by clicking on a mouse) to i) control information (e.g., tables, pop-up screens, etc.) displayed on display  and ii) request an agent  (or other agents as is generally the case throughout this document) to perform a management function (e.g., configuration of switches ).","In one application, resource manager  initiates discovery or rediscovery of management capabilities associated with resources (e.g., agents, applications, interfaces such as management application programming interfaces, etc.) in storage area network environment  without being prompted by a user . For example, resource manager  periodically or occasionally executes a discovery\/rediscovery as a regular course of business to learn of configurations, supported operations, etc. associated with devices in the storage area network environment . In response to learning new management capabilities associated with agents, the computer system  can assign\/reassign the agents , , and  different management functions or duties.","In one embodiment, the agents in storage area network  operate on behalf of the management control center and utilize a respective address to communicate with and query a corresponding network device about its corresponding supported set of operations. For example, based on a configuration of a network device, the agents learn of management capabilities (i.e., operations that an agent, application, interface, entity are able to perform on the corresponding network device) they support. Accordingly, in one application, the network devices do not provide a direct report of management capabilities to the agents. Instead, the network devices provide configuration information and other data enabling an agent (or network management station, application, interface, etc.) to conclude what operations can be performed on a given network device. However, in other embodiments, the agents may directly query the network devices to learn of operations that they support.","In one embodiment, management capabilities include operations that an application, agent, specific interface, etc. are able to perform on a specific network device. In certain cases, an ability to implement management capabilities depends on a status, state or configuration of the network device. For example, a status of the network device may affect the ability of the application, agent or interface to manage the device. In one application, management capabilities refers to an ability of a device to transfer data or provide some other functionality, not necessarily how the device can be managed by an application although certain applications encompass this concept as well. That is, management capabilities may extend to cover operations supported by a corresponding network device.","Computer system  and, more particularly, resource manager  stores learned attributes associated with storage area network environment  in repository . Based on management capabilities reported by agents , , and  to computer system , resource manager  notifies (e.g., via a display screen  of selectable options in graphical user interface ) user  of management functions that can be performed on resources (e.g., switch devices) in the storage area network environment .","Note again that storage area network environment  enables host entities  (e.g., servers, etc.) to access data in storage system resources  on behalf of clients coupled to or through the host entities . However, as discussed, certain host entities  are optionally dedicated to running agent applications rather than server applications for serving data to clients.","The following discussion illustrates how certain host entities  serve data to clients. For example, host entity - couples to network  via adapter - and corresponding ports . Ports  couple to respective ports  and  on switch devices . In turn, ports  and  of switch devices  couple to ports  and  of corresponding storage system resources . Thus, switch devices  and corresponding ports  and  form at least part of a data path (e.g., a zone) between host entities  and corresponding storage system resources .","Storage system resource - includes access controllers  to facilitate access to corresponding storage devices  (e.g., logical storage space). Storage devices  are configured as logical portions of one or more physical storage devices  (e.g., arrays of storage disks). Maps  provide a mapping of storage devices  (e.g., logical volumes) to corresponding physical storage devices  (e.g., storage disks).","Typically, selected host entities  are limited to accessing certain storage devices  in storage system resource - based at least in part on configuration settings of switch devices  of network . For example, in one embodiment, switch ports  and  of switches  are assigned to create a particular zone in network . In general, a zone defines a group of resources in the network providing a logical path i) through a switch resource  and ii) between a host resource  and a storage array resource . Thus, in some respects, a zone defines a logical data flow path in the storage area network environment .","As discussed, computer system  assigns agents , , and  different management functions to more effectively support configuration of storage area network environment . Accordingly, agents , , and  in storage area network environment  enable user  to configure the storage area network environment  so that host entities can more efficiently access data on behalf of corresponding clients.

Resource manager application - may be embodied as software code such as data and\/or logic instructions (e.g., code stored in the memory or on another computer readable medium such as a disk) that supports processing functionality according to different embodiments described herein. During operation, processor  accesses memory system  via the interconnect  in order to launch, run, execute, interpret or otherwise perform the logic instructions of the resource manager application -. Execution of resource manager application - produces processing functionality in resource manager process -. In other words, the resource manager process - represents one or more portions of the resource manager application - (or the entire application) performing within or upon the processor  in the computer system .","It should be noted that the resource manager  (in ) executed in computer system  can be represented by either one or both of the resource manager application - and\/or the resource manager process -.

The resource manager application - may also be stored in a memory type system such as in firmware, read only memory (ROM), or, as in this example, as executable code within the memory system  (e.g., within Random Access Memory or RAM). In addition to these embodiments, it should also be noted that other embodiments of the present application include the execution of resource manager application - in processor  as the resource manager process -. Thus, those skilled in the art will understand that the computer system  may include other processes and\/or software and hardware components, such as an operating system that controls allocation and use of hardware resources.","Note that agents , , and  can operate on respective host entities  in a similar manner as discussed above for resource manager  operating on computer system .

In such an instance, user  may be prompted by computer system  to provide (either previously or during the selection of the resource) computer system  with one or more management addresses associated with device .","Computer  forwards the management address (e.g., a network address associated with device  in the storage area network environment ) to agents  and  in the storage area network environment . The agents  and  operate on behalf of the management control center (i.e., computer ) and utilize the management address (or addresses) to communicate with and query corresponding device  about its corresponding configuration and supported operations.","As shown, agents  and  can include one or multiple interfaces (e.g., management application programming interface - and management application programming interface - associated with agent  and management application programming interface - associated with agent ) on which to communicate with device . For example, a first interface - of the agent  may support SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) type communications with the target network device  being queried; another interface - of the agent  may support FAL (Fabric Access Layer) type communications with the target network device , and so on. Agent  communicates with device  via use of management application programming interface - and respective protocols to learn of a configuration associated with device .","In addition to supporting discovery of management functions supported by network devices in storage area network environment , in a reverse direction, the agents' management application programming interfaces can support execution of generic management commands initiated by user  and received from computer . For example, respective translators  and  (e.g., an ESNAPI interface which is an internal library developed by EMC) of agents  and  support translation of the generic commands from computer  into specific vendor type commands understood by the target devices in storage area network environment  being managed. Assignment of management responsibilities will be discussed in connection with .","Referring again to , management capabilities (a.k.a., management functions) associated with devices in storage area network environment  can cover a broad spectrum of management features associated with SAN resources. Examples of management capabilities include: discovery of connectivity device references, adapters, ports and topology, monitoring of statistics, discovery of fabric, zoning (inactive and active), zone control, registration of asynchronous events, receiving asynchronous events, etc. Management functions supported by agents  and  may extend to configuring a respective target network device  based on these and other device features.","As discussed, agents  and  include management application programming interfaces  and  for interrogating devices , , etc. about their respective configurations. In general, management application programming interfaces of respective agents can support communications such as those based on i) SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), ii) FAL (Fabric Access Layer), iii) SMI (Storage Management Interface), and iv) FC_SWAPI (Fibre Channel SWitch Application Programming Interface), etc. As mentioned, communications via such protocols enable discovery of device attributes (e.g., management capabilities) such as configuration, its name, name of resources in the device, connectivity paths, zone information, vendor type, etc.","Each of multiple independently operating management application programming interfaces  and  can support discovery and execution of different types of operations with respect to a given network device  being queried. For example, the SNMP protocol enables discovery of low security information (e.g., configuration information) associated with device . Typically, most vendor devices support the SNMP protocol. On the other hand, a specific protocol such as the FAL protocol supports communications with devices manufactured by Brocade\u2122 and enables discovery of more advanced configuration information such as zoning, which may not be presently supported by the SNMP protocol. The SWAPI protocol supports discovery of nicknames (instead of World Wide Names) associated with a queried device. Thus, different protocols associated with respective management application programming interfaces support discovery and control of different types of management capabilities or functions.","Although most equipment being queried in the storage area network environment  supports the SNMP protocol, certain protocols are supported only by equipment of a particular vendor type. For example, Brocade\u2122 switches quite often support out-of-band management communications via FAL in addition to SNMP. Thus, a target device such as device  can be interrogated, controlled, etc. via use of multiple protocols such as FAL and SNMP.","In the example shown, based on communications (e.g., an agent sending query messages to device ) via respective management application programming interfaces , the agent  learns that a first interface - of the agent  supports a first set of management capabilities  including management capability types , , , , and , and that a second interface - of the agent  supports a second set of management capabilities  including management capability types , , , and , and so on. As an example, management capability type  may pertain to fabric connectivity status; management capability  may pertain to device nickname discovery; management capability type  may pertain to zoning functions; etc. Note that in certain cases, agent need not query device  and can identify management capabilities supported by a respective network device based on a vendor type, model, software versions, etc. associated with device .","For a given interrogation of network device , each of agents  and  reports learned management capabilities for each of the respective multiple management application programming interfaces  and  to the computer system . Thus, computer system  receives reports of management capabilities from multiple different agents in the storage area network environment . Consequently, the management control center learns which of multiple agents in a storage area network environment  to contact in order to initiate different operations associated with network devices in the storage area network environment .","Note that agents may combine sets of management capabilities into a single set before forwarding them to computer system . For example, as shown, agent  combines the a first set of management capabilities  and the second set of management capabilities  and forwards a set of overall management capabilities  to computer . The set of overall management capabilities  includes a non-duplicated set of management capability types , , , , , , and .

In a similar vein, computer system  notifies agent  that it is responsible for handling commands associated with management capability types  and . Computer system , as in this example case shown, assigns the agents  and  management responsibilities so that they do not overlap with each other. Thus, instead of assigning all management responsibilities to a single agent in storage area network environment , computer system  splits management responsibilities among two or more different agents.","A possible reason for splitting an assignment of management responsibilities in storage area network environment  is to provide more efficient handling of commands. For example, certain agents may be better suited for handling commands via respective protocols supported by their management application programming interfaces. Accordingly, in such circumstances, computer system  may assign management responsibilities depending on how well an agent can handle a type of management responsibility. Assignment of management responsibilities by the computer system  also may be based on load-balancing considerations so that no one agent or management application programming interface is overloaded with management responsibilities.","As discussed, computer system  assigns each agent in the storage area network environment  to handle one or more management responsibilities associated with a device. The computer system  may further assign backup agents to handle the management responsibilities in the event that a primary assigned agent is unable to handle a management responsibility on behalf of computer system .","Via table - and -, respective agents keep track of which devices they support (based on information provided by computer system ) and corresponding management application programming interfaces that are to be used to handle execution of respective management responsibilities. In the event that computer system  specifies which agent and\/or management application programming interface to use, there may be no need for the agents to maintain tables - and -. For example, the computer system  optionally notifies an agent of a management application programming interface to use at a time of initiating execution of a command from computer system .","Note that in certain situations, agents may execute processes with respect to an assigned management responsibility prior to actually receiving a command from the computer system  to execute a given command. These pre-running processes can provide necessary initialization of states, handshaking, etc. so that a command, when received and handled by a respective agent, executes more quickly and efficiently.","As discussed, after assigning management functions to different agents in storage area network environment , computer system  keeps track of management functions (e.g., commands) supported by different agents via table . For example, table  indicates which agent and respective management application programming interface in storage area network environment  to forward commands for execution. Accordingly, when user  initiates selection and execution of a generic command (or, in the alternative, a vendor specific command) presented to the user  as being an option for execution as displayed in graphical user interface , resource manager  consults table  to identify which agent to send the generic command. As discussed, in one application, table  only includes a list of agents assigned to handle certain types of management functions. The corresponding agents in storage area network environment  include respective tables - and - to determine which respective management application programming interface on which to execute the management function. Computer system  may also identify which management application programming interface to use based on entries in table .","In the example shown, for a given command selected by user  and targeted to device , computer  identifies the device to which the command is directed. For purposes of this discussion, assume that user  selects a command (of management function type #) to manage an attribute of device . Resource manager  forwards the command  to the appropriate agent  and management application programming interface - identified in table . For example, resource manager  first identifies that the command  selected by user  is directed toward device . Additionally, resource manager  identifies that command is of management capability type #. Based on the appropriate entry (e.g., the entry for management capability type #) in table , computer  transmits generic command  to agent  in host entity -. A similar procedure is used to transmit other types of commands to different agents based on contents of table .","As briefly discussed above, agent  includes translator  (e.g., an ESNAPI interface\u2014Enterprise Storage Network Application Programming Interface, a library developed by EMC) to convert generic command  into corresponding vendor specific commands understood by a target device . Upon receipt of command , agent  identifies a specific management function associated with the generic command  and thereafter consults a corresponding table  to identify a particular management application programming interface  (if the management application programming interface is not already identified in the received command) of a respective agent to handle execution of the command on behalf of computer system . As shown, execution of command  at agent  includes translating the command  using translator  and communicating corresponding messages  through management application programming interface - to device  to initiate execution of the command  at device .","In contrast to the above technique of the computer system  notifying an agent which management application programming interface to use for execution, in certain cases, table - may not indicate which management application programming interface to use. Under such circumstances, the agent  performs an analysis to determine which of the management application programming interfaces  to initiate execution of the generic command . In one application, the agent  chooses a management application programming interface  that can perform execution of the generic command faster than the other agents. In another application, the agent  itself decides which management application programming interface to use based on a load-balancing function so that neither management application programming interface  is overwhelmed with communication traffic.","Resource manager  can display table  to a user  via graphical user interface . Displaying management capabilities, configuration information of operational capabilities (as well as management addresses of corresponding devices in the storage area network environment ) to a user  via graphical user interface  serves a number of useful purposes. For example, providing a display of configuration and\/or management capabilities and related information in table : i) enables the user  to identify available functionality supported by devices (e.g., device ) in storage area network environment , ii) troubleshoot problems such as an inability of an agent to perform a management function, iii) choose an address template to obtain more functionality associated with a device, iv) primary agent assignment, v) tuning connectivity configurations, etc.","As previously discussed, assignment of which agents in storage area network environment  handle each of the management responsibilities can involve assigning agents to handle different management responsibilities based on performance attributes of a respective host entity  on which the agents reside. In addition to this technique, assignment of management responsibilities can be based on other system attributes such as a i) vendor type associated with a network device, ii) types of communication interfaces (e.g., a management application programming interface and supporting protocols) associated with an agent, iii) an ability of an agent to communicate with a target device, etc.","More specifically, the computer system  can identify a vendor type associated with the device . Assume, for example, that device  is a switch manufactured by Brocade\u2122. Such a switch may support certain communication protocols such as SNMP and FAL. Depending on the vendor type associated with device , the computer system  selects agent  and  among multiple agents to handle execution of the management functions because such agents support the SNMP and FAL protocols.","In one application, computer system  receives information about interfaces (e.g., management application programming interfaces) associated with each of the multiple agents. The information can include an indication of corresponding protocols supported by the interfaces. In addition to SNMP and FAL, agents in storage area network environment  may support other protocols such as SMI (Storage Management Interface), SWAPI (SWitch Application Programming Interface), etc. Depending on communication protocols supported by device , the computer system  selects appropriate agents among multiple agents having corresponding one or more management application programming interfaces to handle communications and execution of the management functions. Typically, agents having multiple management application programming interfaces capable of communicating with a network device via multiple respective protocols can support a wider range of management responsibilities.","In yet another application, computer system  assigns an agent to be responsible for handling execution of the first set of management functions based on an ability of an agent to communicate with and control the device compared to abilities of other agents to communicate with and control the device. In other words, if an agent can efficiently support communications with a target device , it is more likely to be assigned duties of handling corresponding management responsibilities. For example, the ability of agents to communicate with a device can be based at least in part on a respective number of node hops required to communicate between a host entity  on which a respective agent resides and the target device  for which management responsibilities are being assigned. The fewer the node hops between an agent and a target device being managed, the higher the likelihood that the agent can more efficiently handle management responsibilities associated with the target device.","Functionality supported by computer system  and, more specifically, resource manager  and agents  and  will now be discussed via flowchart  in .
