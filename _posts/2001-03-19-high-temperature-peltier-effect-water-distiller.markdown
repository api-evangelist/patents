title: High temperature peltier effect water distiller
abstract: An apparatus for and method of distillation uses a high temperature thermoelectric device to heat a liquid, such as water to vapor (steam) and cool the vapor to a purified, distilled liquid. Distillation system has no moving parts, thereby increasing reliability while reducing noise and maintenance. Liquid in a container has a heating section on the container extending into it to boil it into a vapor that is fed to a condenser section disposed on the container adjacent to the heating section. A thermoelectric section provided with a Peltier effect device is interposed between the heating section and condenser section. The Peltier effect device has one side in contiguous contact with the condenser to transfer heat from it and another side is in contiguous contact with the heating section to transfer heat to it to boil the liquid into the vapor and feed the vapor through the condenser that condenses it into distilled liquid.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to an apparatus for and method of distilling water. More particularly, this invention utilizes a high temperature Peltier effect device to heat water to boil as a vapor and to cool it to distilled water.","Conventional distillers of water such as those designed to distill water in amounts suitable for use in the home have a separate condenser to transfer most or all of the heat along with some steam to the surrounding environment with a fan. This increases the workload on environmental handling systems to remove this heat energy and moisture from environmentally controlled living spaces. Conventional home distillers additionally transfer heat through the walls (including the bottom) of the water reservoir. As water is distilled in these contemporary distillers, precipitates created during the distillation process fall to the bottom of the reservoir. This layer of precipitates decreases the rate of heat transfer to the water and decreases the overall efficiency of these systems. In addition, this layer of precipitates becomes baked onto the bottom of the reservoir and requires expensive efforts and acidic cleansers to remove it.","Reservoirs of the conventional home distillers usually are constructed of relatively expensive stainless steel because of its high thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance. The high thermal conductivity of stainless steel is required because heat is transferred through the walls of the reservoir to the water. Another reason stainless steel is selected for construction of conventional home distillers is that precipitates baked onto the bottom of the reservoir are removed relatively easily. Irrespective of the benefits of stainless steel, it significantly increases the cost of home distillers.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a distillation system using a high temperature thermoelectric device that functions to heat water to its vapor point (steam) and cool the vapor to a distilled water.","The present invention provides a distillation system and method having a thermoelectric Peltier effect device interposed between and in contact with a heater section extending into a reservoir of water and a condenser section. The water is heated to its vapor point (steam) and cooled to condense to a distilled water by the same Peltier effect device that has no moving parts to provide for increased reliability and reduced noise and maintenance.","An object of the invention is to provide an apparatus for and method of distillation including a high temperature thermoelectric device having a Peltier effect device to first heat water to vapor and then cool the vapor to a distilled water.","Another object of the invention is to provide a distillation apparatus and method having no moving parts, to increase reliability and reduce noise and maintenance.","Another object of the invention is to provide a distillation apparatus and method providing for an increase in efficiency by taking the heat energy extracted during condensing and reusing it for heating.","Another object is to provide a distillation apparatus and method evaporating water by flash point vaporization to put heat energy directly in the volume of water instead of wasting it through the walls of a tank and concentrating the heat energy in a small volume of water to reduce the over all requirements for heat energy.","Another object of the invention is to provide a distillation apparatus and method heating only a small volume of water to the boiling point as opposed to conventional systems that heat entire volumes of water to the boiling point for the full duration of the distillation process.","Another object of the invention is to provide a distillation apparatus and method preventing the baking of precipitates onto the walls of the tank to increase reliability and reduce maintenance.","An object of the invention is to provide a highly reliable distillation apparatus and method having no moving parts and fabricated from porcelain, glass, plastics, etc., to reduce production costs as compared to stainless steel.","Another object of the invention is to provide a distillation apparatus and method operable by 110 V power sources as well as safer 12 V or 24 V DC power sources that can be conveniently packaged to be insulated from the effects of high heat and high moisture environments.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Referring to the FIGURE, a distillation system  has a container  containing a reservoir  of water , such as water for distillation into distilled water . Container  may be dish-shaped cylinder and made of a variety of materials, such as porcelain, glass, plastic etc., that are capable of holding water , and cover  made from a foam-like insulating material covers and extends across container  and reservoir  to block the transfer of heat. Container  may include suitable valves, feeder tubes, and a pump connected to a source (not shown) to replenish water  to keep it at or near a predetermined level of water  in reservoir .","Distillation system  further includes a heating section , a condenser section , and a thermoelectric section . Thermoelectric section  is fitted into a traverse opening  in insulating cover  so that condenser section  and heating section  can operatively engage water  in container  to make distilled water . Heating section  is used to boil water  from a water state to a gaseous state, or vapor , and condenser section  is used to cool and condense the vaporized water  to distilled water . Thermoelectric section  has heat conductive plates and sized to extend across an opening  in insulating cover  and being in contact with heating section  and condenser section , respectively. Thermoelectric section  also has a Peltier effect device, hereinafter referred to as PE . PE  is disposed between plates and to effect the simultaneous heating and boiling of water  to vapor  and cooling and condensing of vapor  to distilled water .","Heating section  includes tubular-shaped wall  connected to and extending downwardly from insulating cover  to define a percolating chamber  having a T-shaped cross-sectional configuration having an open-ended bottom \u2032 to receive water . Tubular wall  is made from an insulating material to separate and insulate a portion \u2032 of water  in percolating chamber  from the rest of water  in container . As water portion \u2032 is vaporized, more of water  can flow into percolating chamber  via open-ended bottom \u2032 to replenish water portion \u2032. Optionally, tubular wall  and percolating chamber  could be eliminated; however, such a modification will increase energy needed to vaporize the increased volume of water  and the time required to initiate the distillation process.","Heating section  additionally has a flat plate  of conductive material, such as metal, that has an inner surface disposed in contiguous and intimate contact with thermoelectric section  via heat conductive plate to absorb and transmit heat from a hot side of thermoelectric section  to a rod . Rod  is connected to and orthogonally extends from flat plate  and can be made from the same conductive material as plate . Rod  extents into percolating chamber  to transmit heat to water portion \u2032 at and below level . Parts of water portion \u2032 in portions \/of percolating chamber  are vaporized, or boiled into vapor  by heat conducted through plate  along an outer surface and through rod  along rounder outer surface \/. The parts of water portion \u2032 that are vaporized into vapor  are replaced in percolating chamber  from water .","Vapor  bubbles upward through water portion \u2032 and collects in plenum . Plenum  includes the regions on both sides of first flat plate  and around rod  at the top of portions \/in percolating chamber .","Condenser section  may be fabricated from a block  of heat conductive metal material that has portion  lying adjacent to and in contiguous contact with a cold side of thermoelectric section . Other portions  of condenser section  can extend to lie adjacent insulating cover  and be insulated from the heat associated with heated water  by heating section . Heat conductive metal block  of condenser section  can be cast or otherwise suitably machined with at least one serpentinely extending traverse passageway  from an inlet port  communicating with plenum  to an outlet port  where distilled water  may be collected.","Heat conducting plates and of thermoelectric section  are made from a conductive metal that serves to contain and protect PE  from the ambient. Heat conductive plate also conducts heat and distributes it from PE  to surface of flat plate  of heater section  and plate conducts heat from adjacent portion  of condenser section  to PE . Electrical conductors and control components (not shown) may extend from PE  to supply DC power for the duration of the distillation process. PE  of thermoelectric section  is disposed within plates and in such a fashion to be in intimate contact with both heater section  and condenser section . PE  operates according to the Peltier effect.","The Peltier effect was first discovered in the 19th century and is the liberation of heat at one junction and the absorption of heat at the other junction when a current is passed through a circuit consisting two different metals. However, the temperature difference obtained with different metals is not high. More recently, semiconductors can be used to produce larger temperature differences across metal-semiconductor junctions of metal and n and p-type semiconductors to produce cold sides (heat absorption) and hot sides (heat liberation) so that a number of such metal-semiconductor junctions contained in PE  can be used as an effective source for heating water , such as water to vapor  and cooling vapor  to distilled water (water) .","A number of commercially available modules for liberating heat to heating section  and for absorbing heat from condenser section  as per the Peltier effect may be selected by one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains to fabricate PE  in thermoelectric section . These include and are not limited to the thermoelectric modules marketed under the trademark ZMAX by Tellurex Corporation 1248 Hastings Street, Traverse City, Mich. 49686; the thermoelectric modules model numbers TED-0606-018 . . . , TED 3030-127 . . . , TED 4040-127 . . . , etc., marketed by TE Distributing INC., 113 Hiltwood Drive, Hendersonville, Tenn. 37075; and the thermoelectric modules marketed by Ferrotec America Corporation, 40 Simon Street, Nashua, N.H. 03060. These modules are capable of heating heating section  to about 150 to 200\u00b0 C. along one surface, or side and provide for a sufficiently lower temperature along another surface, or side to absorb heat from condenser section .","Sufficient numbers of these commercially available thermoelectric modules may be selected and are interconnected and arranged in accordance with manufactures specifications in PE  to create hot side inside and adjacent to hot side of thermoelectric section with heat conductive plates in contiguous contact with surface . The heat of hot side is conducted to plate  and rod  via plate to boil at least part of water portion \u2032 into steam-like vapor  along surface \/of rod . If, as shown in the FIGURE, level of water  in reservoir  is raised to place outer surface of plate  in water portion \u2032, then vapor  also will form on surface . Heat is absorbed on cool, or cold side of PE  in contact with heat conductive plate to cool condenser section  via adjacent portion  and condense vapor  in serpentine passageway  into condensed and distilled water  that drains from outlet port . This heating and cooling of PE  of thermoelectric device  occur at the same time during the distillation process and since there are no moving parts, long-term reliability is assured.","In operation, reservoir  is filled with liquid, such as water. DC power is coupled to power-up PE  of thermoelectric section . Heat energy is transferred from condenser section  via adjacent portion  to percolating chamber  via the high temperature PE , which is in thermal contact with condenser section  and flat plate  and rod . This heat transfer is accomplished by 1.) absorbing heat in PE  on cool, or cold side that is in contiguous contact with portion  of condenser section , 2.) conducting the absorbed heat through PE  and plate  and rod  and reusing it to partially heat water portion \u2032, and 3.) generating heat in PE  at hot side and conducting it to plate  and rod  to boil water portion \u2032 into steam-like vapor  along surface \/of rod  and surface of plate . Vapor  rises and collects in plenum  to pass through serpentine passageway  due to convection and increased pressure in plenum  that is caused by boiling parts of water portion \u2032 into vapor  in percolating chamber . The heat removed from condenser section  cools it via adjacent portion  and vapor  is condensed in serpentine passageway  into condensed and distilled water  that feeds by gravity through outlet port .","Distillation system  of this invention uses high temperature thermoelectric PE  to first heat parts of water portion \u2032 to a vapor  (steam) and then cool vapor  to purified distilled water . Distillation system  of this invention has no moving parts, thereby increasing reliability and reducing noise and maintenance. Distillation system  has increased efficiency by taking the heat energy extracted during condensing and reusing it for vaporization that vaporizes parts of water portion \u2032 by flash point vaporization. Concentrating heat energy directly in the volume of water portion \u2032 in percolating chamber  instead of heating the entire volume of water  to its boiling point for the full duration of the distillation process eliminates needless waste of heat that would be lost by transmitting it through the walls of container . In addition, by not boiling water  in container  baking precipitates onto the inner walls of container  is eliminated to reduce maintenance tasks, and relatively expensive stainless steel is not required so that less expensive and more readily available materials such as porcelain, glass, or plastics may be used. Distillation system  of this invention is uncomplicated and utilizes commercially available modules in PE  to assure high reliability, and can be powered by 12 V or 24 V DC power sources to be safer, have reduced power requirements, and could have power conversion and controls mounted in plug modules isolated from the high heat and high moisture environment where distillation occurs.","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of this invention may be adapted. Distillation system  can be in different sizes and configurations and fabricated from a number of different materials chosen to assure long term reliable operation under different operational requirements. Its uncomplicated, compact design, lack of possibly objectionable by-products, and use of commercially available constituents allows its use in confined spaces under adverse conditions.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Distillation system  provides a quick and cost-effective way to distill liquid, including water, without introducing unnecessary complications or creating burdensome weight and size constraints. Therefore, distillation system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":"The FIGURE shows a cross-sectional view of a distillation system having a thermoelectric section including a Peltier effect device interposed between a heating section and condenser section in accordance with this invention."},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
