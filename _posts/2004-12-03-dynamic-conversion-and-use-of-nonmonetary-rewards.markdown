title: Dynamic conversion and use of non-monetary rewards
abstract: Techniques are described for using loyalty program points and other non-monetary loyalty rewards from a first organization in a monetary manner at a distinct second organization, such as to acquire an item from a merchant at a cost that is reduced by a monetary amount based on the loyalty reward used. In some situations, the first organization programmatically interacts with a merchant to cause a gift certificate to be dynamically created for the merchant in an appropriate monetary amount, and later applies the gift certificate to reduce the cost of the item acquisition. In addition, in some situations such acquiring of items by a user from a merchant is performed based on interactions between the user and the merchant that are performed so as to appear to the user to be with the first organization and such that subsequent interactions continue between the user and the first organization.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for using loyalty program points and other loyalty rewards.","Merchants use a variety of techniques to establish loyalty with their customers, such as to foster repeat business and referrals from those customers. One popular technique for merchants and other organizations to establish loyalty is to employ a loyalty program (also referred to as \u201crewards\u201d or \u201cincentive\u201d programs) that allows affiliated users to earn rewards based on their actions. For example, in loyalty programs provided by merchants, customers of the merchants may typically earn loyalty program points for joining the program and for each dollar spent with the merchant, and may later use their earned points to obtain various benefits. Examples of types of merchants that often provide such loyalty programs include airlines (e.g., via frequent flier programs), rental car companies, hotels, credit card companies, online and brick-and-mortar retailers of various types, etc.","As noted, after users earn sufficient loyalty program points from an organization, they can typically use those points to gain various benefits from the organization. In particular, a user may be able to use loyalty program points from an organization to obtain discounts on and\/or free copies of items from the organization (including products, goods, services, information, etc. that are available from the organization for purchase, rent, lease, license, trade, evaluation, sampling, etc.). For example, a user having sufficient loyalty program points from an airline may be able to obtain one or more free flights from the airline and\/or one or more upgrades from a basic level of service to a higher level of service (e.g., to upgrade to first class). Similarly, a user having sufficient loyalty program points from an online retailer may be able to acquire one or more items from the retailer at a discount or for free.","In some situations, an organization may allow users having points in the organization's loyalty program to use those points to gain benefits from other affiliated organizations. Thus, for example, a user having sufficient loyalty program points with a first merchant may be able to obtain a gift certificate from a second merchant who is affiliated with the first merchant. After receiving that gift certificate, the user may then use the gift certificate to assist in acquiring goods from the second merchant. Such inter-organization use of loyalty program points provides expanded options for customers of the first merchant to benefit from the loyalty program, thus enhancing the value of the program to the customer, as well as providing benefits to the first and second merchants.","Unfortunately, such inter-organization use of loyalty program points also creates various problems. One significant problem is that the conversion of loyalty program points from a first organization to a gift certificate or other benefit from a second organization is typically a time-consuming process that may take numerous days and is susceptible to manual processing errors at one or both of the organizations. Thus, a user may be disinclined to engage in such a conversion, lowering the value to the first organization in providing such an option for loyalty point use. Moreover, by directing a user to engage in transactions directly with the second organization, a user may be less inclined to continue engaging in additional transactions with the first merchant.","A software facility is described that facilitates using loyalty program points and other non-monetary loyalty rewards from a first organization to gain a monetary benefit at a distinct second organization. In some embodiments, the second organization is a merchant (e.g., a Web retailer or other online retailer), and the use of the loyalty rewards from the first organization includes acquiring items from the merchant at a cost that is reduced by a monetary amount based on the loyalty reward used (e.g., based on the number of loyalty program points). In addition, in some such embodiments providing of the items from the merchant to a user is based on interactions between the user and the merchant that are performed in such a manner as to appear to the user to be with the first organization and such that subsequent interactions continue between the user and the first organization.","In particular, in some embodiments a user first interacts with one or more computing systems of a first organization from which the user has earned loyalty program points, such as based on one or more Web pages provided to the user by the computing systems. After the user selects to use at least some of his\/her earned loyalty program points in a monetary manner to facilitate acquiring one or more items from a second merchant (e.g., by using a user-selectable control on one of the provided Web pages), a computing system of the first organization interacts with one or more computing systems of the second merchant to provide information about those loyalty program points and to obtain an indicator for a gift certificate of the second merchant, with the gift certificate being dynamically created by the second merchant so as to have an amount that is based on those loyalty program points. When the user is ready to acquire one or more indicated items of the second merchant (e.g., as indicated by the user based on a selection of a user-selectable control on a Web page from the first organization), a computing system of the first organization provides that information to a computing system of the second merchant along with the gift certificate indicator.","A computing system of the second merchant then dynamically assumes control of interactions with the user in order to complete the item acquisition transaction (e.g., by sending one or more Web pages to the user to obtain item delivery information and\/or information regarding additional payment for the item acquisition), with the cost of the item acquisition reduced by the amount of the gift certificate. In at least some embodiments, the interactions with the user by the second merchant are performed so as to appear to the user to continue to be with the first organization (e.g., by the Web pages from the second merchant including logos of the first organization and\/or other information to provide a visual representation similar or identical to that of the Web pages provided to the user by the first organization). After the item acquisition transaction is completed by the computing system(s) of the second merchant, control of further interactions with the user is returned to the first organization so that the user can continue to interact with one or more computing systems of the first organization. The various described activities can each be performed in various ways in various embodiments, as discussed in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","110","105","105","110","120"],"i":["a ","j "]},"As an illustrative example of using loyalty program points of one of the merchants  to assist in acquiring one or more items from another merchant, consider interactions between Customer 1 and Merchant A. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment, computing systems (not shown) of Customer 1 and Merchant A perform various interactions  in which Merchant A provides various information to Customer 1 using one or more Web pages (not shown), and in which Customer 1 provides various instructions to Merchant A (e.g., via selections of user-selectable controls on those Web pages). For example, Merchant A may provide information to Customer 1 to indicate information about its loyalty program, such as a current number of earned loyalty program points for Customer 1, information about opportunities to earn more loyalty program points, and opportunities for Customer 1 to use earned loyalty program points to obtain benefits from Merchant A.","In addition, Merchant A also provides information to Customer 1 in the illustrated embodiment about one or more options for using earned loyalty program points to obtain benefits from distinct Merchant MM , such as information about specific items available from or via Merchant MM (e.g., items that are not available from Merchant A) that may be obtained at specific discounts or specific discounted prices by using specific numbers of earned loyalty program points. For example, Merchant A may provide information to Customer 1 to indicate that an item AA (not shown) has a normal price of $100, but that Customer 1 may obtain a $30 discount on item AA by using 500 of his\/her loyalty program points from Merchant A. Alternatively, Merchant A may inform Customer 1 that he\/she may obtain item AA for $70 by using 500 loyalty program points, but without indicating details of the original price or of the specific amount of the discount. In some embodiments, such information may be provided about multiple items from one or more other merchants, and multiple options for using loyalty program points may further be provided in some situations (e.g., to use 500 loyalty program points to obtain a $30 discount on item AA, to use 1000 loyalty program points to obtain a $65 discount, or to use 500 loyalty program points to obtain an item BB normally priced at $25 for free). Furthermore, in some embodiments such information about available items may be provided to Customer 1 without any price-related information, such as to merely indicate that item BB is available for 500 loyalty program points (e.g., without providing any options for using fewer loyalty program points to obtain only a partial discount on the cost of the item).","In this manner, Merchant A may select specific items available from Merchant MM to make available to Customer 1 as options to be acquired using his\/her loyalty program points, such as items selected to reinforce Merchant A's brand or image. Merchant A may select items as options for customers in various ways, such as to select different items for different customers and\/or to dynamically vary items being offered based on various factors (e.g., based on a price of the item at Merchant MM and\/or based on any incentives offered by Merchant MM to Merchant A related to specific items). In addition, Merchant A in some embodiments may dynamically vary the monetary values corresponding to specified numbers of loyalty program points in various ways, such as based on the customer (e.g., on a value of the customer to Merchant A and\/or on other information about the customer), on a number of earned points that a customer has, on current market conditions, on a current day and\/or time, etc. In some embodiments, Merchant MM may further offer items from one or more other partner merchants or otherwise affiliated other merchants (not shown) or otherwise facilitate acquisition of items from such other merchants (e.g., if Merchant MM provides order processing capabilities for those other merchants while they handle order fulfillment, or if Merchant MM provides order processing and order fulfillment for those other merchants while they handle other business activities), the items offered by Merchant A to Customer 1 may include items from one or more of those other merchants. Moreover, in some embodiments Customer 1 may be informed that item AA will be supplied by Merchant MM (or another merchant affiliated with Merchant MM) rather than Merchant A, while in other embodiments Customer 1 may not receive any information about item AA being supplied by a merchant other than Merchant A, or may merely be informed that item AA will be provided by a merchant other than Merchant A without including details of the identity of Merchant MM.","To enable providing information to Customer 1 about specific items available from Merchant MM at specific prices, Merchant A may obtain such information in various ways. In some embodiments, such information may be previously obtained by Merchant A in an offline manner and stored for later use. Alternatively, Merchant A may retrieve information from Merchant MM dynamically in a programmatic manner at the time of the interactions with Customer 1, such as based on an appropriate API (\u201capplication programming interface\u201d) provided by Merchant MM. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment Merchant MM has one or more commerce servers  with which users and affiliated organizations can interact to perform shopping-related activities. The servers  in the illustrated embodiment include both an interactive shopping interface  with which customers can interact to perform shopping-related activities (e.g., based on Web pages provided to the customers from the commerce servers) and a programmatic shopping API with which appropriate executing programs can programmatically interact to exchange shopping-related information. Thus, for example, an executing program on a computing system of Merchant A may use the API to programmatically interact with a Merchant MM commerce server to obtain information about items currently available from Merchant MM, such as from stored item information .","Such programmatic interactions between programs and computing systems may occur in various ways, such as by Merchant A invoking one or more Web services provided by Merchant MM as part of the API . More generally, various mechanisms exist to allow computers and executing software applications to programmatically interact. For example, remote procedure call (\u201cRPC\u201d) protocols have long existed that allow a program on one computer to cause a program on another computer to be executed, and various object-oriented architectures such as CORBA (\u201cCommon Object Request Broker Architecture\u201d) and DCOM (\u201cDistributed Component Object Model\u201d) provide similar capabilities. In addition, a variety of middleware programs have been implemented to connect separate applications (often of distinct types and from unrelated sources) to allow communication. Various EDI (\u201cElectronic Data Interchange\u201d) networks also exist that provide standard mechanisms to allow a computer system of one user of the network to send data to a computer system of another user of the network. The widespread popularity of the World Wide Web (\u201cWeb\u201d) has provided additional opportunities for computers to inter-communicate. For example, while much current Web use involves users interactively requesting Web pages from Web servers (e.g., via executing Web browser applications of the users) and receiving the requested information in response, there is also growing use of the Web to support the programmatic interaction of remote applications to exchange information via defined APIs, such as via Web services. Such Web services allow heterogeneous applications and computers to interact, and can be defined and implemented using a variety of underlying protocols and techniques. For example, some Web service implementations return data in XML (\u201ceXtensible Markup Language\u201d) format using HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d) in response to a Web service invocation request specified as a URI (\u201cUniform Resource Identifier\u201d), such as a URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d) that includes a specified operation and one or more query parameters. In other implementations, additional underlying protocols are used for various purposes, such as SOAP (\u201cSimple Object Access Protocol\u201d) for standard message exchange, WSDL (\u201cWeb Services Description Language\u201d) for description of service invocations, and UDDI (\u201cUniversal Description, Discovery, and Integration service\u201d) for discovery of available services.","After Customer 1 selects an option provided by Merchant A to use a specified number of loyalty program points to facilitate acquiring one or more items from Merchant MM, such as to use 500 loyalty program points from Merchant A to obtain a $30 discount on item AA, Merchant A dynamically interacts with Merchant MM in a programmatic manner to initiate that item acquisition. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment Merchant A programmatically interacts with Merchant MM to cause a $30 gift certificate from Merchant MM to be created, and then uses that gift certificate as part of acquiring item AA. The dynamic gift certificate creation process is enabled in this illustrated embodiment by a loyalty points-to-gift certificate (or \u201cLPTGC\u201d) conversion server  that is provided by Merchant MM, although in other embodiments such an LPTGC conversion server could be provided in other manners (e.g., by using an LPTGC conversion server that is independent from any particular merchant, such as to provide functionality for Merchant MM and for multiple other unrelated merchants, or instead by Merchant MM incorporating some or all of the functionality of the LPTGC conversion server as part of one or more of the commerce servers ).","In the illustrated embodiment, the LPTGC conversion server provides an API  to allow various functionality to be programmatically accessed. Thus, to initiate the Merchant MM gift certificate creation based on Customer 1's selection, Merchant A performs programmatic interactions  with a portion of the LPTGC conversion server API to provide information about the gift certificate to be created and, after a gift certificate for Merchant MM in the amount of $30 is dynamically created, to receive an indicator (e.g., a unique identifier) for the gift certificate from the LPTGC conversion server for later use in referencing the gift certificate. Various information regarding the created gift certificate may then be stored by Merchant A, such as the indicator, an indication of the gift certificate amount, an indication that the gift certificate is for the benefit of Customer 1, an indication of the loyalty program points used for the gift certificate, etc. The interactions to cause the gift certificate to be created may be performed in various ways, including by Merchant A providing information about the specific amount of the gift certificate (e.g., without providing information about how many loyalty program points are being used and\/or about which customer has initiated the gift certificate creation), about the specific loyalty points selected, about the customer for whom the gift certificate is being created, and\/or about one or more items to be acquired using the gift certificate. If Merchant A does not provide information about the specific amount of the gift certificate, the LPTGC conversion server and\/or Merchant MM may automatically determine a corresponding value for a specified loyalty program reward in various ways, such as based on previously acquired information about how to convert loyalty program points from Merchant A to gift certificate amounts (e.g., based on a prior registration or setup process performed by Merchant A), based on information obtained from a third party regarding a value to assign (e.g., by offering the loyalty program rewards for sale to other users), based on current market conditions for the LPTGC conversion server and\/or Merchant MM (e.g., current demand for some or all items, such as the items indicated to be acquired), on information about the customer for whom the gift certificate is being created (e.g., based on a value of the customer to Merchant MM and\/or on other information available to the LPTGC conversion server and\/or Merchant MM about the customer), and\/or based on currency values for a currency in which the gift certificate amount will be represented.","After the LPTGC conversion server receives the information from Merchant A via the API , the information is forwarded to a Gift Certificate (\u201cGC\u201d) Creation Manager component  for processing. In the illustrated embodiment, the GC Creation Manager first authenticates that Merchant A is who provided the information (e.g., based on a credential or other identifying information provided by Merchant A), and then validates that Merchant A is authorized to request this gift certificate creation. In particular, the LPTGC conversion server may enforce restrictions of various types for some or all of the merchants  who access the functionality provided by the LPTGC conversion server, including how often a merchant may request gift certificate creation and what gift certificate amounts may be requested (e.g., to enforce minimum or maximum thresholds, or to enforce that amounts be in a certain form, such as in multiples of $5 dollars). More generally, in some embodiments some or all merchants may need to have a predefined account with the LPTGC conversion server before requesting gift certificate creation, such as based on a prior registration by the merchant with the LPTGC conversion server, and if so the GC Creation Manager may use stored merchant information  to verify whether such an account exists and whether any merchant-specific restrictions on gift certificate creation exist.","In addition to validating that Merchant A is authorized to request the gift certificate creation, the GC Creation Manager may also verify that Merchant A has sufficient funds or is otherwise capable of providing for payment to cover the amount of the gift certificate (or that Merchant A is allowed to perform the gift certificate creation without such sufficient payment), as in at least some embodiments Merchant A will compensate Merchant MM in an amount based on the amount of the gift certificate (e.g., the exact amount of gift certificate, the gift certificate amount minus a referral fee to Merchant A, the gift certificate amount plus a processing fee charged by Merchant MM and\/or an independent LPTGC conversion server, etc.). Moreover, in some embodiments Merchant MM may take steps to immediately obtain compensation from Merchant A for the gift certificate, such as debiting an account of Merchant A, generating an invoice to be sent to Merchant A, etc.","If Merchant A is not sufficiently authenticated or the creation of the gift certificate is not sufficiently validated or otherwise authorized, an error message may be programmatically returned to Merchant A. Otherwise, the GC Creation Manager proceeds to cause the gift certificate to be dynamically generated and to send an indicator for the gift certificate to Merchant A, as well as to store information about the gift certificate creation with various stored merchant-related information  (e.g., to store a generated transaction identifier along with information about the gift certificate created during the transaction). In particular, in the illustrated embodiment the commerce server includes a GC Manager component  via which gift certificates can be created, such as by customers via the interactive shopping interface . The GC Creation Manager programmatically interacts with the GC Manager (e.g., via the programmatic API ) to cause the gift certificate to be created, and the GC Manager stores information about the gift certificate (e.g., the amount, any time-related or other restrictions on the use of the gift certificate, and an indication of Merchant A or of another entity authorized to use the gift certificate as part of a transaction, such as Customer 1 in some embodiments if that information is provided to Merchant MM) as part of gift certificate information  on the commerce server. In the illustrated embodiment the GC Manager generates and provides the indicator for the gift certificate to the GC Creation Manager for forwarding to Merchant A. In other embodiments, the gift certificate creation may be performed in other manners, such as by having a single Merchant MM component that handles the gift certificate creation, or by directing Merchant A's computing system to programmatically interact directly with the GC Manager component after the gift certification creation is validated and authorized.","In addition to performing programmatic interactions  to initiate creation of the gift certificate, Merchant A may also perform other interactions with Merchant MM. For example, if Customer 1 has not indicated to immediately complete the acquisition of item AA, a computing system of Merchant A may programmatically interact (not shown) with the commerce server via the programmatic API in order to add item AA to a virtual shopping cart for Customer 1 at Merchant MM. To have such a shopping cart at Merchant MM, Customer 1 may need to have an established account with Merchant MM, such as based on optional interactions  that may have previously occurred between Customer 1 and the interactive shopping interface of Merchant MM's commerce server and that are reflected in stored customer account information  on the commerce server. If Customer 1 does not have such an account with Merchant MM, Merchant A may instead facilitate dynamic creation of such an account (not shown) for Customer 1, such as by temporarily transferring control of interactions with Customer 1 to the commerce server in order to allow account creation by Customer 1 to occur privately such that Merchant A does not have access to passwords or other private account-related information, or alternatively by Merchant A to participate in such account creation in order to store account-related information for Customer 1 at Merchant MM to facilitate later interactions with Merchant MM on behalf of Customer 1. In some embodiments, Merchant A may further assist in the account creation process by providing information to Merchant MM about Customer 1 that is known to Merchant A, such as Customer 1's name, delivery address and preferred payment source.","After Customer 1 has indicated an intention to Merchant A to complete the acquisition of item AA, such as based on selection of a user-selectable control on a Web page provided to Customer 1 from Merchant A, a computing system of Merchant A dynamically interacts with Merchant MM in a programmatic manner to initiate that item acquisition completion. In particular, Merchant A performs programmatic interactions  with a portion of the LPTGC conversion server API to provide information about the item acquisition and about the gift certificate to be used to reduce the cost of the acquisition (e.g., by supplying the indicator for the gift certificate). After the item acquisition is completed, Merchant MM notifies Merchant A so that interactions between Merchant A and Customer 1 may continue, such as by returning control of interactions with Customer 1 to Merchant A after temporarily assuming such control in order to complete the item acquisition.","The interactions between Merchant A and Merchant MM to initiate the item acquisition completion may be performed in various ways. For example, the initial indication from Customer 1 to Merchant A to select the loyalty point usage option for item AA may have included an indication to immediately complete the item acquisition, and if so the programmatic interactions  may occur immediately after the programmatic interactions . Moreover, in that situation, information about item AA may be provided to Merchant MM as part of the programmatic interactions  rather than by placing that item in a shopping cart for Customer . Alternatively, after initially indicating to select the loyalty point option for use with item AA, Customer 1 may have made additional indications to Merchant A of other items to acquire from Merchant MM and\/or of other loyalty point usage options to use before ultimately indicating to complete the acquisition of the indicated items, and if so Merchant A performs additional programmatic interactions (not shown) with Merchant MM to create gift certificates corresponding to any such selected loyalty point usage options and\/or to provide information about any additional selected items to be acquired. In addition, Merchant A may provide updates to Customer 1 regarding the items currently available in his\/her shopping cart based on Customer 1's selections (whether or not the shopping cart information is indicated to Customer 1 to correspond to Merchant MM), such as to include corresponding price information based on the use of the selected loyalty point usage options.","After the LPTGC conversion server receives the information from Merchant A via the API regarding completion of the item acquisition, the information is forwarded to a GC-Based Item Acquisition Manager component  for processing. In the illustrated embodiment, the GC-Based Item Acquisition Manager performs initial processing similar to that performed by the GC Creation Manager, including to first authenticate that Merchant A is who provided the information and to then validate that Merchant A is authorized to perform this action.","In addition, in some embodiments the LPTGC conversion server and\/or commerce server use additional techniques to verify that created gift certificates are used only by authorized parties. For example, in some embodiments the LPTGC conversion server and\/or commerce server generate a unique set of information each time that Merchant A adds an item to Customer 1's shopping cart, and provides that set of information to Merchant A. When Merchant A later initiates the completion of the item acquisition process for Customer 1, Merchant A supplies the last set of information received from Merchant MM for Customer 1. Merchant MM then dynamically generates a new set of information based on the information currently in Customer 1's shopping cart, and verifies that the provided set of information matches the newly generated set of information in order to authorize the item acquisition completion using the indicated gift certificate. As long as the method of generating the set of information provides consistent results based on the items in the shopping cart, this check provides additional assurance that the party indicating to use a gift certificate created on behalf of a merchant is that merchant. The set of information may also be encrypted in various ways before being provided to Merchant A, such as in a 1-way manner to prevent easy modification of the information in the set that is provided back to Merchant MM. Various types of information may be included in the set of information in various embodiments, including a unique identifier for Customer 1 and\/or Customer 1's shopping cart, a unique identifier corresponding to Merchant MM and\/or the Web site provided by Merchant MM, and\/or the indicator or other unique identifier for the gift certificate created for use with acquiring the items in the shopping cart. In addition, various other information may be included in the set of information but not required to be an exact match, such as a timestamp corresponding to when the set of information was generated.","If it is determined that Merchant A is not sufficiently authenticated or that the item acquisition completion is not sufficiently validated or otherwise authorized, an error message may be programmatically returned to Merchant A. Otherwise, the GC-Based Item Acquisition Manager proceeds to interact with the commerce server (e.g., via the programmatic API ) to initiate the completion of the acquisition of the item(s) for Customer 1. As part of completing the item acquisition, the GC-Based Item Acquisition Manager and\/or commerce server retrieves information from the stored gift certificate information  for the one or more gift certificates whose indicators were supplied by Merchant A, so that the values of the gift certificates are applied to the item acquisition cost\u2014if the value of the gift certificate(s) exceed the cost of acquiring the items, the surplus value can be handled by Merchant MM in various ways, such as by applying the amount as a credit to Customer 1's account, by returning the surplus value to Merchant A (e.g., via a newly created gift certificate in that amount), or by retaining the surplus amount as being forfeited. The commerce server also stores information about the item acquisition with stored order information , and the LPTGC conversion server stores information about the use of the gift certificate along with merchant information  stored on the LPGTC server (e.g., to store a generated transaction identifier to represent the use of the gift certificate during the acquisition of the items, along with the indicator of the gift certificate used).","In the illustrated embodiment, the LPTGC conversion server and\/or commerce server assumes temporary control of interactions with Customer 1, and performs interactions  with Customer 1 to obtain any needed information and\/or confirmation to complete the acquisition (e.g., to obtain information to authenticate Customer 1, such as based on a password previously defined by Customer 1; to obtain a confirmation by Customer 1 to pay the balanced owed, if any, after applying the discounts associated with the gift certificate(s) being used for the item acquisition; etc.), such as by sending one or more Web pages to Customer 1's computing system via the interactive interface and receiving responses from Customer 1 via selections and\/or information provided in forms on the Web page. While in the illustrated embodiment these interactions may occur directly between one or Merchant MM and Customer 1 without Merchant A's involvement, in other embodiments some or all such interactions could instead be controlled (e.g., mediated) by Merchant A, such as is illustrated by the optional portion of the interactions that passes through Merchant A. Alternatively, if the interactions do not include Merchant A, in some embodiments at least some of the information exchanged between Customer 1 and Merchant MM is provided to Merchant A by Merchant MM in order to provide information to Merchant A about the ultimate transaction that involves the use of Merchant A's loyalty program points, such as to notify Merchant A of changes made by Customer 1 to the order when interacting directly with Merchant MM (e.g., to remove indicated items from the order and\/or to add additional items to the order)\u2014furthermore, in some embodiments at least some such additional changes to the order may not be allowed, such as based on restrictions on how Merchant A's loyalty program points can be used.","Moreover, in at least some embodiments, the interactions  between Merchant MM and Customer 1 are performed by Merchant MM in such a manner as to minimize or eliminate indications to Customer 1 that the interactions have changed from Merchant A to Merchant MM, such as by Merchant MM storing information about the visual representations that Merchant A uses for its Web pages and using that stored information for its own Web pages when interacting with Customer 1. In that manner, Customer 1 continues to see a consistent visual \u201cstorefront\u201d associated with Merchant A, and is more inclined to continue subsequent interactions with Merchant A.","Thus, as described, the LPTGC conversion server facilities using non-monetary loyalty program points from Merchant A in a monetary manner at Merchant MM, such as to benefit Merchant A's customer. While not illustrated in this example, Merchant A can perform many such interactions for its various customers, and other merchants  can similarly perform such interactions for their customers. In addition, while the LPTGC conversion server is provided by Merchant MM in this example, in other examples the LPTGC conversion server may provide similar functionality for multiple distinct merchants.","In the illustrated embodiment, the LPTGC conversion server further provides functionality to allow merchants  to monitor their use of their loyalty program points. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, Merchant A performs additional programmatic interactions  with a portion of the LPTGC conversion server API to request and receive information about its use of LPTGC conversion server functionality. After the LPTGC conversion server receives the request from Merchant A, the request is forwarded to a GC Usage Monitor Manager component  for processing. In the illustrated embodiment, the GC Usage Monitor Manager performs initial processing similar to that performed by the GC Creation Manager, including to first authenticate that Merchant A is who sent the request and to then validate that Merchant A is authorized to receive the requested information.","If Merchant A is not sufficiently authenticated or the request is not authorized, an error message may be programmatically returned to Merchant A. Otherwise, the GC Usage Monitor Manager retrieves stored merchant information  corresponding to the request, and provides the retrieved information to Merchant A. The retrieved information may include, for example, a history of transactions that have used gift certificates created based on loyalty program points from Merchant A, details about one or more transactions whose payment was provided at least in part based on such gift certificates, the status of one or more transactions that use such gift certificates, etc. The information from the LPTGC conversion server may also be provided in a variety of ways, including as a transaction report having various types of information about multiple relevant transactions. Merchant A may supply various criteria related to the information requested, such as a time period of interest, indications of one or more transaction identifiers of interest for which information is desired, indications of one or more transaction report identifiers, etc.","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments have been and will be described in which specific types of loyalty program rewards are used in specific manners to gain specific types of benefits. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques of the invention can be used in a wide variety of other situations, and that the invention is not limited to the details discussed in the illustrative examples. For example, while in various places a \u201cmerchant\u201d and\/or \u201conline retailer\u201d is discussed, it will be appreciated that these terms may include a wide variety of organization and entities, including (without limitation) online shopping malls and item acquisition brokers (including aggregators, consolidators, comparison sites, shopping-related search sites, referral sites, etc.).","As one example, in various embodiments \u201cgift certificates\u201d are created and used by merchants or other organizations. Such gift certificates may generally include a variety of mechanisms for storing monetary value for later use, such as gift cards having a programmable value, smart cards and other cards in which monetary value may be removed and added, coupons having a specified value, discounts and\/or credits that are stored and\/or used in a manner associated with one or more entities (e.g., by applying them to a monetary balance for an account of a customer or by associating them with an account for later application as directed by an owner of the account), and more generally any gift or other monetary record that stores information about a monetary value available for use (e.g., by information stored in a database). Additional information related to techniques for storing and using monetary values that may be used as gift certificates in at least some embodiments is included in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/894,347, filed Jul. 19, 2004 and entitled \u201cAutomatic Authorization Of Programmatic Transactions\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In addition, while in some embodiments gift certificates are created, stored and used without generating a physical embodiment or representation of the gift certificates (e.g., by storing and accessing information related to the gift certificate), in other embodiments such physical embodiments or representations may be created in at least some situations. As one example, the LPTGC Conversion server may cause a gift certificate being created to have a physical representation or embodiment that is then transported or otherwise sent to an indicated recipient. As another example, in some embodiments various types of physical transaction devices may be available to users (e.g., ATM machines, electronic kiosks, coin change machines, etc.), and the devices may allow users to access various functionality related to loyalty program points and\/or other loyalty program rewards of the users (e.g., to provide information to the users about such rewards, such as based on interacting with a remote LPTGC conversion server having that information and\/or by reading information stored on a physical card or device carried by the user). In particular, the physical transaction devices may be able to perform at least some of the types of functionality of an LPTGC Conversion server (whether as a standalone device or via communications with a distinct network-accessible LPTGC Conversion server), including causing a gift certificate to be created based on loyalty program rewards of the user and\/or providing a physical embodiment or representation of a gift certificate for the user (e.g., by printing a paper gift certificate, by electronically adding value to a stored value card of the user, etc.). In some embodiments, a computing system with an appropriate output device may similarly be able to act as a physical transaction device, such as to print a gift certificate on a printer output device and\/or to store information about a gift certificate on various types of recordable media. Alternatively, the physical transaction device may in some embodiments not produce such physical embodiments of gift certificates, such as to instead allow the user to associate an electronic gift certificate with an account of the user without providing a physical representation of that electronic gift certificate. More generally, in some embodiments such physical transaction devices may provide functionality to assist users in creating gift certificates at one or more merchants (e.g., merchants that provide the physical transaction devices, that are otherwise affiliated with the devices, that are affiliated with an LPTGC conversion server that provides or is otherwise affiliated with the device, etc.) based on a type of compensation or other value that is unrelated to loyalty program rewards, such as based on money (e.g., an amount of money equal to or greater than the amount of the gift certificate being created) that is supplied by and\/or promised by the user (e.g., based on charging a credit card of the user, based on debiting a bank account or other monetary source of the user, based on cash provided by the user to the physical transaction device, etc.)\u2014if so, at least some of the compensation or other value may be provided to the merchant and\/or to an LPTGC conversion server affiliated with the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","205","210","220","230","211","212","213","215","240","242","244","248"]},"Various computing systems  of organizations having loyalty programs (e.g., merchants) may initially interact with the LPTGC Conversion system in order to define accounts to allow the organizations to use the functionality provided by the LPTGC Conversion system on behalf of users associated with the organizations (e.g., customers of the merchants)\u2014in some embodiments, some or all of the organizations are unaffiliated with the organization providing the LPTGC Conversion system other than based on use of the LPTGC Conversion system's functionality, while in other embodiments some or all of the organizations may instead be affiliated with the organization providing the LPTGC Conversion system in various ways. In response, the LPTGC Conversion system may store various information  about each of the organizations, such as information on how the organization will compensate the LPTGC Conversion system for any gift certificates or other benefits having a monetary value that are provided to the organization, and\/or information on any restrictions on how and\/or when the organization may use functionality provided by the LPTGC Conversion system.","The organization computing systems may also each use a user interacter component  (e.g., a Web server program or application program) to interact with various users affiliated with the organization, such as by exchanging information with one or more user computing systems . The organization computing systems may also each store various information  related to the users, such as information about any loyalty program points or other rewards earned by the users, and may include that information in the information provided to the users.","When an organization computing system determines to interact with the LPTGC Conversion system to obtain monetary-based benefits based on the loyalty program provided by the organization (e.g., on behalf of a user affiliated with the organization, such as in response to a corresponding request or instruction from the user), an LPTGC Conversion system interacter component  communicates with the LPTGC Conversion system, such as an executing program that will programmatically interact with the LPTGC Conversion system by invoking appropriate functionality in an API (not shown) provided by the LPTGC Conversion system. As previously discussed, the components of the LPTGC Conversion system will then provide corresponding functionality as appropriate, such as to facilitate creation of gift certificates for one or more item ordering systems  of merchants and to facilitate use of created gift certificates to acquire items from the item ordering systems, as well as to optionally provide various monitoring information regarding use of the LPTGC Conversion system's functionality by the organization. In this illustrated embodiment, the LPTGC Conversion system is independent of any single merchant from which items will be acquired using monetary benefits based on the loyalty program of an organization, although in other embodiments the LPTGC Conversion system may instead be provided by or otherwise affiliated with a particular such merchant.","In addition, as part of providing its functionality, the LPTGC Conversion system may further interact with users via the computing systems , such as to establish accounts for the users with one or more merchants and\/or to obtain information from the users in order to complete acquisitions of items from the merchants. In some embodiments, such interactions by the LPTGC Conversion system with the users are performed so as to maintain a consistent interface being provided to the users during interactions with one or more of the organization computing systems and with the interactions with the LPTGC Conversion system, such as by the LPTGC Conversion system using stored organization information  to provide information that when presented to the users appears similar (e.g., substantially similar or identical) to the information from one of the organizations when presented to the user.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that computing systems ,  and  are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Computing system  may instead be comprised of multiple interacting computing systems or devices, and may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated, including through one or more networks such as the Internet or via the World Wide Web (\u201cWeb\u201d). More generally, a \u201cclient\u201d or \u201cserver\u201d computing system or device may comprise any combination of hardware or software that can interact in the described manners, including (without limitation) desktop or other computers, network devices, PDAs, cellphones, cordless phones, devices with walkie-talkie and other push-to-talk capabilities, pagers, electronic organizers, Internet appliances, television-based systems (e.g., using set-top boxes and\/or personal\/digital video recorders), and various other consumer products that include appropriate inter-communication capabilities. In addition, the functionality provided by the illustrated LPTGC Conversion system components may in some embodiments be combined in fewer components or distributed in additional components. Similarly, in some embodiments the functionality of some of the illustrated components may not be provided and\/or other additional functionality may be available.","Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that, while various items are illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used, these items or portions of them can be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively, in other embodiments some or all of the software components and\/or modules may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing system via inter-computer communication. Some or all of the system components or data structures may also be stored (e.g., as software instructions or structured data) on a computer-readable medium, such as a hard disk, a memory, a network, or a portable media article to be read by an appropriate drive or via an appropriate connection. The system components and data structures can also be transmitted via generated data signals (e.g., by being encoded in a carrier wave or otherwise included as part of an analog or digital propagated signal) on a variety of computer-readable transmission mediums, including wireless-based and wired\/cable-based mediums, and can take a variety of forms (e.g., as part of a single or multiplexed analog signal, or as multiple discrete digital packets or frames). Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly, the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","100","270"]},"The routine begins in step , where an indication is received of a loyalty program reward earned by a user from the organization that is to be used in a monetary manner with a distinct merchant, such as an indication received from the user based on an interaction with a Web page provided to the user from a computing system of the organization. The routine then continues to step  to determine a monetary value at the merchant for the indicated loyalty program reward\u2014in some embodiments, however, the monetary value determination is made prior to receiving the indication in step , such as if one or more options were provided to the user for using specified loyalty program rewards of the user to receive specified monetary values, and if the indication in step  is based on a selection by the user of one of the options.","In the illustrated embodiment, the merchant provides its own LPTGC conversion functionality, and thus the routine continues in step  by sending information to the merchant to cause a gift certificate from the merchant having a monetary value as determined in step  to be dynamically created, with the routine receiving an indication of a unique indicator for the created gift certificate from the merchant. The sent information may include various pieces of information in various embodiments (e.g., an indication of the determined monetary value, identity information for the organization, information about the user, information about the specified loyalty program reward, etc.), and the sending may be performed in various ways (e.g., in a programmatic manner, such as by using an API provided by the merchant).","After receiving one or more indications of items to be acquired from the merchant in step , the routine continues to step  to send information to the merchant to initiate acquisition of those items using the created gift certificate. As with step , the sent information may include various pieces of information in various embodiments (e.g., an indication of the items, identity information for the organization, information about the user, the received indicator for the gift certificate to be used, etc.), and the sending may be performed in various ways (e.g., in a programmatic manner, such as by using an API provided by the merchant). In addition, the indications of the items may be received at other times in other embodiments, such as in step  if information previously provided to the user included information about one or more items available from the merchant.","The routine then continues to step  to determine whether to continue. If so, the routine returns to step , and if not continues to step  and ends. As the routine is performed multiple times for one or more users, the routine may in some embodiments interact with multiple different merchants to facilitate acquiring items from those merchants. In addition, while not illustrated here, the routine may provide a variety of additional types of functionality in other embodiments, including interacting with one or more merchants to monitor use of loyalty program rewards from the organization at that merchant. Moreover, in some embodiments the routine may interact with a merchant in a manner to support a shopping cart model at the merchant, such as by adding one or more items to a shopping cart of a user at the merchant, and then initiating a checkout process for the items in the shopping cart.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","184","242"]},"The routine begins at step , where an indication is received from an organization to create a gift certificate corresponding to a loyalty program reward of a user affiliated with the organization. The indication may be received, for example, based on a programmatic interaction from the organization, such as previously discussed with respect to step  of , and may include various types of information as indicated with respect to that step. In optional step , if the organization did not provide an indication of the monetary value for the gift certificate, the routine attempts to determine a monetary value to use, such as based on an indication of the loyalty program reward being used and a predefined mapping for the organization that provides a monetary value corresponding to the loyalty program reward, although in some embodiments the organization may supply the monetary value to use in all such situations.","In step , the routine then determines whether the indicated gift certificate creation is authorized, such as based on authenticating the identity of the organization and\/or validating that the organization is authorized to perform this type of activity and to have a gift certificate created in the indicated amount\u2014if the gift certificate creation is not authorized (not shown), an error message may be sent to the organization and the routine may return to step  or continue to step . The routine then continues to step  to create the gift certificate, which in the illustrated embodiment involves storing corresponding information about the gift certificate without creating a physical paper, card or other embodiment corresponding to the gift certificate, although in other embodiments gift certificates may be created in other manners (e.g., by creating an appropriate physical embodiment of the gift certificate). In step , a unique indicator for the gift certificate is then sent to the organization for later use, although in other embodiments the created gift certificate may instead be immediately used at the merchant to obtain a benefit corresponding to the amount of the gift certificate.","The routine then continues to step  to determine whether to continue.

The indication may be received, for example, based on a programmatic interaction from the organization, such as previously discussed with respect to step  of , and may include various types of information as indicated with respect to that step. In embodiments in which shopping cart functionality of the merchant is being used by the organization, the received indication may identify a particular shopping cart of a customer of the merchant that is to be checked out.","In step , the routine then obtains information to determine whether the indicated item acquisition is authorized, such as based on authenticating the identity of the organization and\/or validating that the organization is authorized to perform this type of activity\u2014if the item acquisition is not authorized (not shown), an error message may be sent to the organization and the routine may return to step  or continue to step . In addition, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere, in some embodiments additional techniques are used to ensure that the item acquisition is authorized, such as by receiving in step  a set of information that was previously provided to the organization (e.g., based on adding items to a shopping cart at the merchant) and by verifying that the information is correct (e.g., by comparing the received set of information to a new set of information that is dynamically generated based on current conditions). In addition, in some embodiments the routine may directly interact with a user of the organization on whose behalf the item acquisition is to be performed, such as to authenticate the identity of the user (e.g., based on a password and\/or other information available to the merchant based on prior interactions with the user).","The routine then continues to step  to complete the item acquisition if possible, which in this illustrated embodiment involves interacting with the user to provide and\/or obtain information corresponding to the item acquisition (e.g., payment source information if the gift certificate(s) being used do not cover the full cost of acquiring the one or more items), although in other embodiments the item acquisition process may be completed in other manners (e.g., by using stored information for the user and\/or the organization without performing any additional interactions). In at least some embodiments, the interactions with the user are performed so as to minimize or eliminate indications to the user that the interactions are with the merchant rather than with the organization. In addition, as part of the item acquisition, information about the one or more gift certificates indicated in step  is retrieved and used for the item acquisition, such as to eliminate or otherwise reduce the cost of the acquisition. Information about the item acquisition transaction is then stored, such as to later be available to the user and\/or the organization, although in other embodiments at least some information about the transaction may be immediately provided to the organization.
