{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. s 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/431,036, entitled \u201cGAME OF CHANCE SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PLAYING GAMES OF CHANCE,\u201d filed on Dec. 5, 2002, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to games of chance and, more particularly, to methods of and systems for playing games of chance.","Legalized public and private bingo games abound in the United States and throughout the world. Bingo-type games involve a plurality of participants each having at least one pre-printed playing card. Typically, bingo playing cards comprise five columns, corresponding to the letters \u201cB\u201d, \u201cI\u201d, \u201cN\u201d, \u201cG\u201d and \u201cO\u201d, whence the game derives its name, and five rows in a boxed matrix. Numbers and\/or free spaces populate the boxes in the matrix.","The game of bingo is played by randomly selecting winning numbers from a population of numbers. In a traditional bingo game, a participant wins when a combination of selected winning numbers covers at least one row, column, and\/or diagonal of five numbers on at least one participant's playing card. However in many bingo games, numerous other patterns that have been predetermined may also be used for winning; these patterns include those known as Hard Way (five-in-a-row without using the free spot), Six Pack (2\u00d73 or 3\u00d72 matrix), or Small Kite. When a participant covers a winning pattern with winning numbers, he or she declares \u201cBingo!\u201d Verification of the win occurs immediately and if the win is verified, the game ends and no further numbers are drawn. Generally, there is only a single winner for each game; if there are multiple winners, the prize is divided equally among all winners.","Keno is another type of legalized public and private game common in the United States and throughout the world. Compared to bingo, keno-type games typically draw more random winning numbers from a larger population of numbers, e.g., integers from 1 to 80. Indeed, keno-type games typically select more winning numbers from the population of numbers than are required to win.","For example, typically about twenty winning numbers are selected from the population of numbers and game participants may win a prize if they match anywhere between zero and fifteen of the winning numbers. Thus, a game participant still can win the top prize without having to match all, or even any, of the winning numbers drawn. Indeed, by comparison, keno-type games typically produce more opportunities to match winning numbers.","Moreover, keno-type games are more flexible than bingo-type games because game participants can choose how many winning numbers they want to try to match in each game, for example two, five, ten, etc. Correspondingly, prizes, for example cash jackpots, are greater when more numbers must be, and ultimately are, matched. Indeed, keno prizes generally increase commensurate with the odds of matching two numbers of the twenty selected, versus matching five of twenty, versus matching ten of twenty, etc.","There is a present and recurring need for new games of chance that are easy to understand, are easy to play, and are accessible while still able to have more than one winner, have fixed odds to win and have a predetermined payout for a win. Such a game is needed to attract new game players and to provide existing players with another game of chance with fixed odds of winning other than an instant lottery or keno.","One aspect of the invention provides a game that has a game session that includes one or more game players, each having one or more game pieces, which themselves each have one or more game cards. Each game card has cells arranged in a pattern predetermined for the game session and has each cell filled with content randomly by a game operator or computer from a predetermined set of cell content for the game session; as used herein, a \u201cset\u201d of items may include one or more of such items.

All references cited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.","One aspect of the invention relates to a new game that includes elements of the well-known wagering games of chance known as bingo and keno. There are advantages of these types of games that make these games attractive for online gaming.","However, there are disadvantages of bingo-type games including the following:\n\n","Shortcomings associated with keno-type games include game complexity and inaccessibility to the game. Indeed, keno-type games are most frequently played in gambling establishments and bars, and therefore, access to these games are limited to those who go to such establishments. Furthermore, those who have never played keno-type games find the rules and the selection process confusing, so they are not inclined or are hesitant to play the game.","According to one embodiment of the invention, a game is provided which has a fixed odds of winning through the drawing of a predetermined number of winning cell content but is unlike keno in that a winning pattern must be obtained on a game card from the matches between the game card cell content and the drawn winning cell content.","Prior to a game session, a game player may need to pay for playing. For example, a game player may pay using money or loyalty points. In particular, a game player may pay using money by debit card, credit card, check, cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization.

Payment may be in any form that is legal in the particular jurisdiction.","In one embodiment of the invention, players may subscribe to play multiple consecutive game sessions. That is, the player pays at one time to play many consecutive game sessions. According to one embodiment, such players may subscribe to multiple games (e.g., fixed-odds or non-fixed odds games) using a computer based interface (e.g., a personal computer, cell phone, PDA, set-top box or other interface). These subscribed games may be automatically played (e.g., by a computer system) without the need to interact with the game provider as discussed more fully below. In another embodiment, the player may also choose to have his or her subscription automatically renewed.","According to one embodiment of the invention, players may also enter to play this or any other wagering game of chance using an alternative method of entry (AMOE). AMOE is a required available method of entry that does not require a purchase to enter a sweepstake; sweepstakes are usually used as a promotional or marketing tool. An individual entering a sweepstakes by AMOE is required by law to have the same odds of winning each of the available prizes.","A common AMOE method is to have an individual interested in entering the sweepstakes send in a postcard with his or her name, address or other contact information. Another AMOE method is to have an individual sign on to a free internet website and submit the required information for free. Numerous other methods may be used for AMOE. Most sweepstakes limit the number of times one individual or family may enter a sweepstakes by AMOE.","According to one embodiment of the invention, it is realized that an AMOE (alternative method of entry) may be used to enter a game of chance. More particularly, it is possible to develop, implement and run wagering games of chance, including the inventive games described herein, with an AMOE method of entry. AMOE methods are conventually used to enter a player in a sweepstakes, which is not considered wagering or gambling. Thus, according to one embodiment of the invention, an individual may enter a wagering game of chance by AMOE using, for example, the post card or the online method outlined above. The wagering game of chance player entering by AMOE may also have the same odds to win the payout associated with the game session in which they are entered. The wagering game of chance player entering by AMOE may also be limited to a small number of game sessions within a given period of time, for example one game session in one year or two game session in one month. Other numbers of sessions and given periods may be any number, and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.","According to one embodiment, the game session that the game player entering by AMOE is entered into may be determined by the game player on the AMOE entry form. For example, the post card AMOE may be required to state the date and the time of the game session that the game player wants to enter. Alternatively, the game session entered may be the next starting game session after the AMOE is received and logged. As another alternative, AMOE entries may be assigned to a specific game session(s) each hour, day, week or other time interval.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["120","120","118","122","118","122","118","100","100","118","122","100","118"]},"Referring to , a game card  includes a number of cells . Each player in a game session  has at least one game card  with the same pattern ( of , e.g., pattern) or matrix of cells . In one embodiment, each cell  of each game card  has a cell content . In one embodiment, the cell content  is one of a predetermined set of cell content (, ) for that game session , e.g. integers from 1 to 75 or English letters from A to Z or a mixture of the two. The cells  of the game card  in each session may be subdivided into groups, each of which includes a subset of possible cell content, e.g. a first column (e.g., item  of ) includes integers 1 to 15, a second column (e.g., item  of ) includes integers 16 to 30, on up to a fifth column (item ) having integers 61 to 75 just as in the traditional game of bingo. Preferably, every game card  is unique in a game session , although duplicate cards may exist.","According to one embodiment of the invention, the object of a game of chance is to match cell content of a particular game card with the drawn winning cell content (item ) and to have the matched cell content cover at least the predetermined winning pattern . In , for example, the winning pattern  is denoted by the gray shading. Initially, because no winning cell content has yet been drawn, each game card does not have matching cell content (unless the cell content is a free or wild spot). The winning cell content is drawn from the predetermined set of cell content (e.g., item of ). In one embodiment, winning cell content may be drawn one at a time up to a predetermined fixed number of drawn winning cell content (item  of ).","Because it may be possible to have more than one game card  per game piece , a winning pattern may also cover more than one game card. For example, the winning pattern may be \u201cW\u201d on the first card, \u201cI\u201d on the second card, and \u201cN\u201d on the third card for a game piece  containing three game cards for a game piece  containing three game cards. Alternatively, for a game piece  containing three game cards the winning pattern may be obtained by a standard 5-in-a-row on any of three cards.","According to one embodiment, a game session  also includes an associated predetermined payout table (e.g., item  of ). Payout table  may include a listing of the ways to obtain a payout and its payout amount. Possible ways to obtain a payout include, for example, matching at least the winning pattern , matching only the winning pattern, matching part or none of the winning pattern, and matching none of the game card.","The payout amount for each method of winning may depend at least in part upon the odds of obtaining the particular way to obtain a payout in the predetermined fixed number of drawn winning cell content. For example, the odds of matching a winning pattern with thirty winning cell content drawn may be twice that for twenty winning cell content drawn, but the payout may be only one and one half times higher for matching the winning pattern in twenty versus thirty winning cell content drawn. Thus, the payout amount may be varied (e.g., increased) if the winning pattern was obtained in less than the predetermined fixed number of drawn winning cell content. For example, if the predetermined number of drawn winning cell content is thirty and the payout for that is thirty credits, then if the winning pattern is obtained within the first twenty drawn winning cell content then the payout for obtaining that may be forty-five credits. Other payout schemes may be used, and the invention is not limited to any particular scheme. Also, a game card  may have, in one embodiment, only one payout per game session .","A payout table (item  of ) may also include adjustments for a player's subscription. For instance, the payout may be adjusted according to their subscription level. For example, a payout to a particular player may be increased for example, if the player has a multiple game subscription, multiple card subscription, high payment per game card or any combination of the three. The payout may also be adjusted for numerous other criterion including, for example, frequent player credits. Of course, payout adjustments generally must meet any legal requirements for the gaming jurisdiction in which the game is played.","The payout table for each game session may also be supplemented by a jackpot that transfers from game session to game session. These types of jackpots are commonly called rolling or progressive jackpots. A rolling jackpot may be, for example, the same amount that transfers from game session to game session until it is paid out. A progressive jackpot is a rolling jackpot that increases as more game sessions, game cards or other criterion are played. Rolling or progressive jackpots are typically paid out for a difficult way to match the drawn winning cell content. For example, in the case of the conventional game of bingo, if all cells of a five by five (5\u00d75) matrix are covered in the first twenty-five drawn winning cell content or no cells are covered after fifty drawn winning cell content, the rolling jackpot may be paid out.","The final payout may also be affected as to whether the game has a fixed payout for a win or whether the payout is shared (e.g., item  of ). If the payout is fixed for a win, according to one embodiment, all players that have a game card winner for a certain type of win will be paid the amount listed in the payout table for the win. In this instance, each player is playing solely against the game operator. If the payout is shared, then all players that have a game card winner for a certain type of win will be paid a total of the amount listed in the payout table. Each player may receive a share of the total payout depending upon how much he or she paid for the game or any other legal criteria.","The final payout may also be affected by bonus play. Which is well-known in the gaming industry. Bonus play works to increase some payouts by offering the player a chance to multiply a payout.","One or more sessions may proceed concurrently. Parameters of the concurrent game sessions  may be the same, similar, or different. For example, drawn winning cell content may be used for one or more concurrent sessions if, for example, the predetermined set of cell content is the same for the one or more concurrent sessions. As a further example, the game card pattern of cells may be different in all the game sessions.","Additionally, game sessions may run continually, i.e. one after another. When one game session ends, another session will begin immediately or in a short period of time. The game sessions may follow a precise time schedule so that players know when games will begin. For example, if game play in a session requires four and a half (4.5) minutes to complete, then the next game may start immediately or in a defined period (e.g., thirty seconds) to maintain to a schedule of games every five minutes (for instance, at :00, :05, :10, :15, :20, :25, :30, :35, :40, :45, :50, :55 of each hour). Because, according to on embodiment, the game sessions may run continually, it may be possible that a particular game session will have no game player or game card that is being played within the particular game session.","Prior to a game session, cell content on at least one game card may be chosen by a game player from the predetermined set of cell content for a particular game session. A game player may choose the cell content of a game card manually or may use a computer system to select the cell content for a particular game session. Alternatively, according to one embodiment of the invention, a computer system may automatically choose the cell content on at least one game card for a game player. Because, according to one embodiment, a computer system can both choose the cell content and play the game, a player need not configure and attend each game playing session, as discussed further below.","Referring to , the cell content  may be a free spot , a blank spot or a wild spot. A free, blank, or wild spot may be in any cell of the game card . Preferably, in one embodiment, there is only one free, blank and\/or wild spot per game card. It is also possible that there is no free, blank or wild spot on a game card.","Besides a free, blank or wild spot, the cell content  may be any letter or character, number, symbol, color, logo, shape, drawing or other item that may be represented in the cell. The cell content  may be, for example, a letter or character of any language (e.g., English, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Greek, etc. Cell content  may also be any random combination of letters or characters including words and phrases. Cell content  may also be a number expressed in any language (e.g., English, Chinese, Roman, etc. The number may be represented by items (e.g. the number of stars in the cell or the dots on the face of a die or dice). The number may be negative, zero, positive, integer, fraction, decimal, real or imaginary. Preferably, according to one embodiment, the number is a positive integer. Cell content  may also be a symbol. For example, astrology, religion, printing and computer fonts, road signs, or law symbols may be used. Cell content  may be any color including black, white or shade of gray. Cell content may also be a logo of a company or product name or trademark. Any type of cell content may be used, and the invention is not limited to any particular type.","Preferably, cell content  of each cell  is unique for the game card  to maximize the different possible cell content to match the drawn winning cell content for a game session. Also preferably, each game card in a game session is a unique combination of cell content  and cell position for that game session.","Cells (e.g. item ) of the game card  are generally arranged in a pattern. The pattern includes three components: shape of the cells , cell connectivity (or how the cells are connected to each other) and the size of the total pattern. For example, in the cells are square and are attached to each other side-to-side in a five by five (5\u00d75) matrix.  shows examples of some of the numerous other possible cell shape, cell connectivity and pattern size combinations. These are just examples, and the invention may implement other shape, connectivity and size combinations.","Referring to and , cells  on a game card  all have the same shape and size as shown in and -or cells may have a different shape or size such as a combination of octagons and squares as in ","Shape of the cells  may be any shape including, but not limited to, a circular, triangle, square, pentagon or hexagon shape. Also, it is possible that all cells have different shapes. For example, various aspects of the invention may be implemented with a game card having cells with irregularly shaped walls as shown in . The cells  may be connected to each other side-to-side, corner-to-corner, point-to-point or any other method.","Patterns may also have holes in them. For example, in , square cells are connected to make a larger square having a hole in the middle. Alternatively, the pattern of has a pattern with a large square cell in the center. Another example pattern shown in includes a combination of octagonal and square cells as described above or may include a matrix of octagonal cells with square holes in the middle. In another example pattern shown in includes a pattern of circular cells having four-sided holes or a pattern having circular and four-sided cells. Further, holes may be the same size and shape as the cells. For instance, in , three internal triangles of the pattern may be holes among six exterior triangles. It should be appreciated that other patterns may be used, and the invention is not limited to any particular pattern.","The winning pattern for a game session may be, any subset of all the cells in the associated game card pattern. The winning pattern may be, for example, a random subset of all cells that may not appear to have a pattern. Preferably, the winning pattern may be a recognizable pattern of cells. The winning pattern may have only one way of being achieved and, as shown in -, the winning pattern may or may not include the cell with the free, blank or wild spot. The winning pattern may also be achieved in a number of different ways. For example, a five-in-a-row winning pattern in a five by five matrix (as in bingo) can be achieved twelve different ways as demonstrated by the shaded lines shown in . A winning pattern known as \u201csmall kite\u201d has four possible configurations as shown in . Also, more than one winning pattern may be possible for a particular game session. For example, a winning pattern may include the triangles of six points of the pattern shown in or six internal triangles.","Winning cell content may be randomly drawn by hand or by computer system from the predetermined set of cell content for a game session. When the drawing is performed by hand, the winning cell content may be chosen, for example from pieces of paper out of a hat or drum, by using balls or discs in a rotating or air blown sphere, or any other method that can be used for drawing content for a game session (e.g., for the games of keno or bingo). Hand-drawn winning cell content may then be displayed or entered into a computer system. Preferably, the winning cell content is randomly drawn by computer system from the predetermined set of cell content for a particular game session.","After a winning cell content is drawn, a player may manually daub his or her game card(s) on paper or by whatever means the player is viewing the game proceedings (e.g., by daubing a game card in an interface of a computer system). The game player may view the game proceedings using television, wireless or line telephone with display, handheld device, kiosk, computer or in person. For example, the game player may operate a computer system that has an Internet-enabled interface (e.g., using Macromedia Flash or Java) and the computer system may display streamed game information within that interface. It should be appreciated that any interface may be used to display game proceedings and that the invention is not limited to any particular interface. Depending upon the viewing medium, it may be necessary to download game information prior to viewing while another viewing medium may allow viewing of the streamed game information.","When a player matches enough winning cell content to obtain a winning pattern for a game session, the player informs the game operator that they are a winner. If the game player is playing the game in person, this act of informing may include raising one's hand or visually indicating that he or she has a winner. The game operator then verifies that the game player won by checking the daubed game card cell content against the drawn winning cell content. If the game player plays the game remotely, for instance over the web or interactive television, or if the game operator is a computer system, then other electronic or voice indication method may be necessary to authenticate and verify the game player and the winning game card. Such methods are well-known in the remote and electronic gaming industry.","In one embodiment, a computer system (e.g., a personal computer PC, set top box, PDA, phone) may automatically daub the matching cell content of each game card being played in a game session after each drawn winning cell content. The game player may view the game proceedings using any interface including a television, a wireless or other type of telephone having a display, a handheld device, a kiosk or computer. However, because the computer is adapted to automatically daub matching cell content, the game player may decide not to observe the drawing of winning cell content.","The computer system may then automatically determine when a game card is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance, the computer system may then notify the game player that he or she has won and what the winnings are after the computer has consulted a predetermined payout table (e.g., item  of  as described above). The computer may also determine if the winning needs to be shared with other winning game cards. Notification of winning to a game player may occur by mail, e-mail, computer web or network, telephone, television, pager, fax, kiosk or any other method.","When the computer system daubs matching cell content on one or more game cards, the computer system may also determine the game card(s) and the associated player identity(ies) that are closest to winning after each drawn winning cell content. The computer system may then display the game card(s) or the identity of the game player(s) closest to winning to all game players observing the game session. The computer system may also choose to display only one or a subset of all the game cards or identities of players closest to winning to a particular game player observing the game session.","After a winner is authenticated and verified, the computer system may then notify all game players observing the game session that a win has occurred. Additionally, the computer system may display the winning game card, the winning player's identity or the payout. Because the game session does not end until a predetermined fixed number of winning cell content is drawn, it is possible for this notification to occur several times, each time for a different game card during a particular game session.","As stated above, it may also be possible that a game card may be a winner because the game card does not match the drawn winning cell content. For example, in a game session having forty drawn winning cell content out of a predetermined set of cell content of seventy-five items, a game card that has no matches may be a winning card. Such a card may have a payout equivalent to a game card having a five-in-a-row matching pattern.","During a period of time between game sessions, a game operator may make announcements, rest, or perform any number of actions. If the game is played using a computer system, advertisements, sponsorships, public service announcements or any visual or auditory content may be inserted into these periods. Advertisements, and other content may also be inserted into the game display during a game session.","In the configuration where the computer automatically daubs the game cards for the players, it may be beneficial to allow a game player to remotely access information indicating the results of a game session after the session has completed. In this manner, a player may not need to attend a particular game session, as results of each session may be accessed at a later time. Further, the player need not access the game session results from a same interface at which the game was played or subscribed. Remote access may be gained, for example, by kiosk, telephone, television, computer, handheld device or any other device or system that is appropriate. Information that may be accessed regarding a past game session may include whether the player won or lost, what the player's payout was, or other information relating to the past game session.","A game player may also be able to replay or review a past game session using a video-enabled device. For instance, a kiosk, telephone having a display, television, computer or handheld device may be used to replay a past game session. By accessing a selected game session in the computer system, a game player may be able to see a past game session as it occurred, the winning cards and winning game player identity(ies), the drawn winning cell content, or possibly any other aspect of the game session of interest.","Preferably, the game, its game sessions, and the game play are partially or fully automated using one or more computer systems. More preferably, the game, its game sessions, and the game play are fully automated. A computer system may be a single computer that may be a supercomputer, minicomputer or a mainframe or personal computer. A computer system used to run a game and its associates sessions and may also include any combination of computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system-level tasks. Multiple computer systems may also be used to run a game. The computer system also may include input or output devices, displays, or storage units. It should be appreciated that any computer system or systems may be used, and the invention is not limited to any number, type, or configuration of computer systems.","A computer system that executes a game according to various embodiments of the invention, may include, foe example, three system components. One system component may handle payment, subscription and\/or AMOE by players to enter the game sessions. Another system component may handle playing and viewing the game and a third system may handle payouts. Such a game system may also be connected (e.g., by direct line or network) to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs, reservations, in-room television viewing, gambling floor kiosks, or other systems. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.","A payment component may include one or more of a number of well-known systems. For example, a player may be able to pay to play one or more games using a telephone and speaking with a call center representative who inputs player, payment and subscription information manually into a computer using a user interface. In the computer, data may be stored in a data which is stored in a memory of the computer system. As used herein, a \u201cdata structure\u201d is an arrangement of data defined by computer-readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system, stored on a medium associated with a computer system (e.g., in a memory, on a disk, etc.) and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as, for example, a network. Also as used herein, a \u201cuser interface\u201d or \u201cUI\u201d is an interface between a human user and a computer that enables communication between a user and a computer. Examples of UIs that may be implemented with various aspects of the invention include a graphical user interface (GUI), a display screen, a mouse, a keyboard, a keypad, a track ball, a microphone (e.g., to be used in conjunction with a voice recognition system), a speaker, a touch screen, a game controller (e.g., a joystick) etc, and any combinations thereof.","Player information may also be entered into a payment system component. Player information that may be input includes name, address, telephone number and age, and payment information may include credit or debit card number or loyalty account information. Also, as discussed above, various aspects of the present invention relate to subscription gaming for wagering games of chance. Subscription information may be input, including, for example, a first game session date and time, a number of game sessions to be played, a number of game pieces to be played per game session and bet per game piece. Based upon the payment and subscription information, the call center representative may verify that the payment information is valid and that enough credit or funds is available for the player's desired subscription.","A similar system may exist for players entering using the mail or a post card AMOE except the call center may be replaced by a mail center having representatives that enter information into one or more computers via a user interface. For example, a cashier that works at a casino directly with players that pay cash or credit to play, may also have the ability to input player, account and subscription information for AMOE players using a user interface of computer.","Computer systems or pay engines for handling electronic or online payment and subscriptions may also be used. Such systems are well-known, and include such systems as Paypal, iKobo, Verisign, and other systems. Using such a system, a player interacts with a user interface to input information into a payment data structure that may be transferred to one or more payment systems (e.g., PayPal).","Various pay systems and one or more user interfaces may be located on computer systems coupled by a network with the computer system(s) storing data having player, account and subscription information. As used herein, a \u201cnetwork\u201d or a \u201ccommunications network\u201d is a group of two or more devices interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media or active communications equipment on which communications may be exchanged between the devices.","The above examples are merely illustrative embodiments of a pay system component. It should be appreciated that an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as any of numerous other implementations of the pay system, for example, variations of online payment, are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. For example, the payment system may include using pay-per-view systems associated with interactive television or the pay engine may additionally deliver a receipt to the player by either e-mail or mail. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of a pay system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.","Payout systems are also well known. Any of a number of standard systems or payout engines for making payouts for winning may be used. For example, a standard application programming interface such as \u2018Quicken\u2019 (Intuit Inc., Mountain View, Calif., USA) may be used to write and mail checks or credit a debit card, credit card (if legal in the jurisdiction of play) or loyalty account. \u2018Quicken\u2019 may obtain the payout information by accessing a payout data structure across a network. As used herein, an \u201capplication programming interface\u201d or \u201cAPI\u201d is a set of one or more computer-readable instructions that provide access to one or more other sets of computer-readable instructions that define functions, so that such functions can be configured to be executed on a computer in conjunction with an application program.","\u2018Quicken\u2019 is merely an illustrative embodiment of the payout system.
