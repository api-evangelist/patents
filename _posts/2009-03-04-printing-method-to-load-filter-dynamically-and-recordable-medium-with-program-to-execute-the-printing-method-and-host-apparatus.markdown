Field of the Invention","Apparatuses and methods consistent with the present general inventive concept relate to a printing method, recordable medium and host apparatus, and more particularly, to a printing method to load a filter dynamically, a recordable medium with a program to execute the printing method and a host apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recently, Microsoft has unveiled concepts on a new XPS (XML Paper Specification) file format to replace existing EMF files, and an XPS-based print driver to print in the XPS file format.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"From the GDI print path, if a print command is sent through a Win32 application  for original data, a spooler  spools the original data into an enhanced meta file (EMF). The EMF file is rendered into a GDI (Graphic Device Interface) function supplied by Windows OS by a GDI rendering engine of a GDI-based printer driver . The rendered EMF file is rendered into a PDL (Page Description Language) by a PDL conversion transmitter to be recognized by the printer  and then transmitted to the printer . Therefore, the printer  finally prints the file. Here, PDL includes PCL (Printer Command Language) developed by HP and PS (PostScript) developed by Adobe.","From the XPS print path, if a print command is sent through .Net Framework 3.0 based WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application  for original data, a spooler  spools the original data into an XPS file format. A filter pipeline administrator  reads a filter setting file  and loads a first filter , a second filter and an nth filter in sequence written in the filter setting file  to process the XPS spool file . The XPS spool file processed by the nth filter is transmitted to the printer  to be printed.","Here, OS provides a GDI to XPS converter to convert the original data into the XPS spool file to thereby print the original data written from the Win32 application along the OXS print path. Conversely, an XPS to GDI converter is also provided to convert the original data into GDI to thereby print the original data written from the WPF application along the GDI print path.","To embody the foregoing XPS print path, an XPS printer driver  is required, and the detailed configuration thereof is as shown in .","The XPS printer driver  includes a Version 3 driver  and a filter pipeline administrator . The Version 3 driver  includes a conversion render module  to convert the original data written from the Win32 application  using a GDI print API (Application Programming Interface), into an XPS spool file; and a setting module  to receive printer setting information.","The filter pipeline administrator  reads a filter setting file  and loads the first filter , and second filter to nth filter in sequence corresponding to a filter description written in the filter setting file . The respective filters , and process the XPS spool file according to a principle set during programming. The processed XPS spool file is transmitted to the printer to be printed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"7"},"As shown therein, four filter descriptions A of \u201cwatermark\u201d, \u201coverlay\u201d, \u201cN-up\u201d and \u201crender\u201d are written in sequence in the filter setting file .","The filter pipeline administrator  reads the filter setting file , and loads \u201cwatermark,\u201d \u201coverlay,\u201d \u201cN-up\u201d and \u201crender\u201d filters corresponding to the filter description A, in sequence, to process an XPS spool file . More specifically, the filter pipeline administrator  loads the watermark filter first. The watermark filter outputs an XPS spool file watermarked from the XPS spool file . The watermarked XPS spool file is inputted to the next overlay filter . The XPS spool file inputted by the overlay filter is used to output an overlaid XPS spool file. Likewise, as the XPS spool file passes through the filter pipeline including a series of filters , , and , each of the filters , , and processes the XPS spool file . Here, the render filter converts the inputted XPS file into a PDL required by the printer . Then, the converted PDL data are transmitted to the printer  to be printed.","However, the conventional filter setting file has the fixed filter description A, and filters are loaded to process print options even though a user did not select the print option.","If the render filter is fixed in the filter setting file, the XPS spool file passes through the render filter to increase the printing job time even though the printer supports the XPS spool file format and the PDL conversion is not necessary.","If a printer does not support the XPS spool file format, the render filter should be present. However, if the filter setting file is fixed to have no render filter, the printer may not print the file. Particularly, considering office environment where a plurality of host apparatuses and printers are connected in a network, some printers may not be used as the filter description of the render filter is fixed in the filter setting file.","The present general inventive concept provides a printing method to dynamically change filters according to a print option, a recordable medium with a program to execute the printing method and a host apparatus.","The present general inventive concept also provides a printing method which reduces print time, a recordable medium with a program to execute the printing method and a host apparatus.","The present general inventive concept also provides a printing method that performs a print operation even if a data format recognizable by an image forming apparatus changes, a recordable medium with a program to execute the printing method and a host apparatus.","Additional aspects and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.","Embodiments of the present general inventive concept can be achieved by providing a printing method which uses filter setting information having at least one filter corresponding to a print option of a print document and an XPS printer driver, the printing method including: selecting the print option; changing the filter setting information corresponding to the print option; and applying the printing option according to the changed filter setting information and transmitting print data.","The printing method may further include restoring the filter setting information after the print operation.","The changing the filter setting information may include initializing the filter setting information, and changing the filter setting information according to at least one filter corresponding to the selected print option.","The printing method may further include displaying changed content of the filter setting information.","The printing method may further include determining whether an image forming apparatus to which the print data is to be transmitted is able to print the print data.","The printing method may further include changing the print data to be printed by the image forming apparatus if the image forming apparatus is unable to print.","The changed print data may include a PDL (Page Description Language).","The printing method may further include displaying print unavailability if an image forming apparatus to which the print data is to be transmitted is not able to print the print data.","Embodiments of the present general inventive concept can also be achieved by providing a recordable medium with a computer program to execute a printing method, the printing method which uses filter setting information having at least one filter corresponding to a print option of a print document and an XPS print driver, and includes: selecting the print option; changing the filter setting information corresponding to the print option; and applying the printing option according to the changed filter setting information and transmitting print data.","Embodiments of the present general inventive concept can also be achieved by providing a host apparatus which has an interface to be connected with an image forming apparatus, the host apparatus including an input unit to receive a print option; a storage unit which stores therein an application program to write a print document and filter setting information; and a controller which changes the filter setting information to have at least one filter corresponding to the inputted print option, generates print data about the print document according to the changed filter setting information and transmits the generated print data to the image forming apparatus through the interface if a print command is sent for the print document.","The controller can restore the filter setting information after the print data are transmitted to the image forming apparatus.","The controller initializes the filter setting information when changing the filter setting information, and changes the filter setting information according to at least one filter corresponding to the selected print option.","The host apparatus further includes a display unit, wherein the controller controls the display unit to display changed content of the filter setting information.","The controller determines whether the image forming apparatus prints the print data.","The controller can change the print data to be printed by the image forming apparatus if the print data are not printable by the image forming apparatus.","The changed print data include a PDL (Page Description Language).","The host apparatus may further include a display unit, wherein the controller displays print unavailability on the display unit if the print data are not printable by the image forming apparatus.","Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present general inventive concept, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below so as to explain the present general inventive concept by referring to the figures.","A printing method, a recordable medium with a program to execute the printing method and a host apparatus according to exemplary embodiments will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","100"]},"The host apparatus  according to the present embodiment includes an input unit , a display unit , a storage unit , a host interface  and a controller .","The input unit  includes an input means such as, for example, a mouse and a keyboard to receive a user input.","The display unit  includes a display device such as, for example, a CRT monitor and an LCD monitor. The display unit  displays a UI (user interface) thereon to select a print option.","The storage unit  includes a storage medium such as, for example, a hard disk, flash memory and RAM to read and write. The storage unit  stores therein an XPS spool file  and a filter setting file .","The storage unit  may store therein an application program  such as WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application or WIN application to write a print document.","The storage unit  stores therein an Operating System (OS, not shown) to support an operation of the application program . The WPF application operates in Windows Vista OS of Microsoft, and may operate if .Net Framework 3.0 is installed in Windows XP or Windows 2003 OS. The Windows Vista, and Windows XP and Windows 2003 having the .Net Framework 3.0 support the XPS print path as a new print architecture.","The XPS spool file  may be stored in the storage unit  in two cases. First, if a print command is sent through the WPF application, the WPF application generates data of print documents in an XPS document format. Then, the XPS spool file  is stored in the storage unit . The XPS document format is defined in XPS (XML Paper Specification), and the XPS document format conforms to the XPS spool file format.","Second, if a print command is sent through the Win32 application for a print document, a spooler  converts data of GDI-based print document written in the Win32 application into the XPS spool file  by using a GDI to XPS conversion module  of the OS.","That is, the XPS spool file  may be generated by the conversion module  not only when the print command is sent through the WPF application, but also through the WIN32 application.","The generated XPS spool file  includes original data written from the application program; a print option for the original data; and setting information of an image forming apparatus  connected to the host apparatus . Here, the print option which is included in the XPS spool file  also includes a print option selectively inputted by a user through the input unit .","The filter setting file  includes filter information about at least one of first filter  to nth filter  to be loaded by a spool file processor  of the controller  (to be described later). Here, the filter information includes a filter description B such as a name of a filter to be loaded. The filter setting file  may be called filter setting information.","The controller  changes the filter setting file  to have at least one filter corresponding to the print option inputted through the input unit  if a print command is sent through the application program for the print document.","More specifically, the controller  changes the filter description B of the filter setting file  according to the print option inputted by the input unit . Then, the filter description B of the filter setting file  is changed dynamically corresponding to the print option selected by a user, and the data do not need to pass through unnecessary filters. Thus, more efficient print is available and print time can be reduced.","In some cases, the controller  may control the display unit  to display a detail of the changed filter setting file .","If necessary, the controller  may initialize the filter setting file  not to have the filter description B when changing the filter setting file . Then, the controller  may determine the selected print option and add filter information corresponding to the determined print option to the initialized filter setting file  to thereby change the filter setting file .","The controller  generates print data of the print document according to the changed filter setting information, and transmits the generated print data to the connected image forming apparatus  through a host interface .","More specifically, the controller  loads at least one of the filters  and  according to the changed filter setting file , and controls the XPS spool file  of the print document to pass through the loaded filters  and  to thereby generate print data. The controller  transmits the generated print data to a printer interface  of the image forming apparatus  through the host interface .","The print data are the XPS spool file  which has passed through the filters  and  to be processed, and may include spool data and data having print option information inputted through the input unit .","If the image forming apparatus  does not support the XPS spool file , the print data may be converted into a PDL (Page Description Language), another format supported by the image forming apparatus , through a render filter  in  (to be described later).","The controller  may store the original filter setting file  in the storage unit  before the filter description B is changed. After the XPS spool file is completely printed, the controller  may restore the stored filter setting file. More specifically, the controller  removes the filter setting file  having the changed filter description B and restores the original filter setting file (not shown). Here, the original filter setting file (not shown) may be additionally stored in another storage space of the storage unit , and then the changed filter setting file  may be removed before the additionally-stored original filter setting file is moved to the original position. Otherwise, a name of the original filter setting file (not shown) may be changed temporarily, and then it can be changed into the original name after the completion of a print operation. Further, other known methods may be employed to avoid Microsoft's Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certification.","If a printer driver has a WHQL certification, it should receive certification again when information such as file size and date are changed, causing an inconvenience in using the printer driver. Thus, the filter setting file  which has changed to efficiently execute the XPS spool file may be removed after the completion of the print operation, and the original filter setting file may be restored to thereby avoid issues related to the WHQL certification.","The original filter setting file  is restored after the completion of the print operation, but it may be restored if the filter setting file  is not needed any more even though not physically \u201cafter the completion of the print operation.\u201d For example, if print data of the print document are transmitted to the image forming apparatus , if the filter processes the XPS spool file or if the XPS spool file passes through the filter pipeline, the filter setting file  is not required anymore.","Meanwhile, the controller  includes a spool file processor  to process data of the print document according to the print option.","More specifically, the controller  includes the spool file processor  to process the XPS spool file of the print document according to the print option.","The spool file processor  forms a filter pipeline which includes the filters  and  loaded corresponding to the filter description B written in the filter setting file . More specifically, the filter description B of the filter setting file  is changed by the controller  before the filters  and  are loaded by the spool file processor , and the filters  and  corresponding to the changed filter description B are loaded. The filters  and  are loaded in sequence as written in the filter description B, and process the XPS spool file  according to assigned functions.","The filters  and  may include at least one of a watermark filter to process a watermark print option, an overlay filter to process an overlay print option, an N-up filter to process an N-up print option, a poster filter to process a poster print option and a render filter to convert an XPS file format into a PCL (Printer Control Language) to be recognized by the image forming apparatus  and a PDL (Paper Description Language) such as PS (PostScript).","The overlay print option is used to overlay contents of two original documents in one page while the poster print option is used to enlarge the original data in 2\u00d72 or 4\u00d74 to print the data. The N-up print option is used to print a plurality of pages of the original data in one page.","The spool file processor  may include a filter pipeline administrator  (refer to ) of Microsoft. Any element can be a spool file processor  as long as it loads a filter for independent processing and enables each filter to process a spool file.","The XPS spool file  which is processed by the nth filter  is transmitted to the image forming apparatus  through the host interface . The host interface  may include one of a parallel port and a USB port. The host interface  may have a network interface card to be connected to the Internet.","The image forming apparatus  receives the processed XPS spool file  through the printer interface .

Then, the controller  may determine the supported file format with the response information transmitted by the image forming apparatus  with respect to the request.","Whether the image forming apparatus  supports the XPS spool file may be determined not only when a print command is sent, but also whenever as required. For example, if a user executes a printer driver program, or if a predetermined time elapses, the controller  may determine periodically whether the image forming apparatus  supports the XPS spool file.","If it is determined that the image forming apparatus  does not support the XPS spool file, i.e., if the print data in an XPS spool file format may not be printed by the image forming apparatus , the controller  can control the display unit  to display the result.","If it is determined that the image forming apparatus  supports the XPS spool file, the controller  changes a filter description about the render filter  of the filter setting file .","More specifically, if the image forming apparatus  supports the XPS spool file, the controller  removes the filter description B\u2033 about the render filter  from the filter setting file .

Then, a print command is sent through the WIN32 application or WPF application (operation S).","The filter setting file is read (operation S). It is determined whether the filter description to process the selected print option is written in the filter setting file (operation S). An operation of initializing the filter setting file to remove all contents of the filter setting file may be inserted between the operations S and S.","If it is determined that the filter description is not written, a filter description about a filter to process the print option is written in the filter setting file (operation S).","Then, the changed filter setting file is stored (operation S).","If it is determined that the filter description is written (operation S), it is further determined whether all the print options selected by a user have been checked (operation S).
