No. 11\/258,334 entitled, \u201cSYSTEMS, METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING A RADIATED PERFORMANCE OF A WIRELESS DEVICE\u201d filed Oct. 24, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,773,964, which claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60\/660,918 entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING RADIATED ANTENNA TESTS\u201d filed Mar. 11, 2005, and Provisional Application No. 60\/621,883 entitled \u201cANTENNA CORRELATION FROM MEASURED COMPLEX RADIATION PATTERNS\u201d filed Oct. 25, 2004, all assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","The described embodiments relate to wireless communications devices, and more particularly, to systems, methods, apparatus, processors and computer readable media for determining the radiated performance of an antenna system associated with a wireless device.","Wireless devices utilize radio waves to provide long distance communications without the physical constraints of a wire-based system. The wireless device transmits and receives information using via the radio waves, which may be carried over predetermined frequency bands. An antenna connected to a transmitter and a receiver, along with the associated circuitry, allows the wireless device to transmit and receive these radio wave signals. The design of the wireless device, including the antenna and the various transmit- and receiver-related components, impact the ability of the wireless device to transmit and receive radio wave signals, and hence define and affect the radiated performance of the device. Thus, it is desirable to determine and tune the radiated performance of a wireless device to optimize the ability of the wireless device to communicate radio wave signals.","Prior art methods of determining the radiated performance of a wireless device, however, have a number of drawbacks. Some tests to determine radiated performance involve destructive modification of the wireless device. For instance, in one example, the signal path between the antenna and receiver is interrupted and re-routed to an external radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) connector. Radiated signal power measurements are then made by external test equipment interfaced at this connector, thereby acting as a substitute for the receiver on the wireless device. The presence of the external RF connector and the associated external cable can distort the true radiated performance of the wireless device. Further, these destructive modifications add expense to the testing procedure due to both the additional equipment and the additional manpower required to make the modification. Additionally, destructive modifications add further expense by making the modified wireless device un-usable for other tests.","Additionally, in a wireless communication system, an RF modulated signal from a transmitter may reach a receiver via a number of propagation paths. The characteristics of the propagation paths typically vary over time due to a number of factors such as fading and multipath.","Further, structures such as buildings, and surrounding terrain, including walls and hillsides, contribute to the scattering and reflection of the transmitted signal. The scattering and reflection of the transmit signal results in multiple signal paths from the transmitter to the receiver. The contributors to the multiple signal paths change as the receiver moves.","Other signal sources also result in degradation of the desired signal. The other signal sources may be other transmitters intentionally operating on the same frequency as the desired signal, as well as transmitters that generate spurious signals in the frequency band of the desired signal. Yet another source of signal degradation may be generated within the receiver itself. Signal amplifiers and signal processing stages within the receiver may degrade the level of the desired signal with respect to the level of thermal noise. The signal amplifiers and processors within the receiver may also generate noise products or distort the received signal and further degrade its quality.","To provide diversity against deleterious path effects and improve performance, multiple transmit and receive antennas may be used. If the propagation paths between the transmit and receive antennas are linearly independent (i.e., a transmission on one path is not formed as a linear combination of the transmissions on other paths), which is generally true to at least an extent, then the likelihood of correctly receiving a data transmission increases as the number of antennas increases. Thus, generally, diversity increases and performance improves as the number of transmit and receive antennas increases.","Further, a wireless device may use multiple antennas for a number of reasons. For example, a wireless device often needs to operate over multiple bands and service multiple operating modes. Another reason is that advanced transceiver architectures are being implemented that use multiple antennas for improving the performance of some of these modes in the field. When operated simultaneously, these modes can interfere with each other, causing degrading overall performance. So it is important to devise accurate means of evaluating the radiated performance of a wireless device that can capture the effects of self-interference. Current methods require several steps to evaluate a combined device\/antenna design, and there is ambiguity with respect to test accuracy with current \u201ccabled\u201d tests. Therefore, dependable design and test methodologies have yet to be developed.","Thus, new and improved systems, apparatus, computer-readable media, processors and methods for determining the radiated performance of a wireless device are desired.","The described embodiments allow for the determination, in a single test and using a single, unaltered wireless device, one or more radiated performance characteristics, such as Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (\u201cEIRP\u201d), receiver sensitivity, Total Radiated Power (\u201cTRP\u201d), Total Isotropic Sensitivity (\u201cTIS\u201d), and envelope correlation, which is related to Rx diversity performance).","In one embodiment, for example, a method of determining a radiated performance characteristic of a wireless device comprises determining a measured signal characteristic of a signal received the wireless device at each one of a plurality of positions associated with a predetermined radiated performance test. The method further includes recording the measured signal characteristics in a test log on the wireless device.

The measured signal characteristics and the synchronization data are determinative of the radiated performance characteristic of the wireless device.","In another embodiment, a computer program is resident in a computer readable medium that, when executed, directs a computer device to perform the actions of determining a measured signal characteristic of a signal received by a receiver module of a wireless device at each one of a plurality of positions associated with a predetermined radiated performance test. The actions further include recording the measured signal characteristics in a test log on the wireless device.

And, the method includes generating a radiated performance characteristic of the wireless device based on the synchronized measured signal characteristic and position information.","Referring to , in one embodiment, a system  for determining a radiated performance of a wireless device  includes a controller system  operable to generate a control signal  to transmit a radio wave signal  to wireless device . Wireless device  is located within a test chamber  at a position  selected from a plurality of predetermined positions associated with a predetermined radiated performance test  being run by controller system . Control signal  includes a positioning component , which defines the physical coordinates of selected position  and thereby dictates the movements of a positioning system  to which wireless device  is mounted. Further, control signal  includes a corresponding signaling component , which defines a radio wave signal  and thereby dictates a transmission by radio signal system . In one embodiment, for example, radio signal system  simulates a base station in a cellular phone network, and thus radio wave signal  may be considered a forward channel signal. Further, radio wave signal  may include an actual or reference signal characteristic , such as a signal power, and predetermined synchronization data , such as position information or time information that corresponds to selected position . For example, reference signal characteristic  is a known characteristic or value that may be used as a baseline value for later calculations, such as a gain calculation. Similarly, predetermined synchronization data  allows measurements made by wireless device  to be correlated to the physical coordinates of position  of wireless device  at the time when the measurement was obtained.","Wireless device  receives and processes signal , resulting in generating a measured signal characteristic  corresponding to reference signal characteristic . In other words, measured signal characteristic  is the received value, as measured by receiver-related components resident on wireless device , of reference signal characteristic . Further, wireless device  parses synchronization data  from signal , thereby providing the ability to relate the respective measured signal characteristic  to the respective selected position  at which the measurement occurred. Additionally, wireless device  includes a radiated performance test module  which monitors the measurement of the received signal and directs the parsing of its data. Further, radiated performance test module  executes to log measured signal characteristic  and synchronization data , thereby forming a record of the test conditions and test results for each selected position . System  then sequences through the remaining plurality of predetermined positions until the signals are received at all positions as determined by the given predetermined radiated performance test .","Once all testing information has been logged, radiated performance testing module  analyzes all of the logged measured signal characteristics  and corresponding synchronization data  and generates a radiated performance characteristic  for wireless device . In one embodiment, for example, radiated performance characteristic  may include a radiated sensitivity metric, which is a function of the power gain and\/or the voltage gain at an antenna of wireless device , and which may be measured for a single or for multiple antennas. For an embodiment of wireless device  having multiple antennas, radiated performance characteristic  may include complex voltage receive gains, which are utilized to predict the correlation between the multiple receive chains\/antennas, thereby providing an indication of the diversity gain provided by the given antenna set-up.","In another embodiment, for example, where synchronization data  includes time information, radiated performance characteristic  may be determined at controller system . In this case, the log of measured signal characteristics  and corresponding synchronization data  may be transferred from wireless device  to a test manager module  located at controller system . Test manager module  maintains another log of corresponding time information and position information, which it correlates with the log from wireless device  to produce a record or log of position information synchronized with measured signal characteristics  for each position dictated by predetermined radiated performance test . In this case, test manager module  initiates the analysis of this synchronized log to determine radiated performance characteristic .","In other embodiments, for example, predetermined radiated performance test  may include a test that involves a wireless device-originated radio wave signal  transmitted to radio signal system . This test is a performance test of the transmit chain\/antenna of wireless device . In an embodiment where radio signal system  simulates a base station of a cellular telephone network, wireless device-originated radio wave signal  may be considered a reverse channel signal.

Once all testing information has been logged, test management module  analyzes all of the logged measured signal characteristics  and corresponding position information from position components  (which also may be considered synchronization information ) and generates radiated performance characteristic  for wireless device . In this case, for example, radiated performance characteristic  may include a measure of the transmission performance of wireless device , such as a transmit power gain. Further, wireless device  may be set-up to simultaneously receive signal  and transmit signal , thereby shortening testing times if there is an overlap in the plurality of predetermined positions associated with each test.","Thus, system  advantageously includes logging of receiver data directly on wireless device , thereby eliminating the need for external connectors and cables that may distort the true receiver-related radiated performance of the device. Further, system  advantageously provides for the wireless synchronization of the measured signal characteristic  and the position information or physical coordinates corresponding to each selected position , thereby eliminating the need for external connectors and cables connected to external synchronization and post-processing equipment. Further, the logging and synchronization capability provided by wireless device  of system  allows for the simultaneous performance of multiple radiated performance tests. Therefore, system  provides an efficient set-up for determining the radiated performance of wireless device .","In one particular embodiment, for example, the systems, apparatus and methods described herein aide in the radiated testing of mobile phones. In this embodiment, several radiated performance characteristics  can be derived from measured data collected in a single test. In particular, the radiated performance characteristics  that can be determined are: a total radiated power (\u201cTRP\u201d) characteristic, a total isotropic sensitivity (\u201cTIS\u201d) characteristic, a peak effective isotropic radiated power (\u201cEIRP\u201d) characteristic, a peak receiver sensitivity characteristic, a peak gain characteristic, an average gain characteristic, and a pattern correlation for diversity enabled phones. Generally, the described embodiments perform, over-the-air, complex receive and maximum transmit EIRP pattern measurements at three channel frequencies without requiring test cables being connected to the test phone. By performing the predetermined radiated tests wirelessly, the described embodiments improve measurement accuracy by eliminating external antenna test cables that can distort radiation patterns. Further, the described embodiments do not require special test fixtures as only one phone is needed for all tests; in contrast, the prior art requires a separate cabled phone fixture for antenna gain\/pattern tests and a second, wireless phone for the peak EIRP and receive sensitivity radiated tests. Additionally, this particular embodiment provides accelerated testing methodologies, as described in more detail below, that are much faster than current TRP and TIS test methodologies. For example, based on experimental results using the present system, the total duration of the TRP and TIS tests is about 1.75 hours for low, mid, and high frequencies, compared with about a 3-5 hour duration for the prior art TIS test at only one frequency.","In this particular embodiment, for example, the measurements are performed in a calibrated far-field anechoic chamber. The testing application is loaded into the test phone while other special purpose control and post processing software is loaded into a host computer controlling the chamber equipment. A cell site simulator or call box is connected to the chamber horn antenna, thereby enabling an over-the-air (OTA) call to a test phone mounted on a rotating pedestal at the far end of the chamber.","For receive mode tests, the phone is commanded to log user-defined data packets to memory on the test phone. The defined data packets, such as a \u201cfinger channel estimate\u201d log packet, contain the complex pilot signals (e.g., In-phase and Quadrature-phase) received by the phone's antennae when the phone is illuminated by an electromagnetic plane wave transmitted from the call box equipment. The logging may be triggered by sending commands from the call box over-the-air to the test phone. By synchronizing this logging event with the movement of the pedestal and test phone, the complex in-phase and quadrature-phase receive pattern data is obtained at each measurement angle over a field of view covering a sphere. Further, tests are done with the chamber horn oriented for vertical and horizontal polarizations, and thus vertical and horizontal receive patterns are obtained. Additionally, for diversity-enabled phones, the complex receive pattern of the secondary antenna is obtained by logging the same packet data in a similar manner.","For transmit mode tests, a power meter is used to measure the radiated power transmitted by the test phone in a given measurement direction with the phone transmitter at maximum power. The test phone is commanded, such as via OTA signals from the call box equipment, to radiate at its maximum transmit power. The transmitted power is collected by the chamber horn and measured by a power meter at each measurement angle. Further, the chamber path loss is determined, and thereby can be accounted for by the reference signal, thereby allowing for the determination of the phone's EIRP. The measured data is stored in real time as the test phone is rotated to the various test angles covering a sphere. Further, tests are done for the chamber horn oriented in both vertical and horizontal polarizations, and thus the vertical and horizontal polarization EIRP patterns are obtained.","All three measurements\u2014the transmit EIRP and the primary and secondary antenna receive complex field measurements\u2014are done in sequence at each measurement angle. Hence, all receive and transmit data can be collected with a single test run.","Additional details relating to this particular embodiment are discussed below.","Referring to , wireless device  can include any type of computerized, wireless device, such as a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant, a two-way text pager, and a portable computer.

Similarly, transmitter module  and antenna system  may be considered the transmit chain of the wireless device.","Additionally, as mentioned above, computer platform  further includes radiated performance test module  to manage radiated testing-related activities on wireless device . Radiated performance test module  may include any hardware, software, firmware and\/or other set of executable instructions operable to manage the collection of any information, such as receiver data and\/or transmitter data, relating to a radiated performance characteristic  of wireless device .

Optionally, this embodiment of the method may further include receiving the radiated performance characteristic from another device (Block ). For example, radiated test manager module  may receive radiated performance characteristic  from wireless device  if the wireless device includes analyzer module .","In particular, in one non-limiting example as highlighted earlier, the described embodiments may be utilized for cellular telephone radiated antenna\/receiver tests, such as: (1) a Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) test; (2) a Total Radiated Power (TRP) test; and (3) an antenna pattern correlation (rho) test.","All three of these radiated tests require spherical measurement of antenna gain for both vertical and horizontal polarizations. Inherent in the TIS test is a measurement of the antenna receive gain pattern, although it is traditionally accomplished indirectly via receiver sensitivity. The TRP test depends on a measurement of the antenna's transmit gain. The antenna pattern correlation test, or antenna rho test, requires simultaneous measurement of complex voltage receive (\u201cRX\u201d) gain, including amplitude and phase, of two or more antennas. The physical procedure of measuring spherical gain is essentially the same for all tests: measure the loss between transmitter and receiver as the phone is physically rotated around the sphere, most commonly in a series of Great Circle cuts (elevation cuts). What differs between each test is the nature and position of the transmitter and receiver.","In the case of the TIS test and antenna pattern correlation test, the transmitter, typically a cell-site simulator such a communication simulator module , is connected to a range directional antenna such as a horn antenna , and the receiver is connected to the antenna under test. In this case, the receiver is receiver module  and the antenna under test is antenna system  of wireless device . For the TRP test, wireless device  acts as the transmitter, and the receiver is an RF power meter  connected to the range antenna .","In these tests, receiver module  of wireless device  makes the necessary measurements for the RX-based tests (RX Gain, Antenna Rho). By using receiver module  of wireless device , the described embodiments provide a number of advantages, such as: time savings, since wireless device  does not have to be modified for testing; and, potentially, more accurate results since the prior art modification of wireless device  and the prior art use of external equipment and cables may alter the gain pattern of the antenna.","Additionally, radiated performance testing module  provides access to receiver data , such as RX_AGC (received power) and Pilot I\/Q estimates from each rake finger via API  interfacing with processing subsystems . Further, radiated performance testing module  logs receiver data  to device test log  within data repository . This approach provides the advantage of being able to test wireless device  with no cables attached. At this point, wireless device  becomes both the test equipment and the data logger. This provides a cleaner test setup which evaluates wireless device  in a more representative state (uncabled) and may provide time savings as well.","Further, the above-described set-up allows all necessary test data to be logged in one single place\u2014one wireless device . For example, with system , position controller  can be queried for position information at the time of each power measurement. This position information, or some data (such as a time) corresponding to this position information, is communicated to wireless device  during testing (without cables) such that all necessary test data can be logged on wireless device . This enables wireless device  to synchronously log position information with receiver parameters such that a power vs. position record can be collected on the fly. Alternatively, controller system  may record the position information and a time, or some other variable that can be synchronized with wireless device , corresponding to the position information. At the same time, wireless device  records the measured data parameter and the time (or other synchronization data). In this alternative, wireless device  may send the log to controller system , which can synchronize the position information with the measured data parameters via the time, or other synchronization data. For example, position information, or at least synchronization data , may be transmitted to wireless device  via: a data socket opened over an active traffic channel, encoding in one or more unused fields in the forward link overhead channel messages, such as the SID, network identification (\u201cNID\u201d), or base station latitude and longitude in system parameter message; and, data could be communicated over auxiliary channels such as Bluetooth\u00ae or 802.11 frequency channels.","The TIS test accounts for interaction of antenna and phone electronics, inclusive of jamming effects from unwanted noise radiated by phone electronics that can couple to the antenna module. In particular, with regard to the TIS test, a CDMA receiver sensitivity measurement entails finding the traffic channel power at which the received signal quality begins to degrade; specifically, the point at which the frame error rate (FER) becomes 0.5%. It should be noted, however, that some other FER threshold may be specified, depending on the given scenario. Further, it should be noted that other threshold parameters may be utilized. For example, utilizing global system for mobile communications (\u201cGSM\u201d) technology, the threshold parameter may be bit error rate (\u201cBER\u201d). For the CDMA case, however, the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (\u201cCTIA\u201d)-specified procedure for the TIS test dictates that a radiated sensitivity measurement is made at every 30\u00b0 in the Theta (elevation) and Phi (azimuth) axes. Again, depending on the scenario, other predetermined positions may be utilized. Excluding points at Theta=0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, this prior art technique requires 60 individual sensitivity measurements for each polarization, which are subsequently integrated over the sphere, producing the TIS metric. This is an extremely time consuming test to perform, since identification of the sensitivity point at each position requires a gradual, iterative process, which in the past has been performed manually.","The described embodiments, however, provide for accelerating the speed at which the TIS test can be performed. The radiated sensitivity around the sphere varies only as a result of the variation of antenna RX gain. All other factors in the link are constant. As such, it follows that if the antenna's RX gain pattern is known, then a sensitivity measurement is required at only a single reference point, preferably the point of maximum antenna gain. Therefore, radiated sensitivity, Sens, at any other point (\u03b8, \u03c6) on the sphere can be expressed as:\n\nSens(\u03b8,\u03c6)=Sens(\u03b8,\u03c6)+[(\u03b8,\u03c6)\u2212(\u03b8,\u03c6)]\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere Sens(\u03b8,\u03c6) is the radiated sensitivity at spherical coordinate (\u03b8,\u03c6), expressed in dBm, G(\u03b8,\u03c6) is the RX antenna gain at spherical coordinate (\u03b8,\u03c6), expressed in dB, and (\u03b8,\u03c6) is the coordinate of the reference sensitivity measurement, i.e. preferably the sensitivity at the position of maximum gain.\n","In the prior art, this approach is impractical, since as mentioned previously, prior art devices are altered destructively to measure G(\u03b8,\u03c6). However, the described embodiments allow G(\u03b8,\u03c6) to be determined non-destructively, since received power measurements are performed by receiver module  of wireless device . Thus, in one particular embodiment, the following accelerated methodology for each polarization (vertical and horizontal) may be utilized:","(1) execute radiated performance testing module  to measure and log G(\u03b8,\u03c6) at a predetermined plurality of positions, such as 30\u00b0 increments for (\u03b8,\u03c6) which in this case defines a shape of a sphere, (excluding \u03b8=0\u00b0 and)180\u00b0);","(2) identify the position, (\u03b8,\u03c6), at which Gis maximum;","(3) perform a single radiated sensitivity test at position (\u03b8,\u03c6), i.e. ramping down transmitted power to the wireless device while monitoring FER (or BER for a GSM-based device) until a predetermined threshold FER is reached, to determine Sens (\u03b8,\u03c6);","(4) apply Equation 1 above to the entire set of predetermined positions, such as the previously-mentioned spherical positions, to determine Sens(\u03b8,\u03c6) for each predetermined position; and","(5) integrate the calculated Sens(\u03b8,\u03c6) over the shape of the predetermined positions in order to determine the TIS metric for the wireless device.","In other words, TIS requires \u201cradiated sensitivity patterns\u201d EIS(\u03b8,\u03c6) and EIS(\u03b8,\u03c6), where EIS(Effective Isotropic Sensitivity) is the radiated receiver sensitivity at a given measurement angle (\u03b8,\u03c6) for a given BER or FER threshold. In a test chamber, however, these values are difficult to measure directly since the call often drops when the test phone is rotated to an antenna pattern null (e.g., the receive signal level can go below phone noise level). To avoid this problem, the receive patterns are measured at a received power level high enough to avoid dropped calls, and then scaled by the measured peak sensitivity value to derive EIS(\u03b8,\u03c6) and EIS(\u03b8,\u03c6) patterns. For example, in one embodiment, the chamber path losses are calibrated so that a known power level is incident on the test phone that is about equal to or greater than 30 dB above the phone's noise floor (e.g., about \u221270 dBm at the phone test site is a good number for a typical phone). It should be noted, however, that other dBm values may be utilized depending on the given test scenario. The antenna gain patterns (G(\u03b8,\u03c6), G(\u03b8,\u03c6))) are derived from the above measured pattern data by normalizing to the received signal strength indication (\u201cRSSI\u201d) value, i.e. the measured power, reported by the phone when \u201cinjecting\u201d the reference power level (\u221270 dBm in this case) directly into the receiver (usually via the RF test port on the phone). This is the value the phone would report if the antenna gain at a given measurement angle was 0 dBi and the power incident at the phone was \u221270 dBm.

For example, wireless device  can independently make determinations when in receipt of synchronization data , such as position information, or synchronization data  such as time information  in combination with the log from controller system  of synchronization data  versus position information. Wireless device  may determine G(\u03b8,\u03c6) and transmit position (\u03b8,\u03c6) to controller system  for re-orientation of positioning system  and initiation of the sensitivity testing portion of the protocol. Wireless device  may then calculate the required Sens(\u03b8,\u03c6), and perform the integration to determine the TIS metric, which it may store and\/or send to controller system .","Alternatively, the data collection at wireless device  may be interrupted after Steps  and  to allow device test log  to be offloaded from wireless device  to, for example, controller system  for post-processing to determine G(\u03b8,\u03c6) and G(\u03b8,\u03c6). For example, log  includes a record of measured data versus synchronization data At this point, controller system  may send control signal  to position wireless device at position (\u03b8,\u03c6) for the radiated sensitivity test. Similarly, wireless device  may offload device test log  after recording a set of sensitivity measurements at the position of maximum gain, or after determining Sens(\u03b8,\u03c6). Then, controller system  can apply Equation 1 at all positions and\/or perform the integration across the sphere, thereby determining the TIS metric.","Furthermore, Step  can be performed with wireless device  in idle mode, since the RX_AGC is active. Advantageously, this technique eliminates the need to maintain a traffic call during the duration of the test. Although, it should be noted that wireless device  may be in a call for Step , since FER may be defined only for traffic data frames.","In one embodiment, the above-described sensitivity test is performed manually\u2014the forward link transmit power on the cell-site simulator is adjusted by hand to reach the target FER on wireless device . As noted above, the described embodiments provide for the automation of the sensitivity test. For example, controller system  establishes a call with wireless device  and gradually ramps the forward link power down while maintaining a record of power vs. time, i.e. in control test log . Simultaneously, radiated performance testing module  records FER vs. time, i.e. in device test log . Radiated test manager module  receives device test log  and executes synchronization logic  to synchronize the measurements associated with the recorded time in each log  and , thereby generating synchronized log  which includes a record of FER vs. power. Based on this record of FER vs. power, performance analyzer module  may determine the point of 0.5% FER.","In another alternative, if the forward transmit power is communicated to wireless device  over the forward link, then all necessary data can be logged at the wireless device . In this case, radiated performance testing module  executes analyzer module  to determine the point of 0.5% FER. Thus, consolidating the logging on wireless device  advantageously eliminates the need for offline synchronization of logs  and  respectively from controller system  and wireless device .","With regard TRP, the TRP test is a performance test of the transmit chain of wireless device . For this test, wireless device  may be configured via device test configuration  to transmit at full power. For example, in a CDMA device, this is most often accomplished by instructing the cell-site simulator to send \u201call-up\u201d power control bits while a traffic call is maintained. Power received from wireless device  is measured by power meter  attached to antenna range directional (horn) antenna .","The CTIA-specified procedure for the TRP test dictates that a power measurement is made at every 15\u00b0 in the Theta (elevation) and Phi (azimuth) axes for each polarization. Excluding points at Theta=0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, this technique requires 264 individual data points for each polarization, which are subsequently integrated over the sphere, producing the TRP metric. Due to the overlap in the positions at which measurements are desired, the described embodiments allow the TRP test to be performed simultaneously with the TIS test, thereby providing substantial time savings.","Alternatively, another method to configure wireless device  for full-power operation is to manually set the digital transmit gain by placing it in Factory Test Mode (FTM). In this configuration, the TRP test can be performed simultaneously with the idle mode RX gain determination described above with regard to the TIS test, providing for potential time savings.","In other words, the TRP metric may be determined by the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"TRP","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03c0"}},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mo":"\u222f","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["EIRP","v"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u03d5"],"mo":","}}},{"msub":{"mi":["EIRP","h"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u03d5"],"mo":","}}}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"sin"},{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03b8"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03d5"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}}}},"where EIRP(\u03b8,\u03c6) is the effective isotropic radiated power for the vertical polarization, and EIRP(\u03b8,\u03c6) is the effective isotropic radiated power for the horizontal polarization, which can be determined from the transmit gain patterns, G(\u03b8,\u03c6):\n\n(\u03b8,\u03c6)=(\u03b8,\u03c6)\/MaxOut\n","where MaxPAOut is the maximum power out of the power amplifier, i.e. the maximum power out of transmitter module , at each test frequency.","It follows that the peak effective radiated power, PeakEIRP, is the maximum value of the EIRP pattern:\n\nPeak=Max[Max((\u03b8,\u03c6)),Max((\u03b8,\u03c6))]\n","The PeakEIRP may be needed for regulatory certification of a wireless device, i.e., SAR, class level certification, radiated emissions.","Further, another transmit mode radiated performance characteristic is the antenna efficiency, \u03b7:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b7","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03c0"}},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mo":"\u222f","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["G","v"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u03d5"],"mo":","}}},{"msub":{"mi":["G","h"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u03d5"],"mo":","}}}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"sin"},{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03b8"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03d5"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}}}},"which is derived in a manner similar to deriving TRP from the antenna gain patterns.","Pattern envelope correlation, \u03c1, evaluates the potential for diversity gains of a dual antenna, dual receiver phone in a mobile environment. The rho test determines fading correlation based on measuring complex gains. The measured complex Rx patterns for the primary and secondary antennas (e.g., E\u03b8, E\u03c6, E\u03b8, E\u03c6, as discussed below) can be used to estimate the envelope correlation resulting from a model of the incident field on the antenna pair.","With the advent of receiver diversity as an available feature in current-generation of mobile station modem (\u201cMSM\u201d) ASICs, a need has developed for radiated tests to predict how well a multi-antenna system will perform in the field. MIMO devices will benefit from such a test as well. A crucial design parameter for a dual-antenna device is the correlation between antennas. An antenna pair which produces highly correlated signals in the dual receive chains is of minimal use for receive diversity. The described embodiments utilize the envelope correlation, also known as the fading correlation, as a predictor of diversity gain in dual antenna systems.","The envelope correlation can be predicted from complex voltage gain patterns of a pair of antennas and an assumed incident RF field. As with other receive gain measurements, the complex antenna gain pattern has traditionally been measured using a cabled test. In the case of a commercial wireless device, this requires destructive modification of the device to install external connectors. Instead of destructive modification, however, the described embodiments utilize component of receiver module  of wireless device . For example, in the case of a cellular phone, the CDMA rake receiver functionality requires accurate phase estimates of the Pilot channel. By providing an active Pilot channel from a cell-site simulator, such as simulator , and having radiated performance test module  log the received power from each receive chain\/antenna, as may be found in an RX_AGC data packet, and the in-phase\/quadrature-phase (I\/Q) Pilot estimates, as may be found in a RX_Pilot Finger data packet, from the rake receiver as the phone is rotated around a sphere, a complex gain pattern can be generated entirely on wireless device . This requires no destructive modification of the handset.","As with the receiver gain pattern discussed above, all logging may be consolidated on wireless device  if position\/angle information is wirelessly transmitted to the device, such as over the forward link, during data collection.","If wireless device  does not accurately implement receiver diversity in Idle mode, multi-antenna complex pattern determination may be accomplished with wireless device  in a traffic call.","In particular, the described embodiments include apparatus and methods for estimating the envelope fading

Complex patterns were measured and the fading correlation was calculated from the patterns for each test case. The resultant \u03c1 values ranged from 0.05 to 0.98. Additionally, the same mockup phones were used to measure the correlation between signals received by each antenna in typical indoor environments. The tests were performed in areas covered by the local PCS service provider.","In particular, referring to , the measured \u201cpattern\u201d correlation results from measurements in test chamber  were seen to compare favorably to those obtained from raw field measurements. For example, graph  includes a horizontal axis  corresponding to measured pattern \u03c1 values and a vertical axis  corresponding to field \u03c1 values for: a phone  having a single dipole antenna connected to a splitter and measured in non-line-of-sight (\u201cNLOS\u201d) conditions (indoors); a phone  having two pair of dipole antennas with 0.05\u03bb separation measured on a rooftop in near line-of-sight (\u201cLOS\u201d) conditions; a phone  having two pair of dipole antennas with 0.05\u03bb separation measured in NLOS conditions; a clamshell phone  having one external antenna and one internal antenna measured in NLOS conditions; a clamshell phone  having one external antenna and one internal antenna measured in NLOS conditions; a phone  with a dual stubby external antenna measured in NLOS conditions; and, a phone  with a stubby external antenna and an internal antenna measured in NLOS conditions. Thus, graph  indicates that the \u03c1's calculated from the patterns and field data nearly lay on top of each other for a large range of \u03c1 values.","Due to the correlation between the measured pattern \u03c1's and the field \u03c1's, these results confirm that laboratory tests can be performed, according to the described embodiments, to evaluate the diversity performance of dual antenna diversity enabled wireless devices without having to resort to extensive field testing.","Further, referring to , a table  includes an example of calculated \u03c1's  for different channel models  using measured radiated patterns from a demonstration phone. In this case, channel models  include an indoor environment with an outside base transceiver station, an urban microcell, an urban macrocell, and a highway macrocell. Further, each channel model  includes a different set of variables . In this case, for example, variables  include polarized wave, m, angular spread, \u03c3, and polarization ratio, XPR. It should be noted that the statistics used for the channel models were from measurements done by Kalliola, et. al., \u201cAngular Power Distribution and Mean Effective Gain of Mobile Antennas In Different Propagation Environments,\u201d , Vol. 51, No. 5, September 2002, hereby incorporated by reference. Based on these calculated results, the described apparatus and methods provide a robust approach for using complex radiated patterns to estimate the fading correlation between dual antennas in mobile environments to characterize the diversity performance of diversity-enabled wireless devices.","Thus, in the described embodiments, one or more predetermined radiated performance characteristics may be determined for a wireless device during a single test, where the wireless device is uncabled, and where the wireless device records its own measured values along with synchronization data in a resident memory. For example, the radiated performance characteristics may include the TIS value, the TRP value, and the envelope correlation, \u03c1. The calculated value of the radiated performance characteristic, based on measurements described herein, may then be compared to some predetermined threshold, such as may be set by a network carrier, a manufacture or standards group, in order to determine a radiated performance acceptability, approval, and\/or certification of the wireless device.","While the foregoing disclosure shows illustrative embodiments, it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the described embodiments as defined by the appended claims.
