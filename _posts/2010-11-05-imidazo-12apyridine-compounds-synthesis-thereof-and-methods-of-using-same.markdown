{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/258,549, filed Nov. 5, 2009, entitled IMIDAZO[1,2-a]PYRIDINE COMPOUNDS, SYNTHESIS THEREOF, AND METHODS OF USING SAME, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with Government support under Grant R01 AI 054193 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments herein relate to the field of chemistry and biochemistry, and, more specifically, to imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine compounds, synthesis thereof, and methods of using same.","Worldwide, over two billion people are infected with tuberculosis (TB), and an estimated 14,400,000 people have active cases of TB. Of these active cases, 83% are located in Africa, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific region. The global impact of TB is enormous: each year, TB kills 1.5 million HIV-negative people and 0.2 million HIV-positive people. New drug resistant strains emerge each year.","The current treatment for active, drug-susceptible TB includes a carefully-monitored regimen of a cocktail of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for two months, followed by an additional four months of rifampin and isoniazid. Multi-drug resistant TB infection requires a lengthy course of therapy lasting two years or more with drugs that are expensive and poorly tolerated. Because of their length, complexity, and expense, these regimens represent inadequate therapies for most TB cases. New therapeutics are urgently needed to combat TB infection, yet no new drugs have been approved to treat TB in over 40 years.","In addition, in a different technical area, a large number of fungi are known to grow at the expense of commercially important plants that are essential to human survival. A number of fungicides have been developed for use in protecting both ornamental plants and food crops from pathogenic fungi. While many safe and effective fungicides are currently in use, the evolution of pathogenic fungi and the ever-increasing pressure to use lower levels of fungicides create the need for new fungicides. Effective antifungal treatments are urgently needed to treat damaging fungal infections in plant species.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration embodiments that may be practiced.

In an embodiment, the quantity of active component may range from 0.5% to 90% by weight of the composition.","In embodiments, in therapeutic use for treating, ameliorating, preventing, or combating TB in subjects, the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be administered orally, parenterally, and\/or by inhalation at a dosage to obtain and maintain a concentration or blood-level of active component in the animal undergoing treatment that is therapeutically effective. In an embodiment, such a therapeutically effective amount\/dosage of active component may be in the range of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg\/kg, for instance, from about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg, of body weight\/day. It is to be understood that the dosages may vary depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the infection, the particular mycobacterial species, whether the infection is latent or active, the drug resistance of the strain, the duration of the infection being treated, and the particular compound being used. Also, it is to be understood that the initial dosage administered may be increased beyond the above upper level in order to rapidly achieve the desired blood-level or the initial dosage may be smaller than the optimum and the daily dosage may be progressively increased during the course of treatment depending on the particular situation. If desired, the daily dose also may be divided into multiple doses for administration, for instance, two to four times per day.","In an embodiment, an initial imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine compound was provided and tested as an exemplary member of the new imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine class of anti-tuberculosis agents disclosed herein. Such compound is identified below as compound ND-8454, and the compound's structure is shown in Table 1. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine is a simple bicyclic compound with a bridgehead nitrogen atom. This class of molecules is unrepresented within the TB literature, and the scaffold is very attractive because of the low cost of starting materials and the ease with which potent (<1 \u03bcg\/mL) anti-TB compounds are synthesized therefrom.","Many of the existing clinical candidates for TB therapeutics are derivatives of existing scaffolds (for instance, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, see Table 1), which results in drugs that are much more prone to emerging resistance. Other clinical candidates are complex compounds that are difficult and costly to manufacture (for example anti-TB candidates TMC207, PA-824, OPC-67683, and LL-3858, see Table 1).","In contrast, ND-8454, N-benzyl-2,7-dimethylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide, the initial \u201chit\u201d based on the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine scaffold, has an in vitro activity against H37Rv TB comparable to the current clinical candidates (MIC=0.08 \u03bcg\/mL or 286 nM) and no observed toxicity to VERO or HeLa cells (>128 and >50 \u03bcM, respectively).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

As used herein, the terms \u201ctuberculosis\u201d and \u201cTB\u201d refer to mycobacterial infection, a common and often deadly infectious disease usually caused by . Tuberculosis usually attacks the lungs (as pulmonary TB), but can also affect the central nervous system, the lymphatic system, the circulatory system, the genitourinary system, the gastrointestinal system, bones, joints, and even the skin. Other mycobacteria such as , and also cause tuberculosis, but these species are less common in humans.","The classic symptoms of tuberculosis are a chronic cough with blood-tinged sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Infection of other organs causes a wide range of symptoms. In some embodiments, a tuberculosis diagnosis may be made by radiology (commonly chest X-rays), a tuberculin skin test, and blood tests, as well as microscopic examination and microbiological culture of bodily fluids. Tuberculosis treatment is difficult and normally requires long courses of multiple antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance is a growing problem.","Approximately one third of the world's population is infected with . However, most of these cases will not develop the full-blown disease; asymptomatic, latent infection is most common. About one in ten of these latent infections will eventually progress to active disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than half of its victims. In 2004, mortality and morbidity statistics included 14.6 million chronic active cases, 8.9 million new cases, and 1.6 million deaths, mostly in developing countries. In addition, a rising number of people in the developed world are contracting tuberculosis because of compromised immune systems from immunosuppressive drugs, substance abuse, or AIDS. The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform worldwide, with about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries testing positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5-10% of the US population tests positive. It is estimated that the US has 25,000 new cases of tuberculosis each year, 40% of which occur in immigrants from countries where tuberculosis is endemic.","An estimated 75% of active TB cases involve pulmonary TB. Symptoms include chest pain, coughing up blood, a productive, prolonged cough for more than three weeks, fever, chills, night sweats, appetite loss, weight loss, pallor, and often a tendency to fatigue very easily. In the other 25% of active cases, the infection moves from the lungs, causing extrapulmonary tuberculosis. This occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and young children. Extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura in tuberculosis pleurisy, the central nervous system in meningitis, the lymphatic system in scrofula of the neck, the genitourinary system in urogenital tuberculosis, and bones and joints in Pott's disease of the spine. An especially serious form is disseminated TB, more commonly known as miliary tuberculosis. Although extrapulmonary TB is not contagious, it may co-exist with pulmonary TB, which is contagious.","The primary cause of TB, , is an aerobic, Gram-positive bacterium. In addition, the complex includes three other TB-causing mycobacteria: and is not widespread, but in parts of Africa it is a significant cause of tuberculosis. was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of milk pasteurization has largely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. is mostly seen in immunodeficient people, although it is possible that the prevalence of this pathogen has been underestimated.","Other known pathogenic mycobacteria include and . The last two are part of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) group. Nontuberculous mycobacteria cause neither TB nor leprosy, but they do cause pulmonary diseases resembling TB.","Specific gene polymorphisms in IL12B have been linked to tuberculosis susceptibility. Additionally, patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of contracting tuberculosis, and they have a poorer response to treatment, possibly due to poorer drug absorption. Other conditions that increase risk include IV drug abuse; recent TB infection or a history of inadequately treated TB; chest X-ray suggestive of previous TB, showing fibrotic lesions and nodules; silicosis; prolonged corticosteroid therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy; head and neck cancers; hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia and Hodgkin's disease; end-stage kidney disease; intestinal bypass or gastrectomy; chronic malabsorption syndromes; vitamin D deficiency; and low body weight. Furthermore, some drugs, including rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work by blocking tumor necrosis factor-alpha, raise the risk of activating a latent infection due to the importance of this cytokine in the immune defense against TB.

For instance, while levels of potency of the ester analogs (notably, benzyl and ethyl) were good in various heterocyclic series (oxazolines, oxazoles, thiazolines, thiazoles and imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines), these esters were metabolically labile.

In addition, the stability of the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine analogs in rat, dog and human microsomes were vastly improved (>80% remained after a 15 minute incubation). Furthermore, unlike the other heterocyclic scaffolds, the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were remarkably metabolically stable in a simulated gastric juice assay (>90% remaining after a 15-minute incubation).","In other embodiments, imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine analogs were generated and optimized using in vitro SAR studies to improve potency, metabolism, organism selectivity and formulation.
