No. 60\/650,001 filed Feb. 3, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","The present invention generally relates to a non-aqueous electrolyte rechargeable electrochemical cell, and particularly to the formulation of non-aqueous electrolyte used in Li ion rechargeable cells to achieve a wide operating temperature range.","Rechargeable lithium ion batteries have been commercially available for well over a decade. In spite of the improvements in energy densities and power densities, lithium ion cell technology remains restricted to a narrow temperature range of operation. The electrolyte components ethylene carbonate (EC) and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF) are responsible for much of the temperature range limitation. As a result, lithium batteries can only deliver the rated capacity and power in a narrow range of \u221220\u00b0 C. and +60\u00b0 C. Below \u221230\u00b0 C., lithium cells suffer severe power and energy loss along with the safety risk caused by possible lithium metal deposition; while at temperatures higher than 60\u00b0 C., the thermal decomposition of LiPFcauses permanent degradation of the cell and potential safety hazards. These restrictions limit the usage of lithium ion batteries in a variety of harsh environments experienced by electric or hybrid electric vehicles (EV\/HEV), military and space missions.","Efforts to lower the low temperature operational limits of Li ion cells have focused on replacing the majority of the high melting EC with high ratios of low melting solvents such as the linear dialkylcarbonates or esters. Exemplary of this effort is U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,064 (Smart et al.). Unfortunately, the cycle life of such modified Li ion cells is compromised at room temperatures. Moreover, the oxidative decomposition of these volatile co-solvents at the charged surface of the cathode accelerates at elevated temperatures, resulting in gas buildup and shortened cell lifetime.","Efforts to raise the high temperature operational limit of Li ion cells include using a thermally stable lithium salt and have been scarce and rarely successful. An example of the use of a thermally stable salt lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) is Xu et al., -5 (1), A26 (2002). While Li ion cells having an electrolyte based on LiBOB and carbonate mixtures such as EC\/dimethylene carbonate (DMC) or EC\/propylene carbonate (PC)\/DMC can stably cycle at temperatures as high as 70\u00b0 C., such cells do suffer from lower power and diminished low temperature performance.","Another example for the effort to improve the stability of electrolytes at high temperature is shown by Takami et al., who taught an electrolyte including LiBFdissolved in a gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) reduces the gas production within a lithium ion cell when the cell is stored at high temperatures. However, such cells also suffer from lower power and diminished low temperature performance. The cycling performance of these lithium ion cells deteriorates rapidly at high temperatures, caused by the presence of labile fluorines in the anion BF. (Takami et al., 149, A9 (2002)). The electrolyte combination of GBL with LiPFalso fails to deliver good performances in lithium ion cells even at room temperature, due to the low stability of the electrolyte on anodic graphite. (Chagnes et al., 150, A1255 (2003)).","Currently, no electrolyte composition is available which can simultaneously support the stable operation of Li ion cells at both high and low temperatures. Thus, there exists a need for an electrolyte composition that can simultaneously support the operation of Li ion cells above 60\u00b0 C. and below \u221230\u00b0 C. without serious degradations in cycle life, energy and power.","A non-aqueous rechargeable electrochemical cell includes an electrolyte composition produced through the dissolution of a thermally stable lithium salt in a lactone solvent. The resulting cell has stable performance in a wide temperature range between \u221240\u00b0 C. and 80\u00b0 C. The resulting cell operates across this wide temperature range with a commercially acceptable capacity retention, power loss characteristics, and safety characteristics across this temperature range.","The non-aqueous rechargeable electrochemical cell includes a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator interposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. A non-aqueous electrolyte is in simultaneous contact with the electrodes and the separator and includes a lithium salt dissolved in a non-aqueous electrolyte solvent having the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"20.91mm","wi":"18.12mm","file":"US08632918-20140121-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","6 ","1","6 "]},"Alternatively, an electrochemical cell includes as a solvent a lactone having a four to eight membered ring to yield a capacity retention for the cell at \u221240\u00b0 C. for more than 50% and at 60\u00b0 C. after 100 cycles more than 90% relative to the cell operation at 25\u00b0 C. Regardless of the nature of electrolyte lactone solvent, additional secondary solvents are also optionally provided such as a cyclic carbonate, an acyclic carbonate, an acyclic mono-ester, and combinations thereof.","The present invention has utility as an electrolyte and an operative battery.
