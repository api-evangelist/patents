Granzyme B is released towards target cells, along with the pore-forming protein, perforin, resulting in its perforin-dependent internalization into the cytoplasm and subsequent induction of apoptosis (see, for e.g., Medema et al., 27:3492-3498, 1997). However, during aging, inflammation and chronic disease, Granzyme B can also be expressed and secreted by other types of immune (e.g., mast cell, macrophage, neutrophil, and dendritic cells) or non-immune (keratinocyte, chondrocyte) cells and has been shown to possess extracellular matrix remodeling activity (Choy et al., 24(12):2245-2250, 2004 and Buzza et al., 280:23549-23558, 2005).","Inhibitors of Granzyme B in humans have been limited to (a) relatively weak, nonspecific inhibitors such as isocoumarins (Odake et al., (1991), 30(8), 2217-2227); (b) biological inhibitors such as serpinB9 (Sun et al., (1996), 271(44), 27802-27809); (c) covalently coupled inhibitors such as aldehydes (Willoughby et al., (2002), 12(16), 2197), halomethyl ketones (Kam et al., (2000), 1477(1-2), 307-323), and phosphonates (Mahrus and Craik, (2005), . & 12, 567-77 and Kam et al., (2000)); and (d) tricyclic inhibitors (Willoughby et al., (2002)).","Nonspecific inhibitors (such as isocoumarins) are not sufficiently potent or specific to be effective treatments for Granzyme-B-related diseases, disorders, and conditions. Likewise, the use of biological inhibitors such as serpins is limited by the ability to deliver the inhibitor to the target mammal, the cost of manufacturing the biological agents, and other, off-target activities, such as inhibition of other serine proteases such as human neutrophil elastase (Dahlen et al., (1999), 1451(2-3), 233-41), Caspase-1 (Annaud et al., (1999), ., September 15; 342 Pt3, 655-65; Krieg et al., (2001), 15(11), 1971-82; and Young et al., (2000), 191(9), 1535-1544); Caspase-4 and Caspase-8 (Annaud et al., (1999)).","The tricyclic inhibitors (Willoughby et al. (2001)) also suffer from synthetic complexity\/high manufacturing cost due to the complex core and accompanying low water solubility.","Despite the advances in development of Granzyme B inhibitors, there exists a need for compounds that inhibit Granzyme B with selectivity, that are relatively simple to manufacture at low cost, and that do not present drug delivery challenges. The present invention seeks to fulfill this need and provides further related advantages.","The present invention provides Granzyme B inhibitor compounds, compositions that include the compounds, and methods for using the compounds.","In one aspect of the invention, the invention provides Granzyme B inhibitor compounds.","In one embodiment, the invention provides the compounds having Formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"29.46mm","wi":"72.56mm","file":"US09458138-20161004-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"its stereoisomers, tautomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein:","Ris a heteroaryl group selected from","(a) 1,2,3-triazolyl, and","(b) 1,2,3,4-tetrazolyl;","n is 1 or 2;","Ris selected from","(i) C-Calkyl,","(ii) C-Cheteroalkyl optionally substituted with C-Calkyl,","(iii) C-Ccycloalkyl,","(iv) C-Caryl,","(v) heterocyclyl,","(vi) C-Cheteroaryl,","(vii) aralkyl, and","(viii) heteroalkylaryl;","Ris \u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014R,","wherein Ris selected from","(i) C-Calkyl optionally substituted with C-Caryl, C-Cheteroaryl, amino, or carboxylic acid,","(ii) C-Cheteroalkyl optionally substituted with C-Calkyl or carboxylic acid,","(iii) C-Ccycloalkyl optionally substituted with C-Calkyl, optionally substituted C-Caryl, optionally substituted C-Cheteroaryl, amino, or carboxylic acid,","(iv) C-Caryl optionally substituted with C-Calkyl, optionally substituted C-Caryl, optionally substituted C-Cheteroaryl, amino, or carboxylic acid,","(v) heterocyclyl,","(vi) C-Cheteroaryl,","(vii) aralkyl, and","(viii) heteroalkylaryl;","Wherein",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"17.10mm","wi":"18.71mm","file":"US09458138-20161004-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"24.38mm","wi":"25.65mm","file":"US09458138-20161004-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Ra and Rb are independently selected from hydrogen and C-Calkyl, and","Rc at each occurrence is independently selected from"]}}}},"(a) hydrogen,","(b) halogen,","(c) C-Calkyl,","(d) \u2014XR, wherein X is selected from O, C(\u2550O), S, S\u2550O, or S(\u2550O),","(e) \u2014C(\u2550O)N(R)(R),","(f) \u2014N(R)(R)(R),","(g) \u2014N\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014R, and","(h) \u2014N\u2014C(\u2550O)O\u2014R,","wherein R, R, and Rare independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C-Calkyl, C-Cheteroalkyl, C-Calkenyl, C-Caryl, aralkyl, and C-Cheteroaryl;

the inhibitory activity of the compounds of the invention is described in Examples D1 and D4.","A Granzyme B enzymatic inhibition assay is described in Example D2 and Example D5. The compounds of the invention identified in Table 1 exhibited Granzyme B inhibitory activity. In certain embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<50,000 nM. In other embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<10,000 nM. In further embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<1,000 nM. In still further embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<100 nM. In certain embodiments, select compounds exhibited ICfrom 10 nM to 100 nM, preferably from 1 nM to 10 nM, more preferably from 0.1 nM to 1 nM, and even more preferably from 0.01 nM to 0.1 nM.","A caspase enzymatic inhibition assay is described in Example D3 and Example D6. None of the compounds of the invention tested demonstrated an ability to significantly inhibit any of the caspases evaluated at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM. In certain embodiments, the compounds exhibited less than 50% inhibition at 50 \u03bcM. In other embodiments, the compounds exhibited greater than 50% inhibition at 50 \u03bcM, but less than 10% inhibition at 25 \u03bcM. The results demonstrate that select compounds of the invention selectively inhibit Granzyme B without significantly inhibiting caspases.","A cell detachment assay is described in Example D7.","A fibronectin cleavage assay is described in Example D8.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include an inhibitor compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of Formulae (I), (II), or (III)) as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Representative salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, ammonium, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts. Representative salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, and trimethamine.","Compositions can include one or more carriers acceptable for the mode of administration of the preparation, be it by topical administration, lavage, epidermal administration, sub-epidermal administration, dermal administration, subdermal administration, transdermal administration, subcutaneous administration, systemic administration, injection, inhalation, oral, or any other mode suitable for the selected treatment. Topical administration includes administration to external body surfaces (e.g., skin) as well as to internal body surfaces (e.g., mucus membranes for vaginal or rectal applications by, for example, suppositories). Suitable carriers are those known in the art for use in such modes of administration.","Suitable compositions can be formulated by means known in the art and their mode of administration and dose determined by a person of skill in the art. For parenteral administration, the compound can be dissolved in sterile water or saline or a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle used for administration of non-water soluble compounds. For enteral administration, the compound can be administered in a tablet, capsule, or dissolved or suspended in liquid form. The tablet or capsule can be enteric coated, or in a formulation for sustained release. Many suitable formulations are known including, polymeric or protein microparticles encapsulating a compound to be released, ointments, pastes, gels, hydrogels, foams, creams, powders, lotions, oils, semi-solids, soaps, medicated soaps, shampoos, medicated shampoos, sprays, films, or solutions which can be used topically or locally to administer a compound. A sustained release patch or implant may be employed to provide release over a prolonged period of time. Many techniques known to one of skill in the art are described in Remington: the Science & Practice of Pharmacy by Alfonso Gennaro, 20th ed., Williams & Wilkins, (2000). Formulations can contain excipients, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated naphthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide\/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers can be used to control the release of a compound. Other potentially useful delivery systems for a modulatory compound include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations can contain an excipient, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate, and deoxycholate, or can be an oily solution for administration in the form of drops, as a gel, or for other semi-solid formulation.","Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with this invention or for use in the methods disclosed herein can be administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents as appropriate. Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with this invention or for use in the methods disclosed herein can be administered by means of a medical device or appliance such as an implant, graft, prosthesis, stents, and wound dressings. Also, implants can be devised that are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time.","One skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable methods of administering a Granzyme B inhibitor directly to the eye are available (i.e., invasive and noninvasive methods). Although more than one route can be used to administer the Granzyme B inhibitor, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. The present use is not dependent on the mode of administering the agent to an animal, preferably a human, to achieve the desired effect, and the described routes of administration are exemplary. As such, any route of administration is appropriate so long as the agent contacts an ocular cell. Thus, the Granzyme B inhibitor can be appropriately formulated and administered in the form of an injection, eye lotion, ointment, and implant.","The Granzyme B inhibitor can be applied, for example, systemically, topically, intracamerally, subconjunctivally, intraocularly, retrobulbarly, periocularly (e.g., subtenon delivery), subretinally, or suprachoroidally. In certain cases, it can be appropriate to administer multiple applications and employ multiple routes to ensure sufficient exposure of ocular cells to the Granzyme B inhibitor (e.g., subretinal and intravitreous). Multiple applications of the Granzyme B inhibitor can also be required to achieve the desired effect.","Depending on the particular case, it may be desirable to non-invasively administer the Granzyme B inhibitor to a patient. For instance, if multiple surgeries have been performed, the patient displays low tolerance to anesthetic, or if other ocular-related disorders exist, topical administration of the Granzyme B inhibitor may be most appropriate. Topical formulations are well known to those of skill in the art. Such formulations are suitable in the context of the use described herein for application to the skin or to the surface of the eye. The use of patches, corneal shields (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,152), and ophthalmic solutions (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,710,182) and ointments is within the skill in the art.","The Granzyme B inhibitor also can be present in or on a device that allows controlled or sustained release, such as an ocular sponge, meshwork, mechanical reservoir, or mechanical implant. Implants (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,443,505, 4,853,224 and 4,997,652), devices (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,554,187, 4,863,457, 5,098,443 and 5,725,493), such as an implantable device (e.g., a mechanical reservoir, an intraocular device or an extraocular device with an intraocular conduit, or an implant or a device comprised of a polymeric composition are particularly useful for ocular administration of the expression vector). The Granzyme B inhibitor also can be administered in the form of sustained-release formulations (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,475) comprising, for example, gelatin, chondroitin sulfate, a polyphosphoester, such as bis-2-hydroxyethyl-terephthalate, or a polylactic-glycolic acid.","When used for treating an ocular disease the Granzyme B inhibitor is administered via an ophthalmologic instrument for delivery to a specific region of an eye. Use of a specialized ophthalmologic instrument ensures precise administration while minimizing damage to adjacent ocular tissue. Delivery of the Granzyme B inhibitor to a specific region of the eye also limits exposure of unaffected cells to the Granzyme B inhibitor. A preferred ophthalmologic instrument is a combination of forceps and subretinal needle or sharp bent cannula.","Alternatively, the Granzyme B inhibitor can be administered using invasive procedures, such as, for instance, intravitreal injection or subretinal injection, optionally preceded by a vitrectomy, or periocular (e.g., subtenon) delivery. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be injected into different compartments of the eye (e.g., the vitreal cavity or anterior chamber).","While intraocular injection is preferred, injectable compositions can also be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, intraarterially, and intraperitoneally. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for injectable compositions are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986)).","An \u201ceffective amount\u201d of a Granzyme B inhibitor or a pharmaceutical composition of the invention as described herein includes a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, such as reduced levels of Granzyme B activity. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as Granzyme B activity. Typically, a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a therapeutically effective amount.","It is to be noted that dosage values can vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. For any particular subject, specific dosage regimens can be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that can be selected by a medical practitioner. The amount of active compound(s) in the composition can vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus can be administered, several divided doses can be administered over time or the dose can be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.","In general, compounds of the invention should be used without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compounds of the invention can be determined using standard techniques, for example, by testing in cell cultures or experimental animals and determining the therapeutic index (i.e., the ratio between the LD, the dose lethal to 50% of the population, and the LD, the dose lethal to 100% of the population). In some circumstances however, such as in severe disease conditions, it may be necessary to administer substantial excesses of the composition.","Methods of Use","In a further aspect, the invention provides methods of using the compounds of the invention as Granzyme B inhibitors.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting Granzyme B in a subject. In the method, an effective amount of a compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of Formulae (I), (II), or (III)) is administered to a subject in need thereof.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a disease, disorder, or condition treatable by inhibiting Granzyme B. In the method, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of Formulae (I), (II), or (III)) is administered to a subject in need thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201cdisease, disorder, or condition treatable by inhibiting Granzyme B\u201d refers to a disease, disorder, or condition in which Granzyme B is involved in the pathway related to for the disease, disorder, or condition, and that inhibiting Granzyme B results in the treatment or prevention of the disease, disorder, or condition.","Representative methods of treatment using the compounds of the invention include those described for Granzyme B inhibitors in WO 2007\/101354 (Methods of Treating, Reducing, and Inhibiting the Appearance of Ageing in the Skin), WO 2009\/043170 (Treatment of Dissection, Aneurysm, and Atherosclerosis Using Granzyme B Inhibitors), WO 2012\/076985 (Granzyme B Inhibitor Compositions, Methods and Uses for Promoting Wound Healing), each expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The compounds of the invention are useful for treating, reducing, and inhibiting the appearance of aging of the skin; treating dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis; and promoting wound healing.","Other disease and disorders described as treatable using the Granzyme B inhibitors are disclosed in WO 2003\/065987 (Granzyme B Inhibitors), expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

A description of intracellular versus extracellular Granzyme B in immunity and disease is provided in Granville et al., 2009, 1-26, expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The reference provides a listing of conditions in which the pathogenic role of Granzyme B has been identified.","The compounds of the invention are useful in treating cutaneous scleroderma, epidermolysis bullosa, radiation dermatitis, alopecia areata, and discoidal lupus erythematosus.","Cutaneous Scleroderma.","Scleroderma refers to a heterogeneous group of autoimmune fibrosing disorders. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome or LcSSc) develop sclerosis of the skin distal to their elbows and knees and have facial involvement. Patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (DcSSc) develop proximal, in addition to distal, skin sclerosis. Both groups of patients are also at high risk of developing internal organ involvement. Patients with LcSSc and DcSSc suffer from Raynaud's phenomenon (excessively reduced blood flow in response to cold or emotional stress, causing discoloration of the fingers, toes, and occasionally other areas believed to be the result of vasospasms that decrease blood supply to the respective regions) with high frequencies. Management of progressive skin involvement is dependent on additional comorbidities. In patients with skin involvement only, mycophenolate mofetil (Cellsept, immunomodulator) or methotrexate (T cell modulator) have been recommended.","Epidermolysis Bullosa.","Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a chronic mucocutaneous autoimmune skin blistering disease. EBA patients can be classified into two major clinical subtypes: noninflammatory (classical or mechanobullous) and inflammatory EBA, which is characterized by cutaneous inflammation. In patients with inflammatory EBA, widespread vesiculobullous eruptions are observed, typically involving the trunk, central body, extremities, and skin folds. Usually the patients suffer from pruritus (rashes). Autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen (COLT) has been implicated in the pathogenesis. Therefore, EBA is a prototypical autoimmune disease with a well-characterized pathogenic relevance of autoantibody binding to the target antigen. EBA is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.2-0.5 new cases per million and per year. The current treatment of EBA relies on general immunosuppressive therapy, which does not lead to remission in all cases.","Radiation Dermatitis.","Radiation Dermatitis (acute skin reaction) ranges from a mild rash to severe ulceration. Approximately 85-90% of patients treated with radiation therapy will experience a moderate-to-severe skin reaction. Acute radiation-induced skin reactions often lead to itching and pain, delays in treatment, and diminished aesthetic appearance\u2014and subsequently to a decrease in quality of life. Skin reactions related to radiation therapy usually manifest within 1-4 weeks of radiation start, persist for the duration of radiation therapy, and may require 2-4 weeks to heal after completion of therapy. The severity of the skin reaction ranges from mild erythema (red rash) and dry desquamation (itchy, peeling skin) to more severe moist desquamation (open wound) and ulceration. Treatments that have been assessed for the management of radiation-induced skin reactions include topical steroid creams, nonsteroidal creams, dressings, and herbal remedies. Only three trials have showed a significant difference: one in favor of a corticosteroid cream, one favoring a nonsteroidal cream, and one for a dressing. However, all three of these trials were small and had limitations, thus there is still an unmet medical need.","Late effects of radiation therapy, typically months to years post exposure, occur at doses greater than a single dose of 20-25 Gy or fractionated doses of 70 Gy or higher. The major underlying histopathological findings at the chronic stage include telangiectasia, dense dermal fibrosis (round fibrosis), sebaceous and sweat gland atrophy, loss of hair follicles, and with higher doses, increased melanin deposition or depigmentation and skin ulcers.","Ramipril was very effective in reducing the late effects of skin injury, whereas its mitigating effects on the acute and sub-acute injury were modest. However, the dose required to mitigate these late effects may be pharmacologically too high to be clinically relevant. More recently, it has been shown that significant mitigation of acute skin injury using an adeno-associated virus encoding the manganese SOD gene, when injected subcutaneously shortly after irradiation. However, difficulties in delivery, application and cost limit the utility of this treatment strategy.","Alopecia Aerata.","Alopecia areata (AA) is a CD8+ T-cell dependent autoimmune disease of the hair follicle (HF) in which the collapse of HF immune privilege (IP) plays a key role. Mast cells (MCs) are crucial immunomodulatory cells implicated in the regulation of T cell-dependent immunity, IP, and hair growth. Many of these infiltrating immune cells express GzmB, suggesting it may be a key mediator in immune cell-mediated follicular attack. The peptide substance P was shown to increase the CD8+ cells expressing GzmB in the intrafollicular dermis, co-relating to a regression of follicles into the catagen stage of follicle growth cessation (Siebenhaar et al., 2007, 127: 1489-1497).","In mice fed a diet with excess vitamin A, AA was accelerated and GzmB expressing cells were found in excess surrounding hair follicles, including in the isthmus (the region of the follicle containing stem cells) (Duncan et al., 2013, 133: 334-343). As GzmB is expressed in the immune cell infiltrate within and surrounding growing follicles, it may be a key protease involved in hair loss through autoimmunity, apoptosis and ECM degradation.","No drug is currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of alopecia areata. A number of treatments have been found to be effective using the American College of Physician's criteria, for example, topical and oral corticosteroids and the sensitizing agents diphenylcyclopropenone and dinitrochlorobenzene. However, there is no cure for alopecia areata, nor is there any universally proven therapy that induces and sustains remission.","Discoid Lupus Erythematosus.","Granzyme B is a serine protease found in cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells that plays an important role in inducing apoptotic changes in target cells during granule exocytosis-induced cytotoxicity. When Granzyme B is secreted into the cytoplasm of a target cell through the pore formed by perforin, it triggers cytotoxic-induced cell death (Shah et al., 2011, 269:16-21).","Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that displays many diverse symptoms in which localized cutaneous LE (CLE) is on one end of the spectrum and severe systemic LE (SLE) on the other end. CLE is a disfiguring, chronic skin disease, with a significant impact on the patients' everyday life. CLE are further divided into four main subsets: Acute CLE (ACLE), subacute CLE (SCLE) and chronic CLE (CCLE), where classic discoid LE (DLE) is the most common form. There is also a drug-induced form of the disease. The disease often has a chronic and relapsing course that can be induced or aggravated by UV light. CLE patients display well-defined skin lesions, often in sun-exposed areas. Discoid LE is the most common subtype of CLE, 60-80% is localized above the neck and 20-40% is generalized (lesions both above and below the neck). 70-90% of the DLE patients suffer from photosensitivity and sun exposed areas such as the scalp, ears and cheeks, which are most commonly involved areas. The lesions start as erythematosus maculae or papules with a scaly surface and then grow peripherally into larger discoid plaques that heal with atrophic scar and pigmentary changes. DLE often results in scarring and alopecia. Mutilation with tissue loss can be seen when the lesions affect the ears and tip of the nose. CLE can be managed but so far, not cured. Avoidance of trigger factors is of utmost importance, such as, cessation of smoking and avoidance of sun exposure. The treatment is about the same for the different CLE subsets where first-line of treatment is sun-protection and local therapy with corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Antimalarial are the first choice of systemic treatment.","Strong co-expression of Granzyme B and the skin-homing molecule, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) was found in lesional lymphocytes of patients with scarring localized chronic DLE and disseminated chronic DLE, which was enhanced compared with nonscarring subacute CLE and healthy controls (Wenzel et al., 2005, 153: 1011-1015). Wenzel et al. conclude that skin-homing cytotoxic Granzyme B-positive lymphocytes play an important role in the pathophysiology of scarring chronic DLE and that the potentially autoreactive cytotoxic lymphocytes targeting adnexal structures may lead to scarring lesions in chronic DLE.","Correlation between Granzyme B-positive lymphocytes and the presence of CLE was shown by Grassi (Grassi et al., 2009, 34:910-914). Granzyme B is an apoptosis immunological mediator that, once synthesized and free from activated cytotoxic lymphocytes, enters the target cell and starts apoptotic mechanisms involved at different levels in all apoptotic pathways. In CLE, apoptosis is characterized by the presence of colloid or Civatte bodies, which are evident in the epidermis and papillary dermis of CLE lesions, and since Granzyme B is mainly expressed in CLE lesions, Grassi et al. conclude that Granzyme B could play a role in the induction of apoptotic mechanisms in CLE.","The expression of Granzyme B and perforin was correlated with clinicopathological features in patients with DLE, where both Granzyme B and perforin were expressed in DLE, with absent expression in normal skin (Abdou et al., 2013, Early Online 1-9). Abdou et al. concluded that cytotoxicity in dermal lymphocytic inflammation was due to expression of both Granzyme B and perforin.","Extracellular Granzymes B is also reported to play a role in DLE by Grassi et al. Further, UV light increases Granzyme B expression in keratinocytes as well as mast cells (Hernandez-Pigeon, 2007, 282:8157-8164). As Granzymes B is in abundance at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), where many key extracellular matrix substrates are present (for example, laminin, fibronectin, decorin), it follows that Granzymes B may also be damaging the DEJ, as is observed in DLE. Given its expression in adnexal structures, Granzyme B may also be contributing to alopecia, as reduced Granzymes B is associated with reduced hair loss in a murine model of skin aging. Similarly, reduced extracellular Granzyme B activity is associated with improved collagen organization and reduced scarring in the skin and aorta.","In view of the established connection between Granzyme B and DLE, by virtue of their ability to inhibit Granzyme B, the compounds of the invention are useful in methods for treating lupus erythematosus (LE) including severe systemic LE (SLE) and localized cutaneous LE (CLE) (e.g., acute CLE (ACLE), subacute CLE (SCLE), chronic CLE (CCLE) and the most common form classic discoid LE (DLE)). In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating DLE comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a subject suffering from DLE.","Administration.","In the above methods, the administration of the Granzyme B inhibitor can be a systemic administration, a local administration (e.g., administration to the site, an inflamed microenvironment, an inflamed joint, an area of skin, a site of a myocardial infarct, an eye, a neovascularized tumor), or a topical administration to a site (e.g., a site of inflammation or a wound).","The term \u201csubject\u201d or \u201cpatient\u201d is intended to include mammalian organisms. Examples of subjects or patients include humans and non-human mammals, e.g., nonhuman primates, dogs, cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, cats, mice, rabbits, rats, and transgenic non-human animals. In specific embodiments of the invention, the subject is a human.","The term \u201cadministering\u201d includes any method of delivery of a Granzyme B inhibitor or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Granzyme B inhibitor into a subject's system or to a particular region in or on a subject. In certain embodiments, a moiety is administered topically, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally, intranasally, orally, transcutaneously, intrathecal, intravitreally, intracerebral, or mucosally.","As used herein, the term \u201capplying\u201d refers to administration of a Granzyme B inhibitor that includes spreading, covering (at least in part), or laying on of the inhibitor. For example, a Granzyme B inhibitor may be applied to an area of inflammation on a subject or applied to, for example the eye or an area of inflammation by spreading or covering the surface of the eye with an inhibitor, by injection, oral or nasal administration.","As used herein, the term \u201ccontacting\u201d includes contacting a cell or a subject with a Granzyme B inhibitor. Contacting also includes incubating the Granzyme B inhibitor and the cell together in vitro (e.g., adding the inhibitor to cells in culture) as well as administering the inhibitor to a subject such that the inhibitor and cells or tissues of the subject are contacted in vivo.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctreating\u201d or \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to a beneficial or desired result including, but not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms, diminishing the extent of a disorder, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of a disorder, amelioration or palliation of the disorder, whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival in the absence of treatment.","Cosmetic Compositions and Related Methods","In further aspects, the invention provides cosmetic compositions that include one or more granzyme B inhibitors of the invention and methods for using the compositions to treat, reduce, and\/or inhibit the appearance of ageing of the skin.","This aspect of the invention is based, in part, on the observation that granzyme B expression is induced in keratinocytes and immune cells, such as mast cells in the skin during aging. When released by these cells, granzyme B cleaves extracellular matrix proteins such as decorin which can result in collagen disorganization. This invention is also based in part on the observation that granzyme B cleaves decorin, in addition to other extracellular matrix proteins, in the interstitial space surrounding cells.","Skin is comprised of three main layers: the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous layers. Each of these three layers has individual compositions. The functions and structures of these layers are known to a person of skill in the art. The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin and includes both living and dead cell layers. The dermis is the middle layer of skin and is comprised of arrangements of collagen fibers, which surround many specialized cells and structures. Hair follicles are found within the dermis, and produce the hair shaft which grows out through layers of the dermis and epidermis to become visible as hair. The lowermost layer of the skin is the subcutaneous layer, often called the sub-dermis. The subcutaneous layer is comprised largely of fat and connective tissue and houses larger blood vessels and nerves. Collagen may be found in all layers of the skin, but is most prominently in the dermis layer.","A youthful appearance is achieved by not having at least one of the characteristic signs of age. This is often achieved by being young. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which being young does not confer a youthful appearance as a disease or disorder or other non-time related event has conferred the characteristics associated with age. A youthful appearance is often characterized by the condition of the skin and the following skin qualities are typically associated with, but not limited to, a youthful appearance: small pore size, healthy skin tone, radiance, clarity, tautness, firmness, plumpness, suppleness, elasticity, softness, healthy skin texture, healthy skin contours, such as few or no wrinkles, shallow wrinkle depth, few or no fine lines, healthy skin luster and brightness, moisturized skin, healthy skin thickness and resilient skin. If a skin of a subject comprises any one or more of these characteristics then a youthful appearance is achieved.","The appearance of ageing can occur for a variety of reasons, but typically happens at a normal rate associated with the passage of time. A rate of appearance of ageing will be different for different subjects, depending on a variety of factors including age, gender, diet and lifestyle. An appearance of ageing is often characterized by the condition of the skin. Characteristics associated with an appearance of ageing in the skin include, but are not limited to, skin fragility, skin atrophy, skin wrinkles, fine lines, skin discoloration, skin sagging, skin fatigue, skin stress, skin inelasticity, skin fragility, skin softening, skin flakiness, skin dryness, enlarged pore size, skin thinning, reduced rate of skin cell turnover, deep and deepening of skin wrinkles. The rate of appearance of ageing can be measured by measuring the rate at which any one or more of the above characteristics appear. An appearance of ageing may be inhibited, reduced, or treated by reducing or maintaining a state of any one or more of these skin characteristics.","In many circumstances a reduction in the appearance of ageing of skin occurs when the rate of collagen cleavage exceeds the rate of collagen formation. In many other circumstances, a youthful appearance of skin is maintained when the rate of collagen formation is equal to the rate of collagen cleavage. In many other circumstances, a reduction in a rate of appearance of ageing of skin is achieved when the rate of decorin cleavage and collagen disorganization and cleavage is slowed such that the rate of collagen fibrillogenesis exceeds the rate of collagen cleavage and the ratio of the rate of collagen fibrillogenesis to the rate of collagen cleavage is greater after application of granzyme B inhibitor compound compared to the ratio before application of the compound. In many other circumstances, an extracellular protein, other than decorin, is also cleaved by granzyme B, and the beneficial effects of inhibiting granzyme B can be enhanced beyond what is realized by inhibiting decorin cleavage alone.","In one aspect, the invention provides a cosmetic composition. The composition comprises a cosmetically acceptable carrier and one or more compounds of the invention (e.g., a compound of Formulae (I), (II), or (III), or stereoisomers, tautomers, and cosmetically acceptable salts thereof, as described herein).","As used herein, the term \u201ccosmetically acceptable salt\u201d refers to a salt prepared from a cosmetically acceptable base, such as an inorganic base and an organic base, or a salt prepared from a cosmetically acceptable acid. Representative salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, ammonium, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts.

Compositions for use in the methods described herein can comprise one of more of a granzyme B inhibitor compound or a cosmetically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, in combination with a cosmetically acceptable carrier.","The cosmetic compositions can include diluents, excipients, solubilizing agents, emulsifying agents, and salts known to be useful for cosmetic compositions. Examples of suitable agents include thickeners, buffers, preservatives, surface active agents, neutral or cationic lipids, lipid complexes, liposomes, and penetration enhancers. In certain embodiments, the cosmetic compositions further include other cosmetic ingredients known in the art.","In certain embodiments, the cosmetic composition can include one or more penetration enhancers. Numerous types of penetration enhancers are known, such as fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, surfactants and non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 8:91-192, 1991; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 7:1-33, 1990). Fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, cabrylic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid, caprylic acid, hexanoic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, valeric acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, erucic acid, nervonic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, recinleate, monoolein (also known as 1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol), dilaurin, arachidonic acid, glyceryll-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, mono- and di-glycerides and physiologically acceptable salts thereof (e.g., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems page 92, 1991; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 7:1, 1990; El-Hariri et al., 44:651-654, 1992).","In certain embodiments, the cosmetic composition further includes other cosmetic ingredients known in the art to be useful for cosmetic, skincare, and\/or dermatological applications (e.g., anti-wrinkle active ingredients including flavone glycosides such as alpha-glycosylrutin; coenzyme Q10; vitamin E and derivatives; as well as sunblock ingredients, moisturizers, and perfumes).","The cosmetic compositions of the invention can be administered for \u201ccosmetic\u201d or \u201cskincare\u201d (e.g., dermatologic) applications, either alone or as an \u201cadditive\u201d in combination with other suitable agents or ingredients. As used herein, \u201ccosmetic\u201d and \u201cskincare\u201d applications includes, for example, preventive and\/or restorative applications in connection with dermatological changes in the skin, such as, for example, during pre-mature skin aging; dryness; roughness; formation of dryness wrinkles; itching; reduced re-fatting (e.g., after washing); visible vascular dilations (e.g., telangiectases, cuperosis); flaccidity; formation of wrinkles and lines; local hyperpigmentation; hypopigmentation; incorrect pigmentation (e.g., age spots); increased susceptibility to mechanical stress (e.g., cracking); skin-sagging (e.g., lack of firmness) and the appearance of dry or rough skin surface features.","The cosmetic compositions of the invention can be formulated for topical administration. Such compositions can be administered topically in any of a variety of forms. Such compositions are suitable in the context of the use described herein for application to the skin or to the surface of the eye. The use of patches, corneal shields (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,152), and ophthalmic solutions (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,710,182) and ointments is within the skill in the art.","Compositions for topical administration include dermal patches, ointments, lotions, serums, creams, gels, hydrogels, pastes, foams, oils, semi-solids, shampoos, soaps, drops, sprays, films, liquids, and powders. Examples of such compositions include those in which a cosmetically effective amount of a compound of the invention is encapsulated in a vehicle selected from macro-capsules, micro-capsules, nano-capsules, liposomes, chylomicrons and microsponges. Another example of such a composition includes absorption of a compound of the invention on or to a material selected from powdered organic polymers, talcs, bentonites, and other mineral supports. A third example of such a composition or formulation includes a mixture of a cosmetically effective amount of a compound of the invention with other ingredients selected from extracted lipids, vegetable extracts, liposoluble active principles, hydrosoluble active principles, anhydrous gels, emulsifying polymers, tensioactive polymers, synthetic lipids, gelifying polymers, tissue extracts, marine extracts, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, solar filter compositions, and antioxidants. Other examples of suitable composition ingredients can be found in US2005\/0249720.","In the cosmetic compositions, the compounds of the invention can be incorporated into any gelanic form, such as oil\/water emulsions and water\/oil emulsions, milks, lotions, gelifying and thickening tensioactive and emulsifying polymers, pomades, lotions, capillaries, shampoos, soaps, powders, sticks and pencils, sprays, and body oils.","Regardless of the compound or formulation described herein, application\/administration to a subject as a colloidal dispersion system can be used as a delivery vehicle to enhance the in vivo stability of the compound and\/or to target the granzyme B inhibitor compound to a particular skin layer, tissue or cell type. Colloidal dispersion systems include, but are not limited to, macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, liposomes and lipid:inhibitor complexes of uncharacterized structure. An example of a colloidal dispersion system is a plurality of liposomes. Liposomes are microscopic spheres having an aqueous core surrounded by one or more outer layers made up of lipids arranged in a bilayer configuration (see, generally, Chonn et al., 6:698-708, 1995). Sustained-release dosage forms of the compounds described herein can also be used.","The amount of the granzyme B inhibitor compound administered or applied to a subject is not critical, except that it should be an amount sufficient to effect improvement of the condition for which the composition is administered\/applied. Application can be dependent on a number of factors, including severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated, and with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until improvement of a condition is effected or a diminution of a symptom is achieved.","A \u201ccosmetically effective amount\u201d of a granzyme B inhibitor compound includes a cosmetically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A \u201ccosmetically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired cosmetic result, such as improved skin elasticity, skin durability, skin firming, skin texture, decrease the appearance or decrease rate of appearance of aging, and the like. A cosmetically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the skin state, age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum cosmetic response. A cosmetically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the cosmetically beneficial effects. A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as improved skin elasticity, skin durability, skin firming, skin texture, a decrease appearance or a decrease in the rate of appearance of aging, and the like. Typically, a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of skin deterioration, so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a cosmetically effective amount.","The amount of granzyme B inhibitor administered\/applied may vary with the severity of the appearance, or rate of appearance, of age of the skin. For any particular subject, specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the judgment of the person applying or supervising the applying of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that may be selected. The amount of granzyme B inhibitor compound(s) in the composition or formulation can vary according to factors such as the skin state, age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum response. For example, a single application can be administered\/applied, several divided doses can be administered\/applied over time or the amount of the composition administered\/applied can be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. It can be advantageous to formulate the granzyme B inhibitor compounds in a composition into a dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of application.","By way of example, a granzyme B inhibitor compound of the cosmetic composition can be administered\/applied to achieve from about 0.01 micrograms per milliliter (\u03bcg\/mL) to about 10 milligrams per milliliter, from about 0.1 \u03bcg\/mL to about 500 \u03bcg\/mL, from about 0.1 \u03bcg\/mL to about 1500 \u03bcg\/mL, from about 1 \u03bcg\/mL to about 2000 \u03bcg\/mL, and from about 0.1 \u03bcg\/mL to about 5000 \u03bcg\/mL, including any range within these ranges, final concentrations at a target site.","Appropriate dosage values can depend on the characteristics of the site to which the composition is to be applied\/administered and on the form of the granzyme B inhibitor compound used. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature and generally available to practitioners in the art. Those skilled in the art will employ different formulations for different uses and the granzyme B inhibitor compound used. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the granzyme B inhibitor compound in, for example, a bodily fluid or a tissue. Following successful treatment, it can be desirable to have the subject undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the condition, wherein a selected compound is administered\/applied in maintenance doses applied, for example, once or more daily, to once every few days. In certain embodiments, granzyme B inhibitor compounds are administered\/applied in an amount to achieve ex vivo concentrations from about 1 micromolar to about 10 millimolar, from about 10 micromolar to about 5000 micromolar, or from about 30 micromolar to about 3000 micromolar, and from about 25 micromolar to about 3000 micromolar final concentration over a site of interest, and including, about 25 micromolar, or about 1600 micromolar, or about 3000 micromolar final concentration over the site, and still more typically between about 1 micromolar to about 1000 micromolar.","Compounds or compositions of granzyme B inhibitors can be administered\/applied by means of a device or appliance such as an implant, graft, prosthesis, garment of clothing, stent, and the like. Also, implants can be devised which are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time. Such implants can be placed into a garment to be worn by a subject, for example a glove, shirt, mask or hat.","The cosmetic compositions of the invention can be used to inhibit or reduce the appearance of ageing. Ageing is a natural phenomenon that cannot be reversed per se, but the appearance of ageing, such as skin deterioration including, but not limited to, skin inelasticity, skin fragility, skin softening, skin flakiness, skin dryness, enlarged pore size, skin thinning, reduced rate of skin cell turnover, skin wrinkling, deepening of skin wrinkles, skin sagging, fine lines, and skin discoloration may be inhibited or reduced.","The cosmetic compositions can be used to increase or decrease a rate of increasing or a rate of decreasing occurrences of a particular skin characteristic. In other words, the composition, when applied to the skin or a portion of the skin of a subject delays the onset of an appearance of aging. For example, in a population of subjects where half of the population applies a granzyme B inhibitor to their skin and another half of the population does not apply a granzyme B inhibitor to their skin, the half which applied a granzyme B inhibitor would not appear as aged as the half which did not apply the granzyme B inhibitor after a period of time had elapsed. The half of the population which applied a granzyme B inhibitor to the skin would also have maintained a youthful appearance.","The rate at which a particular subject experiences a change in the rate of appearance of a particular skin characteristic, i.e., an increasing or decreasing rate of the appearance of a particular skin characteristic, will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to age, weight, sex and lifestyle of the subject. As such, rates are not necessarily constant, but a normal rate of increase or of decrease of an appearance of a characteristic, defined as being the new occurrence of a particular characteristic over a predetermined period of time under a set of conditions that do not include the presence of a granzyme B inhibitor applied by a method or use of this invention, is increased or decreased by applying a granzyme B inhibitor in accordance with a method or use of this invention. Methods of measuring skin characteristics, rates of increasing appearance of skin characteristics and rates of decreasing appearance of skin characteristics are known to a person of skill in the art, see for example, by Agache et al., Springer (2004).","Surprisingly, granzyme B inhibitors can also be used to increase the density of hair follicles of a skin of a subject and may be used to reduce the occurrences of cutaneous xanthomas of a skin of a subject. Actively growing hair follicles contain melanocytes that transfer pigment to matrix keratinocytes, imparting color to hair. Additionally, sebum, produced in sebaceous glands, is often secreted via hair follicles. Increased density of hair follicles results in increased pigment production and increased sebum secretion resulting in improved hair appearance (e.g., hair that is less grey in color or not grey at all) as well as healthier hair and skin. Granzyme B inhibitors also cause hair follicles to appear deeper in the skin which provide stronger hair that is less susceptible to mechanical damage. Additionally, a characteristic sign of ageing is the reduction in hair follicle density. It is known in the art that age and follicular miniaturization are weak predictors of total hair count (see Chapman et al., 152:646-649, 2005). Consequently, the characteristic sign of age associated with hair follicle density is not predictive of hair density.","The cosmetic composition may be applied to a portion of the skin of a subject or to the whole of the skin of the subject. For example, the composition may be applied to the skin, only on the face, only on the scalp, on the whole head or to each part of the body.","Each reference cited is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Abbreviations","As used herein, the following abbreviations have the indicated meanings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0314","num":"0332"},"sup":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0315","num":"0333"},"sup":"19"},"% Inh: Percent inhibition","Ac-IEPD-AMC: acetyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-prolyl-aspartyl-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) substrate","ACN: acetonitrile","BHET: bis-2-hydroxyethyl-terephthalate","Boc: tert-butoxycarbonyl","BSA: Bovine serum albumin","CHAPS: 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate","DAPI: 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole","DCM: dichloromethane","DIPEA: diisopropylethylamine","DMAP: 4-dimethylaminopyridine","DMF: dimethylformamide","DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide","DMSO-d6: dimethylsulfoxide-d6","DTT: dithiothreitol","EDC: 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride","EDTA: 2-({2-[Bis(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl}(carboxymethyl)amino)acetic acid","ESI: Electrospray ionization","EtOAc: ethyl acetate","eq.: equivalent(s)","GzmB: Granzyme B","HATU: 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,1,1-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate","HCl: hydrochloric acid","HEPES: 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid","hGzmB: human Granzyme B","HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography","HOBt: 1-hydroxy-benzotriazol","IC: inhibitory concentration that provides 50% inhibition","LC\/MS: liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry","MeOH: methanol","mGzmB: murine Granzyme B","MS: mass spectrometry","m\/z: mass to charge ratio.","Oxyma: ethyl 2-cyano-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate","PBS: phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4)","RPM: revolution per minute","RT: room temperature","tert-BuOH: tert-butyl alcohol","THF: tetrahydrofuran","TFA: trifluoroacetic acid","wt %: weight percent","Representative compounds of the invention were prepared according to Methods A to E as described below and illustrated in .","It will be appreciated that in the following general methods and preparation of synthetic intermediates, reagent levels and relative amounts or reagents\/intermediates can be changed to suit particular compounds to be synthesized, up or down by up to 50% without significant change in expected results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0359","num":"0377"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00038","num":"00038"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00038","he":"58.93mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09458138-20161004-C00038.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"HCl Solution in dioxane (4M, 5 ml) was added to respective carbamate compound (0.125 mmol) and stirred for 2 hrs at RT.

When appropriate, percent inhibition data was collected and fitted to generate ICdata using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla Calif. USA, www.graphpad.com) and its non-linear regression analysis tools or other equivalent tools.","Select compounds of Examples C1-C9 exhibited inhibitory activity against hGzmB. Each of the compounds of the invention identified in Table 1 exhibited Granzyme B inhibitory activity.","In certain embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<50,000 nM. In other embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<10,000 nM. In further embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<1,000 nM. In still further embodiments, select compounds exhibited IC<100 nM. In certain embodiments, select compounds exhibited ICfrom 10 nM to 100 nM, preferably from 1 nM to 10 nM, more preferably from 0.1 nM to 1 nM, and even more preferably from 0.01 nM to 0.1 nM.","In vitro fluorogenic detection assays for assessing the ICand\/or percent inhibition at a given concentration of inhibitors, against a set of human Caspase enzymes, was performed as described in Example D4. Representative compounds of the invention do not significantly inhibit any caspase enzyme tested at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM.","In certain embodiments, the compounds exhibited less than 50% inhibition at 50 \u03bcM. In other embodiments, the compounds exhibited greater than 50% inhibition at 50 \u03bcM, but less than 10% inhibition at 25 \u03bcM.","HDFa primary human fibroblasts were plated at 10 k\/well in 200 ul, approximately 20 hrs before treatment. The next day, controls and 100 nM GzmB (recombinant, human) plus or minus inhibitor treatments were prepared in serum-free media. GzmB and inhibitor were incubated for 20 minutes at RT before adding to cells. Before addition, media and serum was removed from the cells and the cells were washed with PBS (1\u00d7), using pipettes to prevent disturbing the cells. Treatment preparations (100 ul) were added to the wells and incubated for 7 hours in a tissue culture incubator. After 7 hours, media and treatments were removed and the cells were washed with PBS (1\u00d7) to removed detached cells, using pipettes only. Phase pictures were taken then the PBS was removed and replaced with 100 uL of serum-free media and 20 uL of MTS and the cells were allowed to incubate for 3 hours in a cell culture incubator. After 3 hours the absorbance was read at 490 nm and a percent inhibition value for the treatments with inhibitors was determined from the control wells.

After fibronectin coating, plates were washed 3 times in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl) then once with granzyme B assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% CHAPS). After washing, 50 uL of granzyme B assay buffer was added to each fibronectin-coated well. In a separate non-binding 96 well assay plate 5 uL of 20\u00d7 inhibitor serial dilution stocks were added to 45 uL of 2.22\u00d7 GzmB mix to establish inhibition (enzyme\/inhibitor mixes were all prepared in granzyme B assay buffer and were incubated first at room temperature for 20 minutes, then at 30\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes). After incubation, 50 uL of this 2\u00d7 enzyme\/inhibitor mix was added to the corresponding coated well to initiate fibronectin cleavage (20 nM final granzyme B concentration, 8-point inhibitor dilution series starting at 50 uM). The assay was conducted at 30\u00b0 C. in the TECAN plate reader (TECAN INFINITE\u00ae M1000 Pro), which was programmed to monitor the kinetic fluorescence polarization signal (filter set Ex\/Em 470 nm\/527 nm) with readings taken every minute, for 1 hour.
