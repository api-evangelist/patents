Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to methods for monitoring expression of a plurality of genes in cells. The present invention also relates to genomic sequenced tags and to substrates and computer readable media containing such genomic sequenced tags.","2. Description of the Related Art","Microarray technology is increasingly becoming the method of choice for the quantitative and simultaneous analysis of the expression levels of many thousands of genes. Microarray analyses typically follow the steps of gene selection, microarray synthesis, sample preparation, array hybridization, detection, and data analysis (Watson et al., 19989: 609-614).","PCR-amplified coding sequences of genomic DNA from an organism are particularly useful in microarrays for obtaining global expression profiles where the genome of the organism has been fully sequenced.","Chu et al., 1998282: 699-705 disclose the use of microarrays containing PCR-amplified genomic coding sequences for determining the temporal expression of genes during sporulation.","For other organisms whose genomes have not been sequenced, global expression profiles may be obtained with arraying (1) random genomic DNA segments or clones (e.g., from a genomic DNA library); (2) random cDNA clones (e.g., from one or more cDNA libraries) that are uncharacterized at the DNA sequence level; or (3) random cDNA clones that have been sequenced and partially characterized with respect to putative identification and function.","Genomic sequenced tags (GSTs) are partial genomic DNA sequences. Simply stated, a GST is a segment of a sequence from a random genomic DNA clone that corresponds to part of a specific gene. The use of sequenced GSTs in microarrays compared to genomic clones or random cDNA clones provides several advantages especially for organisms whose genomes have not been fully sequenced. First, since sequence information is available, redundancy and follow-up characterization is minimized. Second, GST microarrays can be organized based on function of the gene products to facilitate analysis of the results (e.g., GSTs encoding enzymes from the same metabolic pathway can be arranged or grouped accordingly).","Ruan et al., 199815: 821-833, disclose the use of microarrays containing EST sequences for determining the temporal expression of genes in root, leaf, and two stages of floral development.","Iyer et al., 1999283; 83-87, disclose the use of microarrays containing human EST sequences for determining the temporal expression of human fibroblast cells in response to serum.","Hayward et al., 200035: 6-14, disclose shotgun DNA microarrays and stage-specific gene expression in malaria.","Bacteria are used as host microorganisms for the industrial production of enzymes and other proteins whether endogenous or heterogenous to the microorganisms. There is a need in the art to provide methods for monitoring the global expression of genes from cells to improve the production potential of these microorganisms.","It is an object of the present invention to provide alternative methods for monitoring expression of a plurality of genes in cells.","The present invention relates to methods for monitoring differential expression of a plurality of genes in a first cell relative to expression of the same or similar genes in one or more second cells, comprising:","(a) adding a mixture of labeled nucleic acid probes isolated from the cells to a substrate containing an array of GSTs under conditions where the nucleic acids hybridize to complementary sequences of the GSTs in the array, wherein the nucleic acids from the first cell and the one or more second cells are labeled with a first reporter and one or more different second reporters, respectively; and","(b) examining the array under conditions wherein the relative expression of the genes in the cells is determined by the observed hybridization reporter signal of each spot in the array in which (i) the GSTs in the array that hybridize to the nucleic acids obtained from either the first or the one or more second cells produce a distinct first hybridization reporter signal or one or more second hybridization reporter signals, respectively, and (ii) the GSTs in the array that hybridize to the nucleic acids obtained from both the first and one or more second cells produce a distinct combined hybridization reporter signal. In a preferred embodiment, the GSTs are the GSTs of SEQ ID NOs. 1-4448. In another preferred embodiment, the GSTs are the GSTs of SEQ ID NOs. 4449-8481.","The present invention also relates to computer readable media, substrates containing an array of GSTs, and computer-based systems.","The present invention relates to methods for monitoring differential expression of a plurality of genes in a first cell relative to expression of the same genes in one or more second cells. The methods comprise (a) adding a mixture of labeled nucleic acid probes isolated from two or more cells in culture to a substrate containing an array of GSTs under conditions where the nucleic acids hybridize to complementary sequences of the GSTs in the array; and (b) examining the array under conditions wherein the relative expression of the genes in the two or more cells is determined by the observed hybridization reporter signal of each spot in the array.","The methods of the present invention may be used to monitor global expression of a plurality of genes from a cell, discover new genes, identify possible functions of unknown open reading frames, and monitor gene copy number variation and stability. For example, the global view of changes in expression of genes may be used to provide a picture of the way in which cells adapt to changes in culture conditions, environmental stress, or other physiological provocation. Other possibilities for monitoring global expression include spore morphogenesis, recombination, metabolic or catabolic pathway engineering.","The methods of the present invention are particularly advantageous when one spot on an array equals one gene or open reading frame because extensive follow-up characterization is unnecessary since sequence information is available, and GST microarrays can be organized based on function of the gene products. However, one spot may contain more than one gene especially if random genomic sequences are used.","Genomic Sequenced Tags","The term \u201cgenomic sequenced tag\u201d or \u201cGST\u201d is defined herein as a segment of a sequence from a random genomic DNA clone of an expressed genome. The term \u201cGST\u201d will be understood to also include two or more GSTs assembled into a contig. GSTs are generally generated as follows: Total cellular DNA is isolated from a cell, digested with a restriction endonuclease or cleaved by sonication, nebulization, or physical methods, size-selected by agarose gel electrophoresis, isolated, and ligated into a vector, e.g., pSGMU2 (Errington, 1986132: 2953-2961). The ligation mixture is used to transform competent cells and transformants are selected under selective pressure, e.g., ampicillin selection. Plasmids from the genomic DNA libraries are generated from random selected transformants, isolated, and partially sequenced. The partial sequences are then compared to sequences in various publicly available databases, for example GenBank, EMBL, Swissprot etc., for identification of function and annotated accordingly.","In the methods of the present invention, the GSTs are preferably at least about 50 bp in length, more preferably at least about 100 bp in length, even more preferably at least about 150 bp in length, and most preferably at least about 200 bp in length.","The GSTs may be obtained from any cell but preferably from a , or cells. In a preferred embodiment, the cell is a clausii cell.","In a preferred embodiment, the GSTs are obtained from a cell. In a more preferred embodiment, the GSTs are obtained from ATCC 14580. In a most preferred embodiment, the GSTs are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs. 1-4448, nucleic acid fragments of SEQ ID NOs. 1-4448, and nucleic acid sequences having at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% homology to SEQ ID NOs. 1-4448.","In another preferred embodiment, the GSTs are obtained from a clausii cell. In another more preferred embodiment, the GSTs are obtained from clausii NCIB 10309. In another most preferred embodiment, the GSTs are selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs. 4449-8481, nucleic acid fragments of SEQ ID NOs. 4449-8481, and nucleic acid sequences having at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% homology to SEQ ID NOs. 4449-8481.","Microarrays","The term \u201can array of GSTs\u201d is defined herein as a linear or two-dimensional array of preferably discrete elements of GSTs, each having a finite area, formed on the surface of a solid support.","The term \u201cmicroarray\u201d is defined herein as an array of GST elements having a density of discrete GST elements of at least about 100\/cm, and preferably at least about 1000\/cm. The GST elements in a microarray have typical dimensions, e.g., diameters, in the range of between about 10 to about 250 \u03bcm, preferably in the range of between about 10 to about 200 \u03bcm, more preferably in the range of between about 20 to about 150 \u03bcm, even more preferably in the range of between about 20 to about 100 \u03bcm, most preferably in the range of between about 50 to about 100 \u03bcm, and even most preferably in the range of between about 80 to about 100 \u03bcm, and are separated from other GST elements in the microarray by about the same distance.","Methods and instruments for forming microarrays on the surface of a solid support are well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,522; U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,637; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,151. The instrument may be an automated device such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,522.","The term \u201ca substrate containing an array of GSTs\u201d is defined herein as a solid support having deposited on the surface of the support one or more of a plurality of GSTs for use in detecting binding of labeled nucleic acids to the GSTs.","The substrate may, in one aspect, be a glass support (e.g., glass slide) having a hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating on the surface of the support, and an array of distinct GSTs bound to the coating, where each distinct GST is disposed at a separate, defined position.","Each microarray in the substrate preferably contains at least 10distinct GSTs in a surface area of less than about 5 or 6 cm. Each distinct GST (i) is disposed at a separate, defined position in the array, (ii) has a length of at least 50 bp, and (iii) is present in a defined amount between about 0.1 femtomoles and 100 nanomoles or higher if necessary.","For a hydrophilic coating, the glass slide is coated by placing a film of a polycationic polymer with a uniform thickness on the surface of the slide and drying the film to form a dried coating. The amount of polycationic polymer added should be sufficient to form at least a monolayer of polymers on the glass surface. The polymer film is bound to the surface via electrostatic binding between negative silyl-OH groups on the surface and charged cationic groups in the polymers. Such polycationic polymers include, but are not limited to, polylysine and polyarginine.","Another coating strategy employs reactive aldehydes to couple DNA to the slides (Schena et al., 199693: 10614-10619; Heller at al., 199794: 2150-2155).","Alternatively, the surface may have a relatively hydrophobic character, i.e., one that causes aqueous medium deposited on the surface to bead. A variety of known hydrophobic polymers, such as polystyrene, polypropylene, or polyethylene, have desirable hydrophobic properties, as do glass and a variety of lubricant or other hydrophobic films that may be applied to the support surface. A support surface is \u201chydrophobic\u201d if an aqueous droplet applied to the surface does not spread out substantially beyond the area size of the applied droplet, wherein the surface acts to prevent spreading of the droplet applied to the surface by hydrophobic interaction with the droplet.","In another aspect, the substrate may be a multi-cell substrate where each cell contains a microarray of GSTs, and preferably an identical microarray, formed on a porous surface. For example, a 96-cell array may typically have array dimensions between about 12 and 244 mm in width and 8 and 400 mm in length, with the cells in the array having width and length dimension of I\/12 and I\/8 the array width and length dimensions, respectively, i.e., between about 1 and 20 in width and 1 and 50 mm in length.","The solid support may include a water-impermeable backing such as a glass slide or rigid polymer sheet, or other non-porous material. Formed on the surface of the backing is a water-permeable film which is formed of porous material. Such porous materials include, but are not limited to, nitrocellulose membrane nylon, polypropylene, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer. The thickness of the film is preferably between about 10 and 1000 \u03bcm. The film may be applied to the backing by spraying or coating, or by applying a preformed membrane to the backing.","Alternatively, the solid support may be simply a filter composed of nitrocellulose, nylon, polypropylene, or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer, or for that matter any material suitable for use.","The film surface may be partitioned into a desirable array of cells by water-impermeable grid lines typically at a distance of about 100 to 2000 \u03bcm above the film surface. The grid lines can be formed on the surface of the film by laying down an uncured flowable resin or elastomer solution in an array grid, allowing the material to infiltrate the porous film down to the backing, and then curing the grid lines to form the cell-array substrate.","The barrier material of the grid lines may be a flowable silicone, wax-based material, thermoset material (e.g., epoxy), or any other useful material. The grid lines may be applied to the solid support using a narrow syringe, printing techniques, heat-seal stamping, or any other useful method known in the art.","Each well preferably contains a microarray of distinct GSTs. \u201cDistinct GSTs\u201d as applied to the GSTs forming a microarray is defined herein as an array member which is distinct from other array members on the basis of a different GST sequence, and\/or different concentrations of the same or distinct GSTs, and\/or different mixtures of distinct GSTs or different-concentrations of GSTs. Thus an array of \u201cdistinct GSTs\u201d may be an array containing, as its members, (i) distinct GSTs, which may have a defined amount in each member, (ii) different, graded concentrations of given-sequence GSTs, and\/or (iii) different-composition mixtures of two or more distinct GSTs.","However, any type of substrate known in the art may be used in the methods of the present invention.","The delivery of a known amount of a selected GST to a specific position on the support surface is preferably performed with a dispensing device equipped with one or more tips for insuring reproducible deposition and location of the GSTs and for preparing multiple arrays. Any dispensing device known in the art may be used in the methods of the present invention. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,522.","For liquid-dispensing on a hydrophilic surface, the liquid will have less of a tendency to bead, and the dispensed volume will be more sensitive to the total dwell time of the dispenser tip in the immediate vicinity of the support surface.","For liquid-dispensing on a hydrophobic surface, flow of fluid from the tip onto the support surface will continue from the dispenser onto the support surface until it forms a liquid bead. At a given bead size, i.e., volume, the tendency of liquid to flow onto the surface will be balanced by the hydrophobic surface interaction of the bead with the support surface, which acts to limit the total bead area on the surface, and by the surface tension of the droplet, which tends toward a given bead curvature. At this point, a given bead volume will have formed, and continued contact of the dispenser tip with the bead, as the dispenser tip is being withdrawn, will have little or no effect on bead volume.","The desired deposition volume, i.e., bead volume, formed is preferably in the range 2 pl (picoliters) to 2 nl (nanoliters), although volumes as high as 100 nl or more may be dispensed. It will be appreciated that the selected dispensed volume will depend on (i) the \u201cfootprint\u201d of the dispenser tip(s), i.e., the size of the area spanned by the tip(s), (ii) the hydrophobicity of the support surface, and (iii) the time of contact with and rate of withdrawal of the tip(s) from the support surface. In addition, bead size may be reduced by increasing the viscosity of the medium, effectively reducing the flow time of liquid from the dispensing device onto the support surface. The drop size may be further constrained by depositing the drop in a hydrophilic region surrounded by a hydrophobic grid pattern on the support surface.","At a given tip size, bead volume can be reduced in a controlled fashion by increasing surface hydrophobicity, reducing time of contact of the tip with the surface, increasing rate of movement of the tip away from the surface, and\/or increasing the viscosity of the medium. Once these parameters are fixed, a selected deposition volume in the desired picoliter to nanoliter range can be achieved in a repeatable fashion.","After depositing a liquid droplet of a GST sample at one selected location on a support, the tip may be moved to a corresponding position on a second support, the GST sample is deposited at that position, and this process is repeated until the GST sample has been deposited at a selected position on a plurality of supports.","This deposition process may then be repeated with another GST sample at another microarray position on each of the supports.","The diameter of each GST region is preferably between about 20-200 \u03bcm. The spacing between each region and its closest (non-diagonal) neighbor, measured from center-to-center, is preferably in the range of about 20-400 \u03bcm. Thus, for example, an array having a center-to-center spacing of about 250 \u03bcm contains about 40 regions\/cm or 1,600 regions\/cm. After formation of the array, the support is treated to evaporate the liquid of the droplet forming each region, to leave a desired array of dried, relatively flat GST regions. This drying may be done by heating or under vacuum. The DNA can also be UV-crosslinked to the polymer coating.","Bacterial Cells","In the methods of the present invention, the two or more cells may be any cell where one of the cells is used as a reference for identifying differences in expression of the same or similar complement of genes in the other cell(s). In one aspect, the two or more cells are the same cell. For example, they may be compared under different growth conditions, e.g., oxygen limitation, nutrition, and\/or physiology. In another aspect, one or more cells are mutants of the reference cell. For example, the mutant(s) may have a different phenotype. In a further aspect, the two or more cells are of different species (e.g., and ). In another further aspect, the two or more cells are of different genera. In an even further aspect, one or more cells are transformants of the reference cell, wherein the one or more transformants exhibit a different property. For example, the transformants may have an improved phenotype relative to the reference cell and\/or one of the other transformants. The term \u201cphenotype\u201d is defined herein as an observable or outward characteristic of a cell determined by its genotype and modulated by its environment. Such improved phenotypes may include, but are not limited to, improved secretion or production of a protein or compound, reduced or no secretion or production of a protein or compound, improved or reduced expression of a gene, desirable morphology, an altered growth rate under desired conditions, relief of over-expression mediated growth inhibition, or tolerance to low oxygen conditions.","The cells may be any cells, but preferably , or cells.","In a preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are clausii cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are firmus cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In another preferred embodiment, the cells are cells.","In a more preferred embodiment, the cells are cells. In a most preferred embodiment, the cells are ATCC 14580 cells.","In another more preferred embodiment, the cells are clausii cells. In another most preferred embodiment, the clausii cells are clausii NCIB 10309 cells.","In the methods of the present invention, the cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for growth using methods well known in the art for isolation of the nucleic acids to be used as probes. For example, the cells may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors performed in a suitable medium. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection).","Nucleic Acid Probes","The nucleic acid probes from the two or more cells may be any nucleic acid including genomic DNA, cDNA, and RNA, and may be isolated using standard methods known in the art. For example, cDNA probes may be obtained from total RNA isolated from the cells using standard methods and reverse transcribed into total cDNA.","The populations of isolated nucleic acid probes may be labeled with colorimetric, radioactive (for example, P, P, or S), fluorescent reporters, or other reporters using methods known in the art (Chen et al., 1998, Genomics 51: 313-324; DeRisi et al., 1997278: 680-686; U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,367).","In a preferred embodiment, the probes are labeled with fluorescent reporters. For example, the cDNA probes may be labeled during reverse transcription from the respective RNA pools by incorporation of fluorophores as dye-labeled nucleotides (DeRisi et al., 1997, supra), e.g., Cy5-labeled deoxyuridine triphosphate, or the isolated cDNAs may be directly labeled with different fluorescent functional groups. Fluorescent-labeled nucleotides include, but are not limited to, fluorescein conjugated nucleotide analogs (green fluorescence), lissamine nucleotide analogs (red fluorescence). Fluorescent functional groups include, but are not limited to, Cy3 (a green fluorescent dye) and Cy5 (red fluorescent dye).","Array Hybridization","The labeled nucleic acids from the two or more cells are then added to a substrate containing an array of GSTs under conditions where the nucleic acid pools from the two or more cells hybridize to complementary sequences of the GSTs in the array. For purposes of the present invention, hybridization indicates that the labeled nucleic acids from the two or more cells hybridize to the GSTs under very low to very high stringency conditions.","A small volume of the labeled nucleic acids mixture is loaded onto the substrate. The solution will spread to cover the entire microarray. In the case of a multi-cell substrate, one or more solutions are loaded into each cell which stop at the barrier elements.","For nucleic acid probes of at least about 100 nucleotides in length, miroarray hybridization conditions described by Eisen and Brown, 1999303: 179-205, may be used. Hybridization is conducted under a coverslip at 65\u00b0 C. in 3\u00d7SSC for 4-16 hours followed by post-hybridization at room temperature after removal of the coverslip in 2\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS by plunging the array two or three times in the solution, followed by successive washes in 1\u00d7SSC for 2 minutes and 0.2\u00d7SSC wash for to or more minutes.","Conventional conditions of very low to very high stringency conditions may also be used. Very low to very high stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization and hybridization at 42\u00b0 C. in 5\u00d7SSPE, 0.3% SDS, 200 \u03bcg\/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and either 25% formamide for very low and low stringencies, 35% formamide for medium and medium-high stringencies, or 50% formamide for high and very high stringencies, following standard Southern blotting procedures.","The carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2\u00d7SSC, 0.2% SDS preferably at least at 45\u00b0 C. (very low stringency), more preferably at least at 50\u00b0 C. (low stringency), more preferably at least at 55\u00b0 C. (medium stringency), more preferably at least at 60\u00b0 C. (medium-high stringency), even more preferably at least at 65\u00b0 C. (high stringency), and most preferably at least at 70\u00b0 C. (very high stringency).","For shorter nucleic acid probes which are less than 50 nucleotides, microarray hybridization conditions described by Kane et al., 200028: 4552-4557, may be used. Hybridization is conducted under a supported coverslip at 42\u00b0 C. for 16-18 hours at high humidity in 50% formamide, 4.1\u00d7Denhardts, 4.4\u00d7SSC, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml of herring sperm DNA. Arrays are washed after removal of the coverslip in 4\u00d7SSC by immersion into 1\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 minutes, 0.1\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS twice for 10 minutes, and 0.1\u00d7SSC twice for 10 minutes.","For shorter nucleic acid probes which are about 50 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides in length, conventional stringency conditions may be used. Such stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization, hybridization, and washing post-hybridization at 5\u00b0 C. to 10\u00b0 C. below the calculated Tusing the calculation according to Bolton and McCarthy (196248:1390) in 0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1\u00d7Denhardt's solution, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 0.1 mM ATP, and 0.2 mg of yeast RNA per ml following standard Southern blotting procedures.","The carrier material is finally washed once in 6\u00d7SSC plus 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes and twice each for 15 minutes using 6\u00d7SSC at 5\u00b0 C. to 10\u00b0 C. below the calculated T.","The choice of hybridization conditions will depend on the degree of homology between the GSTs and the nucleic acids obtained from the two or more cells. For example, where the nucleic acid probes and the GSTs are obtained from identical cells, high stringency conditions may be most suitable. Where the cells are from a genus or species different from which the GSTs were obtained, low or medium stringency conditions may be more suitable.","In a preferred embodiment, the hybridization is conducted under low stringency conditions. In a more preferred embodiment, the hybridization is conducted under medium stringency conditions. In a most preferred embodiment, the hybridization is conducted under high stringency conditions.","The entire solid support is then reacted with detection reagents if needed and analyzed using standard calorimetric, radioactive, or fluorescent detection means. All processing and detection steps are performed simultaneously to all of the microarrays on the solid support ensuring uniform assay conditions for all of the microarrays on the solid support.","Detection","Any detection method known in the art may be used. The most common detection method is laser-induced fluorescence detection using confocal optics (Cheung et al., 199818: 225-230). The array is examined under fluorescence excitation conditions such that (i) the GSTs in the array that hybridize to the nucleic acid probes obtained from one of the first cell and one or more second cells produces a distinct first fluorescence emission color or one or second fluorescence emission colors, respectively, and (ii) the GSTs in the array that hybridize to substantially equal numbers of nucleic acid probes obtained from the first cell and one of the one or more second cells produce a distinct combined fluorescence emission color, respectively; wherein the relative expression of the genes in the two or more cells can be determined by the observed fluorescence emission color of each spot in the array.","The fluorescence excitation conditions are based on the selection of the fluorescence reporters. For example, Cy3 and Cy5 reporters are detected with solid state lasers operating at 532 nm and 632 nm, respectively.","Other methods of detection may be used employing colorimetric and radioactive (for example, P, P, or S) reporters, or other reporters using methods known in the art (Chen et al., 1998, supra; DeRisi et al., 1997, supra; U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,367).","Data Analysis","The fluorescence data obtained from the scanned image may then be analyzed using any of the commercially available image analysis software.

Each PCR reaction employs chromosomal DNA as template for primer pairs that hybridizes to two genes in which has a known location, orientation and distance in the homologs. If a PCR product of the expected size is synthesized, according to the chromosomal map, it can be concluded that the two target genes are placed in the same orientation and at the same distance on both chromosomes.","Multiple PCR reactions as described herein were performed on to investigate the degree of co-linearity to the model organism .

Flanking sequence tags to the region can be as far apart as 10-15 kb when long range PCR methods are employed.

After dissolving the pellet in 100 \u03bcl of TE, the plasmid preparation was sufficiently pure for fluorescent sequencing.","A library with insert sizes in the range from 1 to 2 kb, was constructed by using pSGMU2. A 20 \u03bcg quantity of clausii chromosomal DNA was sonicated using a VibraCell 72408 sonicator (Bioblock Scientific) at minimal amplitude for 10 seconds. The sonication was performed in 300 \u03bcl of Bal31 buffer (600 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 12 mM CaCl, 12 mM MgCl, 1 mM EDTA) in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. After sonication the chromosomal DNA was treated with Bal31 exonuclease (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, Mass.) for 5 minutes at 25\u00b0 C. After water-saturated phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation the DNA was treated by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I under the following conditions: 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl, 0.2 mM each dNTP, at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. After water-saturated phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was ligated with SmaI-digested pSGMU2 and treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The ligation was performed in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP at 10\u00b0 C. for 6 hours. DNA from the ligation mixture was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 1 mM glycogen at \u221220\u00b0 C.","The DNA was then electroporated into JJC128F\u2032 cells using 2.5 kV and 25 mF. The cells were plated on LB agar medium containing 50 \u03bcg\/ml of ampicillin for selection of transformants and 20 \u03bcg\/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (XGAL) and 20 \u03bcg\/ml of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for selection of inserts. The ratio of white to blue colonies in a successful experiment was 4 to 1. A total of 6.554 plasmids were extracted from the white colonies and were sequenced by forward (M13-21) primer using a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Model 377 XL Automatic DNA Sequencer, Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.) with successful sequencing rate of about 90%. The sequencing produced 3,191.401 bp. The total accumulated nonredundant contig length was 2.022.840 bp in 2.232 contigs randomly distributed over the chromosome.","Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a DNA Synthesizer \u201cOligo 1000\u201d (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Primers used for Long Accurate PCR were 20-22-mers, chosen to contain 12 GC-bases.","The overall results are summarized in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of whole-genome random clone"},{"entry":"sequencing of  "},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Successful sequencing reactions","5,899"]},{"entry":[{},"Total characters in gel readings (bp)","3,191,401"]},{"entry":[{},"Average gel read length (bp)","541"]},{"entry":[{},"Total contig length (bp)","2,022,840"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of contigs","2,232"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality, and samples giving improper spacing or ambiguity levels exceeding 2% were discarded or re-run. Vector sequences were removed with the crossmatch program from the Phred\/Phrap package (Ewing and Green, 1998, 8: 186-194). The sequences were assembled with Phrap also from the Phred\/Phrap package.","Annotation of a gene means assignment of a function to a given sequence. The protein encoded genes were found and annotated the following way: The assembled sequences were searched with BLASTX (Pearson and Lipman, 198885: 2444-2448; Pearson, 1990183: 63-98) against a customized database consisting of protein sequences from SWISSPROT, SWISSPROTNEW, TREMBL, TREMBLNEW, REMTREMBL, PDB and GeneSeqP. The matrix used was BL50. The start and stop position of each hit and the score of the hit where temporarily marked in the sequence. All open reading frames starting with ATG, GTG or TTG where temporarily marked with the start and stop position and a score. The score of the ORF was calculated as 0.5 times the length of the ORF for ORF starting with ATG and 0.25 times the length of the ORF for ORFs starting with GTG or TTG. A non overlapping set of regions with maximal score larger than 100 was found from the temporarily marked sequence. Each region represents a gene. The best hit for each gene is shown in Appendix 2. Functional category assignment was done by fastx homology search against clusters of orthologous genes from ncbi. In Appendix 2, the assignment to a particular functional category is represented by a single letter. \u201cC\u201d means energy production and conversion. \u201cD\u201d means cell division and chromosome partitioning. \u201cE\u201d means amino acid transport and metabolism. \u201cF\u201d means nucleotide transport and metabolism. \u201cG\u201d means carbohydrate transport and metabolism. \u201cH\u201d means coenzyme metabolism. \u201cI\u201d means lipid metabolism. \u201cJ\u201d means translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis. \u201cK\u201d means transcription. \u201cL\u201d means DNA replication, recombination and repair. \u201cM\u201d means cell envelope biogenesis, outer membrane. \u201cN\u201d means cell motility and secretion. \u201cO\u201d means posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones. \u201cP\u201d means inorganic ion transport and metabolism. \u201cQ\u201d means secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism. \u201cR\u201d means general function prediction only. \u201cS\u201d means function unknown. \u201cT\u201d means signal transduction mechanisms.","Structural RNA encoding genes were found by homology (blastn) to tRNA and rRNA genes in ","The clausii GST sequences, which encode proteins are designated SEQ ID NOs. 4449-8481. An \u201cN\u201d in a nucleic acid sequence means that the nucleotide is an A, C, G, or T.","Details of the construction of a typical microarrayer can be found on the world wide web site of Professor Patrick Brown of Stanford University. Scanners and computer software for analysis of DNA microarrays are available from several commercial sources such as General Scanning Inc. (Watertown, Mass.), or Axon Instruments (Foster City, Calif.). Individual GST clones were purified as plasmid minipreps using Qiagen Biorobot 9600 (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, Calif.). The plasmid minipreps were precipitated with isopropanol, aliquoted and stored as described on the web site of Professor Patrick Brown of Stanford University.","The amplified GST targets prepared in this manner were spotted individually onto polylysine-coated glass slides using a microarrayer device as described by DeRisi et al. (1997, 278: 680-686). The microarrays were probed with fluorescently labeled cDNA prepared by reverse transcription of polyadenylated mRNA (DeRisi et al., 1997, supra) extracted from cells (Example 2 or Example 4). Conditions for pretreatment of the microarrays, hybridization and washing conditions have been described previously (DeRisi et al., 1997, supra).","To increase the reliability with which changes in expression levels could be discerned, probes prepared from induced or treated cells were labeled with the red fluorescent dye, Cy5 (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, Ill.), and mixed with probes from uninduced, untreated, or \u201creference\u201d cells were labeled with a green fluorescent dye, Cy3 (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, Ill.). The relative ratio of fluorescence intensity measured for the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophors corresponding to each GST target in the arrays was determined using ScanAlyze software. This provides a reliable measure of the relative abundance of the corresponding mRNA in the two cell populations (e.g., treated cells versus reference cells).","The invention described and claimed herein is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments herein disclosed, since these embodiments are intended as illustrations of several aspects of the invention.
