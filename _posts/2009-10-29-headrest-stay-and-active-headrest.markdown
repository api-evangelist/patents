In particular, the present invention relates to a headrest stay and an active headrest that are used for a vehicle.","Conventionally, a headrest stay is known, which is supported by a seat back and to which the body of a headrest is fixed. For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses the technique for embedding the curved parts of a stay bent substantially in an inverted U shape into the pillow-like pad of a headrest.","Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 8-389","In the case of a stay having a pair of members extending in top and bottom directions of a seat back and a member connecting the pair of members in the direction of vehicle width, as in the case of a stay bent in an inverted U-shape, there is a possibility that a member in the direction of vehicle width may restrict movement of an occupant's head. For example, in the event that another vehicle collides with the vehicle from behind and an occupant's head is consequently supported by a headrest, movement of the head in the top and bottom directions of the seat back may be restricted by a member extending in the direction of vehicle width. Accordingly, there has come to be a demand for a headrest stay that enables smoother movement of the head in the top and bottom directions of a seat back.","The object of the present invention is to provide a headrest stay and an active headrest that are able to restrain restriction of movement of a head in the top and bottom directions of a seat back.","A headrest stay according to the present invention includes a pair of first stay-composing parts extending in top and bottom directions of a seat back of a seat provided in a vehicle, while supported by the seat back, the first stay-composing parts being arranged in different positions in a direction of vehicle width; and a second stay-composing part connecting specific parts of the first stay-composing parts in the direction of the vehicle width, the specific parts extending straight in the top and bottom directions of the seat back; wherein the specific parts face a head of an occupant seated on the seat and a space between the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of the vehicle width is less than a width of the head of the seated occupant in the direction of the vehicle width, the second stay-composing part does not have a portion located further forward than foremost portions of the first stay-composing parts, and a portion of the second stay-composing part, which portion is between the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of the vehicle width, is not located further forward than the specific parts, and at least part of the portion is located further rearward than the specific parts and, on a line extending in the top and bottom directions from the front end of each of the specific parts as viewed from the side, includes no member connecting the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of the vehicle width.","In the headrest stay, in the second stay-composing part, it is preferable that the entire portion between the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of the vehicle width is located further rearward than the specific parts.","In the headrest stay, it is preferable to further include a plate-like member connecting the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of the vehicle width and disposed parallel to a plane defined by the one specific part and the other specific part.","An active headrest according to the present invention includes a headrest stay; a cover covering the headrest stay; and a moving mechanism configured to move the headrest stay closer to the seated occupant.","In the active headrest, it is preferable that the moving mechanism is actuated in response to mechanical input and moves the headrest stay at least forward, and an amount that an upper part of the headrest stay in the top and bottom directions is moved forward by the moving mechanism is preferably larger than an amount that a lower part thereof is moved forward by the moving mechanism.","A headrest stay according to the present invention includes a pair of first stay-composing parts extending in the top and bottom directions of a seat back, and a second stay-composing part connecting the specific parts of the corresponding first stay-composing parts in the direction of vehicle width, the specific parts extending straight in the top and bottom directions of the seat back. The specific parts face the head of an occupant seated on a seat. A portion of the second stay-composing part, which portion is between the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of vehicle width, is not located further forward than the specific parts, and at least part of this portion is located further rearward than the specific parts and, on a line extending in the top and bottom directions from the front end of each of the specific parts as viewed from the side, includes no member connecting the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of the vehicle width. This yields the effect that the head of a seated occupant is restrained from being caught by the second stay-composing part and hence restriction of movement of the head in the top and bottom directions of the seat back is eased.","A headrest stay according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. It should also be understood that the compositional elements in the embodiment described below include ones that could easily be anticipated by those skilled in the art and ones that are substantially identical to the compositional elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","1","10","20","10","11","20","20","20","20","21","21","31","31","30","22","21","21"],"i":"a"},"Each first stay-composing part  includes: a fixed part provided lowest in the top and bottom directions of the seat back, a specific part provided highest in the top and bottom directions of the seat back, and a connection part connecting the fixed part and specific part . Each fixed part extends in the top and bottom directions of the seat back and is supported by the seat back . The fixed part has engagement grooves . While the fixed parts are kept inserted in the seat back , engagement projections (not shown) provided on the seat back  side engage with these engagement grooves , thereby positioning the fixed parts ","Each specific part extends straight in the top and bottom directions of the seat back. In the present embodiment, the specific parts on both sides in the direction of the vehicle width are provided parallel to each other. The specific parts , face the head of an occupant seated on the seat . \u201cThe specific parts , face the head of an occupant\u201d means that, for example, it is assumed at a design stage that the specific parts , face the head of a seated occupant. Depending on the body type, posture, or the like, of a seated occupant, there may be a case where the specific parts , and the head of a seated occupant are not parallel with each other. The space W between the one specific part and the other specific part is less than the width of the head of a seated occupant in the direction of vehicle width. The distance between these connection parts , decreases from the fixed parts toward the specific parts and the connection parts , are inclined forward.","The second stay-composing part  includes bent parts  and a straight part . The bent parts  are connected to both corresponding ends of the straight part , and the end of each bent part , which is opposite to the end connected to the straight part , is connected to the specific part of the corresponding first stay-composing part . Each bent part  is inclined rearward toward a higher position in the top and bottom directions of the seat back from the end connected to the corresponding specific part , is then bent in the direction of vehicle width, and is connected to the straight part . As described above, the second stay-composing part  connects the respective specific parts of the first stay-composing parts  in the direction of vehicle width.","In the stay , the specific parts and connection parts of the first stay-composing parts  and the second stay-composing part  are arranged within the case (cover) . The case  is filled with resin foam, and the body  and the stay  are thereby fixed. In the forward and rearward directions, the specific parts face a support part of the case , which supports the head of a seated occupant. Specifically, of the first stay-composing parts , the specific parts are portions located within the case , extending straight in the top and bottom directions of the seat back, and able to support the head of a seated occupant via the support part ","In the stay  according to the present embodiment, the second stay-composing part , which is the upper end of the stay , bends away from the specific parts rearwards. Accordingly, as described below, restriction of movement of the head of a seated occupant is eased. First, a description is given of the problem with a conventional headrest, which is that movement of a seated occupant is restricted.  is a diagram of an example of a headrest that has a conventional stay.","In , a symbol  represents a headrest. A stay  of the headrest  includes: a pair of first stay-composing parts  extending in the top and bottom directions of a seat back and arranged in different positions in vehicle width direction; and a second stay-composing part  connecting in the vehicle width direction a specific parts of the pair of first stay-composing parts , which specific parts extend straight in the top and bottom directions of the seat back. The position of the second stay-composing part  in the forward and rearward directions is the same as the positions of the specific parts . As viewed from the side, the second stay-composing part  overlaps the specific parts (i.e., it is located on the same line as they are).","If forward acceleration is exerted on the vehicle, as in the event where another car collides with the vehicle from behind, the head H of a seated occupant may be moved rearwards and pressed against a body  of the headrest . Additionally, rearward inertia may be exerted on the seat and, moreover, the seated position of the occupant may be shifted downwards, with the result that a seat back  may tilt obliquely downward (rearwards). Consequently, the seated occupant may try to move toward a higher position in the top and bottom directions of the seat back relative to the seat back  and the headrest . The head H of the seated occupant may be moved toward a higher position along the specific parts while pressed against the body  and supported by the specific parts . In this case, the second stay-composing part  is located on the same plane as the pair of specific parts , . Therefore, near the upper end of the stay , indicated by a symbol R, the head H of the seated occupant may be caught by the body . Consequently, the head H may be turned around an axis in the direction of vehicle width, as shown by arrow Y, through the portion of the head H caught by the body , which is the center of rotation. A symbol H indicates the head H before the turn and a symbol H indicates the head H after the turn. Accordingly, because movement of the head H of the seated occupant is restricted in the top and bottom directions of the seat back, the seated occupant may feel discomfort, such as his\/her head H turning, as described above.","In contrast, in the stay  according to the present embodiment, the second stay-composing part  does not have a portion further forward than the foremost portions of the first stay-composing parts . In the second stay-composing part , the portion between one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of vehicle width is not located further forward than the specific parts . In addition, at least part of the second stay-composing part  is located further rearward than the specific parts . Accordingly, as illustrated in  for reference, restriction of movement of the head H of a seated occupant is eased when the head H of the seated occupant is moved in the top and bottom directions of the seat back. If forward acceleration is exerted on the vehicle, the head H of a seated occupant is moved in a higher position in the top and bottom directions of the seat back relative to the headrest -.  illustrates how the head of a seated occupant on a headrest that has the stay of the present embodiment moves. In , a symbol H indicates the head H before movement and a symbol H indicates the head H after movement. In the second stay-composing part , at least part of the portion (the portion including a straight part ) located between the specific parts , in the direction of the vehicle width is located further rearward than the specific parts (i.e., on the side opposite to the seated occupant's side). Accordingly, the head H is restrained from being caught when moved in the top and bottom directions in the seat back while in contact with the body  (case ).","Particularly, in the present embodiment, the straight part  of the second stay-composing part  is connected to the specific parts via the bent parts  tilting in a direction opposite to the seated occupant's side from the corresponding specific parts . Thereby, in the second stay-composing part , the entire portion between the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of the vehicle width is located on the side opposite to the seated occupant's side (i.e., rearwards) with respect to the specific parts . Accordingly, the head H of a seated occupant is effectively restrained from being caught when moved in the top and bottom directions of the seat back. This makes it possible to smoothly move the head H in the upward and rearward directions of the seat back. Since the head H of a seated occupant is restrained from being caught, the head H is prevented from being turned around an axis in the direction of vehicle width, as explained below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 7"],"b":["1","1","1","2","100"]},"As shown in , the degree of change TH in the angle of the head H when the headrest - according to the present embodiment is used is less than that of change TH in the angle of the head H when a conventional headrest  is used. That is, with the headrest - according to the present embodiment, the head H is restrained from being caught when moved in the top and bottom directions of the seat back.","In the present embodiment, in the second stay-composing part , the entire portion between the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of vehicle width is located on the side opposite to the seated occupant's side with respect to the specific parts . However, the present invention is not limited to this. In the second stay-composing part , it is enough for at least part of the portion between the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of vehicle width to be located on the side opposite to the seated occupant's side with respect to the specific parts ; it is preferable that a portion in the intermediate part between the specific parts , in the direction of vehicle width be located on the side opposite to the seated occupant's side with respect to the specific parts ","Additionally, in the present embodiment, the second stay-composing part  connects the respective upper ends of the specific parts , in the top and bottom directions of the seat back. However, the present invention is not limited to this. The second stay-composing part  may connect other portions of the specific parts , , instead of the upper ends.","A second embodiment will be described with reference to .  is a diagram illustrating an example of the movement of the headrest according to the present embodiment. The second embodiment will be described only in respects different from the first embodiment.","A headrest - according to the present embodiment is configured as an active headrest that moves a stay in the direction in which the space between a body and a head H of a seated occupant decreases, for example, in the event where another vehicle collides with the vehicle.","The headrest - includes: a stay  and a body , which are the same as those in the first embodiment, and also an active unit (moving mechanism)  that moves the stay  and the body  closer to the head H of a seated occupant. The active unit  may be a mechanism that is actuated in response to a mechanical input caused by a seated occupant's being pressed against a seat back  as a result of another vehicle's having collided with the vehicle, and consequently moves the stay  and the body . A trigger (actuating mechanism) that mechanically inputs the active unit  is not limited to one that initiates actuation in conjunction with movement of a seated occupant.","For example, a trigger may be one that is able to mechanically input the active unit  in response to impact, pressure, acceleration, or the like, caused by another vehicle's colliding with the vehicle, and that may initiate actuation mechanically or under control. Alternatively, the trigger may be one that mechanically inputs the active unit  in the event collision is predicted based on, for example, a detection result obtained by a means for detecting a vehicle approaching the vehicle conveying the occupant.","When the trigger is not actuated, the body  and the stay  are stopped in a position (refer to a symbol -) that may be apart from the head H of a seated occupant within a movable range. Upon actuation of the trigger, the body  is moved closer to the head H together with the stay  by the active unit  (refer to arrow Y). A symbol - indicates the body  moved toward the head H by the active unit . The direction in which the body  and the stay  are moved at this time is, for example, forward and toward a higher position in the top and bottom directions of the seat back. Thereby, the space between the head H of a seated occupant and the body  and hence the amount of rearward movement of the head H decrease. The direction in which the body  is moved by the active unit  is not limited to this. For example, the direction in which the body  is moved by it may be forward only.","In addition, in the headrest -, the second stay-composing part  is identical in configuration to that of the stay  of the first embodiment. Accordingly, when the head H of a seated occupant is moved in top and bottom directions of the seat back after having contacted the body , the headrest - yields the advantageous effect that restriction of movement of the head H is eased, as in the first embodiment described above. Since the headrest - is configured as an active headrest, the time for which the seated occupant's head H is supported by the body  may be long, as in the event where another vehicle collides with the occupant's vehicle from behind. In this case, the stay  that eases restriction of the movement of head H in the top and bottom directions of the seat back can exhibit the effect more efficiently in combination with the active headrest. In order to ease restriction of movement of the head H in the top and bottom directions of the seat back, it is preferable that the body  does not incorporate any compositional elements of an airbag or the like.","Additionally, the stay , configured as in the first embodiment described above and having a second stay-composing part  at least part of which is located further rearward than the specific parts , is effective particularly when the active unit  moves the stay  at least forwards, and the amount that the upper part of the stay  in the top and bottom directions of the seat back is moved forwards by the active unit  (refer to a symbol U in ) is large, compared to the amount that the lower part of the stay  is moved forwards by the active unit  (refer to a symbol U in ). Where the active unit  moves the stay  in such a manner (e.g., the upper part of the stay  is turned further forwards than the lower part), there is a possibility that the head H moved in top and bottom directions of the seat back may be caught by the second stay-composing part . However, the stay  in which the second stay-composing part  is disposed away from the specific parts eases restriction of movement of the head H in the top and bottom directions of the seat back even when the stay  is moved forward by the active unit .","A third embodiment will be described. In the third embodiment, only respects different from the embodiments described above will be described.","A stay  of a headrest - according to the present embodiment has, in addition to the configuration of the stay  of each embodiment described above, the configuration for easing restriction of movement of the head H of a seated occupant in the top and bottom directions of the seat back.  is a diagram schematically illustrating the configuration of the headrest - according to the present embodiment.","In , a symbol  represents a stay; , first stay-composing parts; , a second stay-composing part; , bent parts; , a straight part; , specific parts; , connection parts; and , fixed parts. As in the stay  in each embodiment described above, the stay  does not have a portion further forward than the foremost portions of the first stay-composing parts . Also, the portion of the second stay-composing part , which portion is between the specific parts , in the direction of vehicle width, is not located further forward than the specific parts , and at least part of this portion is located further rearward than the specific parts . Further, a plate-like member  is provided between the specific parts , ","The plate-like member  is made of metal or resin or the like and connects the one specific part and the other specific part in the direction of vehicle width. The plate-like member  is disposed parallel to a plane defined by the specific parts , and is able to support the head H of a seated occupant. By virtue of the plate-like member , the head H of a seated occupant is supported by the plate-like member  when the head H is moved rearward and pressed against a body . Thereby, when the head H is moved in the top and bottom directions of the seat back relative to the headrest -, the head H can be moved while supported by the plate-like member . Accordingly, rearward movement of the head H is restrained, unlike the case where no plate-like member  is provided and the head H is moved while supported by the specific parts . As a result, the head H is restrained from being caught by the body  (the second stay-composing part ). Additionally, in the present embodiment, the plate-like member  extends up to the second stay-composing part , towards a higher part of the seat back. The upper end of the plate-like member  is connected to the second stay-composing part . Accordingly, restriction of movement of the head H of a seated occupant in the top and bottom directions of the seat back is effectively eased.","Instead of providing the stay  with the plate-like member , or in addition to the provision of the plate-like member , the stay  may be extended to a higher part of the seat back.  is a diagram illustrating the stay  extended to a higher part of the seat back.","As the stay  is extended to a higher part of the seat back, the second stay-composing part  is located in a higher position. This prevents movement of the head H in the top and bottom directions of the seat back from being restricted by the second stay-composing part . For example, the stay  can be composed such that the second stay-composing part  is located highest within the case .","It is to be understood that the embodiments described above may be used in combination with one another.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0048"},"b":["1","1","1","2","1","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0002","num":"0049"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0003","num":"0050"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0004","num":"0051"},"b":["20","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0005","num":"0052"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0006","num":"0053"},"b":"21","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0007","num":"0054"},"b":"21","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0008","num":"0055"},"b":"21","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0009","num":"0056"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0010","num":"0057"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0011","num":"0058"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0012","num":"0059"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0013","num":"0060"},"b":"31"},"H HEAD"]}}}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
