title: High speed braking of submerged propelled sea craft
abstract: Forward underwater movement of a sea craft at a high speed induced by propulsion thereof is decelerated and stopped by projection of drag devices, mounted on a fully submerged underwater sea craft hull, from retracted positions within said sea craft hull or the steering rudders positioned thereon. Each of the drag devices has an elongated drag plate with an end surface cap flush with the outer surface of the hull or the steering rudder in the retracted position of the drag device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to deceleration and stopping of submerged propelled sea craft.","The maneuvering and stopping of submerged sea craft including waterjet propelled and conventional propeller driven submarines heretofore involved diversion of jet outflow from its propulsion unit or reversal of propeller rotation. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to improve travel stoppage of such sea craft without adverse impact on its propulsion unit.","In accordance with the present invention, when propulsion of a fully submerged sea craft at a high speed is terminated, forward movement of the sea craft may then be decelerated and stopped by projection of drag plates from retracted positions within the sea craft hull or the steering rudders on the stern end portion of the hull. In such retracted positions, outer surfaces on the drag plates are flush with the outer surface of the hull or the steering rudders.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates an underwater submerged sea craft  having an axis-symmetric shaped hull  according to one embodiment. The sea craft  is propelled in a forward direction by emergence of propelling water jets  from a conical stern end portion  of the hull  as generally known in the art. The propelling jets  emerge from any number of main water outflow nozzles  such as four. Accordingly to one embodiment, conventional rudders  are mounted on and project from the hull  at locations thereon along a hull centerline , closer to the stern end portion  than a forward bow end portion  onto which seawater flow  impinges during propelled travel of the sea craft .","Pursuant to the embodiment of the present invention as shown in , four (4) high speed flow drag braking devices  are positioned on the bow end portion  of the hull  in angularly spaced relation to each other. Each of the braking devices  as illustrated in ,  and  includes an elongated arcuate drag plate  that is projected from the hull . An end cap  at the radially outer end of the drag plate  is positioned with its outer surface flush with the outer surface of the hull  at the bow end portion  in a retracted position of the braking device  as shown in . Each of the braking devices  is projected from its retracted position to an extended position as shown in  by an actuator  connected thereto inside of a ballast tank chamber  enclosed within the hull .","Projection of the drag plates  from the hull  is effected for emergency deceleration and stopping of the craft  by flow drag during forward travel under high speed conditions. Toward that end an electric power supply  within the sea craft , as diagramed in , is connected to a maneuvering control system  through which the drag plate actuators  are operated in response to input of signals from a craft operator  and a craft speed sensor . Accordingly, pursuant to one embodiment of the present invention the sea craft  under travel propulsion is decelerated and then stopped by the extension of the drag devices  from their retracted positions under selective control after termination of propulsion.","According to other embodiments of the present invention, the braking devices  as hereinbefore described are replaced by braking devices \u2032 that are projected laterally from the rudders  as shown in  or some other type of directional controls. Such braking devices \u2032 extended from the rudders  are plates pivoted to the lateral sides of the rudders , with outer plate surfaces  flush with the rudder sides in their retracted positioned within slots  formed in the rudders . In , yet another embodiment is shown wherein braking devices \u2033 extended laterally from the rudders  are arcuate shaped plates slidably retracted into arcuate slots \u2032 within the rudders .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2A"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1"],"b":["2","2","3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
