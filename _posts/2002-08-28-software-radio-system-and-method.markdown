{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application relates to the following group of applications:\n\n","The foregoing application are all herein incorporated by Reference in their entirety.","The disclosure relates generally to the field of multichannel radio systems. Further, the disclosure relates to modular multichannel radio systems that may be used in military applications. Further still, the disclosure relates to a multichannel software radio system in which switch bus architecture is used for improved security and fault tolerance.","In conventional multichannel radio systems, back plane buses are used to communicate between processors on the black side, that is, the side on which any classified information has been encrypted, and the processors on the red side, that is, processors which are handling information that is classified, but has not yet been encrypted. In conventional systems, the red side processors are coupled to a red back plane bus and the black side processors are coupled to a black back plane bus which means that each processor has access to the next and every other processor on its side. Further, all of the processors on the red side may easily access the cryptography that is used to encrypt the traffic for further processing by the black side. Accordingly, conventional systems do not provide substantial isolation among processors on each side, and further, because of the lack of isolation, conventional systems do not provide desired fault tolerance in that if processing for a single waveform on a specific processor should fail, it may be possible that the processor will cause the failure of all of the processors on that bus to fail. Furthermore, in conventional multichannel radio systems, the lack of isolation between red side processors prevents the processing of information that must remain separate for reasons of security.","Accordingly, there is a need for a software radio architecture which includes black side and red side switching and which provides isolation between processors and between channels.","It would be desirable to provide a system and\/or method that provides one or more of these or other advantageous features. Other features and advantages will be made apparent from the present specification. The teachings disclosed extend to those embodiments which fall within the scope of the appended claims, regardless of whether they accomplish one or more of the above-mentioned needs.","An example of the invention relates to a multichannel communications device. The multichannel communications device includes more than one transceiver and a first switch configured for switching between transceivers. The multichannel communications device also includes more than one cryptographic element and a second switch configured to switch between the cryptographic elements. Further, the multichannel communications device includes a switch policy configured to control communications between the cryptographic elements, including restricting communications between the cryptographic elements.","Another example of the invention relates to a method of sending data using a communications device. The method includes accessing a switch policy. The method also includes selecting a cryptographic element from more than one cryptographic element, based on the switch policy. Further, the method includes encrypting the data, selecting a transceiver, and switching to the selected transceiver.","Yet another example of the invention relates to a modular radio system. The modular radio system includes more than one transceiver. Each transceiver may be in an individual module. The modular radio system also includes a first switch configured for switching between transceivers. The modular radio system further includes more than one cryptographic element and a second switch configured to switch between the cryptographic elements. Further still, the modular radio system includes a switch policy configured to control communications between the cryptographic elements, including restricting communications between the cryptographic elements. The first switch, the cryptographic elements, the second switch, and the switch policy may be incorporated into another individual module.","Alternative exemplary embodiments relate to other features and combination of features as may be generally recited in the claims.","Referring to , an exemplary block diagram representing a multichannel radio system  is depicted. This exemplary embodiment provides four radio channels. Alternative embodiments may support greater or fewer channels. In this exemplary embodiment, transceivers  are depicted, each containing a filter , a receiver\/exciter (R\/E) , a modem , and a black processor . Transceiver  may provide either full or half duplex capabilities. Transceiver  may provide capabilities across the entire spectrum for which multichannel radio system  is designed, or may be special purpose devices providing capabilities for only a portion of the spectrum. Transceiver  may or may not also contain power amplification. Further transceivers  are coupled to power amplifiers (not depicted) and other radio frequency (RF) devices such as antenna switching and cosite mitigation to the left of the transceivers . Transceivers  are also coupled on the right to a Networking\/Information Security (INFOSEC) functional unit (NIU)  consisting of cryptographic devices  and red processors . Red processors  are furthermore coupled to their right to platform interface . Platform interface  may be unique for each platform on which multichannel radio system  is installed.","NIU  supports red applications, INFOSEC functions, and platform interfaces in the exemplary block diagram. NIU  also contains red switch  and black switch . Primary functional components of NIU  include: general purpose processing using core processor , red processing using any of the selected red processors , cryptography in the cryptographic element  using a cryptographic channel  corresponding to the selected processors , key manager , black switching using black switch ., red switching using red switch  and red platform specific interface .","Core processor  hosts a plurality of functions that configure and control the remainder of the multichannel modular radio system . Core processor  provides control to the black common  of NIU . Core processor  provides control to the red processors  via key manager . Core processor  loads application software onto black processors  and, via the bypass function for cryptographic channel , loads application software to red processors . Core processor  requests configuration of red switch  via switch policy . Overall, core processor  controls the flow of radio traffic from platform interface , through red processor  and the corresponding cryptographic channel , to black processor .","Each red processor  is dedicated to a single communications channel. Red processor  performs all red applications associated with its single communication channel as well as other applications permitted by the security policy for the multichannel modular radio system . Having multiple separate red processors  eliminates the need for a high assurance software operating environment to separates applications one from the others based on the security policy for the multichannel modular radio system . Also, multiple separate red processors  permit multiple independent levels of security, one given level on each individual red processor . When in the future a high assurance operating environment becomes available, it may be used on the red processors  to achieve multiple levels of security, with multiple levels on any single red processor .","Cryptographic element  provides independent encryption\/decryption paths for red processors . This provides multiple independent levels of security through cryptographic element .","Each cryptographic channel  interfaces with black switch  in the black common functional area  of NIU . In an exemplary embodiment, the interface may be any high speed serial interface such as TIA\/EIA-644 Low Voltage Differential Signaling. An alternative exemplary embodiment may use a parallel interface. On the red side, each cryptographic channel  connects directly to one red processor . In an alternative exemplary embodiment, each cryptographic channel  could connect to red switch  to provide connectivity around failed cryptographic channel  or red processor  elements or their interfaces. Cryptographic channels  also interface with key manager  for loading of cryptographic keys and algorithms.","Red switch  and black switch  provide connectivity for applications as they are instantiated. The connectivity may be end to end from platform interface  to transceiver , or may connect one red processor  to another red processor  and from one black processor  to another black processor  to provide respectively red and black retransmission, relay or networking functionality between two applications. Red switch  is a high assurance switch certified for multiple independent levels of security, under which any red processor  is only permitted to connect to other red processors  at the same security level and with permission to exchange information. In this exemplary embodiment, the connections to both red switch  and black switch  may be any high speed serial interface. An alternative exemplary embodiment may use a parallel interface.","Red switch  provides data isolation between red processors  as well as platform interface  to allow the connections between any specific interface in platform interface  and any specific red processor , and between any two or more red processors  for purposes of retransmission, relay and networking.","Key to the red switching is switch policy . Red switch  is controlled by switch policy . Switch policy  receives request for red switch  configurations from core processor , receives security policy information from key manager , and then determines whether the request configuration is acceptable within the security policy. If the configuration of red switch  is acceptable within the security policy, then switch policy  directs the configuration of red switch  as requested by core processor . If the configuration of red switch  is acceptable within the security policy, then switch policy  raises a security alarm.","While the detailed drawings, specific examples and particular formulations given describe preferred and exemplary embodiments, they serve the purpose of illustration only.
