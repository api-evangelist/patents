{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a divisional application of Ser. No.10\/840,434, filed May 7, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,171,303, and is related to the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/512,349, filed on Aug. 30, 2006, as a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/840,509, filed May 7, 2004, entitled \u201cDetermining Engine Cylinder Contribution from Indexed Engine Data.","The present disclosure relates generally to engine diagnostics, and more particularly, to evaluating engine cylinder contribution to output power by analyzing the diode ripple signal from an alternator driven by the engine.","One type of engine performance problem found in internal combustion engines is poor cylinder contribution. In a properly functioning engine, each cylinder contributes equally to the total output power for balanced operation. One problem with conventional diagnostic instruments that measure cylinder contribution is that they often require complicated or time-consuming connections to the engine. Further, conventional diagnostic instruments may display results that are difficult to interpret or provide only general information. That is, a technician may invest time setting up a diagnostic instrument yet not receive specific enough information about a problem or performance issue to perform a repair efficiently.","Another conventional technique for measuring engine cylinder contribution derives information about cylinder contributions from the alternator output signal. This technique typically involves a simple electrical connection at the alternator, battery, or electrical accessory receptacle (e.g., a cigarette lighter receptacle). In a typical engine system, a crank pulley on the engine drives an associated alternator pulley using a belt. The alternator pulley is coupled to the alternator rotor, which rotates to generate electrical energy. A typical alternator internally generates a multiphase (e.g., 3 phase) alternating current (AC) signal. This multiphase signal is rectified by a number of diodes, such that the alternator outputs a mostly direct current (DC) signal. The alternator output signal also includes, however, a small AC component known as the ripple voltage or diode ripple signal.","Engine speed varies slightly as each cylinder fires. More specifically, the engine accelerates immediately after a cylinder firing and then decelerates until another cylinder firing occurs. Cylinder contribution can be assessed therefore by analyzing the instantaneous variations in engine speed. The diode ripple signal is proportional to the instantaneous speed of the engine because the alternator is coupled to the engine's crankshaft. That is, variations in the engine speed modulate the diode ripple signal in a mathematically meaningful manner.","In some prior approaches, the diode ripple signal is demodulated using a frequency modulation (FM) receiver or analog phase locked loop. One problem with these approaches, however, is the accuracy or precision of the resulting demodulated signal. The diode ripple signal is typically corrupted by electrical noise or other signals that emanate from various sources. For example, the alternator itself may produce undesirable transients and amplitude modulations in the diode ripple signal. These noise signals can make it difficult to demodulate the diode ripple signal accurately or precisely. Given that an engine performance problem is likely attributable to the malfunction of a single engine cylinder, a technician does not want to receive inaccurate information and, therefore, consume diagnostic or repair time on a properly functioning cylinder.","What is needed is a system and method for demodulating the diode ripple signal that is robust in the presence of amplitude variations and impulse impairments. What is further needed is a system and method that filters the alternator output signal to reduce interference.","In one aspect, a signal processing system generates an engine signature from indexed engine data. The engine signature represents the contribution to output power provided by the firing of each cylinder. The engine signature may be displayed in various ways. For example, the engine signature may be displayed as a waveform, as numerical data, or as a comparative percentage of contribution for each cylinder. The signal processing system includes a buffering unit, an engine data repair unit, a synchronization unit, a signature filter, and an integrator. The buffering unit receives the indexed engine data from the front end or from a storage device. The engine data repair unit reconstructs discontinuity errors in the engine data and provides the engine data to the synchronization unit, which filters and resamples the engine data. The signature filter and the integrator further filter the engine cycle data for display.","In another aspect, a method for generating an engine signature from indexed engine data includes receiving the indexed engine data, generating reconstructed engine data, producing an engine cycles signal, and filtering the engine cycles signal to produce the engine signature. The method further includes receiving a data tag in a tag collection unit and providing an external trigger tag to a synchronization unit and an error tag to an engine data repair unit.","In a further aspect, a method for processing indexed engine data includes calculating a number of indexed engine samples per engine cycle and constructing an engine cycles signal using the number of indexed engine sample per engine cycle. An internally generated phase control bias signal or an external trigger signal be used to control the starting position of the engine cycles signal.","In another aspect, a method for repairing engine data includes receiving indexed engine data and at least one error tag and creating an interpolation of the indexed engine data based on the at least one error tag. The interpolation uses the at least one error tag to connect a last good data point with a next good data point.","Additional aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description, wherein only exemplary embodiments are shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present disclosure.

For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote data processing system, such as a server. The remote data processing system can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a communications link. The communications interface  can receive the data from the communications link and place the data on the connection network . The connection network  can then carry the data to the processor  for execution.","The communications interface  provides bidirectional data communication coupling for the computing device .

The transformer  amplifies the resulting signal. In the illustrated embodiment, the transformer  is an audio band transformer with a gain of about 10. An audio band transformer is suitable for this embodiment because of its low cost and passband frequency range. Of course, other types of signal amplifiers and filter circuits (such as operational amplifier-based active circuits) may be used. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, an active filter\/amplifier circuit may have improved linearity characteristics.","An amplified diode signal is desirable in order to provide a sufficient dynamic range in the AC small signal levels for proper processing. The range of the AC small signal varies from about 10 mV peak-to-peak to about 6 V peak-to-peak. The low pass filter  is employed to complete the bandpass filter. The bandpass frequency characteristic accepts the diode ripple signal that is expected from various common alternator systems. Typically, the first cutoff frequency is from about 155 Hz to 215 Hz and the second cutoff frequency is from about 27.5 KHz to 37.5 KHz. Of course, the filter\/amplifier circuit may be modified or adjusted to work with rare or uncommon alternator systems.","The DC coupler  provides a DC signal path from the input to the output of the filter\/amplifier circuit , although a DC signal path is not necessary for proper operation. In the illustrated embodiment, the DC coupler  is also configured to attenuate the alternator DC output signal to about 90 percent. The adder  then adds the attenuated alternator DC output signal to the amplified diode ripple signal to generate the filtered ripple signal .","The filter\/amplifier circuit  is advantageously configured to apply an AC load on the input signal  (e.g., battery) in the passband. However, as one skilled in the art will appreciate, the alternator may need additional DC loading in order to generate a sufficient alternator output signal. Typically, a sufficient alternator output signal is one that includes nominal current for charging the battery or operating the electrical system of the vehicle. More specifically, without some DC loading the alternator may not be providing an output current that includes a diode ripple signal for which the signal analyzer  can process. A simple way of obtaining a sufficient DC loading can be activating the vehicle's headlights during the time period for which the signal analyzer  or the computing device  is acquiring data. Of course, other types of electrical loads can be directly or indirectly applied to the system (e.g., a carbon pile coupled to the battery).

However, the diode ripple data is a real signal, so the imaginary component is extracted by band-pass filter . A complex signal is needed to determine the phase of a signal, and from these complex parts, the phase can be obtained. A complex signal has real and imaginary parts, where the phase can be expressed as shown in Equation 6.\n\nphase=arc tan(imaginary part\/real part)\u2003\u2003(6)\n","If the DSP  cannot acquire the diode tone frequency sufficiently from the input signal , the signal analyzer  may display a notification to the service technician to select an alternative source for the input signal  or to check the alternator belt for proper tension. For example, in some vehicles, the power signal being applied to the accessory receptacle may include additional filtering that may complicate diode ripple signal recovery. In this case, it may be more efficient for the service technician to provide the alternator output signal  directly from the alternator (or across the negative battery terminal and the alternator case ground) rather than performing more extensive analysis on an equivalent of the alternator output signal .","If there are phase discontinuities in the diode ripple tone, the phase differentiator  produces large impulses.  shows an example of an impulse in the phase demodulated signal. A slope rate limiter  can be used to find these large impulses in the demodulated signal. Once these impulses are found, their location is error tagged and sent to the resampler .

In , phantom or dotted lines are used to illustrate the signal before the application of slope rate limiting.","The embodiment illustrated in  includes a sample and hold reconstruction  approach. The threshold detection  compares the slope metric  to a threshold. If the threshold is reached, then an error signal is sent to the error spreading and delay block . This error remains set until the slope metric falls below the threshold. The spreading routine is used to widen this error to guarantee the error signal being a significant value after the error tag  is down-sampled by the filtered diode ripple indexing tone . When the threshold detection  is set, the slope rate limited decoded engine data is set equal to the substitution value.

However, it is advantageous to express this data independent of the engine RPM and consequently diode ripple tone frequency. In the illustrated embodiment, an indexer  uses the diode ripple tone frequency as an index for sampling the angle demodulated signal. This indexing uses the real part of the diode tone  as the sampling frequency. The real part of the diode tone  is differentiated twice , . This process provides for consecutive zero crossings that guarantee no missing engine data sample points. Of course, the dual differentiation may be viewed as a filter. The zero crossing detector  senses the positive or negative zero crossing of the diode ripple tone and provides this information to the indexer  as the sampling signal. The indexer  effectively down samples the data by the ratio of 25 KHz\/diode tone frequency to yield a signal with a time base that is independent of engine RPM and diode ripple tone frequency. After indexing, the data provided to a storage unit . The indexed data can be referred to as raw indexed engine data . The resampler  also provides other data related to the raw indexed engine data.

Some vehicles are equipped with non-standard alternators which produce over  zero crossings per engine cycle (some alternators produce as many as 1000 zero crossings per engine cycle).

The positive zero crossing detector  determines when the real time domain signal  has crossed zero in the positive direction. A signal is sent to period sample counter . This counter starts counting at the sampling rate. When the zero crossing detector senses another zero crossing, the value in the period sample counter is then stored in store sample count . The period sample counter then is reset and the process starts over. The store sample count block  has now measured the period of the diode ripple tone. This period varies with the phase modulation of the diode ripple tone. Thus the diode ripple tone is decoded as a variation of the diode tone period. Because the zero crossings are used as the strobe to store the diode tone period, the engine data is effectively indexed by the diode tone frequency. The output is the raw indexed engine data .","3.

The engine cycle parameter calculator  computes the RPM per engine cycle as the mean value of the RPM of engine cycles signal . Specifically, each point of engine cycles signal  is a value representing the frequency of the diode ripple. The mean over an engine cycle is taken and divided by the number of indexed samples per engine cycle . This value is multiplied by 60 seconds\/minute and 2 revolutions per engine cycle to yield the RPM per engine cycle.","The display integrator  operates by filtering each individual display pixel column with the corresponding value from previous engine cycles.

Furthermore, an additional signal can be provided to the signal analyzer  for use in determining the number of engine cylinders. For example, a voltage clamp placed on a cylinder spark plug wire can be used to provide a periodic input signal that corresponds with an engine cycle. In an embodiment, the inductive pickup  is used to determine the number of indexed samples per engine cycle, which consequently displays the correct number of cylinders.","The number of samples per period of the raw indexed engine data that are determined  per engine cycle are forwarded to the resampler .

Resampler ","The number of raw indexed engine data samples per engine cycle (which may be determined by the cylinder firing frequency) may have numerous values. Typically these values range from 120 samples to 430 samples per engine cycle depending on physical parameters, such as the alternator pulley ratio. Additionally, some alternator systems may have 430 to 800 samples per engine cycle. In these cases, the front end  operates in the one-half rate mode, as described above and with reference to indexing block . Therefore the processing load of converting the raw indexed engine data to a fixed number of engine signature data points, i.e. 500, may vary.","As described above, it is possible to have different periods for different engine signatures, depending on the number of cylinders and the vehicle's charging system construction. As an example, if an engine has an engine signature period of 150 points, the resampler  may output 500 points. For this example, the resampling ratio is 150 to 500. This implies that 500 points are interpolated from 150 points. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the resampler  may or may not include the original data points in the output. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the resampler  uses a linear weighted interpolation to construct the extra data points.","An interpolation example for a few data points is provided below for a resampling ratio of 150\/500 or 0.3. An output counter, m, is incremented by 1 and an input counter, n, is incremented by the ratio, in this case 0.3.

At this point, the synchronization sub-system presents a complete engine cycle having 500 display points.","The normal engine signature shows a small amount of change in the engine speed as each of the cylinders fire.  shows an example engine signature for a 5 cylinder engine. In this case, each cylinder of the engine is contributing approximately equally to the total power output. Specifically, if the peak-to-peak amplitude of the signal is the same for all cylinders, then all cylinders are contributing equally to the total power output.","On the other hand, the poorly contributing cylinder engine signature indicates a contribution problem with one of the cylinders. When a cylinder fails to contribute equally, the engine speed responds to this lack of a single power stroke and slows accordingly. Specifically, if a particular cylinder is contributing less than the average of the other cylinders, the power stroke fails to generate the engine speed needed to maintain a steady state peak-to-peak amplitude.","Having described embodiments of determining engine cylinder contribution from indexed engine data (which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting), it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings.
