Field of Invention","This invention relates generally to systems and methods for improving reading proficiency using computer analysis aids.","2. Description of Related Art","In conventional systems for reading evaluation, students' reading abilities are tested and the students are grouped according to determined reading fluency ability and instructor availability. Milestones or achievements standards are established for students based on age, grade or other criteria. Re-testing of students then occurs at regular intervals and the results compared to milestones for similarly classified groups of students. Remedial reading instruction, such as individual instruction, may then be provided for students who fail to achieve the milestones or achievement standards for similarly classified students. However, these types of instruction do not facilitate fluid reading of multiple sentences for meaning.","It is well known that a relationship exists between an individual's ability to process the speech sounds of a language and the normal acquisition or improvement of reading skills. Fluent readers recognize the relationship between the various sentences in a text. In reading aloud, they demonstrate their awareness by assigning the correct pitch level and stress to the words in each sentence. The information that is most salient in the sentence, because such information is \u201cnew\u201d or \u201ccontrastive,\u201d will receive distinctive types of stress. A sentence that elaborates on information in a previous sentence could, for example, be read at a lower pitch level.","The prior art systems and methods for improving a reader's fluency are limited to systems and methods that involve a human instructor or those systems employing rudimentary, computer-based instructional features, such as highlighting the text to be read. These computer-based systems have limited or no graphical and\/or auditory instruction and\/or user response capabilities.","The prior art systems and methods for improving a reader's reading fluency level are limited to systems and methods that involve a human instructor or those systems employing rudimentary, computer-based instructional features, such as highlighting the text to be read.

The alterable memory, whether volatile or non-volatile, can be implemented using any one or more of static or dynamic RAM, a floppy disk and disk drive, a writable or re-rewriteable optical disk and disk drive, a hard drive, flash memory or the like. Similarly, the non-alterable or fixed memory can be implemented using any one or more of ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, an optical ROM disk, such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disk, and disk drive or the like.","In various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency improvement system  includes the discourse structure text analysis model  which the reading fluency improvement system  uses to analyze, based on a theory of discourse analysis, a text provided to the user. Discourse structure identifies candidate sentences available as \u201chooks\u201d to link a new utterance into an unfolding text or interaction. The discourse structure text analysis model  may also be used to evaluate one or more spoken or verbal responses provided by the user. Further, the discourse structure text analysis model  may be used to store at least one text that has been previously evaluated based on one or more discourse analysis theories.","In various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency improvement system  includes the information structure text analysis model  which the reading fluency improvement system  uses to evaluate the information structure of a text provided to the user. Information structure is used to determine which elements in a sentence contain important \u201cnew\u201d information. The information structure text analysis model  may also be used to evaluate the information structure of one or more spoken responses or utterances provided by the user, based on a theory of information structure analysis.","It should be appreciated that, to simplify the explanation of the reading fluency improvement system , in the exemplary embodiment shown in , the discourse structure text analysis model  and the information structure text analysis model  are shown as separate text analysis models. When implementing the systems and methods according to this invention, the discourse structure text analysis model  and the information structure text analysis model  may be joined into a combined discourse structure\/information structure text analysis model, may be developed as separate text analysis models, may be integrated into a higher level model of the reading fluency proficiency improvement system , or may be developed as a combination of any of these structures. The specific form that the discourse structure text analysis model  and the information structure text analysis model  take in any given implementation is a design choice and is not limited by this disclosure.","In various exemplary embodiments, from a text analysis perspective, integrating the information structure analysis and the sentence discourse structure analysis can be advantageous by reducing the discourse level ambiguity. In this case, the information structure identifies those sites within the sentence are most likely to link back to previous text. As a result, the number and\/or type of candidate attachment points of a new utterance may be greatly reduced.","In various exemplary embodiments, the user-personalized response storage model  is used to evaluate and\/or store user-personalized reading fluency assessment information, such as, for example, a tuned version of the text displayed, and\/or audio provided, to the user based on user-identifying information, user personalization information, user-personalized reading fluency proficiency level and\/or learning gradient, or the like. In addition, the user-personalized response storage model  may be used to store user-specific speech prosodics or intonation measures as previously identified and\/or determined for that particular user.","In various exemplary embodiments, the fluent-reader speech prosodics and intonation measures model  is used to store various linguistic measures and\/or speech measures of a group of readers previously identified and\/or determined to be fluent readers.

In operation, voice signals from a user's spoken responses or utterances are converted to output signals by the one or more audio input devices . The output signals are then digitized and are analyzed by the automatic speech processing and\/or analysis system .","In various exemplary embodiments, the automatic speech processing and\/or analysis  is used to record and\/or analyze a user's speech utterances to determine the fundamental frequency, f(), of the user's speech. The fundamental frequency f() is typically the strongest indicator to the listener how to interpret a speaker's intonation and stress. In various exemplary embodiments, the automatic speech processing and\/or analysis  is also used to determine the prosody of the speech utterances provided by the user; long or filled pauses, hesitations and restarts may also be tracked","In various exemplary embodiments, the automatic speech processing and\/or analysis  may include any known or later developed speech processing and analysis system. In various exemplary embodiments, the automatic speech processing and\/or analysis  includes the WAVES\u00ae speech processing system developed by Entropic Corp.; the PRAAT speech processing system developed by the Institute of Phonetic Sciences, University of Amsterdam; the EMU Speech Database System of the Speech Hearing and Language Research Centre, Macquarie University; SFS from University Collage London; and TRANSCRIBER from the Direction Des Centres d'Expertise et d'Essais, French Ministry of Defense.","In various exemplary embodiments, the discourse analysis circuit or routine  is activated by the controller  to evaluate, using one or more theories of discourse analysis, a text and\/or one or more spoken or verbal responses provided by the user. In various exemplary embodiments, the discourse analysis circuit or routine  evaluates a text and\/or one or more spoken or verbal responses provided by the user using a theory of discourse analysis such as the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM) discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/609,325, \u201cSystem and Method for Teaching Writing Using Microanalysis of Text\u201d. In various other exemplary embodiments, the Discourse Structures Theory, the Linguistic Discourse Model, the Rhetorical Structure Theory, the Systemic Functional Grammar and\/or the Tagmemics technique may be used by the discourse analysis circuit or routine  to evaluate the text and\/or the one or more spoken or verbal responses.","In various exemplary embodiments, the information structure analysis circuit or routine  is activated by the controller  to evaluate, using one or more theories of information structure analysis, a text and\/or one or more spoken or verbal responses provided by the user. As discussed in greater detail below, from a text analysis perspective, integrating the information structure analysis and the sentence discourse structure analysis advantageously reduces the discourse level ambiguity.","In various exemplary embodiments, under the Linguistic Discourse Model, the representation of a discourse is constructed incrementally using information in the surface structure of incoming utterances together with discourse construction rules and inference over the meaning of the utterances to recursively construct an open-right tree of discourse constituent units (DCUs), as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09\/609,325, 09\/742,449, 09\/689,779, 09\/883,345, 09\/630,371, and 09\/987,420, each incorporated herein by reference in the entirety. This discourse constituent unit tree indicates which units are accessible for continuation and anaphora resolution.","All nodes on the Linguistic Discourse Model tree are first class objects containing structural and semantic information. Terminal nodes correspond to the strings of the discourse. Non-terminals are constructed nodes labeled with a discourse relation. Non-terminal nodes include, but are not limited to coordination (C-) nodes, subordination (S-) nodes, and binary nodes.","Information structure (IS) is represented at terminal and non-terminal nodes. A coordination-node inherits the generalization of the themes of its constituent nodes and the rhemes of the constituent nodes. An subordination-node directly inherits the information structure of its subordinating daughter.","In various exemplary embodiments, the systems and methods according to this invention consider the attachment to be (1) a coordination-node if the theme of the main clause of the new sentence matches thematic information available at the attachment point, or (2) an subordination-node if the theme of the main clause of the new sentence matches rhematic information available at the attachment point. It should be appreciated that binary nodes, which are used to represent the structure of discourse genres as well as conversational adjacency structures and logical relations, are not considered in this exemplary embodiment because the binary nodes follow more ad-hoc, though well-defined, rules. However, it should be appreciated that binary nodes are important nodes and may be included in any embodiment practiced according to the systems and methods of this invention.","In analyzing a discourse, each incoming sentence is assigned its place in the emerging discourse tree using discourse syntax. In current approaches, lexical information, syntactic and semantic structure, tense and aspect, and world knowledge are used to infer the attachment point and relation. However, after exploiting these resources, attachment ambiguities often still remain. Given that normal language users seldom experience discourse attachment ambiguities, additional sources of information must be used in attachment decisions. The information structure of both the incoming sentence and accessible discourse constituent units provides information critical for disambiguation. The problem of identifying the target discourse constituent unit that provides the context for information structure assignment for an incoming sentence is analogous to anaphora resolution. That is, the target unit must be along the right edge of the tree and therefore accessible.","From a discourse perspective, the information structure of an incoming sentence divides the incoming sentence into a theme, which typically is linked back to the preceding discourse, and a rheme, which may not be linked back to the preceding discourse. Establishing a link between the theme of the main clause of a new sentence and information available at an accessible node in the tree determines the sentence's attachment point. The type of attachment, such as, for example, coordination, subordination, or binary, reflects the theme's relation to the information structure of the discourse constituent unit represented at the attachment node.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"As described below and shown in the exemplary sentence embodiments of , themes are marked with a \u201c\u03b8\u201d while rhemes are unmarked.

For Sentence , the appropriate context for information structure assignment is provided by Sentence , with a theme-theme link resulting in a coordination. The rheme of Sentence  intentionally introduces a set of types of noodles picked up as the theme alternative set for Sentence ,  and . The theme focus for each of these sentences (udon, soas, ramen) is presupposed to belong to this set. These sentences are therefore coordinated to each other and subordinated to Sentence .","Processing Sentence  demonstrates that both discourse structure and information structure may operate autonomously. The information structure of Sentence 8 is determined primarily by the conjunction but which acts with the possibility modal in its first conjunct, which provides an accessible set of possible worlds as the rheme alternative set, to construct a theme-rheme pair. At the same time, the discourse attachment of Sentence  fulfills anaphora resolution requirements, rather than information structure.","For Sentence , Sentence  provides the appropriate context for the information structure assignment. The theme-theme link results in a coordination that pops the state of the discourse several levels.","It should be appreciated that, although the assignment of information structure to a sentence depends on the discourse structure, and the construction of the discourse structure may depend on the information structure of the units involved, the dependency between information structure and discourse structure is complementary, rather than circular. For the speaker, the discourse structure provides a set of possible contexts for continuation, while information structure assignment is independent of discourse structure. For the listener, the information structure of a sentence, together with the discourse structure, instructs the listener how rhematic information should be used to update the meaning representation of the discourse. Thus, the relationship between discourse structure and information structure reflects the different but closely related tasks of speaker and listener in a communicative situation.","In various exemplary embodiments, the speech prosodics analysis circuit or routine  is activated by the controller  to determine one or more speech prosody metrics or measures of the one or more spoken or verbal utterances provided by the user. In various exemplary embodiments, the speech prosodics analysis circuit or routine  determines one or more speech prosody metrics or measures, such as, for example, speech rhythm, speech stress, and speech intonation. The speech prosodics analysis circuit or routine  evaluates the user's one or more spoken or verbal utterances using the automatic speech processing and\/or analysis system .","In various exemplary embodiments, the speech intonation measures analysis circuit or routine  is activated by the controller  to determine one or more speech intonation metrics or measures of the one or more spoken or verbal utterances provided by the user. In various exemplary embodiments, the speech intonation measures analysis circuit or routine  determines one or more speech intonation metrics or measures, such as, for example, pitch level, pitch range, speech rate, and speech amplitude. The speech intonation measures analysis circuit or routine  evaluates the user's one or more spoken or verbal utterances previously processed by the automatic speech processing and\/or analysis system .","In various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency proficiency assessment circuit or routine  is activated by the controller  to determine a user's reading fluency level based on the one or more spoken responses provided by the user during one or more reading aloud sessions of a text that has been evaluated for discourse structure and information structure of sentences. In various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency proficiency assessment circuit or routine  determines the user's reading fluency level by analyzing one or more user speech prosodic measures obtained from the one or more spoken responses and\/or one or more user speech intonation measures obtained from the one or more spoken responses, and\/or by comparing the determined one or more user speech prosodic measures to one or more fluent readers speech prosodic measures and\/or the determined one or more user speech intonation measures to one or more fluent readers speech intonation measures.","In various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency proficiency improvement circuit or routine  is activated by the controller  to provide to the user one or more reading fluency improvement aids based on the determined user's reading fluency level. In various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency proficiency improvement circuit or routine  provides to the user one or more reading fluency improvement aids by comparing the determined user's reading fluency level to one or more fluent-reader fluency levels. One or more user-specific reading fluency deficiencies are then determined. One or more reading fluency improvement aids are provided to the user to enable the user to recognize various discourse structure and\/or information structure relations of sentences and\/or phrases.","In various exemplary embodiments, one or more reading fluency improvement aids are provided to the user based on one or more of: determined user-specific reading fluency deficiencies, user-personalized information responses and user class-specific reading fluency deficiencies as determined by the reading fluency improvement system.","In various exemplary embodiments, a user employing a network-enabled computing device, such as, for example, computer , initiates a computer-assisted reading fluency improvement session with the dynamic reading fluency improvement system  over the communications link . In various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency improvement session is initiated by requesting a login web page served by the dynamic reading fluency improvement system  and associated with a uniform resource locator or URL, or by using any other identified login method or technique. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in various other embodiments according to this invention, the dynamic reading fluency improvement system  may be located within a dedicated server, within a content server which also provides instructional content, on a stand-alone user device, or at any other location accessible by communications links . In various other embodiments according to this invention, any one or more of the dynamic reading fluency improvement system  may be located within a user access device such as dynamic reading fluency improvement enabled personal digital assistants  and\/or  without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention.","Once the user begins the session, the dynamic reading fluency improvement system  forwards the requested login web page to network-enabled computer  over the communication link . User identifying information is entered and returned to the dynamic reading fluency improvement system . Based on user identifying information, previously stored reading fluency level personalization, reading fluency learning gradient and user personalization information is retrieved for each user. Sentence level or phrase level dynamic reading fluency proficiency assessment is initiated based on personalization information and\/or prior user session information.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, word level reading fluency proficiency improvement and\/or instruction is used to familiarize the user with word concepts using comprehension aids such as graphic icons, animation clips, video and\/or sound clips or any other information useful in conveying the concept to the user. The words and associated comprehension aids are displayed with a layout complexity based on the user's dynamically determined performance and\/or current word recognition level. Display words are dynamically selected from a list of previously categorized words based on the current word recognition level, learning gradient and\/or personalization information for the identified user.","Sentence level instruction familiarizes the user with fluid reading. In particular, the dynamic reading fluency improvement system  provides an integrated and supportive platform that helps users transition from single sentence parsing of texts to integrated fluid reading. In fluid reading, the user absorbs new information by exploiting the user's existing understanding of the sentence. In sentence level instruction, a text is retrieved and analyzed further using a theory of discourse analysis such as the Linguistic Discourse Model discussed in \u201cSystem and Method for Teaching Writing Using Microanalysis of Text\u201d. In various other exemplary embodiments, the Discourse Structures Theory, the Linguistic Discourse Model, the Rhetorical Structure Theory, the Systemic Functional Grammar and\/or the Tagmemics technique may be used in various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a tunable text summary may be generated. For example, the tunable text summary may be generated using any of the systems and methods discussed in \u201cSystems and Methods for Generating Text Summaries\u201d and \u201cSystems and Methods for Generating Analytic Summaries\u201d. Alternatively, any other known or later-developed system or method for generating a grammatical tunable text summary may be used in various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.","Based on the performance and personalization information of the user of network-connected computer , a personalized, tuned version of the text and\/or sentence is displayed to the user. If the user indicates that assistance in reading the sentence is required, the more salient information in the sentence is displayed with a different display attribute. For example, the more salient information may be differentiated using highlighting, bolding, alternate color or output using an alternate voice for speech output or using any other known or later-developed method of differentiating the salient information. The differentiated salient information prompts the user to focus on the familiar, core knowledge in the sentence while integrating the unfamiliar concepts in portions of the sentence. In this way, the user is trained to integrate new information by exploiting existing knowledge of semantic and grammatical constraints. It should be appreciated that a user's understanding of concepts is dynamically monitored by the systems and methods for dynamic personalized reading instruction according to this invention. Thus, in various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the user's core knowledge may be deduced from previous personalized reading instruction sessions for the user.","Based on the user's current reading level and learning gradient, salient information is selected for display. For example, the rank of information displayed from a tunable text summary is dynamically adjusted to present more or less difficult sentences to a user. Personalization information is also used to personalize the selected instructional text to heighten user interest and\/or to present the selected instructional text using a language specific layout. For example, personalization information specifying a language of instruction is used to specify the vertical alignment of the selected instructional text. A user learning to read using a Japanese or Chinese language text is determined and, based on the determined reading level, an appropriate text layout is determined. More complex text layouts, including horizontal alignments and the like, may be introduced as the user progresses to more advanced reading levels.","Users of network-connected personal digital assistants  and  may similarly initiate reading fluency proficiency improvement sessions with the dynamic reading fluency proficiency improvement system . Additionally, as discussed above, it will be apparent that the sentence level and\/or combined sentence and phrase level dynamic reading fluency proficiency improvement system  may be a single device and may be operated in a stand-alone configuration without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","110"]},"In various exemplary embodiments, the text retrieved has previously been analyzed using a theory of discourse analysis.

In various exemplary embodiments, the determined speech prosodies may include one or more speech prosody metrics or measures, such as, for example, speech rhythm, speech stress, and speech intonation. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, one or more user speech intonation measures are determined from the one or more verbal responses provided by the user by evaluating the user's one or more spoken or verbal utterances. In various exemplary embodiments, the determined intonation metrics or measures may include, for example, pitch level, pitch range, speech rate, and\/or speech amplitude. Then, in step S, the determined one or more user speech prosodic metrics or measures are compared to one or more predetermined fluent-reader speech prosodics measures. Such comparison could take place by aligning the user's speech with the stored fluent speech, and by calculating the difference between the values of user and predetermined measures, using standard ways of calculating the distance between multiple dimensional feature vectors, such as, for example, the cosine distance.","Next, in step , the one or more determined user speech intonation metrics or measures are compared to one or more predetermined fluent-reader speech intonation measures. In an exemplary embodiment, the comparison is performed by calculating the distance between the values for the user's and the predetermined measures, as described above for step S. Operation then continues to step S, where the operation of the method returns to step S.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the reading level, learning gradient and personalization information for the user may be entered prior to providing a text to the user. Reading level information indicates the user's current position within a reading instruction curriculum. In various embodiments according to this invention, the reading level may be input directly by the user, determined dynamically through testing sequences, retrieved from a log of the user's previous personalized reading instruction sessions or by using any other known or later developed method for determining a reading level.","Personalization information for the user may also be entered at the beginning of the session. However, in various other exemplary embodiments, the personalization may be retrieved from a previous personalized reading instruction session, retrieved from a centralized registrar of records or determined using any other known or later developed method of determining pedagogically useful information. For example, the personalization information may include family name and family relationship information useful in personalizing the analyzed text for the user.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a tunable text summary may be generated based on the determined reading level of the user. A tunable text summary may be generated using the \u201cSystems and Methods for Generating Text Summaries\u201d, \u201cSystems and Methods for Generating Analytic Text Summaries\u201d or any other summary generator capable of generating grammatical tunable text summaries. The tunable text summary is used to adjust the display text based on the user's determined reading level. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a shorter and\/or simpler text is displayed based on the determined reading level of the user. For example, a shorter and\/or simpler sentence may be displayed which simplifies the sentence while preserving the salient information and grammaticality of the sentence. The shorter simpler grammatical sentences facilitate reading comprehension by low reading level users. It will be apparent that the use of the tunable text summary to generate simpler texts is merely illustrative and that any method of generating grammatically simpler text may be used in the practice of this invention.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, various types of comprehension aids, such as visual aids, may be provided to the user during reading aloud reading fluency proficiency assessment and\/or improvement session. For example, a less complicated text layout that facilitates concept comprehension and which provides layout space for the comprehension aid may be selected for low reading level users. In various exemplary embodiments, a less complicated text layout is accomplished by positioning the text and the associated comprehension aid in close proximity.","In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the user's personalization information may also be used to adjust the comprehension aids, the text layout and\/or to adjust the text based on the user's language, culture, age or any other known or later developed personalization information. For example, if the language of instruction is Chinese, the text layout may be adjusted to properly orient and display the text based on the vertical alignment the user is likely to encounter in introductory Chinese texts. Alternatively, the selection of the comprehension aids such as graphic icons, sounds and or movie clips and the like may be based on other personalization information such as age and\/or cultural information. In this way, age and culturally appropriate comprehension aid graphic icons are selected for display. Although age, language and cultural information are discussed with respect to personalization information, it will be apparent that any personalization information may be used in the practice of this invention.","As shown in , in various exemplary embodiments, the reading fluency improvement system  is implemented on a programmed general purpose computer. However, the reading fluency improvement system  can also be implemented on a special purpose computer, a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit elements, an ASIC or other integrated circuit, a digital signal processor, a hardwired electronic or logic circuit such as a discrete element circuit, a programmable logic device such as a PLD, PLA, FPGA or PAL, or the like. In general, any device, capable of implementing a finite state machine that is in turn capable of implementing the flowcharts shown in , can be used to implement the reading fluency improvement system .","Moreover, the reading fluency improvement system  can be implemented as software executing on a programmed general purpose computer, a special purpose computer, a microprocessor or the like. In this case, the reading fluency improvement system  can be implemented as a resource residing on a server, or the like. The reading fluency improvement system  can also be implemented by physically incorporating it into a software and\/or hardware system, such as the hardware and software systems of a general purpose computer or of a special purpose computer.","Although the invention has been described in detail, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods of this invention described in detail below, with reference to the attached drawing figures, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
