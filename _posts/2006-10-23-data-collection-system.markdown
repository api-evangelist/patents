{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from Japanese patent applications 2005-306811, filed on Oct. 21, 2005, 2005-306812, filed Oct. 21, 2005 and 2006-152359, filed May 31, 2006. The entire content of the aforementioned applications are incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to a data collection system for collecting data concerning the operation of equipment, such as production machines that constitute a production line.","A first related-art data collection system is one that simplifies the acquisition of the latest information concerning equipment abnormalities (see, for example, patent document 1).","A second related-art data collection system is one comprising: an interface for at least transforming the output of a lamp, a buzzer or a sensor, used to indicate an operating state for a production equipment, to obtain an ON\/OFF signal indicating a start, a standby, a fault or a halted state; and a equipment operating state recording apparatus, which is connected to the interface, for at least recording the start, standby, fault or halted state, data indicating the cause of a fault or a halt, and the start and end times for the individual states of the equipment. According to the characteristic of this system, a plurality of keys provided for the equipment operating state recording apparatus are allocated for a display unit, and multiple choices for the cause of a fault at the production equipment or the halting thereof are allocated to these keys. In accordance with a signal pattern received from the interface, an entry made with a key representing a pertinent choice is enabled for the display unit of the equipment operating recording apparatus, and since an operator selectively used the key to enter data, cause data allocated to the key are recorded as data representing the cause of the fault at the production equipment or the halting thereof. After an operator has entered an end key to counter the cause of the fault or the halting, the entry of another cause input key is enabled, and the time at which the end key was entered is recorded as the start of the new cause or of the standby state (see patent document 2).","A third related-art data collection system is a production management system for managing a plurality of apparatuses connected to a network in a specific area. According to the characteristic of this system, a communication port is provided for controllers of units that belong to the apparatuses in order that they may be connected to a network independent of the network in the specific area. The controllers perform at least one of the data collection, data statistics, data processing and data storage tasks associated with the units, and transmit to a maintenance\/management computer, connected to the independent network, various types of information produced by employing data that are thus obtained. Then, the maintenance\/management computer records and displays the received information for the performance of at least one of the overall control, monitoring, management and maintenance operations for the units (see patent document 3).","A fourth related-art data collection system comprises: a first LAN and a second LAN, and a separation unit and a storage unit connected between the first LAN and the second LAN. According to the characteristic of this system, the separation unit separates the first and the second LANs so that the two do not adversely affect each other, and so that the control unit is accessible via both the first and the second LANs (see, for example, patent document 4).","A fifth related-art data collection system is a system, for a equipment, that can appropriately evaluate a measurement for reducing a period for a stop, due to a fault, in accordance with the cause of the stop (see, for example, patent document 5).","According to a sixth related-art data collection system, a dedicated monitoring PLC is located between a PC and a programmable controller for a plurality of facilities. PLCs for the individual facilities transform signals indicating operating states, cycle times and production quantities, and the cause of an abnormality that caused an equipment to be halted into code, and output this code as BCD (binarized decimal) signals to the dedicated monitoring PLC. The dedicated monitoring PLC sequentially monitors the equipment PLCs, and uses data thus collected to calculate an operating rate for each equipment. Then, the dedicated monitoring PLC adds this operating rate or the number of halt times to a halt history provided for each cause or for each equipment, and stores the data in a register and also transmits them to the PC. The PC fetches the thus received data to table calculation software, while constantly monitoring the operating state of the equipment, and prepares a daily report or a monthly report, or performs a data analysis (see patent document 6).","[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 2002-269664 (e.g., page 1, FIG. 1)","[Patent Document 2] Japanese Patent No. 3616200 (e.g., page 1, FIG. 1)","[Patent Document 3] Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 6-301617 (e.g., page 1, FIG. 1)","[Patent Document 4] WO00\/28700 (e.g., page 1, FIG. 1)","[Patent Document 5] Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 11-184518 (e.g., page 1, FIG. 1)","[Patent Document 6] Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 2003-50624 (e.g., page 1, FIG. 1)","However, it is not easy for these related-art first to sixth data collection systems to be installed in a related-art production equipment, such as a equipment. Specifically, when one of the related-art first to sixth data collection systems is used to collect information for the operation of a production equipment, the production equipment must be customized, or a sequence program, such as a programmable controller, mounted in the production equipment must be greatly modified.","Furthermore, for the transmission and reception of data, the related-art first to the sixth data collection systems can not represent, using a small number of bits, state information concerning various types of equipment states. Thus, for a system that includes very large production facilities, such as plants, the free flow of network traffic would be threatened to collect state information for equipments.","Furthermore, for the related-art first to the sixth data collection system, the operating state of the equipment cannot be satisfactorily analyzed. Specifically, since information upon the occurrence of an abnormality, such as operator moving time information and restoration time information, cannot be obtained, a counterplan required for a production job site cannot be performed. Furthermore, since the occurrence rates for the individual states, including the abnormal state, and the durations and frequencies of these states cannot be obtained, measures for the improvement of productivity and the improvement of quality at the production job site cannot be performed.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a data collection system.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, a data collection system comprises:","a divergence apparatus, located between a equipment and an output apparatus, for outputting contact information concerning an operation performed by the equipment;","a network apparatus; and","a data collection apparatus,","wherein the divergence apparatus includes\n\n","wherein the network apparatus includes\n\n","wherein the data collection apparatus includes\n\n","With this arrangement, information concerning the operation of a equipment can be easily obtained, without having to customize a equipment or greatly change a sequence program, such as a programmable controller, mounted in the equipment.","According to a second aspect of the invention, the data collection system of the first aspect further comprises:","an analysis apparatus, including\n\n","With this arrangement, a collected operating data log can be analyzed. Through this analysis, for example, solutions such as the need to increase the number of operators or the need to establish restoration procedures can be found.","Further, with this arrangement, information concerning the operation of a equipment can be easily obtained without having to customize a equipment or greatly change a sequence program, such as a programmable controller, mounted in the equipment.","According to a third aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the first or the second aspect, the divergence apparatus further includes:","a state recognition unit, for employing contact information acquired by the contact information acquisition unit to obtain state information, which is information concerning a state of the equipment; and","a state coding unit, for transforming the state information obtained by the state recognition unit into coded contact associated information, and","the output unit transmits to the output apparatus the contact information obtained by the contact information acquisition unit, and also transmits to the network apparatus the contact associated information obtained through a transform performed by the state coding unit.","With this arrangement, data can be coded before being output to a network, so that the network traffic can be reduced. Further, the data collection system is extremely effective, especially when introduced into a large production system, such as a plant.","According to a fourth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the third aspect, the state coding unit further includes:","a coding map storage unit, for storing a coding map representing a correlation between state information, which indicates state patterns for n contacts (n is an integer of two or greater), and contact associated information, which is code in (n\u22121) bits or smaller; and","a contact associated information acquisition unit, for obtaining, from the coding map, contact associated information that is correlated with state information obtained by the state recognition unit.","With this arrangement, multiple state types can be handled by using a small number of bits, and network traffic can be reduced. Furthermore, the data collection system is extremely effective, especially when introduced into a large production system, such as a plant.","According to a fifth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the third aspect, the state coding unit includes:","a coding map storage unit, for storing a coding map according to which contact associated information, correlated with state information that indicates a set of two or more states, is regarded as the sum of contact associated information sets that are correlated with the two or more states; and","a contact associated information acquisition unit, for obtaining from the coding map contact associated information correlated with state information obtained by the state recognition unit.","With this arrangement, the operating states generated simultaneously can be sorted, and as a result, a production management department can obtain the state of the equipment more quickly.","According to a sixth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the fourth or fifth aspect, the contact outputs the state of a buzzer that is to be set either to the ON or to the OFF state, or the state of a signal light that is to be turned on or off, or to blink. The state information includes: asynchronous information that is generated asynchronously with a change in the state of the buzzer and a change in the state of the signal light. When state information obtained by the state recognition unit includes asynchronous information, the state coding unit transforms the state information into contact associated information, which is code having a predetermined value, regardless of whether information other than the asynchronous information is included in the state information obtained by the state recognition unit. And according to a seventh aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the sixth aspect, the asynchronous information is production count information indicating a production count for the equipment.","With this arrangement, network traffic can be reduced.","According to an eighth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the second aspect, the analysis unit employs two or more sets of contact associated information to obtain operator moving time information, which concerns moving time for a operator, and restoration time information, which concerns a restoration time. According to a ninth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the eighth aspect, the analysis unit includes:","a operator moving time information acquisition unit, for obtaining, based on two or more sets of contact associated information, information concerning a period extending from the start of the ON state of a buzzer to the OFF state, and defining the information as operator moving time information; and","a restoration time information acquisition unit, for employing, after the buzzer has been changed from on to off, two or more sets of contact associated information to obtain information concerning a period required before the equipment is normal operation, and defining the information as restoration time information.","With this arrangement, information concerning the operation of the equipment can be easily obtained, without changing the related-art procedures followed by operators at a job site. That is, in the related art, when a fault has occurred at a common equipment, a operator is notified by a buzzer. Then, the operator moves to the reequipment, and halts the buzzer sound by pressing, for example, a buzzer stop button. This is normally done to notify other operators that someone who can handle the fault has arrived at the pertinent apparatus. In other words, should the buzzer sound continue, two or more operators may move to the equipment to remove a fault. This is an inefficient situation. According to the arrangement of the invention, information concerning the operation of the equipment can be obtained without having to change the normal process described above.","According to a tenth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the ninth aspect, the analysis results output unit includes:","a moving time histogram output unit, for preparing, based on operator moving time information obtained by the operator moving time information acquisition unit, a histogram that employs, as respective axes, operator moving time, which is represented by the operator moving time information, and a frequency at which movement during the pertinent moving time occurred and\/or a total time for one or more movements during the moving time, and for outputting the histogram; and","a restoration time histogram output unit for, based on restoration time information obtained by the restoration time information acquisition unit, preparing a histogram that employs, as respective axes, a restoration time, which is represented by the restoration time information, and a frequency of an occurrence of a restoration requiring the restoration time and\/or a total time for one or more restorations each of which require the restoration time, and for outputting the histogram.","With this arrangement, a countermeasure at a production job site can be easily effected. Specifically, when the moving time is displayed using a histogram, it is possible to determine whether the frequency at which the equipment was halted is higher when the moving time was long or when the moving time was short. When the frequency at which the equipment was halted during a long moving time is high, it is apparent that the arrangement of operators is a problem. When the restoration time is displayed using a histogram, it is possible to determine whether the frequency at which the equipment was halted was higher when the restoration time was long, or when the restoration time was short. When the restoration time was long, it can be assumed that \u201ctrouble halts\u201d occurred frequently, and that countermeasures for \u201ctrouble halts\u201d are required. When the restoration time was short, it can be assumed that \u201cshort time halts\u201d occurred frequently and that countermeasures for \u201cshort time halts\u201d are required. By displaying the histogram in this manner, a counterplan for a equipment can be determined and supported. It should be noted that a \u201cshort time halt\u201d is a short equipment stop event, such as a clogged conveying line, and that the equipment operation can be quickly restored by performing a comparatively easy process. A \u201ctrouble halt\u201d, however, is a comparatively long equipment stop event that occurs as a result of a fault for which practical countermeasures have not yet been commonly employed, e.g., either operators other than those having special skills can not handle the fault, or to determine the required corrective action a manual or manuals must be referred to.","According to an eleventh aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of one of the eighth to the tenth aspects, the contact associated information includes time information, which is time related information, and the analysis apparatus includes:","a correction unit, for correcting, based on a period that the state recognition unit requires to acquire state information, correcting the operator moving time information and the restoration time information.","With this arrangement, accurate timing of a state change, such as the occurrence of a fault or a recovery operation, for the equipment can be obtained. As a result, the cause of a fault can be found easily.","According to a twelfth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of one of the second to the eleventh aspects, the data collection apparatus employs different network interfaces to connect to the divergence apparatus and to connect to the analysis apparatus.","With this arrangement, a data collection network can be built that is independent of a general network installed in an office, and without constituting a threat to the network traffic in the office, information concerning the operation can be collected. A system configuration for which network traffic is taken into account is especially important in a plant where, for a production system, an extremely large number of equipments have been provided.","According to a thirteenth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the second aspect, the analysis unit employs two or more sets of contact associated information to obtain operator moving time information, which concerns the moving time for a operator, and restoration time information, which concerns a restoration time.","With this arrangement, a collected operating data log can be analyzed. Through this analysis, for example, solutions such as the need to increase the number of operators or the need to establish restoration procedures can be found.","According to a fourteenth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the thirteenth aspect, the analysis unit includes:","a operator moving time information acquisition unit, for obtaining, based on two or more sets of contact associated information, information concerning a period extending from the start of the ON state of a buzzer to the OFF state, and defining the information as operator moving time information; and","a restoration time information acquisition unit, for employing, after the buzzer has been switched from on to off, two or more sets of contact associated information to obtain information concerning a period required before the equipment is normal operation, and defining the information as restoration time information.","With this arrangement, information concerning the operation of the equipment can be easily obtained, without changing the related-art procedures followed by operators at a job site.

In other words, should the buzzer sound continue, two or more operators may move to the equipment to remove a fault. This is an inefficient situation. According to the arrangement of the invention, information concerning the operation of the equipment can be obtained without having to change the normal process described above.","According to a fifteenth aspect of the invention, in addition to the data collection system of the fourteenth aspect, the analysis results output unit includes:","a moving time histogram output unit, for preparing, based on operator moving time information obtained by the operator moving time information acquisition unit, a histogram that employs, as respective axes, operator moving time, which is represented by the operator moving time information, and a frequency at which movement during the pertinent moving time occurred and\/or a total time for one or more movements during the moving time, and for outputting the histogram; and","a restoration time histogram output unit for, based on restoration time information obtained by the restoration time information acquisition unit, preparing a histogram that employs, as respective axes, a restoration time, which is represented by the restoration time information, and a frequency for an occurrence of a restoration requiring the restoration time and\/or a total time for one or more restorations, each of which require the restoration time, and for outputting the histogram.","With this arrangement, a countermeasure at a production job site can be easily effected. Specifically, when the moving time is displayed using a histogram, it is possible to determine whether the frequency at which the equipment was halted is higher when the moving time was long or when the moving time was short.

In this embodiment, the programmable controllers  receive contact information concerning the operation of the equipments , and transmit the information to the output apparatuses  to control the these apparatuses . Further, the programmable controllers  include controllers and computers, such as a programmable controller (PC), a sequence controller and a programmable logic controller (PLC), for performing monitoring sequences for the equipments . The contact information indicates, for example, the ON\/OFF state of a buzzer, the light ON\/OFF state or the blinking state for a red, yellow or green signal light, such as an LED or a fluorescent lamp, or the quantity of products produced by a equipment . The data structure of the contact information is not specifically designated.","The data collection systems  are systems that obtain contact information concerning the operation of the equipments . The contact information is acquired from one or more contacts, and information at individual contacts consisting of contact information is ON or OFF pulse information. The data collection systems  are respectively located between the equipments  and the output apparatuses  that output contact information for the operation of corresponding equipments . Here, \u201cbetween\u201d does not mean a spatial gap, but represents a situation wherein at least one apparatus (in this embodiment, a divergence apparatus  that will be described later) of a data collection apparatus  receives a signal from a equipment , and transmits it to an output apparatus . For this transmission, the received signal may be transferred either unchanged or after having been processed. Furthermore, the data collection systems  receive contact information from the programmable controllers . It should be noted that the data collection systems  may also receive contact information directly from the equipments , and in such a case, the programmable controllers  would not be required.","The output apparatuses  output contact information by using, for example, a signal light, such as an LED, or generating buzzer sounds. The form of the output apparatus  for outputting the contact information is not especially limited. The output in this case is a concept that includes transmission to another apparatus, such as an apparatus having display means, and storage on a recording medium.","Each data collection system  includes one or more divergence apparatuses , one or more network apparatuses , a data collection apparatus  and an analysis apparatus .

In this embodiment, the contact information acquisition unit  obtains, through the programmable controller , contact information concerning the equipment . The contact information acquisition unit  may receive contact information from the programmable controller , or read contact information stored in the reequipment , i.e., the contact information acquisition method employed by the contact information acquisition unit  is not specifically designated. The contact information acquisition unit  separates a transfer line, for contact information received from the programmable controller , into two branches: one branch is to the output unit , so as to output the contact information directly to the output apparatus , and the other branch is to the state recognition , so as to perform state recognition. The contact information acquisition unit  can be, for example, an MPU or a memory, or may be a wireless or a wired reception unit. The processing performed by the contact information acquisition unit  is generally provided by software that is recorded on a recording medium, such as a ROM, but may also be provided by hardware (a special circuit).","The state recognition unit  obtains state information, concerning the state of the equipment , based on the contact information acquired by the contact information acquisition unit . The state of the equipment  includes one of the two states for a buzzer, either ON or OFF, and one of the three states for three types of signal lights, e.g., red, yellow and green lamps, that are lighted, off or blinking. This state can be regarded as a pair of states for a plurality of media, such as a buzzer and a signal light. There are ten state patterns that are paired for all states, and a specific state example will be described later. The state information is information, concerning the state of the equipment , that is to be obtained based on the contact information that the contact information acquisition unit  has obtained. In this embodiment, the state information includes: asynchronous information that is generated, asynchronously, with the change in the state of a buzzer and a signal light change. The asynchronous information is production count information concerning the production count for the equipment , e.g., information concerning the exchange of dies installed in the equipment , information concerning the exchange of a resin employed by the equipment , re-insertion information used when a product that was inspected as defective and was corrected is to be inserted, or setup change information used when a setup change is performed. Normally, the state recognition unit  is, for example, an MPU or a memory, and the processing performed by the state recognition unit  is provided by software that is recorded on a recording medium, such as a ROM. However, the processing may also be provided by hardware (a special circuit).","The state coding unit  transforms state information obtained by the state recognition unit  into contact associated information, which is coded information. When state information obtained by the state recognition unit  includes asynchronous information, the state coding unit  transforms contact associated information, which is code having a predetermined value, regardless of the state information other than the asynchronous information. The state coding unit  employs only asynchronous information and omits the other state information to prepare contact associated information, which is coded information. In this case, the analysis apparatus  regards the state information other than the asynchronous information as being unchanged from the previous state. An explanation will be specifically given later for a method whereby the state coding unit  transforms state information into contact associated information. Normally, the state coding unit  is, for example, an MPU or a memory, and the processing performed by the state coding unit  is provided by software that is recorded on a recording medium, such as a ROM.

In , the following values can be provided for the attribute values of state information. Production quantity \u201c\u2218\u201d is information indicating that 100 works from the programmable controller  were passed along one production line (equipment ). When there is no entry in the production count column, it is assumed that 100 works have not yet passed along one production line (equipment ). Buzzer \u201c\u2218\u201d indicates that the buzzer is in the ON state, and \u201cX\u201d indicates that the buzzer is in the OFF state. \u201cRed\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d represent the colors of the signal lights, and \u201c\u2218\u201d for the individual signal lights indicates \u201clight on\u201d, \u201c\u0394\u201d indicates blinking, and \u201cX\u201d indicates \u201clight off\u201d.

That is, the divergence apparatus  outputs this output signal directly to the output unit , while the divergence apparatus  recognizes the pattern of the output signal (contact information), and outputs, to the network apparatus , state code (contact associated information) that matches the pattern. Among these processes, the process for preparing contact associated information based on contact information will now be specifically explained.","Based on contact information obtained by the contact information acquisition unit , the state recognition unit  identifies a state and obtains state information. Specifically, the state recognition unit  identifies patterns for the signal lights, the buzzer and the production count.","The state recognition unit  performs pattern recognition for the signal lights in the following manner. When, for example, one second contact information indicates the ON state, or the OFF state, the state recognition unit  determines that the signal light is on, or the signal light is off. When one second contact information indicates either the light on pattern or the light off pattern, the state recognition unit  determines that the warning light is blinking.","Further, when the buzzer contact is turned on, the state recognition unit  identifies the ON state, or when the buzzer contact is turned off, identifies the OFF state.","A specific algorithm for state recognition has been explained while referring to .","In this embodiment, when one work is passed along a production line, a pulse signal is transmitted to the programmable controller , and the state recognition unit  determines that a counter has counted 100 pulses.","Following this, the contact associated information acquisition unit  obtains, from the coding map storage unit , contact associated information that is correlated with state information that has been identified and obtained by the state recognition unit . In this embodiment, state information is information for five channels, and when this state information is coded by the contact associated information acquisition unit , four bits of data are obtained. Therefore, by performing pattern recognition for state information, the amount of state information stored is reduced, compared with the amount of information that is directly branched and stored as operating data logs. Further, the network traffic is also reduced.","The state recognition unit  outputs a one second pulse (hereinafter referred to as a \u201ccount up pulse\u201d, as needed) as a signal indicating that 100 pulses have been reached, relative to the production count. The count up pulse is to be very rarely output, while taking into account the pattern changes for the signal lights and buzzer, and also to be generated asynchronously with these changes. By considering this property, it is assumed that the code for the count up pulse is independent of the codes for the signal lights and the buzzer. That is, when the count up pulse is generated, the code (\u201c1111\u201d in ) is to be written to the operating data log by an interrupt. As shown in , the independent code (\u201c1111\u201d in ) is provided for the production count count-up pulse, and when the state information indicates the ON state, the state recognition unit  overwrites and outputs the code. Then, so long as the production count count-up pulse is being output, the analysis apparatus  regards the state as having been continued. That is, when contact associated information is \u201c1111\u201d, the analysis apparatus  employs the preceding or succeeding contact associated information to obtain the states of the three signal lights \u201cred\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d and the state of the buzzer. Through this process, the number of contact channels required for data collection can be reduced. Further, network traffic can be reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0262","num":"0271"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1","2","3","4"]},"The contact associated information acquisition unit  codes the contact information. The advantage of obtaining bit code for the contact information is as follows. When a pattern is to be identified without bit coding, five channels for contacts (red, yellow, green, a buzzer and a production count) are required for pattern recognition. However, when bit coding is employed for contact information, all the patterns, ten in this embodiment, can be represented by four bits, i.e., four channels, so that the number of channels is reduced to represent patterns.","Further, since an independent code is allocated for information, such as a count up pulse, it is very rarely generated, and log description can be performed by an interrupt. Thus, the number of channels is not unnecessarily increased.","After the state information has been coded by the contact associated information acquisition unit , the output unit  outputs the obtained state code to the network apparatus .","Generally, the output unit  outputs to the output apparatus  contact information for n types of contacts obtained by the contact information acquisition unit , without being especially processed. Since the output process performed by the output apparatus  is a well known process, no detailed explanation for it will be given.","Sequentially, the network apparatus  receives coded contact associated information (also called \u201cstate code\u201d, as needed) from the divergence apparatus , and transmits this information to the data collection apparatus .","The data collection apparatus  receives contact associated information from the network apparatus , and stores the received contact associated information in the operating data storage unit . Information stored in the operating data storage unit  is an operating data log consisting of one or more sets of contact associated information. Generally, the contact associated information includes time information (the \u201cdate\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d information shown in ).","Through the above processing, a large amount of contact associated information shown in  is accumulated in the data collection apparatus .","A specific operation performed by the analysis apparatus  will now be explained.","Assume that the command acceptance unit  of the analysis apparatus  accepts an analysis start command from a user.","Then, the contact associated information acquisition unit  obtains an operating data log, having the data structure shown in , from the operating data storage unit  of the data collection apparatus .","The correction unit  obtains a period (\u201ct=one second\u201d in this embodiment), which is stored in advance, that the state recognition unit  requires for the acquisition of state information.","Sequentially, the correction unit  employs the obtained period t (one second) to correct a time that is included in all the contact associated information for the obtained operating data log.","A time correction process performed by the correction unit  will now be described while referring to . Assume that the state indicated by contact associated information is the state of a signal light shown in . While referring to , the signal light at time T is blinking; however, in order to obtain the blinking state at T (\u201cT\u2212t\u201d), the correction unit  changes time information included in the contact associated information from T to T. Through this process, the analysis apparatus  can perform an analysis process based on the state at the exact time, while taking into account the period (t) that the state recognition unit  requires for the acquisition of state information.","Specifically, for example, as shown in , through time correction performed by the correction unit , contact associated information () before correction is changed to contact associated information () after correction. Using this correction process, the time at which the pattern was changed can be accurately obtained.","Next, the analysis unit  performs the analysis process in the following manner, and obtains operator moving time information and restoration time information based on one or more sets of contact associated information.","The state decoder  of the analysis unit  decodes the contact associated information to state information. As a result, the analysis unit  can obtain information with which a timing chart in  can be prepared.","Following this, moving time and a restoration time are calculated based on the ON\/OFF states of an abnormality signal light and a buzzer (operator paging buzzer). The operator moving time information acquisition unit  and the restoration time information acquisition unit  may calculate moving time and a restoration time by employing, as a trigger, the depression of a buzzer halt button, instead of employing the state of the buzzer.","Specifically, assume that a table in  is obtained by decoding and patterning the operating data log (one or more sets of contact associated information). In , since red blinking, i.e., the lighting start time for an abnormality signal light is \u201c12:52:46\u201d, and buzzer the stop time is \u201c12:53:01\u201d, the operator moving time information acquisition unit  calculates \u201cmoving time=buzzer stop time lighting start time for the abnormality signal light=15 (s)\u201d. In this case, red blinking indicates an abnormal halt, and green lighting indicates the normal operating state (see state definition information in ).","The restoration time information acquisition unit  calculates a \u201crestoration time=resume time\u2212buzzer stop time=12 (m) 4 (s)\u201d. It should be noted that, in , the resume time is \u201c13:05:05\u201d.","The results obtained by the operator moving time information acquisition unit  and the restoration time information acquisition unit  are at least temporarily stored by using an analysis results management table shown in . The analysis results management table in  includes at least one record consisting of time information indicating an abnormality start time, moving time and a restoration time.","Next, based on the operator moving time information (analysis results in ) obtained by the operator moving time information acquisition unit , the moving time histogram output unit  prepares and outputs a histogram that employs, as two axes, the moving time for a operator indicated by the operator moving time information, and a frequency at which a movement in the moving time occurred and\/or a total time for one or more movements during the moving time.","Furthermore, based on the restoration time information (analysis results in ) obtained by the restoration time information acquisition unit , the restoration time histogram output unit  prepares and outputs a histogram that employs, as two axes, a restoration time indicated by the restoration time information and a frequency at which a restoration requiring the restoration time occurred and\/or a total time for one or more restorations that required restoration times.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0285","num":"0294"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A to 16D","FIGS. 16A and 16B","FIG. 16A","FIG. 16B"],"b":["134","1314","134"]},"Also, restoration time histograms are shown in . While referring to , since the median for the restoration time is smaller than a threshold value, it can be determined that a countermeasure for a \u201cshort time halt\u201d is required. A \u201cshort time halt\u201d is a short equipment stop event, such as clogged conveying line, from which the equipment can be restored by performing a comparatively easy process. While referring to , since the median for the restoration time is greater than the threshold value, it can be determined that a countermeasure for a \u201ctrouble halt\u201d is required. A \u201ctrouble halt\u201d is a comparatively long equipment stop event that occurs in the case wherein a practical countermeasure not yet been commonly employed, e.g., either operators other than those having special skills can not handle the fault, or to determine the required corrective action a manual or manuals must be referred to. The countermeasure for a \u201ctrouble halt\u201d is, for example, the establishment of procedures for a restoration job. It should be noted that the analysis unit  holds, in advance, information for the threshold value. The analysis unit  may determine whether the median is greater or smaller than the threshold value, and the analysis results output unit  may output information in accordance with the determination results.","The moving time histogram output unit  and the restoration time histogram output unit  specifically perform the following processing, and output the histograms shown in .","Based on records acquired in the past, the moving time histogram output unit  divides the moving time in accordance with suitable levels to form the horizontal axis. The moving time histogram output unit  provides, for the vertical axis, the frequency (the number of times) for the moving time at each level, or the total number of time periods. As a result, it can be ascertained at a glance which moving time adversely affected a period of time halted. When the frequency of short moving times is high, this is not especially a problem, because it is assumed that when a equipment halt occurs, a operator can immediately respond and cope with the problem. On the other hand, when the frequency of long moving times is high, it is assumed that when a equipment halt occurs, it takes time for a operator to arrive at the site, and a problem in the distribution of operators exists. Thus, it is ascertained that the operator distribution planning should be reviewed.","Based on records acquired in the past, the restoration time histogram output unit  divides the restoration time in accordance with suitable levels to form the horizontal axis. The restoration time histogram output unit  provides, for the vertical axis, the frequency (the number of times) at which restoration times were required at each level, or the total time. As a result, it can be ascertained at a glance which restoration time adversely affected conditions during a halt period. When the frequency of short restoration times is high, it is assumed that \u201cshort time halts\u201d occurred frequently, and determination of the reasons and the countermeasures required for \u201cshort time halts\u201d are required. On the other hand, when the frequency of long restoration times is high, it is assumed that \u201ctrouble halts\u201d have occurred frequently, and determination of the reasons and the countermeasures required for \u201ctrouble halts\u201d are required.","In this manner, halt periods are displayed using histograms for moving times and for restoration times, so as to provide for support for the determination of methods for improving the operating rate for the equipment.","The analysis results output unit  may output a graph of the operating information shown in . In this case, the analysis apparatus  should also hold the state definition information shown in . Then, state definition information (e.g., \u201cpower off\u201d data) correlated with state information is output using a timing chart. Since the process for outputting the timing chart is well known, no detailed explanation for this will be given. It should be noted that the definition for the timing chart is the same as that for a time chart.","According to this embodiment, information concerning the operation of a equipment can be easily obtained, without having to reconstruct a equipment, such as a equipment, or having to greatly change a sequence program, such as a programmable controller, mounted in the equipment. The data collection system of this embodiment is extremely effective, especially when introduced into a large production system, such as a plant.","Further, according to this embodiment, when the analysis apparatus  analyzes an operating data log, corrective measures to be taken, such as the need to increase the number of operators or the need to establish procedures for restoration jobs, can be adopted.","Furthermore, according to this embodiment, data to be transmitted to the network apparatus is coded, and network traffic can be reduced. Additionally, only a small amount of data is required for the storage of operating data logs.","Moreover, according to the embodiment, when state information includes asynchronous information that is generated asynchronously with a change in the state of a buzzer and changes in the states of signal lights, regardless of whether state information other than the asynchronous information is obtained, the information can be transformed into contact associated information, which is code having a predetermined value. Therefore, the network traffic can be reduced even more.","Further, according to this embodiment, information (operator moving times and restoration times) concerning the operation of a equipment can be easily obtained, without changing related art procedures for the tasks assigned a operator at a job site (e.g., performance of a duty such that when an abnormality occurs at a equipment, a operator can move to the equipment and press a buzzer stop button). Thus, countermeasures to be taken at a production site can be easily performed.","Furthermore, since moving times are displayed using histograms, it can readily be ascertained whether long moving times or short moving times occurred more frequently when a equipment was halted. And when long moving times were most frequent, it can be assumed that the planning for the disposition of operators should be reviewed. Further, since the restoration time is displayed using histograms, it can be ascertained whether long restoration times or short restoration times occurred most frequently when the equipment was halted. When long restoration times were most frequent, it can be assumed that \u201ctrouble halts\u201d occurred most frequently and that appropriate countermeasures for \u201ctrouble halts\u201d are required. And when short restoration times were not frequent, it can be assumed that \u201cshort time halts\u201d occurred most frequently and that appropriate countermeasures for \u201cshort time halts\u201d are required. Since the histograms are displayed in this manner, the process for determining what measures to take for a equipment can be supported.","Since the analysis apparatus includes the correction unit for correcting time, the exact time at which the state of a equipment is changed (e.g., the occurrence of a fault, restoration) can be obtained, and as a result, the cause for a fault, for example, can be easily determined.","In this embodiment, the coding map is not limited to the map shown in , and a map shown in  or  may be employed. In  or , \u201c\u2212\u201d means \u201cdon't care\u201d, i.e., can be either \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d.","When the coding map in  is employed, for attribute value \u201cno work for a preprocess+work full for post process\u201d, state information indicates that a \u201cyellow\u201d signal light is ON and a \u201cgreen\u201d signal light is blinking (see the seventh record in ). For \u201cwork full for post process\u201d, state information indicates the \u201cgreen\u201d signal light is blinking (see the third record in ). For \u201cno work for preprocess\u201d, state information indicates that the \u201cyellow\u201d signal light is ON and the \u201cgreen\u201d signal light is also ON (see the fifth record in ). And while referring to , the operating state \u201cno work for preprocess+work full for post process\u201d, which is generated at the same time, is sorted. In other words, in the coding map in , three types of state information can be represented by contact associated information provide using two bits (\u201cstate \u201d and \u201cstate \u201d in ). Further, according to the coding map in , contact associated information for state information that indicates two or more states (\u201cno work for preprocess\u201d and \u201cwork full for post process\u201d in this case) is regarded as the sum (\u201c\u2212110\u201d) of correlated contact associated information sets (\u201c\u2212100\u201d and \u201c\u2212010\u201d). That is, \u201c\u2212\u201d (don't care) is regarded as not affecting addition. This is because at a production site many states for a equipment must be transmitted by using a small number of signal lights (hardware). On the other hand, in a production management department, it is preferable that operating states generated at the same time be separated, and that three states, \u201cno works for a preprocess\u201d, \u201cwork full for post process\u201d and \u201cno works for a preprocess+work full for post process\u201d, must be determined based on two output waveforms, instead of three. That is, as shown in , a waveform for \u201cno works for a preprocess+work full for post process\u201d, shown at the bottom in , is put together with \u201cno works for a preprocess\u201d and \u201cwork full for post process\u201d (). As a result, the production management department can ascertain the state of a equipment at a glance. And when a different coding map is employed, the same processes can be employed, for example, for the state code unit , the coding map setting unit , the contact associated information acquisition unit , the analysis unit  and the state decoder .","It should be noted that a circular portion and elliptical portions indicated by broken lines should be referred to for the above described processing.","The functions of the individual apparatuses in this embodiment may be provided using software.

Specifically, it is apparent that, in , losing of a tact balance, and a short time halt and a trouble halt occurred only in specific time slots.","As described above, according to the embodiment, since the histograms showing the ON state and OFF state are prepared and output, the occurrence trend for the operating state can be clearly categorized. Specifically, when, for example, a state wherein a equipment was halted for ten minutes or longer is frequent by referring to the ON histogram, the occurrence trend of the state can be categorized as \u201clong period type\u201d, and it is understood that a \u201ctrouble halt\u201d occurred. A state wherein a equipment is halted for five to six minutes or less is frequent, the occurrence trend of the state can be categorized as \u201cshort period type\u201d, and it is understood that a \u201cshort time halt\u201d or losing of a tact balance occurred. Further, a state wherein a equipment is halted longer than, for example, five minutes is frequent by referring to the OFF histogram, the occurrence trend of the state can be categorized as \u201csporadic occurrence type\u201d, and it is understood that the state only rarely occurred. A state wherein a equipment is halted shorter than five minutes is frequent, the occurrence trend of the state can be categorized as \u201cfrequent occurrence type\u201d, and it is understood that the state frequently occurred. That is, according to the ON\/OFF state histograms, the occurrence trend of the state can be categorized into four types: \u201clong period frequent occurrence type\u201d, \u201clong period sporadic occurrence type\u201d, \u201cshort period frequent occurrence type\u201d and \u201cshort period sporadic occurrence type\u201d.","Furthermore, when operating data collected and stored for an extended period of time is displayed simply using a time chart, it is not easily identified whether the individual operating states were maintained ON for an extended period of time, or frequently switched between ON and OFF. However, when these states are displayed by using the ON\/OFF histograms and categorized as four occurrence types, the occurrence trends of the operating states can be easily obtained.","In the above embodiment, the operating data statistical processor  may prepare only an ON histogram or an OFF histogram. That is, the operating data statistical processor  does not need to determine an occurrence type and obtain state identification information. In this case, a user should examine the ON histogram and the OFF histogram output by the statistical results output unit , and should manually determine an occurrence type, and obtain state identification information.","Further, in the embodiment, the state identification information management table in  has been employed to search one state identification information based on one identifier and an occurrence type. However, a state identification information management table in  may be employed. In this table in , two or more state identifiers and occurrence types are employed to identify one set of state identification information. In the state identification information management table in , when state identifier \u201cnormal operation\u201d of record \u201cID=1\u201d is a short period frequent occurrence type, and state identifier \u201cno work for preprocess\u201d is also a short period frequent occurrence type, this represents state \u201ctact balance is disturbed for preprocess\u201d. In this case, the operating data statistical processor  employs a plurality of state occurrence types to obtain state identification information.","Further, when the state identification information management table in  is stored wherein are entered state identifier \u201cnormal operation\u201d, occurrence type \u201cshort period frequent occurrence type\u201d, state identifier \u201cworks for work full for post process\u201d and occurrence type \u201cshort period frequent occurrence type\u201d, the operating data statistical processor  searches the state identification management table in , and obtains state identification information \u201ctact balance is disturbed in the post process\u201d.","Then, the statistical results output unit  outputs a histogram (see  for example displayed histograms).","Then, the statistical results output unit  outputs the obtained state identification information \u201ctact balance is disturbed in the post process\u201d in the manner shown in .","Furthermore, when the state identification information management table in  is employed, and when the state identifier \u201cabnormally halted\u201d is a long period sporadic occurrence type, the operating data statistical processor  obtains state identification information \u201ca trouble halt occurs occasionally\u201d. The statistical results output unit  outputs the obtained state identification information \u201ca bit halt occurs occasionally\u201d. That is, the state identification information to be output can be various types.","Further, in this embodiment, the ON histogram and the OFF histogram is output at the same time; however, either the ON histogram or the OFF histogram may be output. Based on the ON histogram, the occurrence type of a state can be determined to be either a \u201cshort-period type\u201d or a \u201clong period type\u201d. Further, based on the OFF histogram, the occurrence type of a state can be determined to be either a \u201cfrequent occurrence type\u201d or a \u201csporadic occurrence type\u201d.","Further, software that provides the analysis apparatus for this embodiment is the following program. The program permits a computer to perform:","a contact associated information acquisition step of obtaining one or more sets of contact associated information from a data collection apparatus;","an analysis step of processing the one or more sets of contact associated information obtained at the contact associated information acquisition step, and obtaining predetermined information, and","an analysis results output step of outputting the predetermined information obtained at the analysis step.","The analysis step of the program includes:","an operating data statistical processing step of calculating ON durations and frequencies for the individual states indicated by state information for the equipment, and also calculating OFF durations and frequencies for the states. Furthermore, preferably, based on the ON durations and frequencies and the OFF durations, and frequencies for the individual states that have been obtained at the operating data statistical processing step, ON histograms and OFF histograms that represent ON and OFF frequencies for the states are output at the analysis output step.","Further, at the operating data statistical processing step of the program, an occurrence type that is a type of an occurrence of a state is determined by employing the ON duration and the frequency of a state and\/or the OFF duration and the frequency of a state, and the occurrence type is output at the analysis results output step.","Further, at the operating data statistical processing step of the program, the ON duration and a frequency of a state and\/or the OFF duration and a frequency of a state are employed to determine an occurrence type that is a type of an occurrence of a state, and the occurrence type is employed to find state identification information. Furthermore, the state identification information is output at the analysis results output step.","In the individual embodiments, the individual processes (functions) may be centralized and performed by a single apparatus (system), or they may be distributed to a plurality of apparatuses.","The information transmission step and the information reception step of the program do not include processes performed by hardware, such as processes performed using a modem or an interface card (processes performed only by hardware).","A single computer or multiple computers may be employed to perform the program of the invention. That is, centralized processing, or distributed processing may be performed.","Further, in the embodiments, two or more communication units (information transmitter or output unit), such as data transmitters, present in one apparatus, may be physically provided by a single medium.","The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments and can be variously modified, and these modifications are also included within the technical scope of the present invention.","As described above, the data collection system of the invention is effective and useful, because this system can collect operating data for existing production facilities, without affecting the performance of these production facilities.","[]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0470","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0479"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0002","num":"0480"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0003","num":"0481"},"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0004","num":"0482"},"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0005","num":"0483"},"b":"131"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0006","num":"0484"},"b":"132"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0007","num":"0485"},"b":"133"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0008","num":"0486"},"b":"134"},"a:
