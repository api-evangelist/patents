title: Indexing system and method for nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional data spaces
abstract: Vectors representing objects in n-dimensional space are approximated by local polar coordinates on partitioned cells of the data space in response to a query, e.g., a query data vector entered with a request to find “k” nearest neighbors to the query vector. A set of candidate near neighbors is generated using the approximations, with the local polar coordinates being independent of the dimensionality of the data space. Then, an answer set of near neighbors is returned in response to the query. Thus, the present invention acts as a filter to reduce the number of actual data vectors in the data set that must be considered in responding to the query.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a continuation of allowed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/512,949, filed Feb. 25, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,318,053, from which priority is claimed.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to methods and systems for indexing objects in high dimensional data spaces to respond to user queries.","2. Description of the Related Art","Nearest neighbor searching on high dimensional data spaces is essentially a method of searching for objects in a data space that are similar to a user-selected object, with the user-selected object defining a query. For example, using the present assignee's QBIC system, a user can select a digital image and use the image as a query to a data base for images that are similar to the user-selected digital image. In response to the query, the \u201ck\u201d closest images are returned, where \u201ck\u201d is an integer defined by the user or search engine designer. These \u201ck\u201d images are referred to as the \u201ck\u201d nearest neighbors to the image that was used as the query, and for indexing and search purposes they are typically considered to be multidimensional data points \u201cp\u201d that are close to a multidimensional data point \u201cq\u201d representing the query. Other non-limiting examples of applications that use nearest neighbor searching include video databases, data mining, pattern classification, and machine learning.","In any case, multidimensional indexing methods (\u201cMIMs\u201d) have been introduced for indexing multidimensional objects by partitioning the data space, clustering data according to the partitioning, and using the partitions to prune the search space to promote fast query execution. It will readily be appreciated that in the context of large databases that hold a high number of objects, the time to execute a query like the one discussed above would be excessive in the absence of MIMs. As recognized by the present invention, while effective for low dimensionalities, MIMs are not effective and indeed tend toward being counterproductive for objects having high dimensionalities, e.g., of ten, twenty or more. Image objects, for example, can have hundreds of dimensions, and text documents can have thousands of dimensions.","Weber et al. disclose a filtering method intended to be an improvement over conventional MIMs in \u201cA Quantitative Analysis and Performance Study for Similarity-Search Methods in High-Dimensional Spaces\u201d, 24, 1998 (\u201cVA file\u201d method). In the VA file method, compact approximations of data objects (also referred to as \u201cvectors\u201d) are generated, and by first scanning the compact approximations, a large number of the larger actual vectors can be filtered out such that only a small number of vectors need be examined. In this way, query execution time is minimized.","The present invention has recognized, however, that the VA file method has at least two drawbacks. The first is that as the dimensionality of the data objects increases, the number of bits used in the approximations also increases significantly to facilitate adequate filtering. This means that the performance of the VA file method, like the performance of the above-mentioned MIMs, degrades significantly when applied to high dimensional data spaces (e.g., dimensions over 100). The second drawback with the VA file method is that its filtering capability decreases in the case of clustered data such as multimedia data. The present invention, having recognized the above-noted deficiencies in the prior art, has provided the improvements disclosed below.","The invention is a general purpose computer programmed according to the inventive steps herein. The invention can also be embodied as an article of manufacture\u2014a machine component\u2014that is used by a digital processing apparatus and which tangibly embodies a program of instructions that are executable by the digital processing apparatus to undertake the present invention. This invention is realized in a critical machine component that causes a digital processing apparatus to perform the inventive method steps herein. The invention is also a computer-implemented method for undertaking the acts disclosed below.","Accordingly, a computer is programmed to undertake method acts for querying for data using a query. The method acts undertaken by the computer include, for at least some data vectors in a data space, generating respective approximations in polar coordinates. Also, the method acts executed by the computer include returning \u201ck\u201d nearest neighbors to the query based on the approximations.","In a preferred embodiment, the method acts executed by the computer further include dividing the data space into plural cells, and approximating at least one data point in at least one cell by using polar coordinates with respect to the at least one cell. Accordingly, the method is referred to as \u201clocal polar coordinate-based approximation\u201d. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the data space has \u201cd\u201d dimensions, and a number of \u201cb\u201d bits to be assigned to each cell is determined. Then, the data space is divided into 2cells.","As disclosed in greater detail below, each approximation defines a lower bound dand an upper bound d, and the method acts executed by the computer include generating a candidate set of approximations based on the lower bound dand upper bound dof the approximations. Moreover, the query can be represented by a query vector q, and the computer adds a first approximation having a first lower bound dto the candidate set if d<k\u2212NN(q), wherein k\u2212NN(q) is the klargest distance between the query vector q and nearest neighbor vectors p encountered so far. The candidate set is then used to return \u201ck\u201d nearest neighbor vectors p to the query vector q. With this invention, not all vectors p corresponding to approximations in the candidate set are examined to return the \u201ck\u201d nearest neighbors.","In another aspect, a computer program product includes a program of instructions that have computer readable code means for generating local polar coordinate-based approximations of at least some data vectors p in at least one data set having a dimensionality of \u201cd\u201d. The local polar coordinates are independent of \u201cd\u201d. Computer readable code means use the approximations to return \u201ck\u201d nearest neighbors to a query.","In yet another aspect, a computer-implemented method is disclosed for finding, in a data space, \u201ck\u201d closest data vectors p to a query vector q. The method includes rendering approximations of at least some of the data vectors p using local polar coordinates, and filtering the approximations. After filtering, the \u201ck\u201d closest data vectors p are returned.","The details of the present invention, both as to its structure and operation, can best be understood in reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts, and in which:","Referring initially to , a system is shown, generally designated , that includes a data space server  having access to a local or remote software-implemented index module . Using an input device , a user of a user computer  can input a query for data from a database , and the server , by means of the index module , accesses the database  and returns the requested data to the user computer  for display or storage thereof on an output device, such as a monitor . More specifically, as set forth further below, the user computer  sends a query for data essentially using a query vector q, with the index module  returning the \u201ck\u201d nearest neighbors (referred to herein as the \u201ck\u201d data vectors p that are closest to q) in response. The query vector q can be, e.g., an example image for which the user wants close matches. Other applications of k-nearest neighbor searching are contemplated herein, such as but not limited to document retrieval, data mining, pattern classification, and machine learning.","As intended herein, either or both of the server \/user computer  can be a server computer made by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) of Armonk, N.Y. Other digital processors, however, may be used, such as personal computers, laptop computers, mainframe computers, palmtop computers, personal assistants, or any other suitable processing apparatus can be used. The input device  can be established by one or more of: a computer mouse, keyboards, keypads, trackballs, and voice recognition devices. Output devices other than the monitor  can be used, such as printers, other computers or data storage devices, and computer networks.","In any case, the processor of the server  accesses the module  to undertake the logic of the present invention, which may be executed by a processor as a series of computer-executable instructions. The instructions may be contained on a data storage device with a computer readable medium, such as a computer diskette having a computer usable medium with a program of instructions stored thereon. Or, the instructions may be stored on random access memory (RAM) of the computer, on a DASD array, or on magnetic tape, conventional hard disk drive, electronic read-only memory, optical storage device, or other appropriate data storage device. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the computer-executable instructions may be lines of C or C++ or Java code.","Indeed, the flow charts herein illustrate the structure of the logic of the present invention as embodied in computer program software. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the flow charts illustrate the structures of computer program code elements including logic circuits on an integrated circuit, that function according to this invention. Manifestly, the invention is practiced in its essential embodiment by a machine component that renders the program code elements in a form that instructs a digital processing apparatus (that is, a computer) to perform a sequence of function steps corresponding to those shown.","The logic of the present starts in  at blocks  and , wherein the data space in the database  is divided into 2cells, wherein \u201cb\u201d is an integer number of data points that are assigned to each cell and \u201cd\u201d is the dimensionality of the database . For illustration purposes,  shows a two-dimensional data space that has been divided into plural cells , while  illustrates a single three dimensional cell . The use of two and three dimensions in  is for simplicity of disclosure only, it being understood that the principles set forth herein apply to any high dimensional data spaces.","Moving to block , a DO loop is entered such that for each data point, an approximation in local polar coordinates is generated at block . As shown in , each cell  has a local origin \u201cO\u201d at its bottom left corner, and each cell can be represented by its coordinates shown in .","A vector pis generated in local polar coordinates having a radius \u201cr\u201d from the cell's local origin \u201cO\u201d to the idata point and an angle \u03b8 between the vector and the bisecting diagonal  of the cell. This is illustrated in . As a result, each vector p is represented by an approximation a=<cell, radius \u201cr\u201d, angle \u201c\u03b8\u201d>. At block , a complete local polar coordinate (LPC) file is generated, which in the preferred embodiment can be an array of approximations a representing vectors p.","As can be appreciated in reference to , an approximation is a set of points having radius \u201cr\u201d and angle \u03b8 within a cell. In the two dimensional illustration shown in , the approximation represents two points p and p\u2032 which have polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) and which are symmetric with respect to the diagonal . This is in contrast to the above-mentioned VA method, wherein the approximation would represent the entire cell. In the three dimensional illustration of , the approximation is represented by a circle  around the diagonal of the cell, whereas the above-mentioned VA file method would produce an approximation that would consist of the entire cube. Thus, it will readily be appreciated that the present method produces more efficient approximations than does the VA file method. In higher dimensions, an approximation in the present invention is a set of points on a hypersphere.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 5-7","FIG. 2","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["36","40"],"sub":["min ","max ","min ","1","2","1 ","2 ","max ","1","2"],"sup":["2","2","1\/2","2","2","1\/2"]},"Without loss of generality, these properties hold for any number of dimensions. In the three dimensional case shown in , the point \u201cA\u201d (representing d), C (representing d), the origin \u201cO\u201d, the point \u201cB\u201d (the endpoint of the query vector q), and the point \u201cD\u201d (the corner of the cell opposite to the origin \u201cO\u201d) all lie in the same plane.","With the above understanding in mind, the logic moves from block  to decision diamond , wherein for the candidate near neighbor under test it is determined whether the corresponding minimum distance dis greater than the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q) between the query vector q and the data vectors p in an initially null answer set. The distance k\u2212NN(q) is initialized at an appropriate large value. This test can be thought of as a coarse test, which, if positive, leads to the immediate elimination of the candidate at block . The next candidate is retrieved at block , and the logic loops back to decision diamond  to test the next candidate.","On the other hand, if the candidate passes the test at decision diamond , indicating that the candidate might be a k-nearest neighbor, the candidate is added to a candidate set at block . Then, the candidate's maximum distance is compared to the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q) at decision diamond , and if the candidate's maximum distance is equal to or greater than the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q), the logic loops back to block  to retrieve the next candidate for test.","In contrast, if the candidate's maximum distance is less than the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q), indicating that the candidate is probably one of the \u201ck\u201d near neighbors being sought, the data vector p that corresponds to the candidate is added to an answer set \u201cknn\u201d at block . The answer set \u201cknn\u201d can be ordered by distance between the query vector q and each data vector p in the set. Then, at block  the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q) is potentially recomputed by setting it equal to the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q) corresponding to the kvector p in the answer set.","After the logic of , it will be appreciated that all candidate approximations have been tested, and most have been eliminated. In other words, most data points have been filtered out. Those that remain have been added to the candidate set, and the \u201cbest\u201d of the candidates in the candidate set (as indicated by having a relatively small d) have been added to the answer set. The next stage of the logic is then commenced at block , wherein the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q) is set equal to the maximum distance of the p vectors in the answer set \u201cknn\u201d. Then, a DO loop is entered at block  wherein the actual data points represented by the candidates in the candidate set are scanned in increasing order of distance. The next candidate is retrieved at block , and at decision diamond  the distance between the data vector p under test and the query vector q is compared to the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q). If it is not less than k\u2212NN(q), the logic loops back to block  to retrieve the next candidate in the candidate set. On the other hand, if the candidate passes the test at decision diamond , it is inserted into the answer set \u201cknn\u201d at block , and the k-largest distance k\u2212NN(q) is recomputed at block . The next candidate is then retrieved at block  for test. Owing to the ordering by distance in the candidate set and answer set, the logic can end when the lower bound dof a candidate is encountered which exceeds the k-th distance k\u2212NN(q), such that not all candidates in the candidate set need be tested.","A pseudocode representation (with comments) of the logic of  is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"329pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Algorithm k_NN_Search (q: vector, k: integer)"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\/\/ Variables used in the algorithm"},{"entry":"\/\/ k-NN(q): the k-th largest distance between the query vector q and the vectors p encountered"},{"entry":"so far"},{"entry":"\/\/ N: the number of vectors in the database"},{"entry":"\/\/ knn: answer list to maintain the nearest k vectors encountered so far and their distances to the"},{"entry":"query vector q"},{"entry":"\/\/ cand_list: min heap to maintain the candidate set"},{"entry":"\/\/ c: a candidate to insert into the cand_list"},{"entry":"\/\/ c.oid: identifier assigned to uniquely identify the candidate c."},{"entry":"\/\/ nn: a near neighbor to insert into the knn"},{"entry":"\/\/ MAX: a value that exceeds the possible largest distance between any two points within the"},{"entry":"database."},{"entry":"\/\/ Stage 1"},{"entry":"\/\/ The primary purpose of this stage is to build the cand_list for stage 2.
