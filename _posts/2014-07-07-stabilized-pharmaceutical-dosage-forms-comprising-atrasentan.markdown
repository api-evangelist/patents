Among the challenges in developing such dosage forms are the low atrasentan dose required for the dosage form, the narrow therapeutic window for treating patients, the inherent chemical instability of atrasentan in the presence of moisture and many common excipients, and the safe handling requirements due to the potency of atrasentan. The stabilized solid dosage forms of the present disclosure, however, overcome such challenges and allow for the use of a broader range of excipients (e.g., metal-ion containing excipients such as magnesium stearate), packaging configurations (e.g., blister packs), and manufacturing conditions (e.g., wet granulation).","The low dosing and the narrow therapeutic window for atrasentan have been confirmed through analysis of the data collected from recent Phase IIb clinical trials in subjects with diabetic nephropathy. These Phase IIb clinical trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of atrasentan to identify an appropriate balance between the systemic effects of atrasentan (which can lead to adverse side effects such as edema) and the efficacy effects of atrasentan. Analysis of the clinical data resulted in a finding that for the subjects tested a daily dose of atrasentan less than about 0.25 mg generally was sub-therapeutic while a daily dose greater than about 1.25 mg generally resulted in an increase in adverse effects, particularly peripheral edema, without any further improvement in efficacy relative to the 1.25 mg daily dose. Within this narrow therapeutic window (about 0.25 mg to about 1.25 mg daily), atrasentan was found to significantly reduce residual albuminuria and the urinary-albumin-to-creatine ratio in the subjects studied. Reduction of residual albuminuria and the urinary-albumin-to-creatine ratio are surrogate endpoints generally associated with delaying the progression of end-stage renal disease and associated cardiovascular complications.","As noted above, atrasentan will degrade in the presence of many common excipients. It is believed that hydrolysis, particularly acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, and oxidation are the primary degradation pathways for atrasentan in low-dose, non-stabilized solid dosage forms. It is further believed that the primary degradation products of atrasentan in low-dose, non-stabilized solid dosage forms are the diol, pyrrolidine acid, and N-oxide shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"127.93mm","wi":"63.84mm","file":"US09364458-20160614-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The diol and pyrrolidine acid are believed to form through acid-catalyzed hydrolysis while the N-oxide is believed to form through an oxidative mechanism. Degradation of atrasentan generally is exacerbated as acidity, moisture content, and metal ion content (such as Na, Mg, and Ca) increase in the dosage form or in the specific components of the dosage form. The incompatibility of atrasentan with metal ions is believed to be due to the metal ions catalyzing an oxidation reaction and\/or forming a complex with atrasentan.","The low dosing, potent nature, and chemical instability of atrasentan further increase the difficulty of developing a suitable process for the preparation of the dosage form. A suitable process generally will ensure, inter alia, that atrasentan can be safely handled during the preparation of the dosage form and that dose-to-dose content uniformity can be maintained. One potential approach is to dissolve or disperse the atrasentan in a liquid vehicle (such as water) during processing to minimize the generation of airborne dust and the associated risk of operator exposure to the drug. Dissolving or dispersing the atrasentan in a liquid vehicle during processing also can assist with maintaining suitable dose-to-dose content uniformity for the dosage form. The chemical instability of atrasentan in the presence of water coupled with the decreased chemical stability normally associated with solution state chemistry, however, raises potential concerns that use of a process employing a liquid vehicle to prepare the atrasentan dosage form (such as a process comprising a wet granulation step in which atrasentan is wet granulated with the other excipients during the preparation of the dosage form) may not result in an acceptable final dosage form.","Applicants have discovered stable solid pharmaceutical dosage forms comprising atrasentan, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, that overcome these challenges. In general, the dosage forms comprise a stabilizing amount of an anti-oxidant; a stabilizing amount of a polymeric binder; or a first amount of an anti-oxidant and a second amount of a polymeric binder wherein the first amount and the second amount together provide a stabilizing effect.

In another aspect, the dosage form comprises a first amount of L-cysteine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof; a second amount of a hydroxymethylpropyl-cellulose; and the first amount and the second amount together provide a stabilizing effect. In further aspects, the process for preparing the dosage form comprises a wet granulation step wherein a liquid mixture comprising the atrasentan, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the polymeric binder is prepared and used as a granulating agent during the wet granulation step.","A.

degradation products over a six month period at the 40\u00b0 C. and 75% relative humidity storage conditions for the 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg tablets.","A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of an anti-oxidant on preventing atrasentan degradation in a mixture of atrasentan, a disintegrant, and an anti-oxidant. Binary or tertiary mixtures containing atrasentan monohydrochloride, a crospovidone disintegrant (POLYPLASDONE\u2122 XL), and, for the tertiary mixtures, an anti-oxidant (selected from ascorbic acid powder, sodium metabisulfite, and L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate) at five different molar ratios of atrasentan to anti-oxidant were prepared. In each case, the weight ratio of disintegrant to atrasentan was held constant at about 9:1. The compositions of the mixtures are shown below in Table 3-A (ascorbic acid powder), Table 3-B (sodium metabisulfite), and Table 3-C (L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate). The mixtures were not further formulated (i.e., they were not processed into tablets or capsules) and were maintained as loose blends of the components during storage. To ensure that content non-uniformity for a single mixture did not impact the results, several mixtures were prepared for each molar ratio tested and a different mixture was sampled and tested at each time point.","The mixtures were tested for stability using an accelerated stability testing protocol under which each sample was stored in a 20 mL glass scintillation vial at 80\u00b0 C. and ambient relative humidity. Stability was assessed at initiation of testing, the end of seven days, and the end of three weeks. Stability testing results are reported below in Tables 3-A through 3-F. All data reported represent single values from single runs (i.e., n=1). The \u201cImpurities\u201d data reported below in Tables 3-A through 3-C represent the percent impurities by HPLC peak area percent. The \u201cWeight % Atrasentan\u201d data reported below in Tables 3-D through 3-F represent the weight percent of atrasentan measured relative to the corresponding weight of atrasentan initially added

general, the stability data for the Phase IIb tablets indicate that L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate provides the greatest stabilizing effect of the three anti-oxidants, an interesting result given the relative oxidation reduction potentials (\u201cORP\u201d) of the three anti-oxidants. Atrasentan has an ORP value greater than about 900 mV. Ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, and L-cysteine have ORP values of about 100-280 mV, about 175-300 mV, and about 815-965 mV, respectively. Although L-cysteine has an ORP value that is relatively close to the ORP value of atrasentan (indicating the least oxidative reactivity of the anti-oxidants tested with respect to atrasentan), it still provided the greatest stabilizing effect.","A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of molar ratio of atrasentan to L-cysteine on atrasentan degradation in uncoated tablets comprising L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, but otherwise substantially the same as the tablet core composition described in Table 2-B of Example 2.

Although the primary PXRD pattern for all suspensions after 30 minutes and 6 hours at either room temperature or 40\u00b0 C. still corresponded to the PXRD pattern for the atrasentan Form II polymorph, the PXRD pattern for the samples obtained from the suspensions without HPMC indicated partial conversion of the atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at both room temperature and 40\u00b0 C. A higher level of conversion was seen for the suspensions without HPMC stored at 40\u00b0 C. The PXRD pattern for the samples obtained from the suspensions with HPMC stored at room temperature showed no conversion of the atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at any timepoint.

Prior to lyophilization of the filtrate, the pH of the suspension was measured. The average pH was 1.8 for filtrates from suspensions containing no HPMC and 2.2 for suspensions with HPMC. The pH for each sample remained consistent, regardless of time or temperature. The freeze-dried filtrates were submitted for solid-state NMR analysis to determine if any chemical interaction between HPMC and atrasentan could be observed, but the sample concentrations were too dilute for analysis.","The results indicate that the presence of HPMC in the suspension: (a) slows and possibly prevents the conversion of atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at room temperature, and (b) slows the conversion of atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at 40\u00b0 C.","Wet granulation blends prepared as described in Method 2 (atrasentan added dry to granulation bowl) and Method 3 (atrasentan added as HPMC suspension to granulation bowl) of Example 6 were analyzed prior to compression using inverse gas chromatography (\u201cIGC\u201d) to determine the surface energy of the blends.

The mixture of atrasentan monohydrochloride\/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was added slowly to water (9.4 kg) with stirring to form a suspension. The suspension was cooled to 12\u00b0 C. and the cooled suspension was mixed for three cycles under the following mixing conditions: two minutes of high shear mixing using an agitator and homogenizer at 100% of the maximum speed followed by 120 minutes of mixing using the agitator only at 100% of the maximum speed. The suspension was mixed for an additional nine hours at 12\u00b0 C. using the agitator at 100% of the maximum speed. L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (0.216 kg) was added to the suspension with stirring. The suspension was mixed for an additional 20 minutes using an agitator at 100% of the maximum speed and then heated to 20\u00b0 C.","The intragranular excipients lactose monohydrate (90.61 kg), a second portion of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Hypromellose E5, 2.16 kg), crospovidone (POLYPLASDONE\u2122 XL, 3.5 kg), and a first portion of silicon dioxide (SYLOID\u00ae, 0.25 kg) were added to a single pot processor and blended for 10 minutes at 10 RPM. The intragranular excipients were then blended for an additional five minutes at 102 RPM. The atrasentan suspension prepared as described above was then added to the single pot processor at an average rate of 3.8 kg\/minute while the contents of single pot processor were mixed at 102 RPM. Rinse water (7.6 kg) was added to the suspension vessel and the rinse water was then transferred to the single pot processor at an average rate of 3.8 kg\/minutes while the contents of the single pot processor were mixed at 102 RPM.","The resulting granulation mixture was wet-massed with high shear mixing for 30 seconds to one minute to an achieved target power end point (6.3 kW). The granulation mixture was dried under vacuum at less than 15 mbar with the single pot processor bowl and lid temperature maintained at 75\u00b0 C. until a loss on drying moisture measurement of 0.7% to 1.8% was achieved. The granulation mixture was milled using a COMIL\u00ae to achieve a target particle size distribution of 250 \u03bcm (d90) and 100 \u03bcm (d50).","The extragranular excipients glycerol behenate (COMPRITOL\u00ae, 1.5 kg) and a second portion of silicon dioxide (SYLOID\u00ae, 0.25 kg) were added to the single pot processor and the extragranular excipients and milled granulation mixture were blended for 10 minutes at 10 RPM. The blend was compressed to prepare tablet cores having a weight of 120 mg and a hardness greater than or equal to 40 N. An aqueous solution containing 9.7% HPMC and 0.3% Polyethylene Glycol 1450 was prepared for use as a tablet coating solution.
