{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to a method and apparatus for the releasable latching of a water vessel to a line.","Larger parent ships often recover smaller surface water vessels, such as manned or unmanned surface water vessels (USVs). Once recovered by the parent ship, servicing operations on the smaller vessels may be performed. Typically, the recovery of a smaller vessel is accomplished by driving the smaller vessel alongside a stationary parent ship and lifting the smaller vessel by davit into the parent ship. Alternatively, the smaller water vessel may be driven up a ramp into the larger ship.","Traditional methods of capturing smaller surface water vessels can cause damage to the hull of the smaller vessel. For example, some USVs weigh about 20,000 pounds or more, and are made from materials such as aluminum and the like. A capturing method that for example, requires the USV to be driven into a parent ship in an uncontrolled manner can cause damage to the hull, resulting in expensive repairs and loss of operation. Similarly, smaller vessels may incur damage when driven alongside a parent ship prior to being lifted onto the ship.","In one aspect, the invention is a device for releasably capturing a line for the recovery of a water vessel. In this aspect, the device includes a housing having a line-capturing notch. The line-capturing notch has a top lip portion and a lower lip portion. The device further includes a hinged guide arm for guiding a line within the housing, the hinged guide arm pivotally connected to the housing wherein the hinged guide arm is pivotable between a stowed position and a deployed position. In the deployed position the guide arm forms a continuous extension of the lower lip portion. According to the invention, the device includes a latching mechanism within the housing for latching the line within the housing.","In another aspect, the invention is a water vessel for releasably capturing a line. The water vessel has a hull body having a bow end and a stern end. In this aspect, a line-capturing device is attached to the hull body at the bow end. The line-capturing device has a housing having a line-capturing notch, the line-capturing notch having a top lip portion and a lower lip portion. In this aspect, the line-capturing device further includes a hinged guide arm for guiding a line within housing, the hinged guide arm pivotally connected to the housing. The hinged guide arm is pivotable between a stowed position and a deployed position, and in the deployed position the guide arm forms a continuous extension of the lower lip portion. The line-capturing device further includes a latching mechanism within the housing for latching the line within the housing.","In another aspect, the invention is a method of releasably capturing a line in open water. The method includes the providing of a water vessel on the open water, the water vessel having a hull body having a bow end and an aft end. In this aspect, the water vessel includes a line-capturing device having a housing attached to the hull body at the bow end. The method further includes the presenting of a line in the body of water, the directing of the water vessel, bow-first, towards the line, and the guiding of the line into the line-capturing device. In this aspect, the method further includes the latching of the line within the housing of the line-capturing device.","In yet another aspect, the invention is a water vessel for capturing a line. The water vessel includes a hull body having a stern end and a bow end. The bow end of the hull body comprises a step cutout bordered by a surrounding bow surface. The step cutout has a first substantially triangular bow surface within the hull body, and a second substantially triangular bow surface within the hull body.","In another aspect, the invention is a system for towing a smaller water vessel to a parent vessel. The system includes a parent vessel having an attached line extending from the parent vessel, and a smaller water vessel having a line-capturing device. In this aspect, the line-capturing device includes a housing having a line-capturing notch. The notch has a top lip portion and a lower lip portion. The line-capturing device also includes a hinged guide arm for guiding a line within housing. The hinged guide arm is pivotally connected to the housing, at which the hinged guide arm is pivotable between a stowed position and a deployed position. In the deployed position the guide arm forms a continuous extension of the lower lip portion. In this aspect, the line-capturing device further includes a latching mechanism within the housing at the line-capturing notch, wherein the latching mechanism clamps the line thereby attaching the smaller water vessel to the parent vessel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1D","FIG. 1D"],"b":["100","100","90","90","100","101","101","90","101","90","94","10","90","88","88","90"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1C","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","100","114","116","100","110","114","116","114","116","114","116","101","100","114","116","101","100","100","112","114","116","110","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIGS. 1A-1C","FIG. 1B"],"b":["100","111","113","101","111","113","110","112","100","101","300","100","300","100","130","114","116","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1E","FIG. 1D"],"b":["101","100","101","101","105","107","100","105","100","140","105","94","90","100","101"]},"In order to provide a proper fit, the first and second planar surfaces  and  of device  have shapes and dimensions that match mating cutout surfaces  and  shown in .

With respect to the attachment at point , the attachment element, such as the pivot pin extends all the way through to inner housing plates  and .

Depending on the positioning of the release lever , an inner guide roller  meshes with the camming surface .  shows the inner guide roller  engaged at the camming surface . In this position, the release lever  is prevented from rotating forward in the Ydirection, and holds the pawl  in a position so that gravitational forces bear down on the pawl  maintaining the pawl  in the latched position.","In operation, as stated above, the pawl  is predisposed under the forces of gravity to be in a position that enables latching, as shown in . The pawl  relies on gravity and the force of the line  for its actuation. When a line  such as a cable or rope or the like is scooped up by the guide arm , the line  enters the inner housing at the substantially V-shaped notch  where the line  contacts the pawl . When the pawl  engages the line , the pawl is displaced upwards, rotating around the first pivot pin at  until the line  can pass between the lower edge of the pawl  and the lower lip region  of the housing directly below the pawl . After the line  passes under the pawl , the pawl  is returned to the latched position by the force of its own weight. Subsequent to latching, an operator may actuate the biasing arrangement  via the actuator  and the controller , which then pivots the biased link downwards in a counterclockwise direction in the Rarc, allowing the forward end of the release lever  at  to rotate upwards in a clockwise direction in arc Rabout pivot point . When this happens, the pawl  moves together with the release lever  enabling the pawl  to release the line .","Energy to accomplish the release of the line  is supplied by the line  itself. If there is no tension in the line , then the pawl  and release lever  will not be rotated as described above, and the line  will not be released from the device, even though the actuator  prepares the pawl  to release the line . Thus, a slack line  will not be released. This is desirable because a slack line  if released may be run over by the parent or host vessel that extends the line  for receiving the vessel carrying the device .
