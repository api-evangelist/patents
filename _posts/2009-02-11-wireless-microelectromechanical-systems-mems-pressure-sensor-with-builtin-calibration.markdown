Field of the Invention","The invention relates to the field of mechanical devices and is more particularly, but not by way of limitation, directed to a wireless microelectromechanical systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d) Pressure Sensor with built-in calibration.","2. Description of the Related Art","MEMS micro pressure sensors are employed in a number of important applications. For example, MEMS pressure sensors may be used in automotive applications where they may monitor the pressure of fuel lines, exhaust gases, tires, and seats. These sensors may also be employed in implantable medical applications and may be used to measure ocular or cranial pressure.","These sensors may have to be periodically re-calibrated in order for the sensors to remain accurate. Traditionally, a sensor may be calibrated by applying a known pressure to the pressure sensor. The output of the pressure is measured and is compared with the value of the known pressure. This calibration information may then be used to correct subsequent readings. This traditional method may be labor intensive and costly, and may prevent MEMS pressure sensors from be employed in remote applications.","For at least the limitations described above there is a need for a wireless microelectromechanical system (\u201cMEMS\u201d) pressure sensor with a built-in calibration.","Pressure sensors are used in numerous applications to monitor and control the pressure of air, gas, fluid and vapor. To reliably measure absolute pressure, a pressure sensor must be calibrated.

In a three chamber subsystem, the upper chamber  may be a \u201cdummy chamber\u201d whose sole purpose it to provide a respite from external pressures for diaphragms  and , or it can be similar or identical to the lower chamber . However, other configurations of the subsystem, including mechanical structures with only two chambers, or with more than three chambers, could be implemented in the spirit of the invention.

Lower chamber , center chamber  and the upper chamber  make up integrated sensor\/actuator subsystem . It may be noted that upper chamber  may be, as here, called a \u201cdummy structure.\u201d Despite being referred to as a \u201cdummy structure,\u201d when present upper chamber  serves the purpose of separating diaphragm , which is coupled to secondary actuator , from the external portion of the component and is designed to minimize the offset. One of ordinary skill in the art of pressure sensor design will be aware that integrated sensor\/actuator subsystem  could be designed with a different number of sensor arrays than the two illustrated in , but  demonstrates at least one embodiment of the invention.","As illustrated in , center chamber  may be filled with a pressurized medium for which the sensor is to determine the pressure. The pressure of the medium acting on diaphragm  is transferred to the mechanical structure in lower chamber , in which sensor arrays (primary actuator)  and  reside. It should be noted that a secondary actuator  may be included in a center or other chamber of center chamber  to counter balance the constant pressure in center chamber  during calibration in one or more embodiments of the invention.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, frame  supports sensing component . As the pressure of the gas acts upon diaphragm , diaphragm  flexes and exerts a force onto frame  and urges frame  against the lowermost surface of lower chamber . As frame  moves towards the lowermost surface of lower chamber , sensing component  may be pressed against input inter-digital transducer  and output inter-digital transducer . Input inter-digital transducer  and output inter-digital transducer  may act as fulcrums or pivot points. As the outer most portions of sensing component  is pressed toward the lowermost surface of lower chamber , the innermost portion of sensing component  flexes away from the lowermost surface of lower chamber . In one or more embodiments of the invention, the sensing component will forced to form a pure-bending condition. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the frame may be pressed against a vertical surface, an upper surface, or a surface with any orientation for example.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the sensing component  may act as a deformable beam in a pure bend condition with no or insignificant shear forces between the input inter-digital transducer  and output inter-digital transducer .","In one or more embodiments of the invention, frame, sensing component may be fabricated out of a semiconducting material, such as silicon or germanium, for example. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the sensing component  may have a length in the range of approximately 150 micrometers to approximately 250 micrometers.

The acoustic wave is detected by output inter-digital transducer  at step . The signal from output inter-digital transducer  carries the pressure information at step . The primary actuators  and  may be an electrostatic actuator, an electromechanical actuator, a thermal actuator, or an electromagnetic actuator.","At step , if calibration mode is selected (), control moves to step  where inlet value  is closed to cut off the pressurized media source, and outlet valve  is then opened to drain the pressurized medium out of the center chamber. Next, the chamber is drained at step  after outlet valve  is closed so that the pressure in center chamber  is kept constant during calibration. Subsequently, at step , with electrical signals traceable to external standards, the primary electrically-driven actuators of the primary actuators  and  are activated to generate a digitally-controlled force, which may force sensing component  into the pure-bending condition of step , in the same way the pressure of a gas to be measured may do so when following the method of sensing mode . Steps  to  are completed in a similar fashion for calibration mode  as they were for sensing mode , and the RF output signal contains the information on the pressure measurement for a known pressure, thus creating calibration data. Thus, the calibration mode creates an IDT output just as does sensing mode , but does so for a known pressure.","The pre-established correlation between the force-induced phase shift of calibration mode  and the pressure-induced phase shift of sensing mode  in a given RF signal may then be used by a remote system to compute calibration data for the integrated sensor.
