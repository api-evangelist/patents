{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. National Stage Filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 from International Application No. PCT\/US2011\/067943, filed on Dec. 29, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments pertain to network-based communications. Some embodiments relate to the use of chat or messaging protocols to create network-based connections.","An employee or worker may have a broad, multifaceted role in a business or corporation. The worker may belong to several different collaborative teams and may be one of any number of members on the team. In some cases, these teams may have overlapping membership and goals. Additionally, each team may have multiple shared documents upon which the team may collaborate.","Collaborative teams may create a logistical challenge for each worker on the team. For example, it may be difficult for a worker to keep track of the various teams of which the worker may be a member, including keeping track of the worker's role, other team members, deliverables, etc. Additionally, it may be difficult to ensure that each worker is working from the most up-to-date content or document and is able to find any relevant resources needed.","Typically, collaborative work may be managed via technologies that use local and cloud-based services to try to address user needs. Current technologies may create a patchwork of ad-hoc Internet sites and applications which provide marginal productivity gains. Furthermore, because these current technologies are typically proprietary, it may be difficult to create a common ground for various applications from different vendors to allow these applications to work together in a useful way.","The following description and the drawings sufficiently illustrate specific embodiments to enable those skilled in the art to practice them. Other embodiments may incorporate structural, logical, electrical, process, and other changes. Portions and features of some embodiments may be included in, or substituted for, those of other embodiments. Embodiments set forth in the claims encompass all available equivalents of those claims.","Several of the embodiments described herein provide techniques for creating and managing collaborative working teams using a team management module or a team management logic unit. In example embodiments, a collaborative team may be created by creating an association between team members and the collaborative documents belonging to the collaborative team. In some embodiments, a team member on a particular team may also be a member of any number of other teams. The associations between teams and team members may be mapped and used for efficient project management. In some embodiments, the collaborative team may be created upon the creation of an initial meeting of the team. For example, a team leader may send a meeting invitation to members of the team to begin work on a team project associated with the team. The association between team members may be created via the creation of the meeting invitation sent to members of the team.","In some embodiments, each team may be associated with one or more collaborative team documents related to a team project. These documents may be created using any software application, herein referred to simply as \u201capplication.\u201d for the creation of any kind of document, such as, e.g., a spreadsheet document, a word processing document, a presentation document, etc. Each document that is related to the team project may be associated with the members of the team. In some embodiments, the team management module may allow members of the team to simultaneously modify a collaborative team document in a manner such that each member of the team is notified of changes made by other team members and provided an up-to-date version of the document.","In some embodiments, the team management module may utilize an infrastructure that is based on a chat or messaging protocol. This infrastructure may allow for the organization and management of links between team members and documents, as well as simultaneous modifications made to a document by one or more team members.","For example,  depicts an exemplary collaborative team environment  through which the creation and management of a team and its documents may be performed. The collaborative team environment may include a team management module  in communication with one or more team member platforms (, , , and ) having one or more applications . The collaborative team environment may be in communication with the one or more team member platforms (, , , and ) via any type of communication network.","The one or more applications  of each team member platform , , , and  may be any application that a team member may use to perform any task. For example, these applications  may include a spreadsheet application, a word processing application, a presentation application, a calendar or meeting application, an Internet browser, an email application, a chat application, etc. Each team member platform , , , and  may include any number and type of application . In some embodiments, the applications  may be in communication with one another such that activity by a team member within one application may impact activity within another application.","The team member platforms , , , and  in communication with the team management module  may represent platforms of a member or worker on a collaborative team. In some embodiments, these team member platforms , , , and  may be a machine (e.g., computer) having applications through which a team member may work on any team project. For example, the team member platforms , , , and  may be workstations on which a user may create and\/or modify a collaborative team document using an application . The collaborative team environment  may have any number of team member platforms , , , and . For example, a team having four team members may include four team member platforms, which the team management module  may associate with one another and manage. Additionally, the team management module  may manage any number of teams having any number of team member platforms associated with each team.","In some embodiments, the team management module  may be implemented in any manner (e.g., hypertext markup language (HTML)). In one embodiment, the team management module  may be implemented using HTML, such that the team management module  may be platform independent and may operate via any operating system. The team management module  may use a chat or messaging protocol to create collaborative connections between each team member (and team member platforms) as well as between applications  of each team member platform, allowing these entities to communicate information such as, e.g., each entity's state, changes to documents made by team members, requests or transactions for harmonizing interactions, etc. The chat or messaging protocol may be any chat or messaging protocol (e.g., extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP)). The chat protocol allows the team management module  to monitor and manage connections as well as creation and modification of team documents. In some embodiments, the chat protocol allows for the creation of a data file containing information, such as information about modifications made to a document by team members, when each modification was made and by whom, sources of the content in the document, etc. Because the data file created via the chat protocol concisely describes modifications to a document, the updating of team member documents may be efficient. Furthermore, using the chat infrastructure may allow platform-agnostic team collaboration.","In some embodiments, the applications  may be part of a suite of applications that include the team management module . In some embodiments, the team management module  may be a third-party application capable of managing documents via an application programming interface (API) or a plug-in or add-on for applications , such as applications in Microsoft Office\u2122, which was developed by Microsoft\u2122, Inc. of Redmond, Wash.","In some embodiments, a collaborative working team may be dynamically defined via a calendar entry made using a calendar application, which may be one of the applications . This may be useful since calendar applications may contain contact information for people within an organization and may be used to schedule meetings with other people. For example, a team may meet regularly at a particular time and date with a set of team members attending the meetings. These meetings may be defined by a calendar entry for this meeting, with each of the team members being dynamically associated with the calendar entry and thus dynamically defining the team for a particular project related to the meetings. In some embodiments, the team may have a hierarchy of team members being defined by the calendar entry (e.g., team leader, section leaders, etc.). The team members of the team (or a subset of the hierarchy or members of the team) may be linked via a common chat server list which allows these team members to share a virtual network with one another used for communications, collaborations, document state sharing, etc.","In some embodiments, documents associated with a team may be opened by one or more team members during a team meeting, such as a team meeting specified by a calendar entry of each team member. These documents may be documents distributed to the team prior to the team meeting. During the team meeting, the chat infrastructure of the team management module  may examine the team members attending the meeting as well as documents opened by the team members during the meeting on the team member platforms. Common documents opened on team members' platforms may be identified automatically and associated with the team and the team members. In some embodiments, the team management module  may determine that a particular document is used more frequently by a particular subset of the plurality of team members and may define that subset of team members as a core group of team members to the team.","In some embodiments, these common documents may be identified by the team members themselves and tagged as being associated with the team, either before or after distribution of the document. In some embodiments, documents common to the team may be stored in a designated location. In some embodiments, these identified files and\/or folders may be highlighted by team members as being associated with the team. The metadata for these files and\/or folders may be associated with one or more calendar entries associated with the team, and the files and\/or folders themselves may be tagged as being associated with the one or more calendar entries as well. For example, a document may include a metadata tag indicating calendar information, project title, team members, optional attendees for a meeting, etc.","In some embodiments, the metadata for documents common to the team may be used to search for similar content and information on the collaborative team environment  (e.g., content from other projects). For example, a search for similar existing content from one project may result in material that may be used to advance the progress of another project. Additionally, in some embodiments, each document may have weighed values associated with the metadata tag of the document. These weighed values may be based on frequency of use, particular individual sections of the document used most frequently, age of the document, etc. These weighed values may be used to determine the importance and\/or relevance of the document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","130"]},"In operation , the team management module may use the information in the request to define the team. The team may be defined by information such as scheduled meeting times and places, team members, leaders, project title, business departments associated with the project, etc.","In operation , the team management module may also use the information in the request to associate the appropriate documents with the team defined in operation . In some embodiments, the association of these documents may be stored in memory at the team management module. In some embodiments, team members may be able to access this information to change associations of documents to a team or to add additional documents to be associated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","105","110","115","120","125"]},"When a team member modifies a working copy, a data file may be modified accordingly. The data file may be associated with the working copy on the team member's platform and may contain a list of modifications made to a document since the document was initially created. The data file may include information about modifications made to the document, including any modifications made by team members, sources for content modified (e.g., other documents on the system), etc. In some embodiments, the data file having modification information may resemble a chat file indicating a date, time, an identifier for one or more users, and the chat content from each user.","In some embodiments, the data files may be synchronized using a master clock. This may ensure that the times when modifications were made to copies of a collaborative document are synchronized across team member platforms. In some embodiments, a particular team member platform (e.g., a team leader) may serve as the master platform, and the clock of that platform may be used as the master clock.","When team members' copies of a collaborative document are to be merged, in operation  of , the team management module  may receive data files associated with copies or instances of a collaborative team document from a plurality of team member's platforms. This may include receiving from a first team member platform of a first team member a first data file associated with a first instance of the collaborative team document. The first data file may be a data file for a first instance that is a copy of a collaborative team document and is stored on the first team member's platform. The first data file may include information about modifications made to the first document.","In operation , the team management module  may reconcile the first data file with a master data file. The master data file may include information about modifications made to the collaborative team document by at least a portion of the plurality of team members. The reconciling may include merging and assembling the first data file (and any other data files received from other team members) into the master data file associated with the collaborative team document. In some embodiments, a team member (e.g., a team leader, leader for a particular document section, etc.) may store the master data file on his or her team member platform. In some embodiments, the data files from the plurality of team members may be reconciled to the master data file according to the master clock. That is, modifications made to copies of the collaborative document may be used in the master data file according to relative chronological order. In some embodiments, the modifications may be used in the master data file according to certain preferences, such as priority of team members submitting the modifications, for example. In some embodiments, conflicts between modifications made amongst team members may be highlighted and resolved at a later time. For example, the highlighted conflicts may be resolved by a particular team member or by the team as a whole during a subsequent review of the conflicts.","Once the master data file is reconciled and updated accordingly, the collaborative team document may be updated accordingly using the updated master data file. In some embodiments, the master data file may be pushed to team member platforms. In some embodiments, the master data file may be pulled by the team member platforms. In some embodiments, the updating of local copies of the collaborative team document may occur automatically. Since the master data file contains raw data of changes made to the collaborative team document, updating the collaborative team document may be done quickly.","In operation , the team management module  may modify the master data file based on the reconciling of the first data file with the master data file. The master data file may then be used to update instances of the collaborative team document of the plurality of team members. This may be done by sending a copy of the master data file containing the updated modification information to each of the team member platforms associated with the team. The team member platforms may update their data file using the master data file, which may allow the copy of the collaborative team document stored on the platform to be updated accordingly. In some embodiments, this may occur automatically. This allows the copy of the collaborative team document to be modified based on the changes made, without having to download another copy of the entire collaborative team document.","In some embodiments, authentication and additional security features may be integrated with each team member platform so that documents may reside encrypted on the platform. The additional security may include restricting access to documents to particular team members having an encryption key for the document, automatically closing a document after a period of inactivity, limiting access to a document based on the team platform or user device used to access the document, etc.","In some embodiments, the updating of the data files may occur in or near real-time. That is, each time a team member modifies a document, the data file for that document may be sent to the team management module  and may be used to update the master data file, as well as other team member's data files. In some embodiments, the real-time modifications and updates to the collaborative document may be made during a meeting of the team. Furthermore, because the team management module  operates using a chat infrastructure, in an embodiment, team members may chat with one another via the team member platforms for further collaboration.","In some embodiments, a team leader may be in charge of a team project and may be the responsible party for reconciling modification conflicts. In some embodiments, this responsibility may be passed between members of the team. In some embodiments, a subset of team members may be restricted from certain modification authority. For example, some team members may be restricted from submitting a modification which conflicts with another team member's modifications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","405","410","415","420","425","430"]},"In some embodiments, the data files may be used to generate statistical information about a team member. For example, the data files may be used to track how much a particular team member has contributed to a document by tracking the modifications the team member has made, how long a team member has worked on a document, whether the contributions were original or were derived from other sources on the system, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","500","500","500"]},"Examples, as described herein, may include, or may operate on, logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms. Modules are tangible entities capable of performing specified operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In an example, circuits may be arranged (e.g., internally or with respect to external entities such as other circuits) in a specified manner as a module. In an example, the whole or part of one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware processors may be configured by firmware or software (e.g., instructions, an application portion, or an application) as a module that operates to perform specified operations. In an example, the software may reside (1) on a non-transitory machine-readable medium or (2) in a transmission signal. In an example, the software, when executed by the underlying hardware of the module, causes the hardware to perform the specified operations.","Accordingly, the term \u201cmodule\u201d is understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, specifically configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily (e.g., transitorily) configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a specified manner or to perform part or all of any operation described herein. Considering examples in which modules are temporarily configured, each of the modules need not be instantiated at any one moment in time. For example, where the modules comprise a general-purpose hardware processor configured using software, the general-purpose hardware processor may be configured as respective different modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a hardware processor, for example, to constitute a particular module at one instance of time and to constitute a different module at a different instance of time.","The machine (e.g., computer system)  may include a hardware processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), a hardware processor core, or any combination thereof), a main memory , and a static memory , some or all of which may communicate with each other via an interlink  (e.g., a bus). The machine  may further include a display device , an input device  (e.g., a keyboard), and a user interface (UI) navigation device  (e.g., a mouse).
