{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims priority and contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-069545 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Mar. 14, 2002, and the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a document management apparatus, a document management system, a document management client apparatus, and a document management method.","2. Discussion of the Background","Today, electronic documents are widely used and are generalized. Concurrently with such wide use and generalization of electronic documents, electronic document management systems have drawn attention, and various products and standards for document management systems have been proposed. Such document management systems enable integrally managing, as one document, not only a document file itself, but also a plurality of versions, thumbnails and retrieval indexes thereof.","As a standard of electronic document management systems, the specification of the Document Management Alliance (DMA) is known. The primary object of the DMA is to develop an industry standard specification for document management systems. The DMA provides an API (Application Programming Interface) and a document model for unification of all document management systems. The DMA defines a document not as a simple file but as a more comprehensive model. The details of the DMA specification can be found at in DMA Technical Committee. DMA 1.0 Specification. AIIM International: Silver Spring, Md., 1998 and are known to one of ordinary skill in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100"]},"One document object is constituted of a plurality of versions , . Each version object ,  has properties, e.g., a version number, a creation date, etc. In the example of , two versions exist, version 1.0  and version 2.0 .","One version object is constituted of a plurality of renditions , . A rendition represents a rendering form of a document. For example, in a case of a document created by a word processor, in addition to a document file created by the word processor, a JPEG format image file for a thumbnail, a PDF format file, a text format file, etc. may be conceivable. Each document object includes a plurality of renditions as described above. However, always a primary rendition  exists. The primary rendition  is the one created as the original format of each document, and is the subject file for editing.","One rendition is constituted of a plurality of content elements , . A document is not necessarily constituted of one document file. For example, when a document includes a document file created by a word processor and a spreadsheet file created by a spreadsheet, respective files constitute content elements of the document, according to the DMA document object model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"First, the client calls the document object of the document (which is a report) using a document object ID. The document management apparatus connects the client to the document object of the report, and the document object of the report is returned to the client. Next, the client calls the version 2.0, the document management apparatus connects the client to the version 2.0, and the version 2.0 is returned to the client. Further, the client calls the thumbnail rendition, the document management apparatus connects the client to the thumbnail rendition, and the thumbnail rendition is returned to the client. Finally, the client calls the top content element at the lower level of the thumbnail rendition, the document management apparatus connects the client to the top content element, and the top content element is returned to the client.","In the currently available DMA API according to the DMA specification, each time a user accesses a document that uses the DMA document object model, the process described above with reference to  must be performed. This process is relatively complicated. This causes an application program for accessing the document that uses the DMA document object model to be relatively complicated.","Further, some document management systems do not support version and rendition information. In this case, the DMA API cannot be used.","Furthermore, according to the DMA specification, version, rendition and content element information must be specified. However, some clients might use a simpler document model. For example, a client might not manage version information in a system on the client side. In such a case, when the user accesses a document that uses the DMA specification, the client cannot designate a version of the document, so that the document cannot be accessed.","The present invention has been made in view of the above-discussed and other problems and addresses the above-discussed and other problems.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention allow simplification of an interface for accessing documents that use the DMA document object model.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention also allow a single API to be commonly used in a plurality of systems that use different document models.","Further, the preferred embodiments of the present invention enable accessing documents even when versions of the documents, etc. are not managed in respective systems on the client side.","According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a document management apparatus configured to designate a desired document in a series of documents managed under a DMA document object model, and to make a connection to a desired node in a hierarchical tree-structure of the desired document, is provided.

The document ID is an identifier for uniquely specifying and calling a specific node of a hierarchical tree-structure of a desired document.  is a diagram for explaining the object ID . The object ID is based on the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), structure Request for Comment Document (RFC) 2396. As illustrated in , the character string connecting a URI scheme (http:\/\/), a server name (server), and a route (\/dm) with each other corresponds to a document space (docspace) of the DMA specification. A location of desired document data is specified by this character string of the object ID.","Following the document space, four arguments are designated. The arguments are connected with each other by a symbol \u201c&\u201d.","The argument \u201cdid=\u201d describes a character string identifying a document object designated by the object ID. This argument enables accessing a desired document object.

According to the separated arguments, the document object operating device  specifies an objective document, and sequentially makes connections to nodes in a tree-structure of the objective document constituted of a plurality of hierarchies, which have been specified by the arguments of the object ID.
