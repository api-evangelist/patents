title: Steerable catheter and dilator and system and method for implanting a heart implant
abstract: A catheter according to one embodiment may be configured to extend through a transseptal puncture site, a left atrium, and into a left ventricle. The catheter may comprise a shaft defining at least one lumen configured to receive at least one of an implant and/or a dilator, a first steerable actuator coupled to the shaft at a position on the shaft substantially corresponding to the annulus of the mitral valve when the distal end of the shaft is disposed within the left ventricle, and a handle assembly coupled to a proximal end of the shaft. The handle assembly may comprise a first actuator coupled to the first steerable actuator. The first actuator may be configured to apply a force to the first steerable actuator to deflect the shaft about a region proximate to the first steerable actuator.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686 filed Sep. 12, 2008, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/061,343, filed Jun. 13, 2008, both of which are hereby incorporated fully by reference.","The present disclosure relates to the repair and\/or correction of dysfunctional heart valves, and more particularly pertains to heart valve implants and systems and methods for delivery and implementation of the same.","A human heart has four chambers, the left and right atrium and the left and right ventricles. The chambers of the heart alternately expand and contract to pump blood through the vessels of the body. The cycle of the heart includes the simultaneous contraction of the left and right atria, passing blood from the atria to the left and right ventricles. The left and right ventricles then simultaneously contract forcing blood from the heart and through the vessels of the body. In addition to the four chambers, the heart also includes a check valve at the upstream end of each chamber to ensure that blood flows in the correct direction through the body as the heart chambers expand and contract. These valves may become damaged, or otherwise fail to function properly, resulting in their inability to properly close when the downstream chamber contracts. Failure of the valves to properly close may allow blood to flow backward through the valve resulting in decreased blood flow and lower blood pressure.","Mitral regurgitation is a common variety of heart valve dysfunction or insufficiency. Mitral regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve separating the left coronary atrium and the left ventricle fails to properly close. As a result, upon contraction of the left ventricle blood may leak or flow from the left ventricle back into the left atrium, rather than being forced through the aorta. Any disorder that weakens or damages the mitral valve can prevent it from closing properly, thereby causing leakage or regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation is considered to be chronic when the condition persists rather than occurring for only a short period of time.","Regardless of the cause, mitral regurgitation may result in a decrease in blood flow through the body (cardiac output). Correction of mitral regurgitation typically requires surgical intervention. Surgical valve repair or replacement may be carried out as an open heart procedure. The repair or replacement surgery may last in the range of about three to five hours, and may be carried out with the patient under general anesthesia. The nature of the surgical procedure requires the patient to be placed on a heart-lung machine. Because of the severity\/complexity\/danger associated with open heart surgical procedures, corrective surgery for mitral regurgitation is typically not recommended until the patient's ejection fraction drops below 60% and\/or the left ventricle is larger than 45 mm at rest.","The present disclosure relates to a system and method of implanting a heart implant. For example, the system and method according to one embodiment of the present disclosure may be used to implant a heart valve implant which may suitably be used in connection with the treatment, diagnostics and\/or correction of a dysfunctional or inoperative heart valve. One suitable implementation for a heart valve implant consistent with the present disclosure is the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation. For the ease of explanation, the heart valve implant herein is described in terms of a mitral valve implant, such as may be used in treating mitral valve regurgitation as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/258,828 filed Oct. 26, 2005 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686 filed Sep. 12, 2008, both of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. However, a heart valve implant consistent with the present disclosure may be employed for treating, diagnosing and\/or correcting other dysfunctional or inoperative heart valves. The present disclosure should not, therefore, be construed as being limited to use as a mitral valve implant. In addition, the system and method according to the present disclosure may be used to implant heart implants configured to be used in connection with the treatment, diagnostics and\/or correction of other heart conditions. For example, and without limitation, the system and method consistent with the present disclosure may be used to implant a regurgitation implant configured to induce a controlled regurgitation in a heart valve (such as, but not limited to, a mitral heart valve), for example, in a manner that is generally consistent with advanced disease of the heart. The regurgitation implant may include a regurgitation implant as described in U.S. patent Ser. No. 11\/940,724 filed Nov. 15, 2007 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686 filed Sep. 12, 2008, both of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.","According to one embodiment, a heart implant consistent with the present disclosure may comprise a heart valve implant configured to interact with at least a portion of an existing heart valve to prevent and\/or reduce regurgitation. For example, at least a portion of one or more cusps of the heart valve may interact with, engage, and\/or seal against at least a portion of the heart valve implant when the heart valve is in a closed condition. The interaction, engagement and\/or sealing between at least a portion of at least one cusp and at least a portion of the heart valve implant may reduce and\/or eliminate regurgitation in a heart valve, for example, providing insufficient sealing, including only a single cusp, e.g., following removal of a diseased and\/or damaged cusp, and\/or having a ruptured cordae. A heart valve implant consistent with the present disclosure may be used in connection with various additional and\/or alternative defects and\/or deficiencies.","For the ease of explanation, one embodiment of the system and method consistent with the present disclosure is described in terms of a system and method for implanting a mitral valve implant, such as may be used in treating mitral valve regurgitation. By way of an overview, the system and method may generally comprise placing a guide wire into the left ventricle and advancing a mitral valve implant through a delivery catheter and into the left ventricle. For example, a guide wire may be initially placed into the left atrium of the heart, for example, by way of transseptal puncture of the heart from the right atrium through the fossa ovalis into the left atrium. A dilator may then be advanced along the guide wire to the left atrium and may be passed through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The dilator may include a balloon which may be inflated to facilitate passing the dilator through the mitral valve without damaging the mitral valve or becoming entangled in the mitral valve. A steerable catheter may then be advanced along the dilator into the left ventrical. The steerable catheter may be positioned within the left ventrical to the approximate location in which the implant will be secured. The implant may then be advanced through the steerable catheter and secured to the native cardiac tissue.","Referring now to , a cross-sectional schematic view of a portion of a four chamber heart  is illustrated. The outflow tracts of the right and left ventricles ,  are not shown in order to better illustrate the septum  between the right and left atria , . As shown, the inferior vena cava (IVC)  and superior vena cava (SVC)  communicate with the right atrium  which is separated from the left atrium  by the intra-atrial septum . While not a limitation of the present disclosure, it is may be advantageous to make the transseptal puncture  through the fossa ovalis  since the fossa ovalis  is thinnest portion of the intra-atrial septum .","According to one embodiment consistent with the present disclosure, a guide wire  may be advanced up the IVC  and into the right atrium . The guide wire  may include any guide wire configured to be advanced up the IVC  and into the right atrium . Consistent with one embodiment, the guide wire  may be the same as the delivery guide wire discussed herein; however, the guide wire  may also be separate and distinct from the delivery guide wire. Without limitation, access to the right atrium  may be accomplished by way of the Seldinger wire technique. For example, the right femoral vein (not shown) may be accessed with a hollow needle (not shown) and a guide wire  may be inserted. The needle may be removed and a dilator  may be inserted over the guide wire . The sheath  of a catheter  (such as, but not limited to, a Mullins catheter or the like) having a pre-bent region  proximate the distal tip  of the catheter  may be inserted over the dilator . The sheath , dilator , catheter  and guide wire  may then be advanced up the IVC  through the opening  into the right atrium  as generally illustrated in .","With the sheath , dilator , catheter  and guide wire  in the right atrium , access to the left atrium  may be achieved by transseptal puncture  from the right atrium  through the intra-atrial septum . For example, at least a portion of the guide wire  may be advanced out of the distal tip  of the dilator , sheath  and\/or catheter  as generally shown in . According to an embodiment, the guide wire  may be at least partially advanced into the SVC  as generally illustrated in  and the distal tip  of the catheter  may then be at least partially advanced along the guide wire  into the SVC  as generally illustrated in . Because the SVC  is a thin-walled vein, it may be advantageous to place the guide wire  in the SVC  and then advance the catheter  along the guide wire  since the spring-tipped atraumatic guide wire  reduces the potential for damaging the SVC  compared to the catheter  and dilator .","With the distal tip  at least partially received in the SVC , the guide wire  may be retracted into the dilator  and the catheter  may be retracted (i.e., pulled downward) such that the pre-bent portion  of the sheath  facilitates guiding the distal tip  to the fossa ovalis  as generally illustrated in . For example, using one or more visualization techniques (such as, but not limited to, intracardiac echo (ICE), fluoroscopy, and the like), the sheath  may be retracted proximally, dragging the distal tip  along the intra-atrial septum  until the distal tip  is positioned proximate to the fossa ovalis . Optionally, the position of the sheath  relative to the fossa ovalis  may be confirmed by gently pushing the sheath  distally against the intra-atrial septum  to \u201ctent\u201d the fossa ovalis  as generally illustrated in . The \u201ctenting\u201d of the fossa ovalis  may be seen on ICE, fluoroscopy or the like.","With the distal tip  proximate and\/or contacting the fossa ovalis , the guide wire  may be removed from the catheter  and a transseptal needle  may be advanced through the catheter  towards the distal end  of the catheter  as generally shown in . The position of the catheter  may optionally be confirmed (for example, but not limited to, by \u201ctenting\u201d) and the transseptal needle  may be advanced out of the distal tip  to form a puncture  through the fossa ovalis  and into the left atrium . The sheath , dilator  and catheter  may than be advanced through the puncture  of the fossa ovalis  and into the left atrium  as generally shown in . Once the sheath , dilator  and catheter  are through the fossa ovalis , the needle  may be removed from the catheter  as generally shown in .","With the catheter  in the left atrium , a delivery guide wire  may be advanced through the catheter  until at least a portion of the distal tip  of the delivery guide wire  extends from the distal tip  of the catheter  and into the left atrium  as generally illustrated in . Once the distal tip  of the delivery guide wire  is disposed in the left atrium , the dilator  and the sheath  may be removed, leaving just the delivery guide wire  in the left atrium  as generally illustrated in .","The delivery guide wire  may be used as a guide for advancing other devices into the heart , and ultimately, into the left ventricle . Accordingly to at least one embodiment, the delivery guide wire  may be sufficiently stiff to resist undesirable bending and\/or kinking and to resist undesirable movement of the distal tip . For example, the delivery guide wire  may comprise a stiff, 0.018\u2033 diameter guide wire having a stiffness of approximately 19,900,000 psi. The stiffness of the delivery guide wire  was determined as follows.","When a force is applied to a long thin column, there is no movement of the column until a minimum critical buckling force is achieved, P, then further buckling occurs, though the force does not increase. For a long column of uniform cross-section and length , which buckles under a critical force, P, the following formula applies:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","cr"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"},"mfrac":{"mi":"EI","msup":{"mi":"L","mn":"2"}}}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Where:","n=a constant that is equal to 4 if both ends of the column are clamped and cannot move or rotate.","E=Modulus of elasticity of the material (psi)","I=Moment of inertia (in)\n\nFor a circular cross-section the moment of inertia is:\n"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0054"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c0","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"d","mn":"4"}},"mn":"64"}}}},"br":{},"sub":"cr "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0055"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","cr"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"3"},"mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"Ed","mn":"4"},"mrow":{"mn":"64","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"L","mn":"2"}}}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0056"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"64","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"L","mn":"2"},"msub":{"mi":["P","cr"]}},{"mi":"n","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":[{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"3"},{"mi":"d","mn":"4"}]}]}}}}},"Based on the above, an 8 cm section of the delivery guide wire  was tested and a buckling force of 0.41 lbs. was determined.

In either embodiment, the delivery guide wire  may have a diameter greater than or less than 0.018\u2033.","Turning now to , a dilator  may be advanced over the delivery guide wire  into the left atrium . The dilator  may be configured to pass through the mitral valve  into the left ventricle  without damaging the mitral valve  or becoming entangled in the mitral valve  (for example, the cusps , the chordae and\/or papillary muscles  of the mitral valve ). According to at least one embodiment, the dilator  of the present disclosure may be used to eliminate the rail as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686 filed Sep. 12, 2008. However, it may be appreciated that the system and method disclosed in the present disclosure (and in particular the dilator ) is not inconsistent with the system and method in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686, and as such, the system and method disclosed in the present disclosure (including the dilator ) may be used in conjunction with the system and method in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686.","One embodiment of a dilator consistent with the present disclosure is generally illustrated in . The dilator may include define at least one lumen  configured to receive at least a portion of the delivery guide wire . For example, the lumen  may have an internal diameter of approximately 0.038\u2033. The dilator may also comprise a shaft  including a tapered tip region . The shaft  may comprise a plurality of segments or portions having different stiffness or hardness to produce the desired overall curvature. The shaft  may be formed from one or more suitable polymers such as, but not limited to, a polyether block amide. The shaft  may have a constant inner and\/or outer diameter and may be made from different materials to provide the various stiffness or hardness. Alternatively, or in addition, the shaft  may have different inner and\/or outer diameters and may be made from one or more materials. For example, the various stiffness or hardness of the shaft  may be provided by varying the thickness of the shaft  at the different segments or portions. The different hardness of the segments may provide differing degrees of bending stiffness to the dilator which may facilitate advancing the dilator into and\/or out of the left ventricle .","As shown, the dilator may comprise four different segments , , and . The first segment may be disposed proximate the distal end region . The first segment may optionally include the tapered distal tip  and may have a length of approximately 6 inches. The tapered distal tip  may be provided to facilitate advancing the tip  into the percutaneous puncture site in the groin as the dilator is introduced over the delivery guide wire .","According to at least one embodiment, the first segment may be formed of PEBAX\u2122 3533 having a durometer of 35 D. The second segment may be adjacent to the first segment and may have a length of approximately 1.5 inches. According to at least one embodiment, the second segment may be formed of PEBAX\u2122 2533 having a durometer of 25 D. The third segment may be adjacent to the second segment and may have a length of approximately 2 inches. According to at least one embodiment, the third segment may be formed of PEBAX\u2122 3533 having a durometer of 35 D. The forth segment may be adjacent to the third segment and may have a length of approximately 42.5 inches. According to at least one embodiment, the forth segment may be formed of PEBAX\u2122 7233 having a durometer of 72 D.","It should be understood that the various lengths and hardness described above for the segments -may be adjusted or changed depending upon the circumstances of its intended use. For example, patients with larger and\/or smaller hearts may require one or more of the segments to be harder or softer. An important aspect of the segments -is that the softest segment is the second segment . Also, the second segment is disposed approximately 6 inches from the tapered distal tip . As will be explained herein, the location of the second segment may generally correspond to the of the transseptal puncture site  where the curvature of the dilator may be greatest.","Turning now to , another embodiment of a dilator consistent with the present disclosure is generally illustrated. The dilator  may include a deflectable tip configured to allow the user to bend the distal region  of the dilator . The deflectable tip may facilitate advancement of the dilator through the mitral valve  may allowing the user to generally aim the tip  towards the mitral valve . According to at least one embodiment, the dilator may include a handle assembly  coupled to a proximal end  of the shaft . The shaft may include a plurality of segments, for example, the segments -described above. One or more deflecting wires  may be coupled to the distal end region  of the shaft , for example, as generally illustrated in . The defecting wire  may optionally be disposed in a second lumen  disposed along the length of the shaft . Additional defecting wires  (not shown) may be provided in one or more additional lumens.","The defecting wire  may be coupled to the handle assembly  such that the distal tip may be bent as desired. According to one embodiment, the handle assembly  may include at least one knob, slider or the like  coupled to the defecting wire  such that actuation of the knob  may result in movement of the distal tip . For example, the knob  may be coupled to the defecting wire  and may pull the defecting wire  generally towards the handle assembly  causing the distal tip to bend to one side.","The handle assembly  may also optionally include one or more valves or fittings. For example, the handle assembly  may include a fitting  (such as, but not limited to, a Luer lock fitting or the like) configured to allow the lumen  to be flushed. The handle assembly  may also optionally include a valve  (such as, but not limited to, a hemostasis valve) configured to seal with the delivery guide wire  (not shown).","The lumen  may have various diameters along the length of the shaft . For example, the lumen  may have a smaller diameter proximate the distal tip compared to the remainder of the shaft . The lumen  proximate the tip may be slightly larger than the diameter of the delivery guide wire  (for example, but not limited to, slightly larger than 0.018\u2033) such that the dilator tracks well over the delivery guide wire . The remainder of the lumen  may have a larger diameter configured to reduce drag as the dilator is advanced over the delivery guide wire .","Turning now to , yet another embodiment of a dilator consistent with the present disclosure is generally illustrated. The dilator may comprise an expandable device  (such as, but not limited to a balloon or the like) configured to facilitate advancement of the dilator through the mitral valve  without damaging the mitral valve  or becoming entangled in the mitral valve  (for example, the cusps , the chordae and\/or papillary muscles  of the mitral valve ). The expanding portion  may be disposed proximate the distal end region  of the shaft , for example, substantially adjacent to the tapered tip . The expanding portion  may be fluidly coupled to an expanding medium such as, but not limited to, a gas and\/or liquid which may expand and\/or enlarge the expanding portion  from the deflated or retracted position as generally illustrated in  to the inflated or expanded position as generally illustrated in . According to at least one embodiment, the expanding medium may include carbon dioxide CO2 gas and\/or saline. Optionally, contrast media may be introduced into the expanding portion  to allow the expanding portion  to be more easily visually located using fluoroscopy or the like. The contrast media may coat the inside surface of the expanding portion .","The expanding medium may be introduced through a fitting . According to at least one embodiment, the expanding medium may be coupled to the expanding portion  by way of the lumen as generally illustrated in . As may be appreciated, the delivery guide wire  may be received in the lumen  when the dilator is expanded. The expanding medium may be coupled to the expanding portion  by way of a separate passageway (i.e., a passageway different from the lumen  configured to receive the delivery guide wire ). This passageway may be the same lumen as the steering wire  is housed in, provided there is enough room for the expansion medium to pass around the steering wire.","The expanding portion  may include a resiliently expandable\/collapsible material such as, but not limited to, silicone, Yulex\u2122 or the like which may be selectively collapsed and\/or expanded. The expanding portion  may be bonded to the shaft of the dilator and may include one or more passageways, aperture or lumen  fluidly coupled to the lumen  to allow the expansion medium to expand\/collapse the expanding portion . The diameter of the expanding portion  should be small enough in the first or retracted\/collapsed position to be advanced over the delivery guide wire  to the left atrium  and large enough when in the second or expanded\/inflated position to be advanced through the cusps  and chordae  of the mitral valve  to reduce the potential of damaging the heart  and\/or getting entangled within the mitral valve . For example, the shaft  may have an outer diameter of approximately 0.062\u2033 (e.g., a 5 Fr) and a length of approximately 110 cm or greater. The expanding portion  may diameter of approximately 0.100\u2033 in the first position and a diameter of approximately 15 mm to approximately 20 mm cm in the second position with a length of approximately 8 to approximately 10 mm.","The dilator may optionally include a deflectable tip configured to allow the user to bend the distal region  of the dilator as generally described herein. The dilator may also optionally include one or more radiopaque markers -, for example, disposed about the distal end region . The position markers -may be spaced evenly along the shaft  (such as, but not limited to, approximately 2 cm intervals from the distal tip ) and may be used to verify the position of the dilator and\/or for sizing the implant to be delivered.","While various embodiments of the dilator  consistent with the present disclosure have been described herein, it should be understood that one or more features of any of the various embodiments may be combined with any other embodiment. The dilator  consistent with the present disclosure may have an overall length (i.e., from the distal tip  to the handle assembly  of approximately 145 cm or less. However, the length and\/or the diameter of the dilator  may depend upon the introduction site as well as the intended patient's physiology.","Turning now to , the dilator  may be advanced over the delivery guide wire  proximate to the tip  of the delivery guide wire . The tip  may still extend beyond the tip  of the dilator  to protect the atrial wall from perforation. According to one embodiment, the expanding portion  may be expanded as generally illustrated. The dilator  may aimed generally towards the mitral valve  as generally illustrated in . For example, the tip  may be bent or curved by actuating one or more knobs or the like (not shown) to move one or more deflecting wires as discussed herein. The tip  of the delivery guide wire  may optionally be retracted into the lumen  of the dilator  to increase the flexibility of the distal tip region . The curvature of the dilator  may be confirmed using fluoroscopic and\/or echo guidance techniques or the like. For example, the contrast media and\/or the radiopaque markers may be used.","Turning now to , with the dilator  aimed at the mitral valve  and the expanding portion  inflated, the distal end region  of the dilator  may be advanced through the mitral valve . It should be understood that the dilator  may be advanced through the mitral valve without either the deflectable tip  and\/or the expandable portion ; however, the use of one or more of the deflectable tip  and\/or the expandable portion  may reduce the potential of damaging the heart  and\/or getting entangled within the mitral valve . The second segment of the shaft  may generally correspond to the location of the bend or curve of the dilator  proximate the transseptal puncture site . As may be appreciated, the necessary curvature of the dilator  between the transseptal puncture site  and the left ventricle  is relatively sharp.","The tip  of the delivery guide wire  may be still located inside the lumen  of the dilator  back in the left atrium  generally where it was located in . The dilator  may not yet be aimed or directed at the intended implantation site at this point. Instead, it is only important that the distal end region  of the dilator  is through the mitral valve  without damaging and\/or entangling the cusps  and the chordae\/papillary muscles .","Turning now to , the expandable portion  may be retracted\/deflated and a steerable catheter  may be advanced over the dilator  into the left ventricle  proximate to the distal end region  of the dilator . The steerable catheter  may define at least one lumen  configured receive the dilator  as generally illustrated. The lumen  may also be configured to receive an implant (not shown) such as, but not limited to, a mitral valve implant as generally disclosed in U.S. patent Ser. No. 11\/940,724 filed Nov. 15, 2007 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686 filed Sep. 12, 2008, both of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. The steerable catheter  may also be configured to be selectively curved or bent to facilitate aiming of the distal tip  for securing the implant and\/or facilitate removal of the steerable catheter .","One embodiment of a steerable catheter is generally illustrated in . The steerable catheter may include shaft  defining at least one lumen . The lumen  may be configured to receive the dilator  and\/or an implant (not shown). The shaft  may also include a plurality of segments or portions -having different hardness or stiffness to produce the desired overall curvature.

The different hardness of the segments may provide differing degrees of bending stiffness to the steerable catheter which may facilitate advancing the steerable catheter into and\/or out of the left ventricle  as well as aiming or alignment of the steerable catheter ","As shown, the steerable catheter may comprise three different segments , and . The first segment may be disposed proximate the distal tip . The first segment may optionally include the tapered tip  and may have a length of approximately 8 inches. The tapered tip  may be provided to facilitate advancing the steerable catheter into the percutaneous puncture site in the groin and over the dilator .","According to at least one embodiment, the first segment may be formed of PEBAX\u2122 2533 having a durometer of 25 D and may have a length of approximately 4 to 6 inches. The second segment may be adjacent to the first segment and may have a length of approximately 2.5 inches. According to at least one embodiment, the second segment may be formed of PEBAX\u2122 4033 having a durometer of 40 D. The third segment may be adjacent to the second segment and may have a length sufficiently long to extend beyond the access incision. According to at least one embodiment, the third segment may be formed of PEBAX\u2122 7233 having a durometer of 72 D.","It should be understood that the various lengths and hardness described above for the segments -may be adjusted or changed depending upon the circumstances of its intended use. For example, patients with larger and\/or smaller hearts may require one or more of the segments to be longer or short. An important aspect of the segments -is that the softest segment is the first segment . Also, the second segment is disposed approximately 4 to 6 inches from the distal tip . As will be explained herein, the length of the first segment may generally correspond to the length between the transseptal puncture site  and the implantation site (e.g., the apex) in the left ventricle  where the curvature of the steerable catheter may be greatest.","The steerable catheter may also include a first steering device . The first steering device  may include a pull ring or the like which may be disposed about 1.5-4 inches from the distal end of the tip . The exact length of the first steering device  from the tip  may depend on the size of the patient's heart which may vary quite a bit depending on, among other things, the degree of regurgitation. For example, patients with functional mitral regurgitation often have dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged left ventricle). According to at least one embodiment, the first steering device  may be located 2 inches from the tip .","The steerable catheter may optionally include at least a second steering device . The second steering device  may include a pull ring or the like which may be disposed proximate to the distal end of the tip . The second or more steering devices  may be provided to facilitate curving or bending of the steerable catheter . The first and second steerable devices ,  may be configured to reduce drag during withdrawal and may also facilitate alignment or aiming of the tip  within the left ventricle . The first and second steerable devices ,  may also facilitate advancement of the steerable catheter over the dilator , through the transseptal puncture site , and through the left atrium  and down into the left ventricle .","The first and\/or second steerable devices ,  may be coupled to a handle assembly  which may be disposed about a proximal end  of the shaft . The handle assembly  may include one or more fittings and\/or valves. For example, the handle assembly  may include a valve  (for example, but not limited to, a hemostasis valve or the like) and\/or a fitting  (for example, but not limited to, a luer lock fitting or the like). The handle assembly  may also include one or more actuation devices -(such as, but not limited to, knobs, sliders, or the like) coupled to the first and second steerable devices , . The actuation devices -may be configured to place the first and second steerable devices ,  under tension, therefore causing the shaft  to deflect (e.g., curve or bend). For example, the steerable catheter may include actuation devices -coupled to the first and\/or second steerable devices ,  by way of one or more wires or the like  disposed along at least a portion of the shaft  as generally illustrated in .","By way of example, the actuation devices -may be slide distally and\/or proximally within the handle assembly  to increase or decrease the tension placed on the wires . The tension in the wires  may asymmetrically urge\/pull the first and\/or second steerable devices ,  (e.g., the first and\/or second pull rings) to one side causing the shaft  to defect or curve where the wires  are coupled to the first and\/or second steerable devices , .","Turning now specifically to , the shaft  may optionally include an inner layer  configured to provide a substantially seamless inner surface of the lumen . The inner layer  may also be configured to reduce and\/or minimize surface friction. According to at least one embodiment, the inner layer  may include PTFE or the like. The shaft  may also include another layer  configured to provide the desired stiffness. For example, the layer  may include Pebax\u2122 or the like.","Optionally, the shaft  may include three or more sections configured to provide kink resistance, pushability, and\/or flexibility. For example, the shaft  may include a reinforced section  disposed between the first steering device  and the second steering device . The reinforced section  may be configured to provide increased flexibility, which may facilitate navigating the shaft  to the left ventricle  and configured to provide increased kink resistance. According to at least one embodiment, the reinforced section  may be spiral reinforced and may have a length of 1-3 inches.","The shaft  may also optionally include spiral reinforced section  (as generally illustrated in ). The spiral reinforced section  may extend from the first steering device  towards the handle assembly  for about 7.5 inches. The spiral reinforced section  may be configured to provide kink resistance when deflecting the shaft  using the first and\/or second steerable devices , . As may be appreciated, a kink in the shaft  may reduce the ability of the user to locate the distal tip  within the left ventricle  and may also increase the force needed to push the implant through the lumen  during deployment.","The shaft  may also optionally include a braided reinforced section . The braided reinforced section  may extend from the proximal end of the spiral reinforced section  to the handle assembly . The braided reinforced section  may be configured to increase the pushability and torsional strength of the shaft  while reducing and\/or minimizing kinking. Increasing the pushability and torsional strength and preventing kinking may be important since the length of the shaft  from the groin (where the steerable catheter  may be introduced) to the left ventricle  may be fairly long and involve tortuous anatomy.","Turning now to , the effects of actuating the first and\/or second steerable devices ,  on the shaft  are generally illustrated. For example,  generally illustrates one embodiment of a steerable catheter in which the shaft  is unbiased.  generally illustrates deflection of the distal region . For example, a user may actuate the second actuation device (for example, but not limited to, by sliding the second actuation device generally in the direction of arrow A) causing the second steerable device  to deflect the shaft  in a region  proximate the second steerable device . As may be seen, the second steerable device  may cause the shaft  to deflect and\/or bend in a region  between the second steerable device  and the handle assembly . According to at least one embodiment, the second steerable device  may generally cause the shaft  to deflect and\/or bend in a region  between the second steerable device  and the first steerable device . The second steerable device  may generally cause the shaft  to deflect and\/or bend up to approximately 180 degrees, though angles of curvature greater than 180 degrees are also possible depending on flexibility of the shaft  as well as the effects of the shaft  needing to bend passively to accommodate the patient's anatomy. The radius of the curvature may be 1.0 inches to 2.0 inches, for example, 1.25 inches to 1.75 inches.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["242","218","218","210","206","242","210","210","206","242","210","214","210","206","206","206"],"i":["a ","a "]},"Turning now to , one embodiment generally illustrating the deflecting of both the first and second steering actuators ,  is shown. The first and second steerable devices ,  may generally cause the shaft  to deflect and\/or bend up to approximately 180 degrees, though angles of curvature greater than 180 degrees are also possible depending on flexibility of the shaft  as well as the effects of the shaft  needing to bend passively to accommodate the patient's anatomy. The radius of the curvature may be 1.0 inches to 2.0 inches, for example, 1.25 inches to 1.75 inches, however, the exact range of the radius may depend upon the location of the first and second steerable devices ,  as well as the flexibility of the regions , .","Turning now to , the dilator  has been removed from the steerable catheter  and the implant (not shown) may be advanced through the lumen  proximate to the distal end . By actuating the first steerable actuator , the user may aim and\/or align the distal end segment and\/or distal tip  of the steerable catheter  to the desired location within the left ventricle  where it is desired to anchor or secure the implant by deflecting the shaft  in the region  as generally illustrated by the arrows in  representing the deflection of the steerable catheter . Fluoroscopic and\/or echo guidance may be used to facilitate aiming of the steerable catheter  within the left ventricle .","As may be appreciated, the location of the first steerable actuator  and the region  along the shaft  may generally correspond to the position of the shaft  within the left atrium  and\/or the left ventricle  proximate to the mitral valve . Ideally, the proximal ring  would reside somewhere between the annulus of the valve and the valve leaflets. This would provide for the distal section  to be pointed relatively straight at the desired anchor location. The differing lengths of the first section  may compensate for the variations in the patients' valve to apex length, although anchoring directly in the apex may not always be the desired location. In  the illustrated bend in the catheter may be closer to the valve.","Turning now to , once the steerable catheter  has been positioned to the desired location within the left ventricle  (for example, but not limited to, the apex ), the implant  may be anchored and\/or secured to the native tissue. According to one embodiment, the implant  may include a shaft  coupled to a spacer  and an anchoring device  as generally illustrated in  and described in U.S. patent Ser. No. 11\/940,724 filed Nov. 15, 2007 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/209,686 filed Sep. 12, 2008, both of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. However, the implant  may include any other device configured to be received within the lumen  of the delivery catheter and\/or delivered to the heart .","The implant  may optionally be advanced through the lumen  of steerable catheter  using a pusher  or the like. Securing the implant  to the tissue may depend upon the specifics of the design of the implant . For example, the implant  may be secured to the tissue using one or more screws (for example, but not limited to, helical screws or the like), tines, and\/or sutures (such as, but not limited to, one or more sutures formed, at least in part, of a shape memory alloy).","Once the implant  has been secured to the tissue, the steerable catheter  may be removed from the left ventricle  and ultimately from the heart  and the patient's body. According to one embodiment, the steerable catheter  may be removed by urging the steerable catheter  proximally (i.e., away from the left ventricle ). The first steering actuator  may be used to minimize the force applied against the implant  by the steerable catheter  as the implant  exits the lumen  of the steerable catheter . If the force applied to the implant  by the steerable catheter  as the implant  exits the lumen  of the steerable catheter  is too great, damage may occur to the heart  proximate to the implant site and\/or the implant  may be accidentally pulled out and\/or disconnected from the tissue.","According to one embodiment, the force applied to the implant  by the steerable catheter  as the implant  exits the lumen  of the steerable catheter  may be further reduced with the aid of the second or more steerable actuators . For example, turning to , one embodiment generally illustrating the deflection withdrawal sequence of a steerable catheter  having at least a first and a second steerable actuator ,  is shown.  generally illustrates one embodiment of the steerable catheter . The implant  (not shown) has been secured to the tissue. The second steerable actuator  is illustrated in the \u201cstraight\u201d position (i.e., the second steerable actuator  is not urging the shaft  of the steerable catheter ). The region  between the second steerable actuator  and the first steerable actuator  (for example, but not limited, the distal most 3 inches of the shaft ) is over the implant  from the apex  of the left ventricle  up to the mitral valve . The first steerable actuator  is in the bent or curved position to deflect the shaft  in order to accommodate the curve or bend from the mitral valve , through the transseptal puncture site , and into the right atrium .","As the steerable catheter  is withdrawn from the left ventricle , the region  of the steerable catheter  may start to encounter the curvature in the left atrium  between the mitral valve  and the transseptal puncture site . In order to accommodate this curvature, the second actuation device  may be actuated to deflect the region  of the shaft  of the steerable catheter  as generally illustrated in . Deflecting the region  of the shaft  may reduce drag of the steerable catheter  on the implant  and may also reduce the likelihood of dislodging the implant  from the tissue. While deflecting the region , the user may also un-bend the region  of the shaft  as the region  is moving through the transseptal puncture site  and into a region of reduced curvature. As the steerable catheter  is further removed, the second actuation device  may be un-bent to un-bend the region  of the shaft  as it moves through the transseptal puncture site  as generally illustrated in . At this point, both regions ,  of the shaft  may be somewhat curved passively by the anatomy alone.","Accordingly, the present disclosure may include a steerable catheter including a first steerable actuator disposed 1.5-4 inches from the distal tip of the shaft. The first steerable actuator may include, but is not limited to, a pull ring or the like. The steerable catheter having a first steerable actuator may facilitate aiming or positioning the tip of the steerable catheter to the desired location within the left ventricle. The first steerable actuator may also reduce the force exerted on the implant by the shaft when removing steerable catheter from the left ventricle and may also reduce damage to the heart by allowing the shaft to better conform to the geometries of the pathway.","The steerable catheter may optionally include at least a second steerable actuator in addition to the first steerable actuator. The second steerable actuator may include, but is not limited to, a pull ring or the like which may be positioned proximate to the distal tip of the shaft. The second steerable actuator may further reduce the force exerted on the implant by the shaft when removing steerable catheter from the left ventricle and may also reduce damage to the heart by allowing the shaft to better conform to the geometries of the pathway. The first and\/or second steerable actuators may also facilitate advancing the steerable catheter over a dilator through the tortuous pathway of the transseptal route to the left ventricle.","The present disclosure may also include a dilator having a plurality of segments having different hardness or stiffness. The different segments may improve the ability of the steerable catheter to be inserted over the dilator through the tortuous pathway of the transseptal route to the left ventricle. According to at least one embodiment, the dilator may include four segments wherein the softest segment is located approximately 6 inches from the distal tip.","The dilator may optionally include an expandable device (such as, but not limited to, a balloon or the like) disposed proximate the distal tip. The expandable device may facilitate advancing the dilator through the mitral valve without damaging the mitral valve (for example, damaging and\/or becoming entangled in the cusps and\/or papillary muscles). The dilator may also optionally include a deflectable tip. The deflectable tip may improve the general control of the dilator as it is advanced over a guide wire the transseptal route to the left atrium. The deflectable tip may also allow the expandable device to be aimed towards the mitral valve, further facilitating the advancement to the dilator through the mitral valve.","An implant consistent with the present disclosure may also comprise other embodiments, for example, but not limited to, one or more of the implants as described in U.S. patent application Ser.

As described above, a heart valve implant consistent with the present disclosure may be used in the treatment mitral valve regurgitation. However, the heart valve implant as well as its associated methods may also suitably be employed in other applications, e.g., as an implant associated with one of the other valves of the heart, etc. The present disclosure should not, therefore, be construed as being limited to use for reducing and\/or preventing regurgitation of the mitral valve.","As mentioned above, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to an apparatus, system or method which must satisfy one or more of any stated or implied object or feature of the present disclosure and should not be limited to the preferred, exemplary, or primary embodiment(s) described herein.
