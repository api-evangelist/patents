{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Network planning is required prior to installation of a dedicated network, such as a long term evolution (LTE) network or an evolved packet core (EPC) network. Network planning is a time consuming process that includes identifying necessary network resources and communications connections for the network, and determining appropriate locations for the network resources and the communications connections. Once the planning is complete, the network resources and the communications connections may be installed at the determined locations. Network installation is both a time consuming and an expensive process. However, such dedicated network resources and communications connections do not need to be installed when they are readily available in data centers.","A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications devices and storage systems. A data center generally includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression, etc.), and security devices.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods described herein may provide a network architecture using cloud computing techniques (e.g., virtual machines (VMs), hypervisors, etc.) to operate, manage, and scale systems of the network architecture. The systems and\/or methods may lay a foundation for a transition from dedicated hardware-based network systems to using data center class computer systems for virtual network implementation. The systems and\/or methods may create highly scalable virtual networks with lower operational and capital costs than current dedicated networks, and may provide network primitives that collect operational information associated with the virtual networks.","The systems and\/or methods may provide an elastic cloud network (ECN) device that includes a session delivery network (SDN) component, a network hypervisor, a topology manager, and a catalog. The SDN component may be responsible for managing network primitives, which may lay a foundation for virtualization of other systems. The SDN component may provide session continuity across a data center and\/or a wide area. The network hypervisor may include virtualization-based distribution network infrastructure services, such as resource management, to dynamically and intelligently optimize available resources among virtual machines. The network hypervisor may provide service levels and data protection for reliable and cost effective disaster recovery, security, and integrity to protect an existing infrastructure from data center vulnerabilities. The topology manager and the catalog may permit users (e.g., network administrators) to manage the virtual systems as though the virtual systems were physically dedicated systems.","The systems and\/or methods may create and operate a virtual network infrastructure that virtualizes and aggregates data center devices and attached networks and storage into unified resource pools. The systems and\/or methods may support the virtual network infrastructure by providing compute oriented systems (e.g., Internet protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS), analytics, fault management, performance management, etc.) that are currently provided as standalone hardware and software solutions.","In one example implementation, an ECN device may receive network infrastructure requirements from a user, and may determine network resource availability based on the requirements. The ECN device may recommend network resources to the user based on the determined availability, and may receive user-selected network resources based on the recommendations. The ECN device may logically connect the selected network resources to create a virtual network template, and may verify requirements for the selected network resources. The ECN device may test the virtual network template, and may deploy the virtual network template, via the selected network resources, when the virtual network template is approved by the test.","As used herein, the term \u201cuser\u201d is intended to be broadly interpreted to include a user device or an ECN device, or a user of a user device or an ECN device.","The term \u201ccomponent,\u201d as used herein, is intended to be broadly construed to include hardware (e.g., a processor, a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a chip, a memory device (e.g., a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), etc.), etc.) or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., a processor, microprocessor, ASIC, etc. executing software contained in a memory device).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","100","110","120","130","140","110","120","130","140"]},"User device  may include a radiotelephone; a personal communications system (PCS) terminal that may combine, for example, a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities; a smart phone; a personal digital assistant (PDA) that can include, for example, one or more of a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet\/intranet access, etc.; a laptop computer; a tablet computer; a desktop computer; a workstation computer; or other types of computation and\/or communication devices.
