title: Twist lock mounting system
abstract: A twist lock mount for quick mounting and positioning a device to a support includes a mount receiving member attachable to or integral with the support and a mounting member attachable to or integral with a device to be mounted. The receiving member provides a channel covered by flanges that further define a narrower channel or slot. The mounting member is configured to slide into the channel when it is in one rotational orientation and to lock securely into place when it is in another. A rotation in the opposite direction will unlock the device so that the mount can be slid out of the channel quickly and easily. The twist lock mount simply and effectively prevents movement in the longitudinal, transverse and axial directions and is well suited for use in harsh, high vibration environments.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, licensed, and used by or for the U.S. Government.","The present invention relates generally to a mounting system and more specifically to a twist lock mounting system for rapid and secure attachment and detachment of a variety of devices to various surfaces.","The present invention was developed to address the problem of mounting and dismounting of the M48 Lightweight Motor Blower (LWMB) to the airframe of the AH-64A Apache helicopter. The LWMB is part of the M48 Chemical-Biological Aircraft Mask system and provides filtered, breathable air to aircraft personnel. The LWMB must be securely mounted to the aircraft during flight operations and must be quickly and easily removable when aircraft personnel depart the aircraft. The mounting mechanism for the LWMB must be easy to operate and also be capable of performing in harsh environments where extreme vibration and shock loading is expected.","In general, in one aspect, a twist lock mount for mounting and positioning a device to a support includes a mount receiving member and a mounting member. The mount receiving member includes parallel guide rails having opposing inner guide surfaces that define a channel therebetween, a pair of flanges projecting transversely from the guide rails over the channel and having edges that define a narrowed channel opening, a means for locking a mounting member, and a positioning stop to provide longitudinal positioning for the mounting member in the channel. In accordance with another aspect, the mounting member includes a hub having a rim adapted to slidably engage the mount receiving member flanges, and a lip extending radially outwardly from the hub, the lip including opposing peripheral edges dimensioned to slidably engage the opposing inner guide surfaces of the mount receiving member when the mounting member is in a first rotational orientation and further including a complementary locking mechanism to engaging the locking mechanism when the mounting member is positioned against the positioning stop and rotated to a second rotational orientation.","In general, in another aspect, the locking mechanism includes one or more recesses in the walls of the channel and the complementary locking mechanism includes one or more protrusions from a peripheral edge of the lip of the mounting member. In accordance with another aspect the protrusions include springably mounted lugs positioned on the lip of the mounting member. In general, in another aspect, the recesses include pockets with one or more chamfered edges to mate with complimentarily chamfered edges of the lugs.","In another aspect, the springably mounted lug is formed integrally with the lip and is comprised of a flexible plastic material. In yet another aspect, the mounting member is manufactured of a flexible plastic material in a single shot injection molding process.","In another aspect, a twist lock mount for mounting a device to a support includes a mount receiving member having a T-slot channel with an open end and a means for locking a mounting member in the channel. In another aspect, the mounting member is adapted to slide into the open end of the T-slot channel when it is in a first rotational orientation and includes a means for locking, adapted to be engaged by the means for locking of the mount receiving member when the mounting member is rotated in the channel into a second rotational orientation.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention, as claimed, may be practiced. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present invention may be embodied in methods and devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2","b":["100","100","110","116","116","123","110","110","123","100"]},"As shown in , receiving member  provides a channel  that is defined by a pair of opposing, parallel guide rails . Guide rails  extend longitudinally (in the x direction) and provide inner guide surfaces  that make up the walls of channel . Guide surfaces  extend axially (in the z direction) from the plane of the mounting surface or support (not shown) to the inner surfaces  of a pair of flanges  which project transversely over the channel  and prevent movement of the mounting member  in the axial direction (z). Flanges  terminate at parallel edges  which define a narrowed channel opening or slot . Thus channel  together with flanges  form a channel that is generally T-slot shaped.","Channel  has an open end  for receiving mounting member  and a stop end  which is blocked or partially blocked to prevent the passage of mounting member  and which provides for precise longitudinal positioning of mounting member  in the channel. In this example, a positioning stop  projects transversely into the channel  from one of the guide surfaces  proximate to the stop end  of the channel . As can be seen from , embodiments of twist lock mount  can provide a very low profile to facilitate surface mounting of devices in confined spaces.","The present invention locks the mounting member  in the receiving member  after it has been slid into the channel . In general, a locking mechanism such as an elastic or spring biased protrusion seats into a recess or pocket when the mounting member  is rotated into a lock position. In the embodiment shown in  receiving member  includes a pair of recesses  in guide surfaces . In general, recesses  are cut to match the shape of protrusions such as lugs, teeth, or keys, positioned about the circumference of mounting member . The protrusions are longitudinally staggered to be equidistant from the axis of rotation (z axis) of mounting member  when it is positioned against positioning stop . To facilitate locking and unlocking chamfered mating surfaces  of recesses  may be provided.","Mounting member  has two basic aspects, a low profile disc shaped hub  centered on an axis  (z axis), and an eccentric or oblong lip  extending radially outwardly from the hub . The circumference of hub  is bounded by a rim , which fits complimentarily into the narrowed channel opening  of receiving member  and slidably engages edges  of flanges  as the mounting member  is inserted into the channel . In this embodiment, hub  includes three mounting holes  for inserting screws, bolts or rivets to secure the device to be mounted. Other embodiments may use other attachment means such as an adhesive to secure the device to be mounted to mounting member .","The eccentric lip  of mounting member  is defined generally by a narrow axis and a wide axis. The narrow axis terminates at parallel peripheral edges  which slidably engage inner guide surfaces  of the receiving member  as the mounting member  is inserted into the channel . A locking mechanism is positioned on either or both ends of the wide axis of the lip . The locking mechanism includes a pair of protrusions  which are configured to complimentarily seat in recesses  of the receiving member  when the mounting member  is positioned against the positioning stop  and rotated to a lock position. In this embodiment, protrusions  include nubs or lugs  positioned at the ends of elastically flexible arms . Arms  curve circumferentially around the hub  and are offset from the lip  by gaps  to allow clearance for the arms  to flex inwardly as the protrusions  slidably engage the guide surfaces . In this embodiment arms  curve around the hub  in the direction of rotation (counterclockwise with respect to ) so that protrusions  will seat in recesses  after approximately one-quarter turn. In other embodiments arms  may be positioned around the circumference of lip  to curve in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation. In addition, other rotational securing mechanisms may likewise be used in other embodiments of the present invention. For example, protrusions  may include one or more spring biased ball bearings or nubs, teeth, lugs, catches, and the like, positioned along the outer surfaces of lip  to positively engage recesses  when the mounting member is rotated in the channel  against the positioning stop . In still other embodiments, lip  may provide one or more recesses into which protrusions from guide surfaces  will seat after rotation of the mounting member to a lock position.","Operation of the twist lock mount  will now be described. To engage the twist lock mount , mounting member , which is attached to a device to be mounted, such as the LWMB, is inserted into the open end  of receiving member , shown on the left side of . The rotational position of mounting member  is aligned so that the narrow axis of lip  is in a direction transverse with respect to the channel , with the arms  in a forward and aft positions of the mounting member , so that opposing peripheral edges  can slide along guide surfaces  of the receiving member . The lip  thus acts as a retainer and a guide as the mounting member  is inserted between the guide rails  of receiving member . In this rotational orientation, mounting member  slides longitudinally into the channel  until it comes to rest against positioning stop . Mounting member  is then rotated in a counterclockwise direction (with respect to ). As mounting member  is rotated, a user may observe a slight resistance as the protrusions  press against the inner guide surfaces  and the arms  flex radially inwardly. After approximately one-quarter turn, lugs  or other protrusions will be positioned over recesses , and the elastic arms  will urge the lugs  into recesses  so that they are seated securely. At this point the mounting member  is locked into position and will resist further rotation in the counterclockwise direction. Additionally, the locked mounting member  will resist movement in the lateral, axial and transverse directions. The twist lock mount  may provide a positive indication to the user that it has locked into position such as by providing an audible or tactile snap or click. In environments such as the high vibration environment of a helicopter, it may be desirable to provide an electrical or optical signal to indicate the locked or unlocked status of the twist lock mount .","A twisting force in the opposite direction (clockwise with respect to ) and rotation of about a quarter turn is all that is needed to unseat lugs  from recesses  and free the mounting member  so that it can slide out of the open end  of channel . The amount of force to lock and unlock the mounting can be adjusted to suit the requirements of different applications. As will be appreciated, the twisting force required to operate twist lock mount  may be calibrated to provide for easy locking and unlocking in different operating environments while still ensuring that the mount will not spontaneously unlock. In some applications, it may be desirable to configure the twist lock mount  to lock permanently into position in one operation, such as by squaring the edges  of recesses  so that the lugs  will remain permanently seated.","Vibration can be a problem for sensitive equipment such as aircraft instruments and avionics. In another aspect of the present invention, twist lock mount  may advantageously provide vibration damping for devices to be mounted. For example, the mating surfaces of the twist lock mount  may be configured to dampen and dissipate vibrations at frequencies likely to be encountered in high vibration environments such as an aircraft, as would be readily understood to those of skill in the art.","It will be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention can be manufactured in a variety of ways, and from a wide variety of materials. In most embodiments the two principal components can be of an inexpensive, unitary, molded manufacture, utilizing a widely available plastic material such as nylon. Selection of the material for mounting member  will depend on the material's ability to flex within its elastic limits. In applications where mechanical stresses and shock loading are a factor it is preferred that both the mounting member  and the receiving member  be manufactured of a flexible, tough grade impact modified nylon. The parts may be manufactured in a single shot injection molding or extrusion process. Other plastic molding techniques, such as, for example, casting and compression molding which are familiar to persons skilled in the art may also be employed. Where metal is chosen as the material of construction for one or more components of a twist lock mount according to the invention, those skilled in that art will recognize die casting as a preferred method of fabrication. Regardless of the method of manufacture, it is viewed as greatly preferable to produce components such as the mounting member , as unitary pieces in the various embodiments of the present invention. However, the elements of this invention may also be separately manufactured and assembled into a complete device by adhesives or by mechanical means, which will be readily apparent to those knowledgeable in the art of the material of fabrication.","The present invention thus provides a low profile and lightweight mounting configuration that is simple to manufacture, install and operate. The present invention may be scaled to accommodate various device and equipment sizes, thus facilitating adaptability in a wide variety of commercial, consumer and military applications.","As has been shown, embodiments of twist lock mounting systems according to the present invention provide simple, ergonomic, easily securable, quickly releasable, low profile, mounting mechanisms for a variety of equipment, components and devices in a number of different working environments. For example, embodiments of the twist lock mounting system can advantageously be deployed in harsh environments where extreme vibration and shock loading is expected. The ease of operation, simplicity of manufacture and scalability of the present invention will enable embodiments to be used in many other applications, particularly where there is a need for a mounting system that provides rapid and secure manual attachment and detachment of devices and components in confined spaces. In addition, embodiments of twist lock mounting systems precisely define the position of the mounted part relative to the holding part, lock the part securely into place and unlock the same with a simple twist of the wrist. While the invention is simple to fabricate and to assemble at the same time it provides a high degree of stability, uniformity, and durability.","A number of embodiments of the invention defined by the following claims have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications to the described embodiments may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention. For example, while some embodiments described above provide recesses in guide surfaces of the receiving member and protrusions on the mounting member for engaging the pockets, in other embodiments protrusions may be positioned on the guide surfaces of the receiving member and recesses for receiving the protrusions may be provided in the mounting member. Additionally, in some embodiments, simple weight reduction modifications may be made such as the removal of material in the mount receiving members and hub of the mounting member. In other embodiments, electrical contacts may be integrated into the mounting. For example, an electrical, magnetic or optical contact, sensor, or switch may be integrated into the mounting to indicate when the device is in a locked or unlocked position.","Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the invention, which is limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
