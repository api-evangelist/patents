title: Device and service management based on layer 2 through layer 7 device attributes
abstract: A smart network may include a smart network host device as well as one or more client devices configured to connect to the smart network. Each of the client devices may implement one or more services that the client device exposes to other devices connected to the smart network. Each of the client devices includes network layer 2 and 3 attributes as well as network layer 7 application attributes. The application attributes are enumerated as named services, which each client device registers with the smart network host device. When a client device needs access to a named service, the smart network host device uses layer 2, 3, and 7 attributes associated with the client device to select a suitable server for providing the named service to the client device.

No. 61\/327,072, filed Apr. 22, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Technical Field","The present disclosure relates generally to automated network configuration systems and, more specifically, to device and service management based on layer 2 through layer 7 device attributes.","2. Description of the Related Art","Home networks, in which multiple computing and\/or peripheral devices are communicatively linked together in a consumer's home, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. A home environment may include one or more computers, a wireless router, a cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, and one or more other devices capable of connecting to the home network. Conventionally, each device in the home network must be manually configured to connect to the network and, once connected, may then communicate with other devices attached to the home network. Each connected device may offer different services to the other devices within the network or require certain services from other devices within the network. Conventionally, each device and related service must be manually configured to operate properly with other devices offering or using a certain service.","Manual configuration can technically enable devices to operate together in a given network. In practical settings, however, procedures for establishing and provisioning services within a home network are typically too involved for the majority of home network users to implement reliably. For example, a network user may need to manually reconfigure a home network router, determine a network IP address and\/or hostname for each device, establish network credentials, register a networked video monitor device and a home surveillance camera, pair the monitor device with the camera, and so forth. Furthermore, in order for a device to locate another device on the home network, a device must establish communication using a unique IP address of the other device. Such connections are typically defined as peer-to-peer connections. In peer-to-peer applications, a user may be required to manually keep track of which address is associated with which device or service in order to configure the devices to communicate properly. Such manual configuration procedures present a significant challenge for unsophisticated users attempting to set up a home network and provision services on the home network.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for systems and methods that reliably and conveniently enable the user of a home network to automatically configure and provision services provided by one or more client devices on the home network.","For clarity, identical reference numbers have been used, where applicable, to designate identical elements that are common between figures. It is contemplated that features of one example embodiment may be incorporated in other example embodiments without further recitation.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a more thorough understanding of various example embodiments of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of skill in the art that certain embodiments of the invention may be practiced without one or more of these specific details.

The event hub server  determines that the first client device () has subscribed to be notified whenever this type of event has been generated and, therefore, sends a message to the media content service executing on the first client device () informing the service that a program has finished recording. In response to receiving the message about the event, the first client device () may perform certain tasks based on information associated with the event.

The service communication data may be transmitted via the smart network host device  or directly between the client device  and service provider device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1A-1F"],"b":["600","102","2","4"]},"The method begins in step , were the smart network host device  processes a first registration request from a first client device . Registration includes assigning device data to the client device . The device data may include a unique IP address, a unique device name, and a name for each service name associated with the device. In step , the smart network host device  stores the device data within database . In one embodiment, the device data is stored within the database  prior to transmitting a response to the client device . In step , the smart network host device  receives a service query from the client device . The service query indicates a named service to which the client device  needs to connect. In step , the smart network host device  determines that a specific server device best matches the service query. In one embodiment, the smart network host device  determines that a specific server device best matches the service query based on certain criteria, such as topology data  and device status . For example, a particular server device may be selected from a set of server devices that each offer the named service needed by the client device , based on minimizing network hop count between the particular server and the client device . Furthermore, device status  for a particular server device may be used to avoid selecting server devices that are not currently available. In another embodiment, the smart network host device  determines that a specific server device best matches the service query based server load for each potential server device from a set of server devices that each offer the named service needed by the client device . Persons skilled in the art will recognize that any technically feasible technique may be implemented to determine server load without departing the scope and spirit of the present invention. In yet another embodiment, the smart network host device  determines that a specific server device best matches the service query based link speed and available bandwidth between the client device  and each server device from a set of server devices that each offer the named service needed by the client device. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that other technically feasible techniques may be also used to determine a best match without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. In step , the smart network host device  transmits the identity of the server device to the client device . The server device may be any client device, the smart network host device , or a server system external to the smart network .","In sum, example embodiments of the invention provide systems and methods for associating client devices within the smart network with named services. Each client device may offer or require a given named service. The smart network host device acts as a central authority to maintain device and service namespaces, and network state information needed to associate a client device to a particular service. A client device may query the central authority to determine what client devices and services are available to provide additional functionality or resources to the client device. The central authority is configured to store associations between specific client devices and their L2, L3, and L7 identifying information. The central authority uses L2-L7 attributes in determining which device should best serve a specific client device.","One embodiment of the invention may be implemented as a program product for use with a computer system.
