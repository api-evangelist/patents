title: System and method for providing decentralized E-commerce
abstract: A system and method of decentralized e-commerce for searching and indexing non-standardized content is provided. The content is tagged with provider tags to identify content fields of information within the content and is stored remotely at one or more network locations for searching and indexing by a portal server. The provider tags are devised according to each provider's own tagging scheme. The provider tags are in turn cross-referenced with portal tags of a portal tagging standard using key information supplied by the provider. The portal server uses the key information to conduct field specific searching and/or indexing of the decentralized, non-standardized content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to a system and method for decentralized e-commerce by providing for field specific searching and indexing of information within non-standardized, decentralized content.","The internet has grown explosively over the past decade, during which time the internet has evolved into a multinational forum for e-commerce, educational and informational exchange. With this explosive growth, the sheer volume of content available on the internet has made it difficult for content providers to make their content known and for users to find the content. While large businesses with large marketing programs and budgets can garner great attention and generate high traffic volumes to their sites through mass media advertising and the like, small content providers, such as individuals and small businesses, go all but unnoticed.","Search engines, such as Yahoo and Excite, make finding information from even small business and individual web sites possible by spidering content and generating a searchable index of the content. However, these search engines are limited in that they generally index keywords from the full content and\/or the metatag fields, such as, the \u201ckeyword\u201d and \u201cdescription\u201d metatags that provide descriptive information regarding the content. However, there are no means for these search engines to parse the content and conduct field specific searches within the content. For example, a searcher looking to buy a used 1995 Porsche might conduct a search for the terms \u201cPorsche\u201d, \u201cFor Sale\u201d and \u201c1995\u201d. Such a search may return thousands of hits, including articles or reviews about Porsches, sellers of Porsche related merchandise such as sunglasses, t-shirts, mugs, etc., new Porsches, Porsche parts, etc. Interspersed among all of these hits that are not relevant to the user's search request, there may be several sites selling Porsches. However, even among the sites selling Porsches, the search engine's summary of the search results is unlikely to provide critical information to the searcher, because the search engines have no way of finding and presenting the vital details in the index of hits. For example, it is unlikely that the index will include the price, model year, model type, mileage, etc. Since search engines typically extract the page title and several lines of text from the beginning of the content for inclusion in the search result index, these statistics will be presented to the user only by chance. Because this information is frequently not presented in the search result summary, the searcher must then link to each web page individually to locate the vital and full details. This method of searching is inefficient and frustrating for the user. As a consequence, the user may simply turn to a large used car web site having field searchable centralized content.","As an alternative forum for small businesses and individuals to engage in e-commerce on the internet, online classified ad sites such as Yahoo Classifieds and auction sites such as Ebay have been developed. These sites offer sellers an opportunity to add their content to a centralized searchable database typically organized by product category. Although these systems provide a forum for individuals and small businesses engage in e-commerce, the seller's content must be entered into each site database individually and is confined to the data fields of the site's database. Moreover, due to storage space limitations and the rapid consumption of storage space by thousands of users placing product listings, these systems typically permit only limited product information and descriptions. Thus, the addition of customized content design and presentation including multimedia, video and sound, as is common on most web sites, is generally not available on these systems.","More recently with the popularization of extensible markup language (XML), standard development groups have begun to create global content tagging standards for decentralized content sharing and searching. For example, 4World Telecom is proposing a tagging standard for real estate listings called the Real Estate DTD\/Schema Design, and the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) is preparing a tagging standard for classified advertising called the NAA Standard for Classified Advertising Data. While these proposals provide a means for searching and\/or indexing of decentralized content through standardized tagging schemes, the content must conform to the tags and tagging format of the particular tagging standard. This system is inflexible in that content developed pursuant to the tagging standard of one portal server can not be searched and indexed by another portal server using a different tagging standard. Thus the content provider is required to develop separate content for each portal tagging standard.","For the foregoing reasons, a need exists for a system and method for decentralized e-commerce, wherein decentralized, non-standardized content stored on a plurality of content servers can be searched and indexed by content fields of information within the content.","One object of the present invention is to provide a system and method of decentralized e-commerce that satisfies this need using a portal server to conduct field specific searches of non-standardized, decentralized content.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a system and method for conducting field specific searches of decentralized, non-standardized content using key information. The system and method provide a portal server for receiving content search requests from users. The search requests contain search terms associated with portal tags. The associated portal tags define search criteria wherein the search for a term will be restricted to content fields corresponding to that term's associated portal tag. The content is stored on a plurality of remote content servers and is tagged by the provider using a tagging language such as XML to identify important content fields of information within the content. Each content provider may tag its content according to its own tagging scheme. The content providers in turn supply key information cross-referencing their tags to corresponding portal tags during a registration process. In this way, the portal server searches the content of each provider by comparing each search term associated with a portal tag to content identified by a corresponding provider tag.","In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the portal server generates a content index of all registered content prior to receiving a search request. The content index contains a record for each provider's content. Each record has data fields identified by portal tags. The data fields for each record are filled with the assistance of the key information. The key information is used to identify and extract content identified with provider tags corresponding to each portal tag. The extracted content is then stored in the corresponding portal tag field of the content index. In this way a field searchable index of the content is generated. In this embodiment, user search requests are conducted on the content index, instead of directly on the content.","In accordance with another aspect of this embodiment of the invention, the portal server may process a user search request by first searching the content index for the search terms associated with portal tags that are indexed, and second searching the content directly for search terms associated with portal tags that are not indexed. In this way, the content index may be used to exclude content that does not meet at least a portion of the search request, so that the decentralized content search is reduced to a smaller subset of content.","In accordance with other aspects of the invention, the portal server compiles and transmits a summary of the search results to the user, and engages in the selection and transaction of content items and services for sale, auction or the like.","These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims and accompanying drawings.","The present invention is described in terms of the above exemplary embodiments. This is for convenience only and is not intended to limit the application of the present invention. In fact, after reading the following description, it will be understood how to implement the present invention in alternative embodiments.","I. Introduction","Briefly, the method and system according to one embodiment of the invention satisfies the shortcomings of the existing methods and systems for searching non-standardized, decentralized content. One embodiment of the present invention provides for a portal server to conduct field specific searches of non-standardized, decentralized content supplied by one or more content providers and stored remotely on one or more content servers. Field specific searching is made possible by using key information. The key information relates provider tags identifying fields of information in content with corresponding portal tags from a portal tagging standard. In this way, each content provider's unique provider tags are associated with a standard set of portal tags. Thus, using the key information, the portal server receives search requests containing search terms restricted by portal tags and compares the search terms to content identified by corresponding provider tags.","Using this system and method, content providers retain the flexibility to tag content in accordance with their own needs and do not have to restrict content to the requirements of any one portal server's tagging standard. Further, portal servers can create portal tagging standards according to their own needs and changing conditions while being able to retain access or gain access to a preexisting content base regardless of the content provider's tagging scheme.","Development of portal servers for decentralized e-commerce will be encouraged by the potential for revenue and profit generation. Revenue and profit generation may be by any or all of (1) the sale of advertising space on the user search interface, (2) exacting a percentage of sales of merchandise searched and sold through the portal, and\/or (3) charging a fee for registration of content and\/or for searching content.","Certain embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the figures.","II. System Architecture","The system architecture of one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated with reference to . As shown in , the system includes a portal server  configured to communicate with one or more content servers  storing content supplied by providers  and one or more users  through an interface device  (collectively the \u201cnodes\u201d). The portal server  acts as a search interface and intermediary between users  and content servers .","Each node is connected directly or indirectly to the portal server  via a network , such as, the internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an internet connection or the like, via a public switched phone network, dedicated data line, cellular network, personal communication system (PCS), microwave, satellite networks, cable or the like. The user interface device  and content servers  are capable of communicating with the portal server  directly or indirectly. Communication between the interface device , the portal server  and content server  is electronic by means of a network  and includes a conventional high-speed connection employing known communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP, and is capable of decrypting and encrypting data received and transmitted between the nodes to secure transmissions using known protocols, such as secured socket layer (SSL) server certificate technology.","Portal Server and Content Servers","Referring to , the portal server  and each content server  are implemented as single general purpose computers as described below. In another embodiment the functionality of the portal server  and each content server  may be distributed over a plurality of computers. In that embodiment, the portal server  and\/or each content server  are configured in a distributed architecture wherein the databases and central processing unit (CPU)  are housed in separate units or locations and are connected via a network connection as described above. It will be appreciated that an almost unlimited number of controllers may be supported. This arrangement yields a more dynamic and flexible system, less prone to catastrophic hardware failures effecting the entire system.","As shown in , the portal server  and content servers  are each implemented as single general purpose computers including a CPU , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , a communications port  and a data storage device .","Referring to , the data storage device  of the portal server  stores the registered provider database , content index  and portal tagging standard database . Referring to , the data storage device  of each content server  stores content . As described more fully below, the registered provider database , content index , and portal tagging standard database  are used by the portal server to register providers and conduct searches of content  having tagged content fields.","The CPU  comprising a conventional microprocessor such as an Intel Pentium processor electrically coupled to each of the portal server and content server's other elements. The CPU  executes program code stored in one or more of ROM , RAM  and data storage device  to carry out the functions and acts described in connection with the portal server  and each content server . The CPU  comprises at least one high-speed digital data processor adequate to execute program modules for the provider registration process, database creation process and user search process described in detail below in connection with . The CPU  interacts with ROM , RAM  and data storage device  to execute stored program code according to conventional data processing techniques.","Interface Device","According to one embodiment of the invention as shown in , a user interacts and communicates with the portal server  over network  using an interface device  to search and view content  stored on content servers . The interface device  is a web browser based system implemented as a single interactive visual display device such as a general purpose computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or the like. There are many commercial web browser software programs that can enable the communications required between the interface devices , portal server  and content servers , the primary function being transmission and reception of content through the network  and presentation of content to the user . Examples of such software programs include the Netscape Navigator browser by Netscape Corporation and the Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft Corporation.","II. Data Storage and Formats","In the illustrated embodiment of the invention, data is stored on the portal server  and the content servers . The portal server  stores the registered provider database , content index  and portal tagging standard database . The content servers  store content .","Samples of database records from the registered provider database , content index  and provider tagging standard database  are shown in , respectively. Exemplary content  is illustrated in . The organization of these databases and content, including, specific data and fields illustrated in these figures represents only one embodiment of the records stored in the databases. Moreover, it should be understood that the databases themselves are only representative, that the information contained therein could equally be consolidated into fewer databases or divided up among more databases.","Registered Provider Database","The registered provider database  shown in  is used to store information relating to the content provider and its content. Referring to the sample records \u2013 illustrated in  of the registered provider database , each record contains data fields \u2013. These fields correspond to provider , affiliation , contact information , content category , type , network address  and key information . The key information field has sub-fields for portal tag  and provider tag .","The data fields for each record are populated with information supplied by each content provider during the provider registration process. The initial three fields are primarily self explanatory and administrative in nature. The provider field  identifies the name of the provider, the affiliation field  indicates whether the provider is an individual or a company and the contact information field  contains the address and phone number for each provider.","The remaining four fields and two sub-fields are instrumental in the handling and searching of the provider content. The content category field  and type field  categorize each provider's content within one of the categories and types of information for which a portal tagging standard has been created. As will be discussed in further detail below, there is a unique portal tagging standard for each category and type of content. The network address field  provides the network location of the stored content on a content server . The address stored in this field is used by the portal server  to locate each provider's content on a remote content server. The key information field , and its portal tag  and provider tag  sub-fields relate provider tags to corresponding portal tags of the portal tagging standard. For example, referring to exemplary record , one of the portal tags for the employment resume category and type is the \u201cExperience\u201d tag. The content provider has indicated that the \u201c<employment>\u201d provider tag identifies the content field in the provider's content containing information corresponding to the \u201cExperience\u201d portal tag. This relationship is supplied by each provider and recorded in portal tag field  and provider tag field . As will become more apparent below, the key information is instrumental in facilitating the search and indexing of each provider's content.","Content Index","In the illustrated embodiment of the invention a content index may be generated and stored on the portal server for each of the one or more of the categories and types of content. The content index  contains excerpts from one or more content fields of each provider's content. The excerpts are stored and organized by corresponding portal tags, whereby field specific searches can be conducted on the content index rather than directly on the decentralized content. All categories and types of content may be indexed within one content index, or a separate content index may be generated for each category and type of content.","Referring to , exemplary records of a content index for the category and type residential real estate are illustrated. The exemplary content index  contains records \u2013 having data fields \u2013. The data fields \u2013 correspond to category , type , network address  and portal tags  having portal tag sub-fields \u2013.","The category field  and type field  identify the portal tagging standard category and type to which the content relates. The network address field  stores the physical network address of the content on a content server . The exemplary portal tags field  has sub-fields for state , town , price , square feet  and style . It should be understood that these sub-fields are only representative and may be selected from among all of the portal tags in the portal tagging standard for the chosen category and type of content. Therefore, the content index for this or another category and type of content may have different sub-fields, and\/or fewer or more sub-fields than the exemplary content index  shown in .","For example, as shown in  several exemplary records from the type and category of residential real estate content are shown. The portal tagging standard for residential real estate may include portal tags relating to the state and town that the property is located in, the taxes, the price of the home, the square footage, the style of the home, the acreage, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms and the like. However, so as not to duplicate and centralize the content, the content index is limited to content fields relating to only a subset of all the portal tags in a portal tagging standard. As shown only the state , town , price , square footage  and style  have been indexed. Alternatively, a content index for the employment resume category and type may contain entirely different sub-fields such as, education, experience and like fields selected from the employment resume category and type portal tagging standard.","The data fields \u2013 of the exemplary content index  are populated with a combination of information extracted from the registered provider database and from each provider's content during indexing. The category, type and network address fields are extracted from fields ,  and  respectively of the registered provider database . The portal tag sub-fields \u2013 are populated with content extracted from content fields identified with provider tags corresponding to the portal tag fields.","Portal Tagging Standard Database","The portal tagging standard database defines a set of portal tags and required tags for each category and type of content that can be registered by a provider. Thus, each record in the database corresponds to a unique portal tagging standard applicable to a particular category and type of content.","Exemplary records \u2013 of the portal tagging standard database  are illustrated in . The portal tagging standard database  contains data fields \u2013 corresponding to category , type , portal tags  and required tags . The data fields for each of these records are populated by the portal server or a third party developer of the portal tagging standard database . The category field  and type field  contain the descriptive name of the category and type of content to which the portal tagging standard applies.","Each portal tagging standard comprises a set of portal tags stored in portal tags field  and required tags stored in required tags field . The collection of portal tags in a portal tagging standard provides a standard set of tags used by the portal server to interface with a user, and search or index content. The required tags field  stores a list of portal tags for which a content provider must provide key information relating a provider tag to each portal tag. The required tags set a basic minimum level of content and searchability for a provider to register its content. For example, in a portal tagging standard for residential real estate a provider may be required to supply provider tags identifying content fields containing at least a town and price, since almost every user conducting a search will want to be able to restrict the search to a particular town and price range.","Other contemplated portal tagging standards include standards for handling employment resumes, and the sale and auctioning of merchandise and services. A portal tagging standard for employment resumes may include portal tags for content relating to at least candidate's name, address, education, experience, and a job classification, such as accounting, engineering, or attorney. A portal tagging standard for the sale of merchandise or services may include portal tags identifying at least the name of the merchandise, a description and a price. A portal tagging standard for the auction of merchandise would be similar to the standard for sale but might have a minimum bid tag rather than a price tag. It should be understood that these are only representative examples of portal tags for some content categories and types and that the method and system of the invention can be used in conjunction with all categories and types of content.","Content Sample","Referring to , a sample of tagged content for the sale of real estate is illustrated. The sample content has provider tags for \u201c<title>\u201d , \u201c<bed>\u201d , \u201c<bath>\u201d , \u201c<acreage>\u201d , \u201c<price>\u201d  and \u201c<address>\u201d  marking content , , ,  and  respectively. Content supplied by a provider may be any readable data file, such as a word processor file, an HTML or XML file, or the like. The content may relate to any categories and types of content for which a portal tagging standard has been created. The content is tagged to identify content fields within the content. The content may be tagged using any markers distinguishable from the content itself, such as the tagging scheme of known languages such as XML. A pair of provider tags is used to mark the beginning and end of each discreet content field of information within the content.","As discussed above, the provider tags do not have to correspond in name to the portal tags of the portal tagging standard for the category and type of content. Moreover, each provider may have its own unique provider tags. Instead of requiring identically named portal and provider tags, key information is used to cross-reference each provider tag to a corresponding portal tag. The key information is supplied by each provider during the provider's content registration process. In this way each content provider can create and tag their content using their own tagging standard so that the same content can be used with multiple portal servers simply by adjusting the key information to comply with each portal server's tagging standard.","The processes of creating the registered provider database , content index , portal tagging standard database  and content , as well as the other operations of the system and method described with reference to , are illustrated in , described in detail below.","III. Portal Tagging Standard Database Creation Process","The portal tagging standard database creation process is the preliminary step in setting up the portal server  for registering content providers and searching content. The portal tagging standard database creation process comprises generating and storing a portal tagging standard for each category and type of content to be registered and searched.","The portal tagging standard database creation process is illustrated in . In step  portal tags for each category and type of content portal tagging standard are defined. A portal tag is usually created for each discrete vital piece of information or data within a category and type of content that a user is likely to want to identify and search. For example, as shown in , in content relating to the sale of residential real estate, portal tags for state, city, street, taxes, bedrooms, bathrooms and the like have been created since a user searching for houses is likely to want to restrict a search to one or more of these fields of data.","Once the portal tags are defined, in step  required tags are selected from among the defined portal tags. Referring back to , the required tags field  contains a list of selected portal tags from the portal tags field . The required tags are those portal tags for which a provider must have a correspondingly tagged content field. The failure of a provider to provide and tag content corresponding to required portal tags may prevent the provider from registering the content. The benefit of the required tags is that only content that meets a certain minimum level of content tagging for field specific searching can be registered, thus encouraging thorough tagging and providing accurate field specific searching.","Once the portal tags and required tags are created for a category and type of content, in step  the portal tags and required tags are stored in the portal tagging standard database . Thereafter, the portal server may begin registering content related to each category and type for which a portal tagging standard has been created.","IV. Content Provider Registration Process","Referring to , the content provider registration process  is illustrated. The content provider registration process registers content by collecting and storing each provider's contact information, including the content network address and key information relating each provider's tags to corresponding portal tags. The registration process begins with step . In step , the portal server collects information from each provider including the content network address, provider name and contact information. Proceeding to step , the content provider selects the category and type of portal tagging standard most closely related to the provider's content. The provider may select the category and type from among the available portal tagging standards stored in the portal tagging standard database .","In step , the provider supplies key information cross-referencing provider tags with corresponding required and nonrequired portal tags. For example, referring to , if the content is for the sale of residential real estate the content provider will be prompted to associate provider tags, such as \u201c<address>\u201d, \u201c<bed>\u201d, \u201c<price>\u201d, etc. shown in , with each of the portal tags in portal tag field , such as \u201cstate\u201d, \u201ccity\u201d, \u201cprice\u201d, \u201cbedrooms\u201d, etc. In the illustrated embodiment, the provider must at least provide key information associating provider tags to the required portal tags, but may also provide key information for the nonrequired portal tags. Record  in  illustrates key information cross-referencing the portal tags \u201cstate\u201d, \u201ctown\u201d, \u201cprice\u201d and \u201cbedroom\u201d to corresponding provider tags \u201c<address4>\u201d, \u201c<address5>\u201d, \u201c<sale price>\u201d and \u201c<bed>\u201d. This key information indicates that state information in this content will be identified by the \u201c<address4>\u201d tag, town information will be identified by the \u201c<address5>\u201d tag, and so on. Proceeding to step , the content provider registration information is stored in the provider database  shown in .","In step  the system is prompted as to whether the newly registered content should be indexed. In one embodiment of the invention all of the registered content is indexed in a content index  stored on the portal server . The content index  permits the portal server to conduct searches either wholly or partially in the content index , as will be discussed in detail below. Alternatively, in other embodiments of the invention the content is not indexed, and each user search is conducted directly on the content  stored on each content server . If the content is not to be indexed the registration process is complete and ends at step . If the content is to be indexed the process proceeds to step .","Indexing and searching the index provides a speed and an efficiency advantage over searching the content directly. However, since not all of the content is indexed, some search capabilities are lost by searching the index alone. Indexing requires a balancing act of providing adequate representation of the content without duplicating too much of the content itself in the index. Therefore, the index contains only the most important portal tags for a category and type, and may only contain excerpts of the correspondingly tagged provider content. For example, the content index  for residential real estate illustrated in  includes only the \u201cstate\u201d, \u201ctown\u201d, \u201cprice\u201d, \u201csq. ft.\u201d and \u201cstyle tags\u201d. Thus, if a user wants to conduct a search using the \u201cbedrooms\u201d portal tag as a search criteria the portal server could not search the index, since the bedroom field has not been indexed. As will be discussed in further detail below, a resolution to this problem is that, the portal server may first search the index for those search criteria in the index, and then search a potentially reduced amount of content directly for the nonindexed search criteria.","In step  the system indexes the content and creates a record in the content index  shown in . As discussed above, the content index  contains fields for category , type , network address  and portal tags  having exemplary subfields state , town , price , sq. ft.  and style . The subfields \u2013 are a subset of portal tags from the entire portal tagging standard for each category and type of content. This subset of portal tags is common only among all indexed content for an individual category and type, such that the indexed information is consistent for all indexed content in a category and type.","The portal tag subfields  through  for each record are populated by the portal server. The portal server populates these fields by using the registered provider database  to associate the portal tags  through  with the corresponding provider tags. Once the portal server has associated each portal tag  through  with its corresponding provider tag , the portal server searches the content  for content fields tagged with corresponding provider tags. For each matching content field, at least a portion of content is extracted from the content field and stored in the appropriate field for the record in the content index . This process is repeated for each of the exemplary portal tag subfields  through . The process concludes at step .","The indexing process may occur only once at the time of the content provider registration or additionally the content may be reindexed on a periodic basis such as daily, monthly or annually so that the index accurately reflects revisions and changes to the physical content located on the remote content servers .","V. User Search Process","Referring to , the user search process  is illustrated. The user search process begins at step . In step , the user accesses the portal server website. In step , the portal server offers the user a selection of content by category and type. The category and type of content is selected from among the categories and types of content that have been registered by content providers. In step , the portal server receives the user's content category and type selection. The portal server transmits a search request form to the user in step . The search request form contains search fields for each of the portal tags in the portal tagging standard related to the selected category and type. Alternatively, where the portal server has created an index of content for the selected category and type, the user may either be offered the opportunity to search on all fields or only those fields which have been indexed in the content index . If the content is not indexed the user may be offered the opportunity to search on any of the fields within the portal tagging standard or only the fields for the required tags. Additionally, the user may be offered the opportunity to search primarily within the fields relating to the required portal tags and secondarily search the fields associated with the nonrequired portal tags.","After completion of the search request form, in step , the portal server receives the user's search request. In step , the portal server determines whether the category and type of content to be searched has been indexed. If the category and type has been indexed, the process proceeds to step , and if it has not been indexed then to step .","Referring first to the indexed category and type of content, in step , the portal server searches the content index  for content matching the user's search request. As discussed in conjunction with step , the user's search request includes search terms associated with each search field related to a portal tag. Accordingly, the search is conducted on a field specific basis, wherein the search terms associated with search fields are compared with the content stored in the corresponding portal tag field in the content index . Each of the search terms and associated search fields in the search request is compared with each of the records in the content index. As the portal server identifies matches, it generates a list of the content index records that match the user search request.","Where a user has been permitted to search on portal tag fields that have not been indexed, the process proceeds to step . In step , if the user's search request includes search fields that have not been indexed, the portal server proceeds to search the content directly. When searching the content directly after conducting an index search, the portal server may be able to reduce the number of content sites it has to search by excluding content that did not match the search terms during the index search.","For example, referring to the sample content index shown in , assume a user submitted a search for \u201cNew York\u201d or \u201cConnecticut\u201d in the state field , and \u201c5\u201d or \u201cfive\u201d in the bedrooms field (not indexed). In response to this search request, since the bedrooms field has not been indexed, the portal server searches the content index  only for entries matching the search terms in the state field . In the illustrated records, records  and  are excluded because the state is \u201cNew Jersey\u201d. Records  and  are matches since the state for each is \u201cNew York\u201d. Since the bedroom field is not indexed, the portal server will search the decentralized content directly for the search terms associated with the bedroom field. Because the search request required a match in both the state field  \u201cand\u201d the bedrooms field, the search of decentralized content can exclude all content associated with entries not matching the state field  search terms; i.e. the portal server does not have to search content corresponding to index entries  and  since they have already been excluded as matches. The use of indexing and the combination of indexing and direct content search provides for increased speed and efficiency by eliminating or reducing the amount of full content based searching over the network.","Referring back to step , if the category and type of content are not indexed, the process proceeds to step . In step  the portal server directly searches the content for content matching the user's search request. The portal server first searches the registered provider database to identify all registered content in the selected category and type of content and the corresponding network addresses. The portal server in turn searches the content stored at each of the network addresses. For each piece of content, the portal server uses the key information in the registered provider database to cross-reference each portal tag associated with a search term to the corresponding provider tag. The portal server then searches the content to identify matching content fields. A matching content field is a content field identified by the provider tag corresponding to the portal tag associated with the search term. The portal server then compares the search term with the matching content field. This process repeats for each of the search terms and associated portal tags for all content in the selected category and type.","Referring to , the index and content search processes rejoin in step . In step  the process generates a summary of the content matching the user's search request. The summary of search results may be presented in a tabular form and includes links to the full content along with fields containing important information from the content. The information displayed should be selected based on the usefulness in helping the user review the result. Thus, displaying content corresponding to the required portal tags is a good starting point. In addition, displaying content corresponding to the searched portal fields may also be beneficial for the user. By providing a search summary, the user may quickly scan the vital information from each matching content site. In step  the summary is transmitted to the user for viewing.","In the illustrated embodiment, in step  the user is offered the opportunity to link to the full content of any of the entries listed in the summary. The portal server thereafter receives a user selection and transmits or links the user to the full content for the selected content. In step  the portal server determines if the viewer wants to view more entries for the summary. If so, the process returns to step . If not, the process ends at step .","Alternatively, in step  the user may be offered the opportunity to purchase or enter an auction for merchandise offered in content matching the user's search request. In this embodiment, the portal server may handle the auction and\/or transaction directly for the provider or direct the user to the provider's e-commerce or auction site.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the system and processes of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
