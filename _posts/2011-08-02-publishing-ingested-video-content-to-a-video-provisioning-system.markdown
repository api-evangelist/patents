The users may use video client devices (e.g., a set top box, etc.) to obtain free broadcast television video content (e.g., from Fox, ABC, CBS, etc.), on-demand video content (e.g., Video On-Demand (VOD), pay-per-view (PPV), etc.), and\/or pay television video content (e.g., from HBO, Cinemax, etc.) from cable television operators (e.g., Comcast, Time Warner, etc.) and\/or satellite television operators (e.g., DirectTV, Dish Network, etc.). The users may use computer devices, wireless mobile handset devices, etc. to obtain other video content from on-line content providers, such as television operators (e.g., ABC, Fox, CBS, etc.), over-the-top (OTT) content providers (e.g., Hulu, Veoh, Jaman, YouTube, etc.), and\/or other commercial content providers (e.g., Apple Computer's iTunes, Netflix, Blockbuster, etc.).","Unfortunately, the video content is not always received from content providers in a format and\/or protocol that can be played by the different types of user devices. Additionally, it is sometimes difficult to offer and\/or distribute the video content, to the different types of user devices and\/or via different types of networks, to enable the different types of user devices to access, obtain, or play the video content.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods, described herein, may enable video content, of different formats, which have been ingested and\/or processed by a video content management system (VCMS), to be published to a video provisioning system. Publishing the video content to the video provisioning system may allow different types of user devices to access, obtain, and\/or play the video content. The systems and\/or methods may enable the VCMS to perform the publication operation by encrypting the video content video to create packaged video content. The packaged video content may include copies of the video content that are formatted to be played on the different types of user devices when the video content is available for release to the user devices. The systems and\/or methods may enable the VCMS to publish the packaged video content to one or more destination devices, associated with the video provisioning system, from which the video asset can be obtained by the different types of user devices. The systems and\/or methods may enable ingested metadata, associated with the packaged video content, to be published to a store front portal that allows the different types of user devices to access the metadata to download and\/or play the video asset.","The different types of user devices may, for example, include computer devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, and tablet computers), wireless handset devices (e.g., mobile phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and tablet computers), and\/or set top boxes.

Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the embodiments.","While series of blocks have been described with regard to , the order of the blocks may be modified in other implementations. Further, non-dependent blocks may be performed in parallel.","It will be apparent that systems and\/or methods, as described above, may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement these systems and methods is not limiting of the embodiments. Thus, the operation and behavior of the systems and methods were described without reference to the specific software code--it being understood that software and control hardware can be designed to implement the systems and methods based on the description herein.","Further, certain portions, described above, may be implemented as a component that performs one or more functions. A component, as used herein, may include hardware, such as a processor, an ASIC, or a FPGA, or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., a processor executing software).","It should be emphasized that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d\/\u201ccomprising\u201d when used in this specification are taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.","Even though particular combinations of features are recited in the claims and\/or disclosed in the specification, these combinations are not intended to limit the disclosure of the embodiments. In fact, many of these features may be combined in ways not specifically recited in the claims and\/or disclosed in the specification. Although each dependent claim listed below may directly depend on only one other claim, the disclosure of the embodiments includes each dependent claim in combination with every other claim in the claim set.","No element, act, or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the embodiments unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items. Where only one item is intended, the term \u201cone\u201d or similar language is used. Further, the phrase \u201cbased on\u201d is intended to mean \u201cbased, at least in part, on\u201d unless explicitly stated otherwise."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2"],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
