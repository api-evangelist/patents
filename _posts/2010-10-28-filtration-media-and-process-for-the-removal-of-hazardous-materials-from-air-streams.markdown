General purpose filters, such as those employed by first responders and the military, for example, are designed to remove a wide range of toxic vapors. Examples of toxic vapors removed by general purpose filters include, for example, hydrogen cyanide, cyanogen chloride, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and chlorine. The filter, in its simplest form, consists of a housing into which filtration media is located. The contaminated air stream is passed through the bed of filtration media. It is upon contacting the contaminated air stream with the filtration media that toxic vapors are removed by either physical adsorption or by chemical reaction.","Typically, general purpose respirator filters employ activated carbon impregnated with basic metal salts which include, for example, copper-chromium, copper-molybdenum (U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,311), and copper\/zinc\/molybdenum (U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,882). Examples of basic metal salts include carbonates, hydroxides and oxides. In several instances, triethylenediamine is added to the formulation to promote the removal of cyanogen chloride (U.S. Pat. No. 4,802,898).","Carbon-based filtration media rely on the metal impregnants to facilitate chemical reactions. This is because the contribution of the carbon substrate to the chemical reactions is small. For example, mixtures of copper carbonate\/copper hydroxide may be impregnated into the pores of activated carbon to promote stoichiometric reactions involving the removal of acid gases, such as for example hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nCuCO+2HCl\u2192CuCl+HO+CO\n\nCu(OH)+2HCl\u2192CuCl+2HO\n","From the above reactions, the basic copper salts react with hydrochloric acid to produce the corresponding copper (II) chloride while liberating HO and, in the case of the carbonate, carbon dioxide (CO). Note that the above reactions are stoichiometric and not catalytic. That is to say, one copper carbonate or copper hydroxide molecule will remove two molecules of hydrochloric acid. As a result of the stoichiometric nature of the reaction, it is desired to maximize the number of reactive sites associated with the filtration media.","As is well known to one skilled in the art, a well dispersed metal phase is desired in order to maximize the number of sites available to facilitate the reactions necessary for the removal of toxic vapors. Often times, the loading of basic metal salts is limited to approximately 10% by weight metal to 15% by weight metal. Higher metal loadings can result in the formation of large metal particles, leading to pore blockage and a decreased overall effectiveness of the filtration media.","Procedures for impregnating activated carbon with basic impregnants are well known to one skilled in the art. These procedures involve mixing carbonates, hydroxides and\/or ammonium complexes of base metals such as for example copper (copper carbonate-hydroxide), molybdenum (ammonium molybdate), zinc (zinc carbonate-hydroxide) and vanadium (ammonium vanadate), in concentrated ammonium hydroxide solutions. Optionally, ammonium carbonate is added. The solution is used to impregnate activated carbon granules to the desired metal loading. Materials prepared according to this procedure do not; however, disperse the metal phase throughout the pore structure. For example, it has been reported that activated carbon impregnated with copper and zinc, or copper, zinc and molybdenum, results in locating zinc primarily at the external surface of the granule, versus a zinc phase well dispersed throughout the pore structure (Rossin and Morrison, 29, (1991) 887; Rossin and Morrison, 31, (1993) 657). The net effect is a reduced dispersion of zinc and a poor utilization of the zinc phase.","One mechanism for increasing the effectiveness of a filtration media to facilitate stoichiometric reactions is to employ a functionalized porous media. In this manner, the support, along with the impregnants, will be capable of contributing to stoichiometric reactions leading to the removal of toxic vapors.","Substrates other than activated carbon are known to be useful in removing toxic chemicals. One example is zirconium hydroxide, (Peterson et al., 48 (2009) 1694), wherein zirconium hydroxide was found to remove sulfur dioxide from streams of air in an order of magnitude greater than the value achieved for activated carbon.","The removal of cyanide compounds, such as for example hydrogen cyanide, is of special interest to this invention. Base metal carbonates, hydroxides and oxides of copper and zinc are known by one skilled in the art to be effective in the removal of hydrogen cyanide. For example, hydrogen cyanide is removed upon contact with, for example, copper carbonate according to the following reactions:\n\nCuCO+2HCN\u2192Cu(CN)+HO+CO\n\n2Cu(CN)\u2192CuCN+CN\n","According to the first reaction, copper carbonate reacts with hydrogen cyanide to form copper (II) cyanide. Copper cyanide subsequently decomposes to yield copper (I) cyanide, liberating cyanogen, which is highly toxic and therefore an undesired by-product. The addition of molybdenum to the formulation has been shown to minimize the formation of cyanogen; however, cyanogen formation is not eliminated all together. The role of molybdenum in minimizing cyanogen formation is not clear. One possible explanation is that molybdenum complexes with copper, increasing the stability of the copper (II) cyanide complex.","Zinc is much more preferred in applications involving the removal of cyanide compounds, such as for example hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is removed upon contact with zinc carbonate, for example, according to the following reaction:\n\nZnCO+2HCN\u2192Zn(CN)+HO+CO\n","There is no reduction of zinc (II) cyanide to zinc (I) cyanide, as per reactions involving copper as described above. This is because zinc does not possess a stable+1 oxidation state, and, as a result, the product zinc (II) cyanide is stable.","There are issues associated with the use of zinc only in carbon-based filtration media. In order for an impregnant to be effective, the impregnant must be well dispersed throughout the pore structure of the media. As stated above, impregnation of carbon-based media with zinc results in the zinc being confined to a region at or very near the external surface of the granule, leading to a poor metal dispersion and consequently a poor utilization of zinc.","The removal of cyanogen chloride is also of special interest to the present invention. Triethylenediamine (TEDA) is known by one skilled in the art to be effective in the removal of cyanogen chloride. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that TEDA catalyzes the hydrolysis of cyanogen chloride as described below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"4.83mm","wi":"46.74mm","file":"US08877677-20141104-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Reaction product hydrochloric acid, HCl, is then removed via reaction with base metal carbonates, hydroxides and\/or oxides, or via reaction with TEDA. Reactions involving HCl and TEDA will poison TEDA. As known by one skilled in the art, the addition of base metal oxides, hydroxides and\/or oxides to TEDA impregnated activated carbon will increase the service time of the filter.","Thus an objective of the present invention is to provide an improved filtration media for removing hazardous materials from air streams. Another objective is to incorporate at least one reactive moiety within the filtration media, to enhance the filtration performance. A further objective is to provide a method of using the improved filtration media to remove hazardous materials from air streams.","The present invention relates to a novel filtration media and process for removing toxic materials from streams of air at ambient conditions using the novel filtration media. The filtration media is comprised of porous zirconium hydroxide onto which at least one reactive moiety is impregnated. The reactive moiety is selected from materials which react with the toxic materials and\/or catalyze reaction of the toxic materials with other moieties.","The present invention relates to a novel filtration media and process for removing toxic materials from streams of air at ambient conditions. The novel filtration media is comprised of porous zirconium hydroxide, Zr(OH), impregnated with at least one reactive and\/or catalytic moiety.","Substrate","Zirconium hydroxide (Zr(OH)) is employed as a reactive substrate in the present invention. Although we refer to the substrate as zirconium hydroxide, the product may be in the form of a polymorph of zirconium hydroxide, zirconium oxyhydroxide and zirconium oxide. As sold on the commercial market, zirconium hydroxide is an amorphous, white powder that is insoluble in water. Zirconium hydroxide may be prepared by precipitating zirconium salts, such as for example zirconium oxynitrate and zirconium oxychloride, in aqueous solutions using alkaline solutions to bring about precipitation. Examples of alkaline solutions include ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Alternatively, zirconium hydroxide may be purchased as a commercial product from vendors that include Magnesium Electron (Flemington, N.J., USA). The structure of zirconium hydroxide, Zr(OH), may be represented as a two-dimensional square lattice, each connected by a double hydroxyl bridge yielding a stoichiometric Zr(OH). Zr(OH)particles contain both terminal and bridging hydroxyl groups (Southern et al., Chem. Mater. 14 (2002) 4313).","Table 1 below compares the density and porosity of zirconium hydroxide granules to activated carbon granules representative of those employed by the prior art in the preparation of filtration media. The carbon granules were obtained from Calgon Carbon Corporation as product CWS carbon. The Zr(OH)was purchased from Magnesium Electron, Inc. (New Jersey, USA). In Table 1, the surface area is expressed in units of mper cmof filter volume (m\/cm) and the pore volume is expressed in units of cmpore volume per cmfilter volume rather than the standard units of m\/g and cm\/g, respectively. The former units are employed to account for the difference in the density of the two materials. Zr(OH), because of the higher molecular weight of zirconium relative to carbon, has a much higher density. Filters are filled by volume, not weight. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, we believe the surface area and pore volume contained in the filter volume is far more important than the specific surface area (expressed in units of m\/g) and specific pore volume (expressed in units of cm\/g).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Material","Density","Surface Area","Pore Volume"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Activated Carbon","0.47 cm\/g","520 m\/cm","0.31 cm\/cm"]},{"entry":[{},"Zr(OH)","0.93 cm\/g","415 m\/cm","0.35 cm\/cm"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Zr(OH)has sufficient capacity in its own right for the removal of many toxic vapors. However, such basis media will not possess sufficient capacity for the removal of many toxic vapors, such as for example hydrogen cyanide, and will thus require the addition of base metals, or mixtures thereof, to facilitate said removal.","Reactive Moieties\/Functional Groups","At least one reactive and\/or catalytic moiety\/functional group is\/are incorporated onto the substrate. Suitable reactive moieties are selected from base metals. The suitable base metals include vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, silver molybdenum, and mixtures thereof. Copper, zinc, and silver are preferred. Zinc is even more preferred, since zinc will not form the hazardous product cyanogen upon exposure to hydrogen cyanide. The base metal may be in several forms, such as for example, free metal, carbonates, oxides and hydroxides. Carbonates and hydroxides are the preferred form. The base metal is present in the amount of about 5% to about 40% by weight of the filtration media. An amount of about 15% to about 25% is also useful.","Other reactive moieties can be incorporated into the zirconium hydroxide substrate. Of particular interest are amines which are useful in applications involving toxic chemicals that may be removed via hydrolysis reactions, such as, for example, those reactions described for cyanogen chloride as described previously.","The suitable amines are triethylamine (TEA), quinuclidine (QUIN), triethylenediamine (TEDA), pyridine, and pyridine carboxylic acids such as pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (P4CA). Triethylenediamine is most preferred. The loading of TEDA can be as low as 0%, if hydrolysis activity is not desired in the application, or up to about 15% by weight of the filtration media, should hydrolysis activity be desired. A preferred amount of TEDA used is from about 3% to about 6% by weight of the filtration media.","The present invention optionally includes at least one alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal to enhance filtration performance. Such metals are selected from lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium and barium. The alkali or alkaline earth metal may be present as an oxide, hydroxide or carbonate, or mixture thereof. Up to 5% of alkali or alkaline earth metal can be used. An amount of about 0.5% to about 3% by weight of the filtration media is also useful.","Method for Preparing the Novel Filtration Media","Porous zirconium hydroxide impregnated with reactive moieties may be prepared using techniques well known to one skilled in the art. However, it should be noted that the method of preparation can have a significant impact on the performance of the resulting material. One method of preparation is to form zirconium hydroxide powder into particles, beads, extrudates, etc. of the desired mesh size. The powder (in agglomerated or non-agglomerated form) is then impregnated using ammonium solutions containing the target concentration of base metal(s) and, if desired, alkali metals. Following impregnation, the material is then dried at temperatures not to exceed about for example 200\u00b0 C., and preferably not to exceed about for example 100\u00b0 C., as this will bring about the dehydration of the zirconium hydroxide, reducing its porosity and also its filtration effectiveness.","Following drying, the impregnated material, if desired, can then be forwarded for amine (such as for example TEDA) impregnation. Using TEDA as an example, amine impregnation may be performed using techniques known to one skilled in the art. Preferably, TEDA is impregnated via a sublimation operation. For example, a known mass of impregnated formed powder plus the desired amount of TEDA are loaded into a V-blender or rotating drum, for example, for the purpose of contacting the formed powder with TEDA. During the operation, TEDA will sublime into the pores of the formed powder over time. Heating the apparatus to temperatures on the order of about 50\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C., for example, will speed the sublimation operation.","A more preferred method of preparation involves impregnation of the porous Zr(OH)in the form of a powder. This is accomplished using impregnation techniques as described above. For example, the Zr(OH)powder is preferably dried at for example 100\u00b0 C. to remove pre-adsorbed moisture. An impregnation solution is prepared by dissolving a base metal salt, e.g. carbonate in a concentrated ammonium solution. The powder is then contacted with the solution until incipient wetness is achieved. At this point, the powder is dried in an oven at for example 100\u00b0 C. Once dry, the powder can be impregnated with TEDA by placing the desired amount of powder and the desired amount of TEDA in a device designed to contact the two materials, such as for example a V-blender or rotating drum. The TEDA and impregnated powder are blended for a time sufficient to allow the TEDA to sublime into the pores. The TEDA containing impregnated powder is then formed into the desired geometric form, e.g. particles, beads, extrudates, etc., of the desired size using techniques known to those skilled in the art. One method is to form the powder into pills or tablets using a tableting machine. Alternatively, the powder can be pressed into large tablets, which are then crushed and sieved into particles of the desired mesh size.","An even more preferred method of preparation involves precipitation of the metals onto the porous Zr(OH)substrate. For example, Zr(OH)powder is slurried in water. To the slurry is added a predetermined amount of alkali metal hydroxide, such as for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide. A second solution is prepared containing a base metal salt dissolved in DI water, for example zinc sulfate, zinc nitrate, zinc chloride, zinc acetate, copper sulfate, copper nitrate, copper chloride, silver nitrate, silver chloride, silver acetate, silver sulfate etc. Mixtures of salts may also be employed. The solution is then added to the slurry. The pH of the slurry is then adjusted to the target value, of between about 5 and about 13, preferably between about 7 and about 11, more preferably between about 9 and about 10. The pH adjuster is an appropriate acid, such as for example sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid or formic acid. The reduction in pH will result in the base metal being precipitated onto the surface of the zirconium hydroxide substrate, likely in the form of a metal hydroxide, such as zinc hydroxide, copper hydroxide, etc. Upon completion of the precipitation, the slurry is filtered, then washed with DI water to remove any residual acid. The resulting solids are dried. The resulting dried powder may then be impregnated with TEDA as described previously. Upon completion of the TEDA impregnation operation, the resulting powder may be formed into particles as described previously using techniques known to one skilled in the art.","An advantage of the above mentioned precipitation procedure is that the use of ammonia can be readily avoided. This is important, as filtration media employed in general purpose respirators have issues related to ammonia off-gassing as a result of impregnating the media using concentrated ammonia solutions.","The nature and loading of reactive moieties will depend upon the application. For applications that involve cyanide gases, for example hydrogen cyanide, zinc is the preferred reactive moieties since undesired by-product cyanogen will not form.","Process for Filtration of Toxic Chemicals Using Novel Filtration Media","The novel process disclosed herein involves contacting a bed of filtration media as described herein with an air stream containing toxic vapors or aerosol particles contained within the air stream. Non-limiting examples of toxic vapors include acid gases, blood agents, or blistering agents selected from hydrogen cyanide, cyanogen chloride, phosgene, hydrochloric acid, fuming nitric acid, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen bromide, carbonyl fluoride, fluorine and sarin. Aerosol chemical warfare agents as well as industrial toxins can also be filtered from the air stream. Non-limiting examples further include AChE-inhibiting pesticides such as parathion, paraoxon and malathion, organophosphorus-based (\u201cOP\u201d) compounds, and nerve or vesicant agents selected from sarin (GB), bis-(2-chloroethyl)sulfide (HD or mustard gas), pinacolyl methylphosphonothiolate (GD) and 0-ethyl S-(2-diisopropylamino)ethyl methylphosphonothiolate (VX), as well as analogs and derivatives of these agents. Industrial toxins may include parathion. Aerosol chemicals will either evaporate into the vapor phase upstream of the filter bed, or accumulate as droplets on the filter material, only to be absorbed within the pores of the solid at a later time. Alternatively, the aerosol chemicals may be entrapped on a particle filter (located upstream of the filter media), whereby the entrained chemical will evaporate over time and adsorb within the pores of the filtration media. The concentration of toxic materials in the contaminated air stream can be greater than 1% by volume. The filter may be any device that brings into contact the contaminated air stream with the filter material. Such as for example, the filter can be a standard respirator filter worn on a face mask or one employed in collective protection applications such as involving vehicles and buildings. It is desired that the filter be of sufficient volume to provide a contact time between the air stream and the filter media of at least 0.05 seconds, and preferably of at least 0.15 seconds.","The novel process disclosed herein is designed to operate under ambient conditions, which can vary significantly based on the location and environmental conditions. Generally, the novel process described herein is designed to operate as low as for example \u221220\u00b0 C. and as high as for example 49\u00b0 C. The humidity of the process stream may be as low as for example less than 5% relative humidity to as high as for example greater than 90% relative humidity.","Breakthrough testing was performed for the purpose of determining the ability of the novel filtration material described herein to remove toxic vapors from streams of air. Methods for performing breakthrough testing are well known to one skilled in the art. Briefly, a known volume of filtration media is loaded into a tube and supported on an entrainment device such as a fine mesh screen. The filtration media is contacted with the contaminated air at the target humidity (water content), flow rate and temperature. The effluent stream is monitored continuously or at discrete intervals for the concentration of toxic chemical or hazardous by-product. The breakthrough time is defined as the time in which the effluent concentration of toxic chemical exceeds a threshold value (referred to as breakthrough concentration). Analytical devices used to determine the concentration of toxic chemical in the feed or effluent streams include, but are not limited to, infra red spectrometers, gas chromatographs, and UV visible detectors.","Zirconium hydroxide powder was purchased from a commercial vendor. The powder was pressed into wafers approximately 2.5 cm in diameter and 1 to 2 mm thick using a steel die and a hydraulic press. The resulting wafers were crushed and sieved to yield 12\u00d730 mesh particles. The particles were forwarded for breakthrough testing.","SObreakthrough testing was performed by adding 15.1 cmof 12\u00d730 mesh Zr(OH)particles to a 3.1 cm i.d. test cell. The volume of 12\u00d730 mesh Zr(OH)particles was sufficient to achieve a bed depth of 2.0 cm. The media in the test cell was challenged with 2,000 mg\/mof SOin air at 15% relative humidity (RH) with a total flow rate of 4,350 ml\/min.
