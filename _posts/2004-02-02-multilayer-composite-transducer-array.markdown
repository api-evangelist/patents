title: Multi-layer composite transducer array
abstract: A multi-layer composite transducer array includes at least one pair of composite transducers with an electrical and mechanical isolation layer disposed therebetween. Each composite transducer is defined by a composite panel having a common electrode coupled to a first surface and electrode segments electrically isolated from one another and coupled to a second surface. Each pair of composite transducers is configured such that the electrode segments associated with the pair's composite transducers oppose and are aligned with one another. The isolation layer has dielectric material segments that are sized, shaped and aligned in correspondence with opposing and aligned ones of the electrode segments associated with the pair's transducers. Spaces formed in the isolation layer between the dielectric material segments are filled with a viscoelastic material.

Existing homing array technology uses numerous narrowband and high-power longitutdinal tonpilz resonators to form the aperture of an active transducer. Each tonpilz resonator consists of several active and inactive mechanical components that work together as a spring-mass, single degree-of-freedom system. Unfortunately, tonpilz resonators are expensive to fabricate and offer only a limited operational bandwidth above their first length mode resonance.","To address operational bandwidth limitations of tonpilz resonators, recent work has focused on constructing multi-resonance tonpilz elements using 1\u20133 piezocomposites as the active component. While this approach provides improved bandwidth when compared to that of the original single-mode tonpilz resonators, these devices are still limited to first order resonance. Furthermore, the fixed-size radiation head masses inherent to tonpilz resonators prevent them from being used to realize resonators that are \u201cfrequency agile\u201d.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a transducer array that can operate in a broadband frequency range.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a broadband transducer array that is inexpensive to fabricate.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, a multi-layer composite transducer array includes at least one pair of composite transducers with a layer of dielectric material segments interposed therebetween. Each composite transducer is defined by a piezoelectric polymer composite panel having opposing first and second surfaces with at least one common electrode coupled to the first surface and a plurality of electrode segments electrically isolated from one another and coupled to the second surface. Each pair of composite transducers is configured such that the electrode segments associated with a first composite transducer oppose and are aligned with the electrode segments associated with a second composite transducer. Each dielectric material segment in the layer thereof is sized, shaped and aligned in correspondence with opposing and aligned ones of the electrode segments associated with the first and second composite transducers. Spaces formed in the layer between the dielectric material segments are filled with a viscoelastic material.","Referring now to the drawings, simultaneous reference will be made to  where a multi-layer composite transducer array is shown and referenced generally by numeral . More specifically,  is an exploded perspective view depicting a pair of composite transducers having a segmented electrode surface and isolation layer disposed between the composite transducers, and  is a side view of an assembled embodiment of the multi-layer array.","Array  has a pair of composite transducers  and  with an electrical and mechanical isolation layer  disposed therebetween. Each of composite transducers  and  is identically constructed so that the following description of composite transducer  applies to composite transducer . A plurality of electrode segments  are supported on a first major surface of a piezoelectric polymer composite panel . The number, size and shape of electrode segments is not a limitation of the present invention. Details of a suitable composite panel are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,255,761, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, composite panel  is constructed using spaced-apart piezoelectric (e.g., a ferroelectric material such as piezoceramic materials lead zirconate titanate or lead titanate) columns or rods  that span the thickness or height H of composite panel . Filling the spaces between rods  for the full height thereof is a viscoelastic material  such as a thermoplastic epoxy.","Each of electrode segments  can have a dedicated electrical lead coupled thereto. This can be accomplished by passing conductors (e.g., conductors  and  are illustrated in ) through a side of composite panel . More specifically, each of conductors  and  is routed through viscoelastic material  and electrically coupled to one of electrode segments . The second major surface of composite panel  has a single common electrode  that substantially spans and is coupled to composite panel . Note, however, that the single common electrode  could be replaced with a plurality of common electrodes (i.e., at the same potential) without departing form the scope of the present invention. Typically, the height H of composite panel  is the same throughout so that planes defined by electrode segments  and common electrode  are parallel to one another.","Each layer of the multi-layer array can also be shaped to conform to simple or complex contours if viscoelastic material  comprises a thermoplastic material such as thermoplastic epoxy. For example, as illustrated in , composite panel  has been shaped (e.g., by heating) such that the planes defined by, electrode segments  and common electrode  are curved in correspondence with one another and composite panel .","Composite transducers  and  are configured and positioned in array  such that electrode segments  on composite transducer  oppose and are aligned with electrode segments on composite transducer . Separating composite transducers  and  is isolation layer  that consists of dielectric material segments  extending through layer  and a viscoelastic material  that can be the same material as that used for viscoelastic material . Each of dielectric material segments  is sized, shaped and aligned with opposing and aligned ones of electrode segments  from composite transducers  and . Since electrode segments  are electrically isolated from one another by spaces therebetween, similar spaces are formed between dielectric material segments . The spaces between segments  (and regions surrounding segments  up to the edges of array ) are filled with viscoelastic material . In this way, dielectric material segments  provide the needed electrical isolation between opposing electrodes  on composite transducers  and , while viscoelastic material  provides mechanical damping and isolation between composite transducers  and .","Composite transducers  and  are typically bonded to isolation layer  by an adhesive  so that no external type of clamping is required to hold array  together. Any commercially-available structural adhesive can be used provided it is acoustically transparent and can withstand the rigors of the environment in which array  is to be deployed.","The multi-layer composite transducer array described herein can be used as part of an underwater array assembly such as assembly  illustrated in  where like reference numerals are used to describe the elements incorporated into assembly . A waterproof housing (e.g., a waterproof encapsulant)  has one or more arrays  (e.g., two are shown) fitted and sealed therein. An acoustic absorbing material  (e.g., a particle-filled epoxy) partially fills waterproof housing . The lowermost composite transducer in the stack of multi-layer arrays  is coupled to acoustic absorbing material  by means of adhesive . More specifically, common electrode  of the lowermost composite transducer is adhered to acoustic absorbing material . At the other end of the stack of multi-layer arrays , common electrode  of the uppermost composite transducer abuts waterproof housing . Note that this portion of waterproof housing  must be acoustically transparent to facilitate the transmission of sound waves. Another isolation layer  is disposed between arrays  and is coupled to each of arrays  by adhesive .","Signal electronics  can be located within and\/or outside of housing  as illustrated. Conductors (not shown for clarity of illustration) coupling signal electronics  to the electrodes (i.e., electrode segments  and common electrodes ) in multi-layer arrays  are passed through acoustic absorbing material  and through each composite transducer's composite panel as described above.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Broadband operation is achieved owing to the combination of: (i) the inherent broadband resonance of each composite transducer's piezoelectric polymer composite panel , and (ii) the fact that the array's individual layers can be separately addressed\/tuned to a different frequency range. The present invention also provides an improved spatial field-of-view since numerous elements may be formed by selectively applying electrodes over the array aperture to form elements having different (non-uniform) apertures. The invention teaches element apertures that can be varied in size by simply addressing electrode segments separately. High frequency responses are achieved using small sized electrode segments. The electrode segments can be combined for low frequency responses, or larger sized electrode segments could be used.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
