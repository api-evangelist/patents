The memristor name is a contraction for memory resistor [1] because that is exactly its function: to remember its history [3]. The memristor is a two terminal passive device whose resistance state depends on its previous state and present electrical biasing conditions. And combined with transistors in a hybrid chip, memristors could radically improve the performance of digital circuits without the necessity to shrink transistors [3]. Given their two terminal structural simplicity and electronic passivity, the applications for memristor technology range from non-volatile memory, instant on computers, reconfigurable electronics and neuromorphic computing [4],[3]. According to Chua [4], the memristor behaves like a linear resistor with memory but exhibits many interesting nonlinear characteristics, and several electronic models have been presented to describe the electrical behavior of memristor devices [1],[4],[2],[5],[6]. However, given that memristor devices are not commercially available, good physical model to hardware methods have not yet been reported m the published literature. Therefore, methods for accurate memristor modeling is an impending need.","Prior Art Memristor Models","Referring to  depicts the typical DC electrical Lissajous I-V curve characteristic response of a memristor device measured under test with a sinusoidal input of 0.5 V volts amplitude and 100 Hz frequency.

As the memristor device transitions from a low conductivity state to a high conductivity state it exhibits highly nonlinear diode-like characteristics at approximately \u22120.35 and 0.2 V threshold voltages, respectively. that switched the device from a low conductivity state to a high conductivity state and vice-versa.

Over the course of developing the present invention attempts were made to fit linear and nonlinear models to fit memristor hardware with little success, primarily because these prior art published models don't represent accurately the electrical characteristic behavior of memristor dence hardware. Therefore, the present invention developed the steps for achieving a compact model that accurately represents the electrical behavior of chalcogenide based memristors. The models produced by the present invention consists of a threshold memristor model similar to those utilized in state of the art CMOS modeling and simulation as for example the well known BSIM4.6.4 from the University of California, Berkeley. These types of compact models have proven very valuable within the microelectronics industry given their straight forward singled valued mathematical formulations that make modeling and simulation within very large scale integrated circuits fast, reliable and accurate. Common CMOS transistors operate within various regions of operation, cutoff, ohmic and saturation. Similarly. the present invention provided a method for developing a memristor model that operates within three regions: off, nonlinear and on. Therefore, the goal of the present invention is to develop a compact memristor model that describes the electrical behavior of memristor devices, and it is simple and accurate to enable large scale device simulations.","Measured Results on Memristors","All hardware memristor devices which were measured as the basis for development of the present invention modeling were fabricated and tested at Boise State University, and the fabrication details have been described elsewhere [7]. The physical structure of the memristor devices characterized was composed of three thin films of Ag, SnSe and Ge2Se3 sandwiched between tungsten metal contacts. All electrical DC measurements were performed with an Agilent B 1500A (HP4145B) semiconductor parameter analyzer and Micromanipulator 6200 microprobe station equipped with temperature controllable wafer chuck and tungsten probe W tips (Micromanipulator size 7A) at room temperature. The tested memristor devices were 180 nm in diameter with 80 um\u00d780 um tungsten pads for electrical contact to the top and bottom electrodes. All of the electrical measurements performed and recorded (see , ) by the semiconductor parameter analyzer can be input to a computer over a standard data bus in real time, or stored onto other recording media or removable memory device for further processing by specialized modeling software which prescribes the necessary computer executed steps. The specialized software will generate a model corresponding to the measured and recorded parameters of the particular memristor under test. Of course, models corresponding to the recorded measured parameters can be either automatically or manually plotted (see , ).","For nonlinear modeling, if one considers the actual memristor regions of operation where the nonlinear behavior dominates below or above the threshold voltages, \u22120.35 and 0.2 V respectively (see , , ), prior art models (see , ) do not replicate measure hardware (see , ) for either p=1 and p=10 (see , , ). Given the lack of measured and model correlation for both linear and nonlinear memristor prior art models, the present invention has developed an empirical memristor modeling method that can be employed to accurately capture the DC electrical Lissajous I-V curve characteristic behavior of memristor devices.","Referring to , one important characteristic of memristor devices is the fact that their present behavior is dependent on their past state. Therefore, the present invention models electronic characteristic behavior as being dependent on the previous memristor state requiring the need for determining a set of initial conditions. For example, R(t=T) represents the state or the memristor device at an initial time T. Rand Rmust be determined (see , ) as they represent final states of the memristor device. Assuming that the memristor device initial state corresponds to R(t=0)=Rand that in time an input potential voltage greater than T(see , ) is present across the device and which is also a parameter requiring determination, the present invention models the behavior of the memristor device as
