{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Obtaining fast and accurate identification of a subject has always been a concern of public and private security institutions, including, without limitation, law enforcement, military, private security, among other personnel. Obtaining fast and accurate identification of a subject including any prior and current history of the subject can be useful to law enforcement, military, private security, among other personnel, associated with public and private security institutions.","Biometric scanners are available which can capture an image of a fingerprint or palm-print. A signal representative of the captured image is sent over a data communication interface to a host computer for further processing. For example, the host can perform a one-to-one or one-to-many fingerprint matching.","Current fingerprinting devices for use in the field present issues of safety and use. Handheld scanners can be cumbersome and do not leave hands free for rapid response to changing conditions. Handheld scanners also require police to come within arms-reach of a suspect. Additionally, current fingerprinting devices cannot be used unobtrusively to identify suspects without arousing suspicion.","Accordingly, there is a need for surreptitious biometric identification capabilities for use in the field.","Methods and apparatus for surreptitiously identifying a suspect are disclosed.","In one embodiment, a sensor is configured to produce an electrical signal corresponding to a biometrics signature of a subject. The sensor is configured to be surreptitiously mounted to a surface. The surface may be, but is not limited to, the surface of a vehicle, a door surface, or a surface that comes into frequent contact with a biometric signature.","In various embodiments, a biometric sensor may comprise a capacitive sensor, thermal sensor, electromagnetic sensor, optical sensor, or ultrasonic sensor, among others.","In one embodiment, a surreptitious biometric acquisition apparatus is mounted to an entry point of a building to assist in entry-exit control. The surreptitious biometric acquisition apparatus may be mounted to a door handle or other surface that commonly comes into contact with biometric signatures. In another embodiment, a surreptitious biometric acquisition apparatus is mounted to the surface of a vehicle, such as a police vehicle. The surreptitious biometric acquisition apparatus is formed integrally with the surface of the vehicle.","In one embodiment, a method for surreptitiously identifying a suspect comprises obtaining an analog signal representing biometric data of the subject. The analog signal is converted into a digital signal by a signal processing module. The digital signal is then transmitted to a first processing node, where it is processed for later comparison. The processed signal is then transmitted to a database of known biometric information, where the biometric signature is compared to the known information in the database. If a match is found, the database then transmits identifying information of the subject to the first processing module for display. If no match is found, a no match indicator is transmitted instead.","Various embodiments of a surreptitious biometric acquisition apparatus, as disclosed herein, can be used for identification of subjects. Identifying subjects through biometric data can be useful in a variety of situations including, but not limited too, law enforcement, military, and private security.","In one embodiment of a surreptitious biometric acquisition apparatus, illustrated in  a biometric acquisition module  is formed integrally with the surface of a vehicle . In the embodiment illustrated in , the biometric acquisition module  is formed integrally with a hood  of the vehicle . In other embodiments, the biometric acquisition module  may be formed with any suitable surface of the vehicle , including but not limited to the trunk, the roof, or side panels. The biometric acquisition module  is communicatively coupled to a first node . In one embodiment, communication between the biometric acquisition module  and the first node  can be, for example, a wired or wireless connection. The first node  is configured to receive a signal from the biometric acquisition module  that contains biometric data associated with a suspect that has come in contact with the biometric acquisition module . In one embodiment, the first node  can be a laptop computer located inside of the vehicle . In another embodiment, the first node  can be an independent system installed into the vehicle specifically configured for biometric identification. The first node  is configured to transmit the biometric data to a biometric database  via a network .","The biometric database  can be any suitable database containing biometric and identifying information of subjects. In one embodiment, the biometric database  can be a government-maintained identification database, for example, Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Eurodac Fingerprint Database, or any other government biometric database. In another embodiment, the biometric database  can be a privately built and maintained biometric database, for example, created by an employer containing biometric data of employees. The biometric database  compares the received biometric signal with stored data, e.g., biometric and identifying information of subjects, and transmits the results of the search back to the first node , or other nodes, for example. In one embodiment, biometric database  transmits the results of the search to the first node . In one embodiment, the first node  can then display the match information to the police officer, for example, by displaying the subject's identity on the screen of an in-car laptop computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","102","102","102","102","102","104","102","104","102","104","104","102","104","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3B","b":["202","202","218","220","222","220","222","220","222","202","202","202","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["218","212","208","208","212","226","208","224","212","212","218","212","210","206","206","212","208"]},"The capacitive biometric sensor  operates as follows: a suspect places a biometric signature, e.g., finger with fingerprint or palm with palm-print, on top of an insulating layer . A switch  is closed by the sensor , causing a short circuit between the inverting terminal  and the output voltage . This causes the circuit to be in a balanced state, wherein the output voltage  is equal to the reference voltage . The switch  is then opened, which causes the reference voltage  to charge the first and second capacitive plates A and B. The presence of a biometric signature, e.g., finger with fingerprint, acts as a third capacitive plate and causes the capacitance of the feedback loop to vary. The capacitance varies with respect to whether a biometric ridge or valley is present. The variance in capacitance between the first and second capacitive plates A, B and the biometric signature causes a variation in the voltage at the inverting terminal , which in turn causes a variation in the output voltage . This variation can be interpreted by the signal processing module  () as indicating a ridge or valley of a biometric signature. Referring back to , a complete image of the suspect's biometric signature is developed by the signal processing module  () by interpreting the output voltage  of each of the capacitive elements  in the array of the capacitive biometric sensor .","In one embodiment, the insulating layer  may comprise a transparent conducting film (TCF), which may be fabricated from either organic or inorganic materials. Inorganic films may comprise a layer of transparent conducting oxide (TCO), generally in the form of indium tin oxide (ITO), fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), and doped zinc oxide. Organic films may be constructed of carbon nanotube networks and graphene. Transparent conducting films act both as a window for light to pass through to the active material beneath and as an ohmic contact for carrier transport out of the photovoltaic. Transparent materials possess bandgaps with energies corresponding to wavelengths which are shorter than the visible range (380 nm to 750 nm). As such, photons with energies below the bandgap are not collected by these materials and this visible light passes through.","In one embodiment, the insulating layer  may comprise a transparent conductive oxide. Transparent conductive oxides (TCO) are doped metal oxides used in optoelectronic devices. TCO films may be fabricated with polycrystalline or amorphous microstructures. TCO films may use electrode materials that have greater than 80% transmittance of incident light, for example, as well as conductiveness higher than 10S\/cm, for example. The transmittance of TCO films, just as in any transparent material, is limited by light scattering at defects and grain boundaries. Mobility in TCO films is limited by ionized impurity scattering, and may be on the order of 40 cm\/(V*s) for example. In one embodiment, TCO films may be made from n-type conductors. TCO films may be manufactured from, for example, tin-doped indium-oxide (ITO), aluminum-doped zinc-oxide (AZO), or indium-doped cadmium-oxide, or binary metal oxides without any intentional impurity doping. Binary metal oxides may be n-type with a carrier concentration on the order of 10cm.","Doped metal oxides for use as transparent conducting layers may be grown on glass substrates. The glass substrate, apart from providing a support that the oxide can grow on, has the additional benefit of blocking most infrared wavelengths greater than 2 \u03bcm for most silicates, and converting it to heat in the glass layer. This process helps maintain a low temperature of active region of the TCO. TCO films may be deposited on a substrate through various deposition methods, including metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), metal organic molecular beam deposition (MOMBD), spray pyrolysis, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), or magnetron sputtering of the film. Magnetron sputtering is very inefficient, with only 30% of the material actually being deposited on the substrate. In the case of ITO, this inefficiency is a significant drawback. TCO growth may be performed in a reducing environment to encourage oxygen vacancy formation within the film, which contribute to the carrier concentration (if n-type).","Charge carriers in these oxides arise from three fundamental sources: interstitial metal ion impurities, oxygen vacancies, and doping ions. The first two sources always act as electron donors In one embodiment, TCO films may be fabricated solely using these two intrinsic sources as carrier generators. When an oxygen vacancy is present in the lattice it acts as a doubly-charged electron donor. In ITO, for example, each oxygen vacancy causes the neighboring In3+ ion 5s orbitals to be stabilized from the 5s conduction band by the missing bonds to the oxygen ion, while two electrons are trapped at the site due to charge neutrality effects. The stabilization of the 5s orbitals causes a formation of donor level for the oxygen ion, determined to be 0.03 eV below the conduction band.","Dopant ionization within the oxide occurs in the same way as in other semiconductor crystals. Shallow donors near the conduction band (n-type) allow electrons to be thermally excited into the conduction band, while acceptors near the valence band (p-type) allow electrons to jump from the valence band to the acceptor level, populating the valence band with holes. Charged impurity ions and point defects have scattering cross-sections that are much greater than their neutral counterparts. Increasing the scattering decreases the mean-free path of the carriers in the oxide, which leads to poor device performance and a high resistivity.","In one embodiment, the insulating layer  may comprise a transparent conducting polymer. Transparent conducting polymers (TCP) have conjugated double bonds which allow for conduction. The effective bandgap is the separation between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. TCPs have conductivity below that of TCOs and have low absorption of the visible spectrum allowing them to act as transparent conductors. The TCPs can be made into flexible films making them desirable despite their low conductivity. This makes them useful in the development of flexible electronics, such as biometric sensors, where traditional transparent conductors will fail. TCP films may be fabricated from, for example, Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), doped-PEDOT with poly(styrene sulfonate), Poly(4,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), or Poly(4,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with iodine or 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano 1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ).","In one embodiment, the insulating layer  may comprise a carbon nanotube (CNT) film. CNT films have high elastic modulus, high tensile strength, and high conductivity. CNT films may be prepared in three steps: the CNT growth process, putting the CNTs in solution, and finally, creation of the CNT thin film. Nanotubes may be grown using laser ablation, electric-arc discharge, or different form of chemical vapor deposition. Density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) may be applied to separate CNTs by density. In order to separate the grown tubes, the CNTs are mixed with surfactant and water and sonicated until satisfactory separation occurs. This solution is then sprayed onto the desired substrate in order to create a CNT thin film. The film is then rinsed in water in order to get rid of excess surfactant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 2"],"b":["302","302","306","306","306","308","304","308","308","310","314","314","104","314"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["302","306","324","318","316","316","304","316","318","304","322","320","312","322","312","322","322","320","304","320"]},"In one embodiment, the imaging surface  may comprise a transparent conducting film (TCF), which may be fabricated from either organic or inorganic materials.

Where a ridge of the biometric signature is in contact with the imaging surface, heats is transferred at a higher rate.
