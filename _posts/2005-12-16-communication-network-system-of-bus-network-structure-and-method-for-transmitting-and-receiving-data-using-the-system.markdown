The MRS network supports three types of addresses, which are unicast, anycast, and multicast, to identify a particular service. Each address is in the form of a cast type and an address in any one of the three address types, and has the length of 16 bytes.","In the case of an online game, a plurality of service instances interacts and communications between the service instances also increase. However, in the conventional art, a network address is not allocated to the service instances. Namely, one process having an identical network address contains many service instances and processes a large number of communications between service instances.","Accordingly, the present invention utilizes a new address system, allocates a single network address to each service instance and efficiently processes a communication between service instances. In this case, a game server does not need to distribute messages to each of a plurality of game centers. Accordingly, management cost may be significantly reduced.","For this, the present invention allocates a network address uniquely identifying each service to the same. Also, the network address is defined as a unique address value capable of identifying the each service in the entire network system according to the present invention.","In the present invention, data is transmitted\/received between services registered in an MRS network via a connector and a broker, on the basis of the network address.","Also, the present invention supports three types of addresses which are unicast, anycast, and multicast.","A communication network system according to the present invention may register a service in a broker via a connector, by using a unicast address which is a network address allocated to each service. Also, the communication network system may make at least one portion of the registered services (hereinafter, referred to as in \u201cfirst service\u201d) join an anycast group or a multicast group according to a function of a corresponding service and transmit\/receive data between a first service and a service registered in the anycast group or the multicast group (hereinafter, referred to as in \u201csecond service\u201d). Namely, in the present invention, data may be transmitted or received between a unicast address of a source transmitting a message and an anycast address of a destination receiving the message.","For this, a connector of the communication network system according to the present invention may function to register first services in a broker and to make at least one part of the registered first services join an anycast group or a multicast group according to a function of a corresponding service. A broker in an MRS network may function to transmit\/receive data between the first service and a second service registered in the anycast group or the multicast group. Also, the broker is registered with a unicast address of the first service and also with the anycast address or the multicast address of the second service.","As an example, when a service A providing a GOSTOP game service is generated, a connector may initially register a unicast address of the service A in a broker, and subsequently make the service A join a multicast group associated with providing of the GOSTOP game service. When a service B transmits a packet asking how many users are using a game with respect to GOSTOP game services, a broker may receives the packet and transmit the same to the service A and a multicast address of all the services registered in the multicast group. The service A receives a response to the query via the broker.","As described above, in the present invention, each service may be grouped into an anycast or multicast group according to its properties. The grouping may be performed by using a unicast address which is a unique network address allocated to each service. Accordingly, the grouped service may be a service operating in a physically separated server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"In , a cast type is the type of an address and has one value from among CT-UNICAST, CT_MULTICAST and CT_ANYCAST.","The unicast address is a network address which is allocated to each service and is also a unique address capable of identifying all the services using an MRS network.

A reserved value is allocated to the instance ID with respect to a portion of services and a dynamically generated value in the server is allocated to the instance ID with respect to the rest of the services.","As an example, values of 1 to 65535 are reserved for when a service requires a fixed unicast address. Values after 65536 may be dynamically allocated and used within the server.
