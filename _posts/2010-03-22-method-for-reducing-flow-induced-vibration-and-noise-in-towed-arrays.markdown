title: Method for reducing flow induced vibration and noise in towed arrays
abstract: A method for reducing noise in a towed acoustic array includes providing a towed array having a length, diameter, frequency range and tow speed. The relationship between tension in the towed array and wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels is determined. Wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels are related to the noise in the array. An optimal towed array tension is calculated using the determined relationship. Tension is increased to the optimal towed array tension by either provided additional towed array hose or a drogue at the end of the towed array.

More particularly, this invention relates to a method for operating a towed acoustic sensor array.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Naval vessels and geophysical exploration vessels routinely deploy towed acoustic arrays for analyzing undersea structures and objects. Improving signal to noise ratio is critical for these array. This can be increased by decreasing noise sources in the towed acoustic array. A standard towed array deployment is shown in . A tow vessel  is provided having a tow cable  joined to a towed array . Towed array  is below a water surface . As tow vessel  moves in the direction indicated by arrow  with velocity V, the towed array  is subjected to surface friction along length Lcreating a force F in the direction shown by arrow . This results in a tension in towed array . It is understood that tow vessel  can be a surface or subsurface vessel.","Flow noise is an important component of towed array noise. Flow noise in towed arrays can result from bulge waves and extensional waves propagating in the hose wall, and also from convective energy due to the turbulent boundary layer. These all have a well defined distribution of energy across stream-wise wavenumber at a given frequency, and also a well defined propagation speed.","The turbulent boundary layer developed over the surface of a towed array and vortex shedding induced during turns, are primary sources of flow noise. Standard towed array design is aimed at filtering energy from the turbulent boundary layer using a combination of hydrophone size, hydrophone grouping, and the stand-off distance between the hydrophone and the hose wall of the array. These methods are effective for filtering energy which exists at higher wavenumbers than acoustic energy at low wavenumbers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["22","22","24","26","24","24","28","26","28","30","26","30","32","30","26","22","34","24"]},"Therefore, there is a need for reducing flow noise in towed acoustic array.","A first object of the present invention is to reduce flow noise in a towed acoustic sensor array.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for reducing flow noise that results in an array that can be easily handled.","These and other objects are achieved by this method for reducing noise in a towed acoustic array. The method includes providing a towed array having a length, diameter, frequency range and tow speed. The relationship between tension in the towed array and wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels is determined. Wall pressure fluctuation spectral levels generate the noise in the array. An optimal towed array tension is calculated using the determined relationship. Tension is increased to the optimal towed array tension by either provided additional towed array hose or a drogue at the end of the towed array.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.","Recently, tow tests have been performed with a customized experimental towed array instrumented with sensors to measure mechanical and hydrodynamic forces. The wavenumber-frequency spectra measured with internal hydrophones and also with wall pressure sensors mounted in the array hose wall have shown high auto-spectral levels at low frequencies. For purposes of this disclosure, low frequencies are defined as frequencies below 100 Hz. This energy is broadly distributed across all of the measured stream-wise wavenumbers and has no apparent speed of propagation. This type of energy has also been measured with different types of pressure sensors in other towed arrays with different mounting characteristics. Incoherent vibration of the sensors in the array can create this type of energy. Recent measurements made using three axis accelerometers internally mounted in the experimental array showed high auto-spectral levels due to accelerations in the plane orthogonal to the array axis, and somewhat lower spectral levels along the axis, in the low frequency range. Measurements made during tow ship turns showed significant increases in both the pressure and acceleration spectral levels.","The recent measurements cited here show flow induced energy which exists across all wavenumbers at lower frequencies. The primary data originated from two tests.  provides a graph of this data. The graph plots spectral energy,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mn":"10","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"Log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03a6","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"f"}},{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"Pa","mn":"2"}}]}}}}}},"br":{},"b":["36","95","38","95"],"i":["m ","m "],"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Here we propose an algorithm which enables determination of a specified (required) noise reduction for a given array geometry.
