Recently, however, technological advances have resulted in the proliferation of alternative communications systems. For example, various wireless systems such as cellular networks have been developed. In addition, data networks such as the Internet have been deployed. The proliferation of these and other alternative communications systems has created incompatibilities that have not been fully resolved.","In accordance with the present invention, techniques for handoff of communications sessions between cellular and desktop telephones are provided. According to some embodiments, these techniques enable a user to establish and maintain a communication session that may be handed between a cellular telephone and a desktop telephone. In particular, these techniques can enable a communication session to be handed from a cellular telephone to a desktop telephone and\/or from a desktop telephone to a cellular telephone.","According to a particular embodiment, a method for effecting handoff of a communication session between a cellular telephone and a desktop telephone includes anchoring a communication session involving a remote device and a cellular telephone in an enterprise network such that signaling for the communication session passes through an element of the enterprise network; receiving an indication to handoff the communication session from the cellular telephone to a desktop telephone coupled to the enterprise network; placing the remote device in a holding state in response to the indication; and coupling the desktop telephone to the remote device to resume the communication session.","Embodiments of the invention provide various technical advantages. For example, these techniques may allow a user of a cellular telephone and a desktop telephone to be reached using a single telephone number. According to some embodiments, these techniques may allow a user to continue a communication session passed between a cellular telephone and a desktop telephone. Furthermore, these techniques may enable single number reachability and handoff between cellular and desktop telephones without the use of a separate conference bridge. Cost may be reduced. Furthermore, security may be enhanced by preventing unauthorized access to a communication session during handoff.","Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","16","18","14","20","22","16","20","20","24","26","28","10","12","14","12","14","14","12"]},"Cellular telephone  represents a mobile communications device, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, capable of communicating with remote devices through cellular network . For example, cellular telephone  may communicate through cellular network  using base station . Cellular telephone  may support any one or more mobile communications technologies, such as global systems for mobile communications (GSM), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and any other appropriate communications protocols. Furthermore, according to particular embodiments, cellular telephone  may also support packet-based communication protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP) and wireless standards such as 802.11 to provide for wireless telephony services. In addition, cellular telephone  may support advanced features associated with handoff of a communications session to or from desktop telephone .","Desktop telephone  represents a communications device, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, capable of communicating with remote devices through enterprise network  and effecting handoff with cellular telephone . Desktop telephone  may communicate through enterprise network  using any appropriate wireline or wireless protocol. Furthermore, desktop telephone  may interact with call manager  and\/or mobility application  when appropriate to effect handoff of a communication session with cellular telephone .","Cellular network  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for providing wireless telephony services using cellular protocols and technology. Various cellular protocols and technologies may be used by cellular network , including but not limited to global system for mobile communications (GSM), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and any other appropriate analog or digital cellular protocol or technology. Cellular network  may include any number of base stations , as well as base station controllers, mobile switching centers, and other appropriate communications equipment for use in communicating with cellular telephone  and PSTN . Thus, as illustrated, cellular network  may couple to base station  to receive and transmit wireless signals to and from cellular telephone .","Enterprise network  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for interconnecting elements coupled to enterprise network . Thus, enterprise network  may represent a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), and\/or any other appropriate form of network. Furthermore, elements within enterprise network  may utilize circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communication protocols to provide for wireline telephony services. For example, elements within enterprise network  may utilize IP. In addition, elements within enterprise network  may utilize wireless standards such as the 802.11 family of wireless standards to provide for wireless telephony services. Note that the 802.11 family of wireless standards includes, among others, 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. Enterprise network  may also utilize interactive voice response (IVR). Enterprise network  may include any number of call managers , mobility applications , gateways , and other appropriate communications equipment for use in communicating with desktop telephone  and PSTN . Thus, as illustrated, enterprise network  may couple to desktop telephone  to receive and transmit signals and to effect handoff of a communication session between desktop telephone  and cellular telephone .","PSTN  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, through which cellular network  and enterprise network  may communicate. PSTN  may include switches, wireline and wireless communication devices, and any other appropriate equipment for interconnecting cellular network  and enterprise network . PSTN  may include portions of public and private networks providing network transport services between various geographic areas and networks.","In the embodiment illustrated, enterprise network  includes call manager , mobility application , and gateway . Call manager  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for providing telephony services over enterprise network . For example, call manager  may support voice over IP (VoIP) communications using any of various protocols such as signaling connection control point (SCCP) protocol, session initiation protocol (SIP), media gateway control protocol (MGCP), H.323, and\/or any other appropriate protocol for VoIP. Furthermore, call manager  may act as an IP private branch exchange (PBX) and support PBX functions, such as hold, park, transfer, redirect, and\/or other high level and low level call management features.","Mobility application  represents any suitable collection of hardware, software, and controlling logic to support single number reachability and handoff between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . For example, mobility application  may, when appropriate, utilize PBX features to effect handoff of a communication session between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone .","Gateway  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for interconnecting enterprise network  with PSTN . Gateway  may be used to convert communications between different communication protocols. For example, gateway  may convert communications received from cellular network  in SS7 protocol to any of various other protocols that may be used by enterprise network , such as protocols associated with an integrated services digital network (ISDN) standard in the case of circuit-switched trunking and H.323, SIP, or other appropriate protocols in the case of IP-based trunking.","In operation, cellular telephone  may initiate and receive telephone calls through cellular network , and desktop telephone  may initiate and receive telephone calls through enterprise network  to establish communication sessions with remote devices. Note that, as used herein, a remote device refers to any communications device capable of establishing communication sessions with cellular telephone  or desktop telephone , such as devices located in cellular network , enterprise network , PSTN , or other linked networks. Furthermore, as used herein, a communication session refers to the transfer of voice, video, data, and\/or other information between two or more communication devices. For example, according to particular embodiments a communication session may involve a call between two communication devices or a conference call involving two or more communication devices.","Various advanced features may be supported by elements of system . For example, a single number reachability feature may allow calls that come into enterprise network  to be simultaneously offered to both cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . Also, handoff of a communication session may be supported. For example, deskphone pickup may allow a user to hang up on a communication session involving cellular telephone  and retrieve the communication session using desktop telephone . Conversely, cellphone pickup may allow a user to hang up on a communication session involving desktop telephone  and retrieve the communication session using cellular telephone . Another advanced feature is enterprise dial tone. Enterprise dial tone involves routing calls placed from cellular telephone  through enterprise network . According to particular embodiments, enterprise dial tone anchors a communication session in enterprise network  so that other advanced features such as deskphone pickup may be supported. Yet another advanced feature allows a user to remotely enable and disable the single number reachability feature. Remote control over single number reachability may prevent a person from being bothered by business calls at inappropriate times. Still another advanced feature is the provision of a single voicemail box. According to particular embodiments, an indication of pending voicemail messages may be provided to cellular telephone . Note that while specific advanced features have been enumerated, various embodiments may include one or more of these and other advanced features.","To provide for single number reachability, a single telephone or directory number may be associated with both cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . By dialing the telephone number, a remote device may initiate a communication session with cellular telephone  or desktop telephone , depending on which device a user answers. For example, when a remote device dials the telephone number, cellular telephone  and desktop telephone  both may ring or otherwise indicate an attempt by the remote device to establish a communication session. Thus, an incoming call may be offered both to desktop telephone  and cellular telephone . If a user answers cellular telephone , the communication session will be established between the remote device and cellular telephone . If the user instead answers desktop telephone , the communication session will be established between the remote device and desktop telephone .\u2019","Mobility application  may assist in providing a single number reachability solution. For example, when an incoming call arrives for the shared directory number at call manager , the call may be offered to both desktop telephone  and mobility application . Mobility application , after being offered the call, may place a second call to cellular telephone  through gateway , PSTN , cellular network , and base station . A user may establish a communication session either by answering the incoming call using desktop telephone  or by answering the second call using cellular telephone . If the user answers the incoming call using desktop telephone , the second call placed by mobility application  may be terminated. If the user answers the call using cellular telephone , the incoming call leg from call manager  to desktop telephone  may be terminated.","Anchoring a communication session in enterprise network  may provide for advanced features such as handoff between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . Anchoring a communication session in enterprise network  represents routing signaling through enterprise network  to provide for control of the communication session. Incoming calls answered at desktop telephone  and outgoing calls from desktop telephone  inherently involve signaling that passes through enterprise network . However, when signaling and data flow between cellular telephone  and a remote device, enterprise network  may not inherently be included in a signaling path. For example, a remote device not be located in enterprise network  may be able to communicate with cellular telephone  without sending signals through enterprise network . In this case, anchoring the communication session in enterprise network  may be particularly useful since enterprise network  might otherwise be excluded from the signaling path. If enterprise network  is excluded from the signaling path, mobility application  and call manager  cannot provide single number reachability and support handoff of communication sessions.","Various methods may be used to anchor a communication session in enterprise network . For example, as discussed above, a telephone number of cellular telephone  may be associated with call manager  and\/or mobility application  so that calls to the telephone number route through enterprise network . After receiving a telephone call intended for cellular telephone  and desktop telephone , call manager  and\/or mobility application  may include itself in a signaling path associated with the resulting communication session. The two-stage dialing process discussed above may be used to anchor a communication session initiated by a remote device with mobility application . Note that when the remote device exists outside enterprise network , for example on cellular network , hairpinning media through gateway  may be appropriate. That is, media communicated to gateway  from the remote device may be routed to cellular telephone  without requiring the media to pass through enterprise network . Similarly, media communicated to gateway  from cellular telephone  may be routed to the remote device without requiring the media to pass through enterprise network .","Calls placed by cellular telephone  may also be anchored in enterprise network . A two-stage dialing process similar to the one discussed above may be used to anchor an outgoing call. Cellular telephone  may couple to mobility application  during the first stage. For example, cellular telephone  may dial a telephone number associated with mobility application . After coupling to mobility application , secondary or enterprise dial tone may be provided to cellular telephone . Before secondary dial tone is provided, a user of cellular telephone  may be required to enter a user name and password for security purposes. After authentication, the user may dial a second telephone number and a second call may be placed from mobility application  to a remote device. Alternatively or in addition, the two-stage dialing processes may be transparent to a user of cellular telephone . For example, cellular telephone  may place a \u201cstealth\u201d call to mobility application  before coupling to the remote device through mobility application . The first stage may be labeled \u201cstealth\u201d out of convenience because cellular telephone  may place the call without notifying the user of cellular telephone  and may suppress notification events such as ringing. In either case, the first telephone call and the second telephone may be internally bridged by mobility application . Note that during communication sessions involving cellular telephone , an appropriate indication may be displayed at desktop telephone , such as \u201cremote in use.\u201d The indication may be displayed at desktop telephone  in response to a communication from mobility application  that cellular telephone  is being used.","Anchoring a call in enterprise network  may allow mobility application  to effect handoff of a communication session between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . For example, a communication session may be handed from cellular telephone  to desktop telephone . In general, various elements of system , such as mobility application , may utilize PBX features such as hold, park, transfer, redirect, and other high level and low level PBX functions to provide for handoff of a communication session between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . According to a particular embodiment, after a user of cellular telephone  hangs up on a communication session, mobility application  places a leg of the communication session associated with the remote device in a holding state, for example using a hold function, and starts a timer. To place the communication session in the holding state, mobility application  may communicate a command to call manager . During the time the remote device is in the holding state, music on hold may be suppressed.","If a user of desktop telephone  presses a resume key on desktop telephone , picks up a handset of desktop telephone , or performs some other appropriate action before expiration of the timer, desktop telephone  may communicate a signal to call manager  and\/or mobility application  announcing the resumption of the communication session. A new call leg may be established between desktop telephone  and call manager  and\/or mobility application  before the communication session with the remote device may be resumed. If the timer expires before the resume key is pressed, mobility application  and\/or call manager  may terminate the communication session.","Alternatively, the user may press the resume key on desktop telephone  or take other appropriate action without first hanging up the communication session using cellular telephone . For example, desktop telephone  may communicate a signal to call manager  and\/or mobility application  in response to the pressing of the resume key, and the communication session may be placed in a holding state until the communication session can be redirected to desktop telephone . After the reestablishment of the communication session with the remote device using desktop telephone , the call leg associated with cellular telephone  may be dropped.","A communication session may also be handed from desktop telephone  to cellular telephone . Desktop telephone  or a remote device may initiate a communication session involving desktop telephone . In either case, the user of desktop telephone  may press a cellphone pickup key on desktop telephone  or take some other appropriate action, and, in response, desktop telephone  may communicate a signal to mobility application . Mobility application  may then place a new call to cellular telephone . Event notification such as ringing may be suppressed so that the communication session may not be disturbed. When the user answers the call on cellular telephone , mobility application  may place desktop telephone  on hold or drop desktop telephone  from the communication session and resume the communication session using cellular telephone . Gateway  may hairpin the media communicated between cellular telephone  and the remote device if the remote device is located outside enterprise network .","Note that according to particular embodiments any one or more of the features provided by system  may be remotely enabled and disabled. For example, using cellular telephone  the single number reachability feature may be enabled or disabled. As discussed above, remote control over single number reachability may prevent a person from being bothered by business calls at inappropriate times. Furthermore, activating single number reachability from a remote location may be useful to make a person more accessible.","Cellular telephone  and desktop telephone  may share a single voicemail system. For example, according to particular embodiments a voicemail system may be executed by mobility application  or some other element of system . A user may access stored voicemail by coupling to the appropriate element of system  using cellular telephone  and\/or desktop telephone .","According to particular embodiments, media communicated by one endpoint may pass through mobility application  before the media is forwarded to the other endpoint. For example, mobility application  may internally bridge media streams. Alternatively or in addition, media may communicated between endpoints without the media passing through mobility application . For example, mobility application  may send information to each endpoint to direct the endpoints to communicate media to each other rather than to mobility application . The information may include identifiers of the other endpoint such as IP addresses, telephone numbers, SIP identifiers, and\/or any other appropriate identifiers of endpoints. Alternatively or in addition, other information may be communicated, such as port numbers. Furthermore, identifiers and other information related to gateways, call management devices, and\/or other appropriate network nodes may be communicated to any appropriate network elements to allow direct communication between endpoints. Thus, for example, gateway  and desktop telephone  may communicate media directly to one another without the media passing through mobility application .","Thus, a single telephone number may be associated with both cellular telephone  and desktop telephone  to provide for single number reachability. Furthermore, a communication session may be handed off between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone  without requiring the use of a conference bridge. In addition, other advanced features may be provided by system .","Note that communication system  represents one embodiment of a system that supports single number reachability and handoff between cellular and desktop telephones. Various alternative embodiments are possible. For example, while in the illustrated embodiment enterprise network  couples to cellular network  through PSTN  using gateway , various other embodiments may include enterprise network  coupling to cellular network  in other ways. For example, enterprise network  may couple to cellular network  using a service provider that supports VoIP. Thus, in alternative embodiments, cellular network  and gateway  may not be included in communication system .","Furthermore, while the described example includes two specific types of telephones, various numbers and types of telephones may be utilized in accordance with various embodiments. For example, one or more cellular telephones , desktop telephones , home telephones, wireless computing devices, and\/or other wireless or wireline communications devices may be used. Thus, single number reachability may provided using various numbers and types of telephones and other communication devices through various networks, including packet and switched networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["26","26","40","42","44","12","14"]},"Processor  controls the operation and administration of elements within mobility application . For example, processor  operates to process information received from network interface  and memory . Processor  includes any hardware and\/or logic elements operable to control and process information. For example, processor  may be a programmable logic device, a microcontroller, and\/or any other suitable processing device.","Network interface  communicates information to and receives information from devices coupled to enterprise network . For example, network interface  may communicate with gateway , call manager , and desktop telephone . Furthermore, network interface  may receive information from and transmit information to remote devices as well as cellular telephone . Thus, network interface  includes any suitable hardware or controlling logic used to communicate information to or from elements coupled to mobility application . According to particular embodiments, network interface  includes multiple computer telephone integration (CTI) ports. At least one of the CTI ports may couple to call manager  and be associated with a directory number shared by cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . Other CTI ports may form a pool of CTI ports available for making outgoing calls from mobility application  to cellular telephone . Thus, individual CTI ports in the pool may be temporarily assigned to communication sessions. Note that two or more CTI ports may be internally bridged when appropriate.","Memory  stores, either permanently or temporarily, data and other information for processing by processor  and communication using network interface . Memory  includes any one or a combination of volatile or nonvolatile local or remote devices suitable for storing information. For example, memory  may include random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, or any other suitable information storage device or a combination of these devices. As illustrated, memory  may include one or more memory modules, such as code .","Code  includes software, executable files, and\/or appropriate logic modules capable when executed to control the operation of mobility application . For example, code  may include executable files capable of supporting single number reachability and handoff between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . Furthermore, code  may include instructions to enable mobility application  to anchor a communication session in enterprise network  and couple remote devices to cellular telephone  and desktop telephone  as appropriate.","In operation, network interface  may receive incoming and outgoing calls. For example, network interface  may receive an incoming call initiated by a remote device. In response to receiving the incoming call, processor  may place a second call to cellular telephone  using network interface . For example, a CTI port associated with a telephone number shared by cellular telephone  and desktop telephone  may receive an incoming call passed to network interface  from call manager . Processor  may select a temporary CTI port from a pool of CTI ports in response to receiving the incoming call and then offer the incoming call to cellular telephone  using the temporary CTI port. If cellular telephone  answers the second call, processor  may internally bridge the two CTI ports. If instead desktop telephone  answers the incoming call, processor  may drop the second call. Alternatively or in addition, network interface  may receive an outgoing call initiated by cellular telephone . In response to receiving the outgoing call, processor  may place a second call to a remote device using network interface . Again, two CTI ports may be utilized for the two calls and internally bridged.","According to particular embodiments, network interface  may receive an indication to effect handoff of a communication between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . For example, network interface  may receive an indication generated by a user pressing a button on desktop telephone  indicating a desire of the user to handoff a communication session from cellular telephone  to desktop telephone  or from desktop telephone  to cellular telephone . Alternatively or in addition, network interface  may receive an off-hook notification generated by a user of cellular telephone  terminating a communication session.","In response to receiving an indication to effect handoff or at any other time, processor  may take appropriate action to handoff a communications session. For example, for handoff of the communication session to desktop telephone , processor  may place a leg of the call associated with the remote device on hold, couple the held call leg to desktop telephone , and drop a leg of the call associated with cellular telephone . Thereafter, a user may resume the communication session using desktop telephone .","For handoff of the communication session to cellular telephone  or at any other time, processor  may place a leg of the call associated with the remote device on hold, place a new call from a temporary CTI port to cellular telephone , couple the held call leg to the new call leg, and drop a leg of the call associated with desktop telephone . Thereafter, a user may resume the communication session using cellular telephone . Furthermore, when a user answers cellular telephone , processor  may transmit a communication through network interface  to gateway  to hairpin media in gateway  to cause media to flow between the remote device and cellular phone  through gateway  without traveling, for example, through call manager  and\/or mobility application . For example, processor  may identify a port used by a gateway associated with the remote device and identify the port to gateway . Processor  may also identify a second port used by gateway  and identify the second port to the gateway associated with the remote device. Thereafter, the gateway associated with the remote device and gateway  may communicate media directly to one another.","For direct communication of media between endpoints, memory  may store identifiers and other information of endpoints and other network nodes. For example, memory  may store IP addresses, telephone numbers, SIP identifiers, port numbers, and any other appropriate information. According to particular embodiments, information for allowing direct communication may be received during setup of a communication session by network interface . This information may be communicated by network interface  to endpoints and other network nodes when appropriate. For example, information associated with gateway  may be communicated to desktop telephone  to allow media to flow directly between desktop telephone and cellular telephone  using gateway . Thus, by communicating information, mobility application  may allow endpoints to communicate media directly to one another without sending the media through mobility application . Furthermore, signaling may still be communicated to mobility application  through network interface  while media is communicated between endpoints without passing through network interface .","Note that mobility application  may utilize any appropriate protocol to communicate with other elements of system . For example, mobility application  may utilize Java telephony application programming interface (JTAPI) to interact with call manager .","While this example includes specific functional components for mobility application , mobility application  may include any collection and arrangement of components, including some or all of the enumerated functional components, for providing single number reachability and handoff between cellular telephone  and desktop telephone . Moreover, mobility application  contemplates implementing each of the functional components using any suitable combination and arrangement of hardware and\/or logic, and implementing any of the functionalities using a computer program stored on a computer readable medium. Furthermore, mobility application  may be implemented as a stand-alone device, or aspects of mobility application  may be distributed among various devices within enterprise network . For example, some or all aspects of mobility application  may be incorporated into call manager .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["12","12","60","62","64","66","12","16","26","12","14"]},"User interface  allows a user of cellular telephone  to input information into cellular telephone  and receive information outputted by cellular telephone .

Controller  may also operate to communicate voice data received through cellular interface  to a user of cellular telephone  using user interface . For example, user interface  may generate sounds corresponding to data received from a remote device.","A user of cellular telephone  may couple to a remote device by dialing a telephone number associated with mobility application , receiving secondary dial tone, and then dialing a telephone number associated with the remote device using user interface . Alternatively or in addition, the user may only dial a telephone number associated with the remote device using user interface .

Controller  may prevent a user of cellular telephone  from hearing, for example, music on hold, secondary dial tone, and secondary dialing associated with mobility application  placing the second call. Also, during handoff with desktop telephone , controller  may suppress similar event notifications generated by mobility application .","While this example includes specific functional components for cellular telephone , cellular telephone  may include any collection and arrangement of components, including some or all of the enumerated functional components, for communicating with remote devices using cellular network .
