{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to devices which facilitate hazardous materials decontamination procedures and, more particularly, to a portable, durable, re-usable platform for use in the performance of said decontamination procedures.","2. Description of the Background","Hazardous materials response personnel (\u201cresponders\u201d), such as firefighters, are typically subjected to some form of on-site decontamination procedure once the circumstances requiring their presence have been addressed. Often, one or more fully-encapsulated hazardous material suits must be deployed to ensure the safety of the responders while working with, or in the vicinity of, the hazardous material(s). Use of one or more of those suits requires that they be subjected to thorough decontamination prior to storage for future use. One procedure for accomplishing the required on-site decontamination is the washing of the suit's exterior with an  appropriate cleaning\/decontamination agent while being worn by the responder. However, due to the presence of hazardous materials in the fluid runoff, the procedure must include the collection of that contaminated runoff in some form of temporarily deployed vessel.","Previously, responders grabbed any convenient implement to elevate themselves above the collection vessel (and accumulated fluid), inclusive of plastic or metal, \u201cmilk\u201d-style crates and plastic pallets. Unfortunately, these unintended devices raise safety issues such as: (1) insufficient structural strength to support the combined weight of the responder and the hazardous materials suit, (2) insufficient lateral stability while the responder is stepping on or off the apparatus, and (3) insufficient physical size (i.e. length, width). When a responder is wearing a fully-encapsulated hazardous materials suit, his\/her vision and dexterity are severely compromised. If a responder trips and\/or falls while attempting to step on or off the elevated apparatus, needless injury to or direct contamination of his\/her body, and damage or destruction of the hazardous materials suit, can result.","The present invention is not the first to address the need for elevated support platforms used in association with the clean up and\/or containment of hazardous materials. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,838,178 to Chriske et al., 5,020,667 to Bush, and 6,382,108 to Stanek et al. disclose platforms designed to accommodate hazardous materials. Each of the platforms has a perforated top surface and an integral containment vessel. Additional devices intended to facilitate cleaning and\/or decontamination procedures are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,675,923 to Ashley, 4,858,256 to Shankman, and 6,164,298 to Petter et al. Each of those apparatus include a  platform on which an individual may stand, or an object may be situated, such that a cleaning\/decontamination procedure may be completed.","Unfortunately, each of these prior art devices possesses certain limitations with respect to the specific needs addressed by the present invention. The Chriske et al., Bush, and Stanek et al. devices do not incorporate collapsible and weight-minimizing designs to emphasize ease of storage and portability. They are each, in fact, intended primarily for transportation via fork-lift trucks. The platforms of the Ashley, Shankman, and Petter et al. apparatus are piecemeal components of far more elaborate systems and are likewise not at all portable.","Therefore, there remains a need for a portable apparatus that provides a substantial degree of utility in supporting the weight of a responder wearing a fully-encapsulated hazardous materials suit in an elevated position during on-site decontamination procedures. An apparatus of this type should be sized to provide a responder, even with the limited vision\/dexterity imposed by the hazardous materials suit, with a large enough area to safely maneuver during decontamination, collapsible to allow for easy storage and transportation, lightweight for optimum portability, and economical to manufacture in order to provide for widespread use.","It is, therefore, the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved apparatus for supporting hazardous materials response personnel in an elevated position during on-site decontamination procedures. ","It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved elevated platform for use during on-site decontamination procedures that prevents damage to the temporarily deployed hazardous material containment vessel.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved elevated platform for use during on-site decontamination procedures that is collapsible for storage and transport.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved elevated platform for use during on-site decontamination procedures with folding leg assemblies that also serve as handles for transportation.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved elevated platform for use during on-site decontamination procedures that is lightweight for portability.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved elevated platform for use during on-site decontamination procedures that is economical to manufacture to provide for widespread use.","These and other objects are accomplished by a portable, re-usable, elevated platform that provides a large, non-slip, grated surface on which an individual wearing a fully-encapsulated, hazardous materials suit may stand, and turn as needed, to ensure thorough on-site decontamination. The present invention generally comprises a top grate and two folding\/pivoting support leg assemblies with locking pins. The elevated design allows for the collection of the hazardous material runoff in a containment vessel deployed underneath. The present invention is fabricated of impervious, strong, lightweight materials (e.g. aluminum) to prevent absorption of any hazardous materials and to provide sufficient structural strength while keeping  its overall weight reasonable (i.e. to be transported\/set-up by a single individual). Moreover, the closed-cell design of the present device prevents any accumulation of chemicals which might otherwise pose a hazard. All chemicals run through for collection in a basin. The present invention's design is simple and straightforward, and can be economically manufactured.","The support leg assemblies are pivotally mounted at each end of the frame and fold inward, and lock in position, for storing or transporting the platform. Upon folding outward, locking pins hold the legs in position substantially perpendicular to the top grate. The ends of the leg assemblies are sealed to prevent the retention\/cross-contamination of any hazardous materials and turned slightly upward at the ends to prevent damage to the containment vessel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 1\u20133","b":["10","10","20","40","40"]},"The top grate  typically includes two end members  and a plurality of cross members . The end members  and cross members  are preferably fabricated of commercially available aluminum solid bar or tubular stock having a rectangular cross-section. The end members  are sealed with aluminum plugs to prevent ingress and collection of hazardous materials. Each end of a cross member  is fixedly attached to one of the end members . The cross members  are preferably attached by welding to the end members , and a full butt weld is preferred to seal the hollow interior of the cross members . The net result, as shown in , is a substantially square assembly with a flat platform top and a series of equal gaps between the cross members .","Tape  possessing a high coefficient of friction on its exposed surface is adhesively attached to the top surfaces of the end and cross members , , respectively. ","In the illustrated embodiment the top grate  measures approximately 48\u2033 along each side, thereby providing a 16 square foot surface on which a responder may stand while being decontaminated, with equal gaps of 1.5\u2033 to 2.5\u2033 between the cross members to provide adequate drainage. Alternative embodiments of the present invention may include top grates  that vary in size and are fabricated of materials other than aluminum. It should also be understood that alternative embodiments may include gaps between the cross members  that measure more or less than 1.5\u2033 to 2.5\u2033.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","40","40","20","24","22","40","40","42","44","46","48","52","54","42","44","46","42","44","46","44","46"]},"The leg assemblies , \u2032 are constructed as follows. One end of each of the support members  is fixedly attached perpendicularly to a foot\/crossbar . The opposite end of each of the support members  is pivotally attached to a mounting bracket  via a pivot pin . The mounting brackets  are fixedly attached to the top grate  proximate points where the cross members  are fixedly connected to the end members . The linear spacing of the support members , as attached to the foot\/crossbar , is preferably equivalent to that of the mounting brackets , as attached to the top grate . Both ends of each foot\/crossbar  are bent slightly in the direction of the support members  such that when the leg assemblies , \u2032 are extended and the platform  is resting on a surface, the ends of the feet\/crossbars  are angled slightly away from that surface.","The retention chains  are used to establish a permanent, yet flexible, connection between the quick-release pins  and the top grate . In this manner, the pins  are not subject to being misplaced\/lost during the platform  set up, or tear down, process described in detail below. The quick-release pins  are inserted in through holes , and are thereby releasably attached to the mounting bracket , to hold the leg assemblies , \u2032 in either the folded or extended position.","The leg assemblies , \u2032 fold inward (i.e. toward the top grate ) for storing or transporting the platform . Upon folding outward, the quick-release pins  hold the leg assemblies , \u2032 in position substantially perpendicular to the top grate . The leg assemblies , \u2032 pivot about pins  that extend through the mounting brackets  and the support members . ","With collective reference to , the set up process for the decontamination platform , from its fully collapsed configuration for storage or transportation, begins with the extension of the leg assemblies , \u2032. This is accomplished by first placing the collapsed platform  upside down on the ground or floor (i.e. essentially resting on the tape  affixed to the top grate ). Each leg assembly , \u2032 is extended by removing the quick-release pins  from the holes , grasping the foot\/crossbar  and pulling. As the foot\/crossbar  moves away from the top grate , the support members  rotate around the pivot pins . Once the support members  reach a position that is substantially perpendicular to the top grate , the leg assembly \u2032 is locked in the extended position by replacing the quick-release pins  in the holes  located in the mounting brackets .","Once both leg assemblies , \u2032 have been extended and locked in place, the platform  may be turned over and set upon the ground or floor (i.e. resting in a stable configuration on feet\/crossbars ). The total time required to set up the platform, from its fully collapsed state, is approximately one minute. As noted above, the ends of the feet\/crossbars  are angled slightly away from the ground or floor. In this manner, the probability of damaging or puncturing the hazardous materials collection vessel  (see ), on which the platform  is typically positioned, is minimized, if not eliminated.","To fold the present invention into its fully collapsed configuration for storage or transportation, the platform  is first placed upside down on the ground or floor (i.e. again resting on the tape  affixed to the top grate ). Each of the leg assemblies , \u2032 is collapsed by removing the quick-release pins  from the holes  and pushing the foot\/crossbar  toward  the top grate . This causes the support members  to rotate around the pivot pins . Once the support members  reach a position that is substantially parallel to the top grate , the leg assembly  is locked in the folded position by replacing the quick-release pins  in the holes  located in the mounting brackets . Due to the extension of the feet\/crossbars  beyond the edges of the top grate , the legs assemblies , \u2032, when locked in the folded or collapsed position, also serve as handles to assist in the transportation of the decontamination platform  by one or two individuals.","When used as intended and as shown in , the platform , with its leg assemblies , \u2032 extended, is placed proximate the center of a hazardous materials collection vessel . A responder  wearing a fully encapsulated hazardous materials suit steps onto the platform , thereby placing himself\/herself in an elevated position over the containment vessel . A second responder  may then thoroughly decontaminate the exterior surface of the hazardous materials suit worn by the first responder  by applying an appropriate liquid via a nozzle assembly . The liquid dripping off of the hazardous materials suit falls through the top grate  of the platform  and collects in the containment vessel  for proper disposal.","As is readily perceived in the foregoing description, the portable, re-usable, elevated platform  of the present invention provides a large, non-slip, grated surface  on which an individual  wearing a fully-encapsulated, hazardous materials suit may stand, extend his\/her arms, and turn as needed, to ensure thorough on-site decontamination. The platform  may even be utilized to decontaminate an individual that has been injured and is lying on an emergency medical service \u201cspine board\u201d. The elevated design of the present invention allows  for the collection of the hazardous material runoff in a containment vessel  deployed underneath. The collapsible nature of its design provides for easy storage and manual transportation. The design of the feet\/crossbars  reduces the probability of damage to the containment vessel  and assists in the transportation of the platform . The present invention is fabricated of impervious, strong, lightweight materials (e.g. aluminum) to prevent absorption of any hazardous materials, and the tubular construction provides sufficient structural strength (i.e. to support up to 600 lbs.) while keeping the overall weight reasonable (i.e. to be transported\/set-up by a single individual). The present invention's design is simple and straightforward, and can be economically manufactured.","Having now fully set forth the preferred embodiment and certain modifications of the concept underlying the present invention, various other embodiments as well as certain variations and modifications of the embodiments herein shown and described will obviously occur to those skilled in the art upon becoming familiar with said underlying concept. It is to be understood, therefore, that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically set forth in the appended claims.
