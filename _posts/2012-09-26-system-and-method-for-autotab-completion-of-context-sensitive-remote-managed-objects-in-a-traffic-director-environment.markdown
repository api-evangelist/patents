A familiar example is the use of a client computer, such as a laptop equipped with a web browser application, by which a user can access a web server via the Internet.","Today's organizations rely increasingly on their computing resources being readily available from almost any location, at all times, with a high level of performance. The task of ensuring that such resources are allocated efficiently often requires the use of a load balancing device to distribute requests from clients to target resources, in a fair manner according to its distribution policies. These are the types of environments that embodiments of the invention can be used with.","Described herein are systems and methods for providing software administration tools, for use in administering server configurations, such as in a traffic director or other type of server environment. In accordance with an embodiment, the traffic director, referred to herein in some embodiments as \u201cOracle Traffic Director\u201d (OTD), is provided as a software-based load balancer that can be used to deliver a fast, reliable, scalable, and secure platform for load-balancing Internet and other traffic to back-end origin servers, such as web servers, application servers, or other resource servers.","In accordance with an embodiment, the system comprises a command-line interface and\/or command-line shell which provides an autocompletion feature for remote objects including wherein, in response to an instruction from an administrator to invoke the feature, the system determines configurable remote back-end objects based on the context of the command-line at the time of invocation, and uses the information to one of autocomplete the command-line input or provide a list of remote back-end objects. Embodiments of the invention can also be used with other types of server environment.","As described above, today's organizations rely increasingly on their computing resources being readily available from almost any location, at all times, with a high level of performance. The task of ensuring that such resources are allocated efficiently often requires the use of a load balancing device to distribute requests from clients to target resources, in a fair manner according to its distribution policies. It is also desirable to be able to manage or administer such systems efficiently and securely.","Described herein are systems and methods for providing software administration tools for use in administering server configurations, and in particular a system and method for auto-tab completion of context sensitive remote managed objects. In accordance with an embodiment, the systems and methods can be used with a server environment such as a traffic director, referred to herein in some embodiments as \u201cOracle Traffic Director\u201d (OTD), which is provided as a software-based load balancer that can be used to deliver Internet and other traffic to back-end origin servers, such as web servers, application servers, or other resource servers.","In accordance with an embodiment, the traffic director serves as an entry point for traffic such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) requests, which are received from clients or client devices, for communication to a back-end of resources or resource servers acting as origin servers. Each traffic director includes one or more traffic director instances defined by a configuration, wherein the configuration provides information about various elements of that instance, such as listeners, origin servers, failover groups, and logs.","Examples of the types of clients that can be used with the system include computer servers, laptop computers, portable devices such as smartphones, and other types of computing devices, some of which may include, e.g., a web browser application for accessing a web server.","Examples of the types of resources that can be used as origin servers include lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) servers, web servers, multimedia servers, application servers, database servers, and other types of resources.","From an administration perspective, in accordance with an embodiment, the traffic director is designed to be easy to install, configure, and use; and can include a simple, wizard-driven graphical interface, as well as a robust command-line interface, for use by an administrator in managing traffic director instances. For any particular organization, depending on their business requirements, such as the number of back-end applications for which they want to use the traffic director to balance requests, their internal requirements such as security, and the traffic director features they wish to use, the traffic director topology can be varied to address their needs.","In accordance with an embodiment, the following terms are used herein. It will be evident that, in accordance with other embodiments, additional and\/or different terms can be used.","Configuration: A collection of configurable elements (e.g., metadata) that determines the run-time behavior of a traffic director instance. In accordance with an embodiment, a typical configuration contains definitions for listeners (e.g., IP address and port combinations) on which the traffic director should listen for requests, together with information about servers at the back-end to which the requests should be sent. The traffic director can read the configuration when a traffic director instance starts, and while processing client requests.\n\nInstance (Traffic Director Instance): A traffic director server that is instantiated from a configuration and deployed on an administration node or the administration server.\n\nCluster: A collection of two or more traffic director instances that are created from the same configuration.\n\nFailover Group: Two or more traffic director instances grouped by a virtual IP address (VIP).\n\nAdministration Server: A specially configured traffic director instance that hosts the interfaces, including administration console and command-line interface, through which an administrator can create traffic director configurations, deploy them as instances on administration nodes, and manage the instances.\n\nAdministration Node: A physical server that is designated as a host on which the administrator can deploy traffic director instances. In accordance with an embodiment, on a given node, the administrator can deploy only one instance of a configuration.\n\nINSTANCE_HOME: A directory of the administrator's choice, on the administration server or an administration node, in which the configuration data and binary files pertaining to traffic director instances are stored.\n\nORACLE_HOME: A directory of the administrator's choice in which the administrator installs the traffic director binaries.\n\nAdministration Console: A web-based graphical interface on the administration server that the administrator can use to create, deploy, and manage traffic director instances.\n\nClient: In accordance with an embodiment, an agent (e.g., a web browser or an application) that sends requests (e.g., HTTP and HTTPS requests) to traffic director instances. Examples of the types of clients that can be used with the system include computer servers, laptop computers, portable devices such as smartphones, and other types of computing devices, some of which may include, e.g., a web browser application for accessing a web server.\n\nOrigin Server: In accordance with an embodiment, a resource or server at the back-end, to which the traffic director forwards the requests that it receives from clients, and from which it receives responses to client requests. Examples of the types of resources that can be used as origin servers include lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) servers, web servers, multimedia servers, application servers, database servers, and other types of resources.\n\nOrigin-server Pool: A collection of origin servers that host the same application or service, and that the administrator can load-balance by using the traffic director. In accordance with an embodiment, the traffic director distributes client requests to servers in the origin-server pool based on the load-distribution method(s) that are specified for that pool.\n\nVirtual Server: A virtual entity within a traffic director server instance that provides a unique IP address (or host name) and port combination, through which the traffic director can serve requests for one or more domains. In accordance with an embodiment, a traffic director instance on a node can contain multiple virtual servers. The administrator can configure settings such as the maximum number of incoming connections specifically for each virtual server, and can also customize how each virtual server handles requests.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","106"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, the back-end can include one or more origin servers . Each of the origin servers can communicate with one another, and with the traffic director, via an internal network  such as an Ethernet network. The traffic director can receive requests from clients , via the Internet , and in the case of many organizations a firewall .","In accordance with an embodiment, from an administration perspective, the server environment is designed to be easy to install, configure, and use; and can include a simple, wizard-driven graphical interface, as well as a robust command-line interface, for use by an administrator in managing server instances. At least one of the server instances can be designated an administration node . An administration server  includes an administration interface , which in turn includes one or more of an administration console (GUI)  and\/or a command line interface , that enables an administrator  to configure or otherwise administer  the server environment or its server instances.","In accordance with an embodiment, a configuration is a collection of configurable elements that determines the run-time behavior of a server instance. A typical configuration may contain, e.g., definitions for listeners on which the traffic director should listen for requests, together with information about servers at the back-end to which the requests should be sent. The server environment, e.g., traffic director, can read the configuration when a server instance starts, and while processing client requests. An administrator can define  configurations , ,  for server instances, which are stored in a configuration store  on the administration server. The administrator can then instantiate a configuration by deploying it  on one or more administration nodes.","It will be evident that the example shown in  is provided for purposes of illustration and that, in accordance with other embodiments, different types of server environment, and different deployment scenarios can be used.","Command Line Interface with Auto-Tab Completion","In accordance with an embodiment, the system includes a command-line interface (CLI) and\/or command-line shell, which provides the administrator with an intuitive autocompletion feature for configurable remote objects within a server environment such as a traffic director.","For example, in accordance with an embodiment (referred to herein in some instances as auto-tab completion), pressing the Tab key instructs the system to autocomplete a command-line input, or alternatively to provide a list of configurable remote back-end objects within the command-line shell, based on the context of the command-line when the feature is invoked.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["288","760","761"]},"As further shown in , at any point, the administrator can also request  that the command-line interface enter a command-line shell mode .","In accordance with an embodiment, the shell mode provides an autocompletion feature for remote objects. For example, at any point while using the shell mode to enter input , the administrator can request  autocompletion of a command, e.g., by pressing the Tab key. In accordance with other embodiments, other means of issuing such a request, such as other key combinations can be used to invoke the autocompletion feature.","In response, in accordance with an embodiment, the system determines configurable remote back-end objects based on the context of the command-line or partial command at the time of invoking the autocomplete , and uses this information to one of autocomplete the command-line input, or provide a list of remote configurable back-end objects for the administrator to select for review and\/or modification .","In accordance with an embodiment, the configurable remote back-end object can be retrieved from the server environment or server instances, or from another source of configuration information, such as the configuration store.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"776"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"$"]},{"entry":[{},"$ tadm --user=admin --port=1895"]},{"entry":[{},"$ tadm -u admin -p 1895"]},{"entry":[{},"$"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In accordance with an embodiment, in the command-line standalone mode, the administrator can invoke the command line interface (tadm) by specifying a command, options, and operands.
