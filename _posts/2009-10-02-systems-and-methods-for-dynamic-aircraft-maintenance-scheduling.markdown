{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to the field of aircraft maintenance scheduling.","Conventional aircraft maintenance is based on a fixed schedule and includes performing maintenance activities based on fixed intervals (e.g., days, weeks, hours, etc.). These fixed schedules can lead to conducting maintenance prior or after when maintenance should be conducted for different aircraft equipment. For example, in some instances a fixed maintenance schedule may cause a part that is operating very well to be removed and replaced early.","Yet other conventional aircraft maintenance systems provide a maintenance manager responsible for many aircraft with a trend analysis and allow the maintenance manager to schedule service for the aircraft based on displayed trend results. As the number of aircraft in a fleet increases or as the \u201cuptime\u201d for each aircraft is demanded to be higher, it becomes more challenging and difficult for a maintenance manager to effectively schedule maintenance for the aircraft.","One embodiment of the invention relates to a system for scheduling aircraft maintenance. The system includes communications electronics configured to receive data generated by a plurality of equipment onboard an aircraft. The communications electronics are configured to receive the data while the aircraft is in flight. The system further includes computing electronics configured to receive the data from the communications electronics and to update a maintenance schedule based on the received data. The maintenance schedule includes a scheduled maintenance appointment for each of the plurality of equipment for the aircraft. The computing electronics may be configured to update the maintenance schedule by adjusting a scheduled maintenance appointment for at least one of the plurality of equipment onboard the aircraft. The computing electronics may be configured to update the maintenance schedule by adding a maintenance task to a to-do list for the next scheduled maintenance appointment based on the received data. The data may include usage information for the plurality of equipment and the plurality of equipment may relate to a plurality of aircraft subsystems. The communications electronics and the computing electronics may further be configured to coordinate maintenance schedules for a plurality of aircraft (e.g., by resolving conflicts between scheduled for the plurality of aircraft based on data received from aircraft while in flight).","Another embodiment of the invention relates to a system for scheduling aircraft maintenance. The system includes communications electronics configured to receive data from systems onboard a plurality of aircraft while the aircraft are in flight. The system further includes computing electronics configured to receive the data from the communications electronics and to update a maintenance schedule for the plurality of aircraft based on the received data.","Another embodiment of the invention relates to a method for scheduling aircraft maintenance. The method includes receiving data from systems onboard a plurality of aircraft while the aircraft are in flight. The method further includes updating a maintenance schedule for the plurality of aircraft based on the received data.","Another embodiment of the invention relates to a system for scheduling aircraft maintenance. The system includes means for receiving data from systems onboard a plurality of aircraft while the aircraft are in flight. The system further includes means for updating a maintenance schedule for the plurality of aircraft based on the received data.","Another embodiment relates to a device for mounting in an aircraft. The device includes a first interface to avionics systems, a second interface to an onboard maintenance system, and a third interface to a wireless data communications electronics. The device further includes a processing circuit configured to log data available from at least the first and second interfaces and to cause the wireless data communications electronics to wirelessly transmit the logged data to a ground-based aircraft maintenance system during flight.","Alternative exemplary embodiments relate to other features and combinations of features as may be generally recited in the claims.","Before turning to the figures, which illustrate the exemplary embodiments in detail, it should be understood that the application is not limited to the details or methodology set forth in the description or illustrated in the figures. It should also be understood that the terminology is for the purpose of description only and should not be regarded as limiting.","Referring generally to the Figures, systems and methods for scheduling aircraft maintenance are shown and described. A computerized maintenance system located on the ground is configured to receive data from systems onboard the aircraft while the aircraft are in flight. Using the received data, the computerized maintenance system is configured to dynamically update a maintenance schedule for one or more aircraft.","The computerized maintenance system may conduct one or more processing steps to determine how to update the maintenance schedule. The data received from systems of the aircraft may include fault information for one or more aircraft systems. When the computerized maintenance system receives the data including fault information, the computerized maintenance system can, for example, estimate the severity of the error and create or move the next maintenance appointment for the aircraft to the next time the aircraft is docked at a hub for the airline. The computerized maintenance system may use an expert system to predict when maintenance will be necessary for the aircraft. An expert system may also be configured to determine the severity of the fault and to make decisions regarding the maintenance schedule. For example, if an in-flight fault for an aircraft is determined to be severe, the expert system may check for maintenance times and parts available to repair the aircraft at the airport at which the aircraft will be landing. If another aircraft is scheduled to receive an available maintenance time or part, the expert system may determine that the severe fault takes priority over, for example, regularly scheduled maintenance and updates the maintenance schedule accordingly.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a system  for scheduling aircraft maintenance is shown. System  is shown to include communications electronics  configured to receive data from systems onboard aircraft ,  while the aircraft ,  are in flight. System  further includes computing electronics  configured to receive the data from the communications electronics  and to update a maintenance schedule  for one or more of the plurality of aircraft based on the received data.","Advantageously, as aircraft ,  are in flight, computing electronics  on the ground  may be updating an aircraft maintenance schedule . While computing electronics  may update a single aircraft maintenance schedule for a single aircraft (e.g., helicopter, airplane, prop plane, jet, military drone, etc.) or maintain a separate aircraft maintenance schedule for more than one aircraft, in other exemplary embodiments computing electronics  are configured to maintain the aircraft maintenance schedule for a plurality of aircraft in an integrated fashion. That is, computing electronics  may be configured to cause one or more scheduling updates for a second aircraft due to a determined aircraft update for a first aircraft.","With limited maintenance resources (e.g., one maintenance hanger  stall at an airport, limited human resources, limited parts resources, etc.), it may not be possible to service multiple aircraft at once. For example, as aircraft  and  are approaching an airport including maintenance hanger  (or other limited maintenance resources), computing electronics  may be configured to analyze data from both aircraft ,  to determine if either aircraft are in need of maintenance resources. If either aircraft is in need of maintenance resources, computing electronics  will update aircraft maintenance schedule  (e.g., while the aircraft in need of maintenance is still in the air). Updating aircraft maintenance schedule  may include assigning an identifier for the aircraft to a particular date and time slot of the maintenance schedule . Updating the aircraft maintenance schedule  may also include or cause updating of other maintenance related systems or databases. For example, when computing electronics  updates aircraft maintenance schedule , the computing electronics  may also cause a parts inventory system  to be updated, a flight scheduling system  to be updated, a human resources (HR) scheduling system  to be updated, and\/or a real estate scheduling system  to be updated. In an exemplary embodiment, however, computing electronics  are configured to coordinate maintenance data and maintenance activities for a plurality of connected systems. For example, when computing electronics  determines that aircraft  is in need of maintenance, computing electronics can conduct further communications with aircraft  to further analyze any faulty parts or systems of aircraft . Computing electronics  may then establish a comprehensive maintenance \u201cplan\u201d for aircraft . For example, computing electronics  may assign a date and time for maintenance of the aircraft , communicate with real estate scheduling system  to reserve maintenance hanger  for the date and time, communicate with HR scheduling  to assign a team (e.g., one or more maintenance managers or technicians) to conduct the maintenance during the date and time, communicate with the parts inventory system  to ship the proper parts to maintenance hanger  prior to the date and time of the maintenance, and communicate with flight scheduling system  to ensure that aircraft  is not scheduled to fly until after the maintenance is completed. Flights previously scheduled for aircraft  may be reassigned to other aircraft so that a minimum number of flights are cancelled.","A maintenance plan determined by computing electronics  may be communicated to a maintenance manager or other employee  via a maintenance portal system  in communication with a client . The maintenance portal system  may be configured to cause client  to display graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and to allow the maintenance manager  to accept, revise, or deny the maintenance plan proposed by computing electronics . Maintenance portal system  may be a stand-alone system configured to interface with computing electronics  in a distributed fashion (as shown) or maintenance portal system  may be integrated with computing electronics . Maintenance portal system  may cause GUIs to be displayed on client  that include, for example, fault or maintenance alerts for a plurality of aircraft, chat, voice, or video connections to maintenance experts, maintenance histories for a plurality of aircraft or parts, and work orders currently in progress, scheduled, and\/or completed for a particular aircraft or a plurality of aircraft. Maintenance portal system  may further allow client  to request and display manuals for particular parts or aircraft, public or private \u201cwiki\u201d entries for the aircraft or parts at-issue, or information from any one or more of systems -.","Communications electronics  are shown as being ground-based, but may be satellite-based in other exemplary embodiments. Communications electronics  may be distributed (e.g., a network of radio towers) or may be implemented at a single location for a single airport or other entities use. In some embodiments, communications electronics  are integrated with computing electronics  and\/or take the place of communications interface . Communications electronics  may be configured to communicate using cellular communications technologies, VHF radio, Iridium satellite communications, or any other wireless data communications technology.","Communications electronics  are shown as communicably coupled to network  (e.g., Internet, WAN, LAN, etc.). In other exemplary embodiments, communications electronics  may be configured to communicate directly with communications interface  of computing electronics  (e.g., via wired or wireless communications). Computing electronics  may be located remotely from communications electronics  (e.g., at an airline maintenance headquarters).","Each aircraft ,  may include onboard systems configured to support the communications and computing activities of system . For example, each aircraft ,  may include onboard systems as shown in  or otherwise. Computing electronics  are shown to include a connectivity manager  which may be a software module configured to include, for example, a data delivery client or server for managing the flow of information between the plurality of aircraft ,  and computing electronics . Connectivity manager  may, for example, query aircraft and handle responses from the aircraft or may be configured to handle data \u201cpushed\u201d from the aircraft to the computing electronics . Connectivity manager  may further be configured to manage activities or hardware of communications interface  (e.g., which may include circuitry and\/or drivers for operating communication electronics ). Connectivity manager  may also be configured to handle authentication and security activities for computing electronics , ensuring that only authorized aircraft or communications sources are granted access to the data of computing electronics .","Computing electronics  are shown to include expert systems . Expert systems  may be or include one or more software systems configured to simulate a decision making process of an expert. Expert systems  may utilize inputs from the plurality of aircraft , , maintenance portal system , and\/or any of systems - as inputs to decision making processes. Expert systems  may further include a knowledgebase and a knowledge engine configured to apply the plurality of inputs and the knowledgebase in a meaningful way. Computing electronics  may include other modules and components as shown and described, for example, in .","Referring now to , a flow chart of a process  for scheduling aircraft maintenance is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. Process  is shown to include receiving data from systems onboard a plurality of aircraft while the aircraft are in flight (step ). Process  is further shown to include using an expert system to predict maintenance needs for the aircraft based on the received data (step ). While step  is shown to include using an expert system, it should be noted that other predictive systems may be used. Whether the prediction is conducted by an expert system or other processing system, the prediction may be completed using any type or number of prediction logic (e.g., model-based, statistical, forward-chaining, backward-chaining, etc.). Process  is further shown to include updating a maintenance schedule for the plurality of aircraft based on the received data and the predicted maintenance needs for the aircraft (step ). As described above, updating the maintenance schedule may include any number of sub-steps or other related activities such as coordinating plans and resources with other maintenance-related systems (e.g., systems - shown in ).","Referring now to , a more detailed flow chart of a process  for scheduling aircraft maintenance is shown, according to another exemplary embodiment. Process  is shown to include an aircraft's onboard maintenance system (OMS) generating maintenance related data including a fault, alarm, or other information (step ). As examples of other information, the maintenance related data may include performance data such as the flight speed of the aircraft, the temperature differences experienced by the aircraft, the number of rapid accelerations experienced by the aircraft, the average rotations per second of an aircraft engine, or other aircraft data. Aircraft systems other than or in addition to the OMS may also generate the maintenance related data.","Process  is further shown to include the aircraft's OMS providing the maintenance related data to an onboard communications system during flight of the aircraft for wireless transmission to ground-based communications electronics (step ). As previously noted, any number of intermediate communications devices or networks (e.g., satellites, cellular networks, relays, wireless access points, etc.) may exist between the aircraft's onboard communications system and the intended ground-based communications electronics. The ground-based communications electronics then receive the maintenance related data transmitted from the onboard communications system of the aircraft during flight and provide the data to computing electronics for processing (step ).","Referring further to , process  is further shown to include, at the computing electronics (or a subsystem in communication therewith), predicting the need for maintenance of one or more aircraft using the data received from the aircraft in flight (step ). The need for maintenance of the one or more aircraft may be calculated or estimated using an expert system or any other logic or algorithms (e.g., comparing values of the received data to thresholds, applying many received data points to a weighted-multivariable function to determine whether maintenance is now desired, etc.). Predicting the need for maintenance may also include querying the relevant aircraft-based system for additional information. For example, if a fault is initially transmitted from the aircraft to the computing electronics, the computing electronics may query the system that produced the fault for diagnostics information or information that can be used for additional diagnostics. The additional information queried for may include, for example, current input and output values for the system, values or parameters of the system when the fault occurred, historical values, or other state or value information of the aircraft.","Referring now to , process  is further shown to include providing the maintenance related data received from the aircraft to an expert system configured to determine the urgency of maintenance for the aircraft (step ). Like the predicting step, this step may also include transmitting a query or request for additional information to the aircraft. Urgency may be ranked and expressed by the system in any number of ways. For example, the computing electronics may rank maintenance urgency on three levels (e.g., low, medium, high). In other embodiments, the urgency is expressed in terms of minimum number of additional flight hours before repair and\/or with an action rule accompanying the urgency (e.g., zero hours\u2014must land plane to service immediately, three hours\u2014may complete flight if within the three hours, twelve hours\u2014may make one or more additional flight legs prior to maintenance, etc.).","Process  is further shown to include receiving, at the expert system, information regarding when and where maintenance resources are available (step ). The \u201cwhen and where\u201d information is used by the expert system, in addition to the data received from the in-flight aircraft and information predicted or determined in any previous step, to determine a maintenance schedule for the aircraft that is in flight (step ). One or more maintenance schedules are updated in response to the determination of step .","Referring now to , a detailed block diagram of the computing electronics of the system for scheduling aircraft maintenance is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. Computing electronics  are shown to include a processor  and memory . Processor  may be a general or specific purpose processor configured to execute computer code or instructions stored in memory  or received from other computer readable media (e.g., CDROM, network storage, a remote server, etc.). Memory  may be RAM, hard drive storage, temporary storage, non-volatile memory, flash memory, optical memory, or any other suitable memory for storing software objects and\/or computer instructions. When processor  executes instructions stored in memory  for completing the various activities described herein, processor  generally causes computing electronics  to complete such activities.","In addition to aircraft maintenance schedule , connectivity manager , and expert systems , the block diagram shown in  is shown to include a data aggregation module , a data archive , a knowledgebase , a client services module , and a statistical analysis module . Data aggregation module  is configured to aggregate data from one or more of the inputs to computing electronics . For example, data aggregation module  may be configured to aggregate maintenance-related information or performance-related information from the plurality of aircraft , . Data aggregation module  may also be configured to aggregate information from, for example, multiple parts inventories or parts inventory systems such as system , one or more flight scheduling systems , one or more weather systems , one or more remote diagnostics systems , or from any other combination of external data sources. Data that is aggregated by data aggregation module  may be provided to data archive  for use by other modules or logic of computing electronics . Data archive  may be or include one or more relational databases, hash tables, lookup table, ordered list, linked list or other data structure or structures configured to organize and store archived data for retrieval. Knowledgebase  is a computer-readable knowledge base configured to store knowledge (e.g., rules, relational information, etc.) to assist deductive reasoning logic of expert systems . Knowledgebase  may be updated as computing electronics 's experience changes. For example, if certain parts on an aircraft begin failing sooner than expected, the data aggregation module  (or another logic module or process of computing electronics ) may update the knowledgebase  so that expert systems 's handles or provides warnings relative to the certain parts earlier. Knowledgebase  or expert systems  may further be supported by statistical analysis module . Statistical analysis module  may be configured to conduct a detailed statistical analysis of groups of data from a plurality of aircraft. Statistical analysis module  may, for example, continually operate on data archive  to find trends, correlations, test conclusions, or otherwise. Results from statistical analysis module  may be presented to a user via a report or graphical user interface. In other embodiments results from statistical analysis module  may be used to update knowledgebase , to assist expert systems  in making a decision, or by a sorting or ordering feature of aircraft maintenance schedule .","Referring further to , client services module  may be configured to provide application programming interfaces, web services, remote service invocation features, or any other services for allowing remote devices, clients or processes to communicate with computing electronics . For example, maintenance portal system  may be configured to communicate with the data and modules of computing electronics  via a web service provided by client services module . Any of components , , , , , , , and  may include computer code or instructions executable by processor . The computer code may include script code, object code, compilable code, or any other suitable code or instructions.","Referring now to , a block diagram of an aircraft system for use with scheduling systems of the present invention is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. The aircraft system is shown to be mounted or installed in or on aircraft . The aircraft system is shown to include information management system (IMS) . Information management system  may be configured to conduct data loading from other aircraft systems such as aircraft avionics systems , aircraft onboard maintenance systems (OMS) , aircraft cabin systems , and any other aircraft system via communications connections or networks in the aircraft. For example, aircraft  is shown to include avionics network  and data communications network  which IMS  is configured to use. Once data from aircraft systems is received or loaded by IMS , then IMS  provides the data to wireless communications system  (e.g., satellite communications system, radio communications system, etc.) for direct or eventual transmission to a ground-based maintenance system as described in previous Figures or in other embodiments of the present invention.","Referring further to , avionics systems  may include aviation electronics for the aircraft including one or more of a cockpit display system, a communications system, a navigation systems, a GPS system, a VOR or LORAN system, a monitoring system, an aircraft flight control systems, a fly-by-wire system, a collision-avoidance system, a weather system, a radar system, an aircraft management system, a tactical avionics system, a military communications system, a sonar system, and\/or an electro-optic system. While data from one or more of the avionics systems  may be forwarded to a ground-based maintenance system of the present invention by IMS  without any or much processing by IMS , in other embodiments IMS  may be configured to conduct some analysis of data from the various avionics systems  (for example, to estimate if a fault exists prior to sending data to the ground).","OMS  includes one or more processing devices configured to at least detect and, in some cases, diagnose anomalies or faults of one or more aircraft systems. OMS  may include a number of sensors distributed about the aircraft configured to provide signals for interpretation by processing circuitry of OMS . OMS  may be configured to conduct some of the analysis described above with respect to an expert system on the ground. For example, OMS  may analyze sensor input or other aircraft information to determine an urgency or severity parameter and provide the urgency or severity parameter to wireless communications system  with descriptive information for use by the ground-based maintenance system or expert system. In some embodiments, OMS  may include its own expert systems configured to work in alone or in conjunction with expert systems of the ground-based maintenance system.","Cabin systems  may include, for example, an entertainment system, a mapping system for allowing passenger's to view the aircraft's progress on a map, a drink ordering system, or other aircraft systems that are associated with the cabin of the aircraft. Cabin systems  (via a master controller or separately) may communicate fault or performance information to data communications network  for transmission to IMS  and eventual communication via wireless communications system . For example, if the aircraft's entertainment system is beginning to provide error codes, those codes may be communicated to the ground-based maintenance scheduling system during flight.","Avionics network  is shown as communicably coupling avionics systems  and IMS . While avionics network  is shown as a single network, it should be noted that in various exemplary embodiments, more than one avionics network  or bus may be provided in aircraft  for providing avionics data to IMS . Avionics network  may be configured to communicate via one or more standard or proprietary protocols. For example, avionics network  may be an aircraft data network, an avionics-full duplex switched Ethernet (AFDX) network, an ARINC network, an IEEE 1394b network, or any other suitable network.","Data communications network  may be an Ethernet network, an optical network, a network as described above with respect to avionics network , or otherwise. Data communications network  is configured to receive data communications from OMS , cabin systems  or other aircraft systems and to provide the data communications to IMS  for transmission via wireless communications system .","Interface  may be one or more jacks, communications circuits, communications drivers, terminals, or other hardware for joining networks ,  to IMS . For example, interface  may include an ARINC  jack and associated circuitry as well as an Ethernet jack and associated circuitry for receiving communications from both avionics network  and data communications network .","IMS  is shown to include a processor  and memory . Processor  may be a general or specific purpose processor configured to execute computer code or instructions stored in memory  or received from other computer readable media (e.g., CDROM, network storage, a remote server, etc.). Memory  may be RAM, hard drive storage, temporary storage, non-volatile memory, flash memory, optical memory, or any other suitable memory for storing software objects and\/or computer instructions. When processor  executes instructions stored in memory  for completing the various activities described herein, processor  generally causes IMS  to complete such activities.","Memory  is shown to include a fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) unit , a local data log , and a performance manager . The fault detection and diagnostics unit  is configured to analyze inputs received from avionics systems , OMS , or cabin systems  in order to detect or diagnose faults (e.g., errors, alerts, alarms, etc.) provided by systems , , . Fault detection and diagnostics unit  may be configured to serve as a \u201cfirst level\u201d or \u201cfirst filter\u201d of information from avionics systems , , and . For example, when an alarm is generated by one or more of systems , , and  it may first be provided to fault detection and diagnostics unit . Fault detection and diagnostics unit  may process the alarm according to one or more algorithms to determine if the alarm is of a severity level that should be reported in flight. In other embodiments, fault detection and diagnostics unit  will wait for another instance of the same alarm to determine if the first alarm was merely \u201cnoise\u201d\u2014and not something that should be provided to the ground. In other embodiments, fault detection and diagnostics unit  is configured to receive an alarm and to actively respond to the alarm with one or more diagnostics routines. The diagnostics routines may request or otherwise gather additional information from the system or systems that generated the alarm. The fault detection and diagnostics unit  may then package the alarm with relevant information or unit  may be configured to attempt to describe the alarm using its own logic (e.g., by wrapping the alarm with one or more XML tags, etc.) and to send the description to the ground-based maintenance system.","Local data log  may be a memory buffer or a log retained on IMS  of the information received from systems , , or . Fault detection and diagnostics module , performance manager , and query service  may be configured to operate on data stored in local data log . In some embodiments, IMS  may be configured to transform data stored within memory  and local data log  prior to sending the information on to a ground-maintenance station via wireless communications system .","Performance manager  may be configured to analyze data from systems ,  or  for performance reasons or against performance benchmarks. For example, performance manager  may be configured to determine whether the navigation performance of the aircraft is within a certain threshold of performance. In other embodiments, performance manager  may be configured to receive information (e.g., from other aircraft) against which performance manager  compares aircraft 's performance.","Query service module  is configured to provide a service through which a ground-based maintenance system (e.g., including computing electronics  or maintenance portal system ) can query IMS . As previously noted, when a fault or other data is detected in one of systems , , and  and communicated to the ground-based maintenance system, the ground-based maintenance system may include one or more process steps that include requesting additional information from the aircraft for use in further diagnostics, expert systems, or scheduling processing. For example, a query may request further information about a fault to determine if the fault is indicating an urgent problem or a problem of reduced importance. The expert systems (e.g., expert systems ) may be configured to query the aircraft via query service  during multiple branches of a process to determine how to update a maintenance schedule. The query service  may be a web service, an SQL service, an XML-based service, a proprietary service, a service according to a standard communications protocol, or otherwise.","Referring now to , a flow chart of a process  for scheduling aircraft maintenance is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. Process  is shown to include a plurality of equipment onboard an aircraft generating data (e.g., usage information, fault information, etc.) (step ) and providing the data to an onboard communications system during flight for wireless transmission to ground-based communications electronics (step ).","Process  is further shown to include receiving the data transmitted from the onboard communications system of the aircraft during flight and providing the data to computing electronics for processing (step ). Process  yet further includes predicting, at the computing electronics, the need for maintenance for the plurality of equipment onboard the aircraft using the received data (step ). The computing electronics then uses the predicted need for maintenance for the plurality of equipment onboard the aircraft to update a maintenance schedule for the aircraft (step ). The computing electronics may be configured to update the maintenance schedule by adjusting a scheduled maintenance appointment for at least one of the plurality of equipment onboard the aircraft. The computing electronics may be configured to update the maintenance schedule by adding a maintenance task to a \u201cto-do\u201d list (e.g., checklist, etc.) for the next scheduled maintenance appointment based on the received data. The communications electronics and the computing electronics may further be configured to coordinate maintenance schedules for a plurality of aircraft (e.g., by resolving conflicts between schedules for the plurality of aircraft based on data received from aircraft while in flight).","Referring further to , it should be noted that in some embodiments the device on the aircraft may include a processing circuit configured to generate additional information for the aircraft equipment based on logged data prior to sending the data to the ground. For example, a processing circuit in the aircraft may be configured to perform a calculation to generate the additional information including, e.g., a diagnostics calculation, a usage calculation, a statistical model, a fault detection routine, and a thresholding analysis. The processing circuit may further be configured to predict a maintenance need for aircraft equipment based on the calculated additional information. The processing circuit may then cause at least one of the prediction and the calculated additional information to be wirelessly transmitted to the ground-based aircraft maintenance system. In other embodiments, the logged data is not transmitted\u2014only the generated additional information (e.g., a suggested maintenance update, a diagnostics conclusion, etc.).","In yet another embodiment of the invention the predicting and maintenance schedule updating steps are conducted by computing electronics onboard an aircraft and the updated maintenance schedule is communicated to ground-based systems for synchronization or use (e.g., by a maintenance manager system, etc.).","It should be noted that while many of the systems and methods described herein are mentioned as conducting wireless data communications while the aircraft is in flight, in the same systems and methods or in alternative systems and methods the data communications may be conducted while the aircraft is on the ground (e.g., via wired and\/or wireless communications). Yet further, it should be noted that the systems and methods described herein for predicting service needs or updating maintenance schedules may be provided to a single aircraft (e.g., using data from a plurality of aircraft subsystems or equipment) or for a plurality of aircraft (e.g., to coordinate maintenance activities across a fleet.","The construction and arrangement of the systems and methods as shown in the various exemplary embodiments are illustrative only. Although only a few embodiments have been described in detail in this disclosure, many modifications are possible (e.g., variations in sizes, dimensions, structures, shapes and proportions of the various elements, values of parameters, mounting arrangements, use of materials, colors, orientations, etc.). For example, the position of elements may be reversed or otherwise varied and the nature or number of discrete elements or positions may be altered or varied. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure. The order or sequence of any process or method steps may be varied or re-sequenced according to alternative embodiments.

The present disclosure contemplates methods, systems and program products on any machine-readable media for accomplishing various operations. The embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented using existing computer processors, or by a special purpose computer processor for an appropriate system, incorporated for this or another purpose, or by a hardwired system. Embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure include program products comprising machine-readable media for carrying or having machine-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such machine-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer or other machine with a processor.
