title: Methods and apparatus for controlling devices within storage network
abstract: A management station includes a management application that controls zoning within devices manufactured or provided from different vendors within a network, such as a data storage network. The management application receives a generic zone control command from a user to control zoning within a device in the network. The management application translates the zone control command to one or more vendor specific device zone control commands in a vendor specific device command set that is specifically designed to control zoning within devices from a specific vendor. To perform the translation, the management application identifies the vendor of one or more devices that are affected by the zone control command. Based on this identification, the management application selects an appropriate vendor specific device command set that contains vendor specific zone control commands.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to systems for managing data storage, and more particularly, to systems and techniques which provide control of various heterogeneous devices within a networked data storage environment.","The vast growth of information service and data processing industries has resulted in a need for computer systems to manage and store large amounts of data. As an example, financial service businesses such as banks, mutual fund companies or the like often operate large and complex data processing systems that require access to many hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of data. Data storage system developers have responded to these types of data storage requirements by integrating large capacity data storage systems into networks called \u201cstorage networks\u201d.","As this name implies, a storage network is a collection of data storage systems that are networked with each other and with a number of host computer systems that operate as servers to serve data stored in the data storage systems. In a typical implementation, one or more connectivity devices, such as high speed data switches, interconnect the various data storage systems to each other and to one or more servers of the computer systems (servers) that require access to (e.g., read and\/or write) the data in the data storage systems. As the servers access (e.g., read and\/or write) the data, the data switches channel the data access requests (e.g., data read requests, data write requests) to the appropriate data storage systems within the storage network.","A network management station is also included in a typical data storage network. Generally, the network management station manages the servers, data switches, and data storage systems the comprise the storage network. To do so, the network management station includes management software that can remotely control, manage and configure components of the data storage network. By way of example, the management software can configure allocations of storage network resources (e.g., one or more data storage volumes) to specific hosts or groups of host computer systems (e.g., servers or other computer systems that require access to data in the storage network). Storage network resources that can be managed in this manner include, among other things, disk partitions, volume configurations, and access control mechanisms within the data storage systems and the data switches. In some storage networks, the network management station and associated management software allows a network administrator or systems manager (a person responsible for managing the storage network) to establish \u201czones\u201d of related resources within the storage network.","Generally, a zone of resources within a storage network is an association, relation or grouping of resources (e.g., servers, switch channels, portions of data storage) that are arranged according to function or location. By way of example, a network administrator can use conventional vendor-supplied (i.e., manufacturer supplied) storage network management software to configure a zone of ports (data communications channels or paths) within that vendor's data switch to associate certain servers in the data storage network with certain allocations of data storage within one or more of the data storage systems in the data storage network. Thus, the network administrator might, for example, define a zone to include a server or group of servers, a dedicated channel through the data switch (via allocation of one or more ports), and an amount of data storage space in the form of one or more volumes of storage maintained within one or more of the data storage systems. An administrator might create such a zone in the storage network, for example, for each department (e.g., engineering, accounting, human resources, and the like) within a company.","A data switch (one or more) that channels requests for data between the various data storage devices and server computer systems is generally responsible for zone enforcement. In operation of a typical data switch, each port within the data switch is dedicated to transferring data to and\/or from a single respective data storage system or server computer system. To create a zone, the management software causes the data switch to establish a grouping of one or more server ports (i.e., connections between the data switch and a server) with one or more data storage system ports (i.e., connections between the data switch and a data storage system) together into a zone. Generally, resources (servers, switch ports, and portions of data storage systems) within the same zone can \u201csee\u201d or access each other, while resources in different zones cannot access each other. As an example, a server in a first zone can access data storage in the first zone, but not data storage allocated to other zones. Thus, zoning in the context of storage networks operates as a form of access control and provides an organized mechanism of managing and associating amounts of data storage to specific computer systems.","Typically, a network administrator creates a zone of servers and associated storage resources for an intended purpose. For example, an administrator might place accounting servers and accounting data into an accounting zone, while engineering servers and engineering data storage resources might be placed into an engineering zone.","Most manufacturers of storage network equipment (data storage systems and data switching equipment to handle data access requests) provide some form of zoning capabilities within vendor-supplied management software that is specifically designed to manage devices manufactured by that vendor's data storage network equipment product line. As noted above, most manufactures implement zoning within the data switching equipment as this equipment serves as the central data transfer point to handle the transfer of data access requests between server computer systems and the data storage systems which store the data.","Though zoning is a common characteristic in storage network equipment (e.g., data switches) made by different manufacturers, the commands and interfaces used to control zoning within a particular manufacturers equipment are often specific to that manufacturer. As an example, commands used to control zoning within a data switch for use in storage networks manufactured by IBM Corporation might differ from commands used to control zoning within a data switch for use in storage networks manufactured by EMC Corporation. Other data storage network manufactures and vendors such as Brocade Communications Incorporated, Hitachi, Mercury Computer Systems, and the like might each provide a set of zoning control and configuration commands that differ from each other. These zoning control commands are typically implemented within vendor supplied and vendor specific management software applications. Such conventional zoning control and management applications cannot control zoning in devices made by other vendors. This may be problematic if a customer desires to use storage network equipment made by different manufacturers within the same storage network.","For instance, if a customer uses a data switch from IBM Corporation and another data switch from Hitachi Corporation in the same data storage network, various problems might arise when that customer attempts to configure zoning within each of these different data switches. Each data switch may require that a network administrator perform zoning configuration and control using zoning commands designed and developed by the specific manufacturer of the switch, as implemented within that manufacturer's storage network management software. As such, the network administrator might be required to operate two different storage network management software applications. One storage network management application might be provided from IBM to provide proper control of zoning in the IBM data switch, and another storage network management application might be provided from Hitachi to properly control zoning in the Hitachi data switch. Each network management application might have a different user interface and each may operate quite differently from the other. Each management application might also require the customer to have knowledge of different installation and configuration procedures and may require separate payments of software licensing fees. Generally, overhead increases if a customer must maintain, learn and operate different storage network management applications from different manufacturers in order to manage, configure and control different data storage network equipment installed in the same data storage network.","The present invention addresses these and other issues concerning the incompatibilities and difficulties encountered when a customer desires to use data storage networking equipment from different vendors or manufacturers in the same data storage network. While the present invention specifically addresses such issues with respect to zoning control in a data storage network, the invention is also generally applicable to overcoming similar issues with respect to the operation of similar features (e.g., access control, device management, and so forth) that are present within storage network devices from various manufacturers in cases where those features are controlled or configured differently from each other.","More specifically, the present invention provides mechanisms and techniques that provide a management station which includes a management application that can control zoning within devices manufactured or provided from different vendors within a network such as a data storage network. The management application can receive a generic zone control command from a user to control zoning within a device in the network. The management application can then translate the generic zone control command to one or more vendor specific device zone control commands in a vendor specific device command set that is specifically designed to control zoning within devices from that vendor\/manufacturer. To perform the translation, the management application can identify the vendor of one or more devices that are affected by the generic zone control command. Based in this identification, the management application can select and load an appropriate vendor device command set. The generic zone control command may be in a format that is readily compatible with the vendor specific device command in the vendor specific device command set. However, if needed, the management application can also access a command mapping that maps (i.e., that matches) parameters for the generic zone control command(s) to parameters of the vendor specific zone control commands. Thus translation may include simply calling the vendor specific command based on the generic command, or the generic command may be mapped to the vendor specific command.","Once translated, the management application can perform the vendor specific device commands to control zoning in devices from that vendor in the network. Vendor specific device command sets may be dynamically linked libraries, for example, which can be loaded into memory as needed. A typical device in which zoning can be controlled in this manner is a data storage network switch that channels data between servers and data storage systems in a data storage network. Since the management application can control zoning in devices made by different vendors\/manufacturers which are installed in the same network, a system manager does not need to load vendor specific management applications onto the management station, nor do they need to learn each user interface for each vendor specific management application.","According to one embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for controlling zoning within a device. The method comprises the steps of receiving a generic zone control command, translating (i.e., either directly calling or mapping and then calling) the generic zone control command to at least one vendor specific device command of a plurality of vendor specific device commands that respectively control zoning in a plurality of different vendor devices, and performing (e.g., executing) the at least one vendor device command to control zoning in a device. Since the generic zone control command is translated to one or more vendor device commands chosen from a database of vendor device commands (e.g., vendor command sets) that can control zoning in devices from different vendors, the method allows a single mechanism, such as a management application that incorporates the method, to be used to control zoning in many different devices from many different vendors in the same network, such as a data storage network.","According to another method embodiment of the invention, the step of translating includes steps of identifying a vendor of at least one device within the zone corresponding to the generic zone control command and selecting a set of vendor specific device commands, from the plurality of vendor specific device commands, that corresponds to the vendor of the device within the zone. The method also includes the operation of mapping the generic zone control command to at least one vendor specific device command within the set of vendor specific device commands. In this manner, the mapping operation can determine the vendor of a device which is affected by the generic zone control command and can choose a vendor specific device command set based on this vendor identification.","According to another embodiment of the invention, the step of selecting selects the set of vendor specific device commands that are specific to a vendor of a device within the zone to which the generic zone control command is directed. For example, in a management application that uses this method embodiment, if the management application receives a generic zone control command to control zoning (e.g., to configure a port to be included in a zone) in a data network switch manufactured by EMC Corporation, the management application can identify EMC as the vendor of the switch and can load an appropriate command set (e.g., an EMC supplied dynamically linked library of data network switch routines) that can specifically control zoning in the EMC switch affected by that generic zone control command. Once loaded, the management application can map the generic zone control command to one or more EMC specific zone control commands within that command set. It is to be generally understood that those skilled in the art are familiar with dynamically loading libraries into software applications to allow such application to access functions or routines within those libraries.","In yet another embodiment, the step of identifying includes steps of identifying a zone that is affected by the generic zone control command and identifying devices within the zone that are affected by the generic zone control command and identifying vendors of the devices within the zone that are affected by the generic zone control command. These operations allow a management application to determine which vendor specific command sets will be required to properly carry out the intended function of the generic zone control command.","In another embodiment, the plurality of vendor specific device commands include sets of vendor specific device commands (e.g., commands that are specific to controlling functions of devices, such as zoning, from a specific vendor). In this embodiment, the step of translating includes the steps of selecting a set of vendor specific device commands that can control zoning within a device to which the generic zone control command is directed and dynamically loading the set of vendor specific device commands into a management application to allow the management application to control zoning within the device to which the generic zone control command is directed. Since the vendor specific device command sets can be dynamically loaded, for example, into a memory system, a management application employing this technique can control zoning in hardware added into a network at anytime, even after the management application has commenced processing. That is, hardware can be added to a network anytime as long as the management application is provided with a database or other resource containing the vendor specific commands sets to control zoning in the new hardware. When zoning control is attempted on the new hardware via the management application, the management application can select the proper zoning control commands, for example, based on an identification of the vendor of the new hardware.","In an alternative embodiment, the step of translating includes steps of selecting the vendor specific device command (one or more), within the set of vendor specific device commands, that performs zoning operations in the device to which the generic zone control command is directed in accordance with the generic zone control command and mapping parameters of the generic zone control command to parameters of the vendor specific device command(s) to provide the vendor specific device command(s) with data required to perform the zoning operations in the device. A command mapping or other data structure (e.g., linked list, object or relational database, etc.) may be used to indicate how parameters of the generic zone control command(s) properly map to parameters of vendor specific zone control command(s).","In yet another embodiment, the step of receiving receives the generic zone control command from a device management application that can control zoning in a network of devices from different vendors. Since devices from different vendors may be incorporated into the same network and zoning in these devices may be managed by the management application provided by this invention, there is no need to use management applications provided for each specific vendor of each specific device to control zoning. This saves significant learning time on behalf of a network administrator or a systems manager since that person need not learn specific vendor management application software interfaces.","In another alternative embodiment, the step of performing performs the vendor specific device command to control zoning within a device from a vendor that is a vendor of devices that are controlled by the specific vendor specific device command to which the generic zone control command is translated. That is, vendor specific zone control commands provided from a vendor of the device affected by the generic zone control command are used to control zoning.","In still another embodiment, the step of translating includes the step of loading a library of vendor specific device commands into a management application based on a vendor of a device affected by the generic zone control command to allow the management application to perform vendor specific device commands in order to carry out the generic zone control command within the device affected by the zoned control command.","In another method embodiment, the steps of receiving, translating and performing are processed by a management application that controls zoning within devices in a data storage network. In this embodiment, the step of translating includes a step of loading a dynamically linked library of vendor specific device commands, selected based on a vendor of a device affected by the zoning control command, into a memory for use by the management application to control zoning in the device.","The present invention also provides other embodiments which include a computer system configured to control zoning in a plurality of devices from different vendors in a network. In such embodiments, the computer system comprises an input-output interface, a processor and a memory system coupled to the processor and to the input-output interface and encoded with instructions that form a multi-zone management application. When the multi-zone management application is performed on the processor (e.g., executes, interprets or otherwise processes), it causes the computer system to receive, via the input-output interface, a generic zone control command and to translate the generic zone control command to at least one vendor specific device command of a plurality of vendor specific device commands (e.g., selected from a library via a command mapping) that respectively control zoning in a plurality of different vendor devices coupled to the input-output interface. The computer system also performs, via the multi-zone management application in the memory system, the vendor specific device command(s) to control zoning in a device coupled to the input-output interface. In other words, once the generic zone control command is translated to one or more vendor specific commands, the management application performs the vendor specific commands to control zoning in devices made by the vendor who supplied to vendor specific commands. In an alternative embodiment, the computer system also includes a multi-zone command database containing the plurality of vendor specific device commands and command mappings which can be loaded into the memory system upon identification of specific vendors of devices to which generic zone control commands are directed.","According to other embodiments of the invention, the processor performs (e.g., executes, interprets or otherwise processes) instructions, code or logic (e.g., a software module, library, program, or the like) that is encoded into the memory system to provide all of the operations disclosed in the method embodiments (i.e., steps, operations) and configurations summarized above and as explained herein.","Other embodiments include a computer system configured as a management station to perform all of the aforementioned methods via software control, or via hardware and\/or software configured to perform those methods and the techniques disclosed herein as the invention.","Other embodiments of the invention that are disclosed herein include software programs to perform the operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below. More particularly, a computer program product is disclosed which has a computer-readable medium including computer program logic encoded thereon to provide the methods for controlling zoning within a device according to this invention and its associated operations. The computer program logic, when executed on at least one processor within a computing system, causes the processor to perform the operations (e.g., the method embodiments above, and described in detail later) indicated herein. This arrangement of the invention is typically provided as software on a computer readable medium such as an optical medium (e.g., CD-ROM), floppy or hard disk or other such medium such as firmware in one or more ROM or RAM or PROM chips or as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The software or firmware or other such configurations can be installed onto a computer system to cause the computer system to perform the techniques explained herein as the invention.","It is to be understood that the system of the invention can be embodied strictly as a software program, as software and hardware, or as hardware alone. Is also to be understood that the management application of this invention typically performs (e.g., executes, runs, or is otherwise operated) on a management station coupled to a data storage or other type of network. The management station is generally networked but is typically a dedicated computer system, personal computer or workstation operated by a network or systems administrator or manager. In alternative arrangements however, the management application of this invention may reside on a computer system located elsewhere on the network and the user (e.g., systems manager) that provides the generic zone control commands may be located elsewhere on the network and may be communicating with the management station over a network connection (e.g., WWW or other browser-type interface, command-line interface, messaging interface, E-Mail, or another protocol or interface). Moreover, the multi-zone command database may be local to, or remotely located from the management station and may be any type of database or storage mechanism that can store data.","An example implementation of the invention that incorporates certain of the aforementioned embodiments is the Enterprise Control Center (ECC) software management application manufactured by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass. which can control devices in data storage networks.","The present invention provides techniques and mechanisms that allow a systems manager (person responsible for management and control of computing systems and\/or other components) to control and configure different devices produced by different manufacturers that co-exist and operate together within a single data storage network. In particular, the invention allows a single network management application (e.g., software program) to control zoning in various data storage network devices such as switches that each might require a different command set or a different application programming interface (API) for zoning control.","Generally, a management application configured with this invention provides a generic set of data storage network administration zoning control commands for selection and use by the systems manager. When the systems manager selects a generic zoning control command, such as \u201cADD STORAGE DEVICE XYZ TO ZONE 1,\u201d the system of the invention can determine what devices (e.g., what switch(s) in the network) are (or will be) specifically required or involved to perform this zoning command. Once this is determined, the management application can access the appropriate vendor-specific command set(s) that will allow this zoning command to be carried out within the specific devices (e.g., vendor switches). The vendor-specific command sets can be dynamically linked libraries, for example, that provide functionality to control zoning in a specific vendor switch in the storage network. The management application loads the appropriate vendor specific command set(s) and performs the generic zone control command using any required corresponding vendor specific command(s) contained within the vendor-specific command set.","It may be the case that the generic zone control command is identical in nature to a command in the vendor specific command set, in which case the generic zone control command essentially is the same command with the vendor specific command set. In an alternative case, the invention may need to map, translate or otherwise convert the generic zone control command to one or more vendor specific commands (e.g., map parameters of generic command to parameters of vendor specific command). Since the management application provides generic zone control commands that correspond to zone control commands in each manufacturers command set, zoning control can be implemented in a standard fashion irrespective of the specific zoning control application programming interfaces required for each device from each different device manufacturer or vendor.","Moreover, in the case where the generic zone control commands are the same as (i.e., are in the same format with the same command name, parameters, etc.) the vendor specific commands, no mapping is needed and the management application can simply load the required vendor specific command set and call commands within this set (via the generic commands that are the same) to carry out zone control operations. No mapping of commands may be needed in this case. In cases where there may be difference in the generic and vendor zone control commands and a mapping is needed, the invention may provide the mapping ahead of time as a \u201cwrapper\u201d to the vendor specific command set that serves to translate the generic zone control commands to vendor specific commands. Alternatively, the mapping of such commands may be done in real-time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","140","142","144","120","122","150","156","130","132","350","350","300","310","350","300","120","122","120","122","140","144","150","156","120","122","120","122"]},"In this particular example, the data storage network  is configured into three zones (zone-1, zone-2, zone-3). As noted above, the zones in this example are essentially groupings of ports within the switches , . Zone-1 includes the zone-1 hosts , the zone-1 server , and the zone-1 data storage systems . Zone-2 includes the zone-2 hosts , the zone-2 server , and the zone-2 data storage systems  and . Zone-3 includes the zone-3 host  (i.e., the network management station in this example), the zone-3 server , and the zone-3 data storage systems . The data storage network switches ,  are configured to support and enforce the zones within the data storage network .","Of particular importance to this example embodiment of the invention is that different vendors or manufacturers produce the various switches ,  (as well as other devices) installed within this example data storage network . In other words, the data storage network  is a composition of various heterogeneous components that may each operate or be controlled somewhat differently from each other. For instance, data storage network switches ,  are manufactured by vendors A and B respectively. Each vendor-specific switch ,  may require the use of vendor-specific command set(s) to control and configure zoning with that switch.","In contrast to this invention, in a conventional data storage network (not shown here), a vendor may provide a vendor specific network management application that includes an appropriate command set to control zoning within that vendor's switches. If a conventional data storage network were to use switches from multiple vendors, a systems manager would be required to operate multiple management applications (one for each different vendor) to manage zones in each switch since each different vendor switch requires the use of vendor specific zone control commands to manipulate zoning within that vendors' devices. In other words, conventional or prior art zoning control requires the use of vendor specific management applications equipped to exclusively operate with only the vendor specific commands associated with switches manufactured from that vendor and do not allow control of, for instance, zoning in many different switches from many different vendors.","Conversely, the multi-zone management application  configured with embodiments of this invention allows a systems manager, using this single multi-zone management application  (equipped with components on the invention), to control and configure zoning within the data storage network switches ,  in the data storage network , irrespective of which vendor produces or provides such switches. This is accomplished, as will be detailed below, since the multi-zone management application  has access to multi-zone command database .","Multi-zone command database  includes vendor specific command sets to control zoning within switches produced or provided from specific vendors. As will be explained further, the multi-zone management application  of this invention presents a single set of generic zone control commands to the systems manager via the management station .

When a user selects a generic zone control command , the multi-zoned management application user interface - receives the zone control command  (Step , ) for further processing.","As previously explained, zoning allows a systems manager to group various resources (e.g., devices coupled to switches) together to allow those resources to access each other through a switch while at the same time disallowing access to those resources from devices or other resources not included in the zone. Examples of typical zone control commands  include \u201cADD\u201d to add a resource (e.g., storage space, switch port, server) to a zone, \u201cREMOVE\u201d to remove a resource from a zone, \u201cDELETE\u201d to delete a zone entirely and \u201cCONFIGURE\u201d to otherwise configure a zone in a particular manner. Zone control commands, whether they be generic or specific to a device, typically include one or more parameters which specify, for instance, a resource associated with the zone (e.g., data storage system to be added, removed, or otherwise configured within the zone).","In step , the multi-zone management application user interface - receives and passes the generic zone control command  to the multi-vendor application programming interface -. In step , the multi-zone management application  loads the appropriate set of vendor specific commands (- or - in this example), as selected from a group of command sets from different vendors. Once the proper vendor specific command set  is loaded, in step , the management application  performs or processes (i.e., executes) the generic zone control command within the appropriate vendor's switch (either ,  in this example).","In one embodiment, to do so, the multi-vendor application programming interface - uses the device identifier  to identify a vendor of the switch(s) that is\/are affected by the generic zone control command . This may be done, for example, by a device identifier table (not shown) within the device identifier  that matches switch identities (i.e., network addresses) with vendor identities. An entry in such a device identifier table might indicate, for example, that the data storage network switch  () is manufactured by IBM Corporation. Another entry may indicate that the data storage network switch  () is manufactured by EMC Corporation. Based on the identification of a vendor in response to receipt of a zone control command , the multi-vendor application programming interface - then sends a load command set signal  to the multi-zone command database  in order to obtain the appropriate specific set of vendor specific device commands  that the multi-zone management application  can use to specifically control zoning within the switch(s) identified as being affected by the zone control command . In response to this command, the multi-zone command database  returns the vendor specific device command set  for the specified (i.e., identified) switch\/vendor and places\/loads the command set(s)  into the memory system . As noted above, the vendor specific device command sets  which are loaded into memory  in this manner may be dynamically linked libraries, for example, which the multi-vendor application programming interface - can dynamically link into to obtain access to the proper functions, routines, procedures and\/or the like in order to control zoning in a specific vendor device.","In a preferred operation of the invention, function calls to zoning control functions within the vendor specific command sets  are of the same name, syntax and\/or parameter formats as the generic zone control commands  to which those vendor specific functions correspond. In such cases, no special switch command mappings - are required since the generic zone control commands  are the same format as zoning commands  used by the switch vendors. This is illustrated in  by the arrow passing uninterrupted from the multi-vendor API - through the switch mappings - to the EMC vendor specific command set -. In other words, EMC specific commands to control zoning follow the same conventions, format and syntax as the generic zone control commands and thus no command mappings  are needed.","However, in some instances, there may be differences between the name, syntax, parameter placement and\/or parameter values of one or more generic zone control commands  and the zone control function (or functions)  within the vendor specific device command sets  that are executed to carry out the generic zone control commands within a specific vendor switch. In such cases, a command map  is required to map or translate the generic zone control command  to a format acceptable by the vendor specific command sets .","The system of the invention may include one or more command mappings  which describe how to map or pass generic zone control command (e.g., ) function names, parameters and\/or their associated values to one or more vendor device specific command (e.g., ) names, parameters and\/or parameters values as required for the vendor specific commands in the vendor specific device command set(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["330","360","365","1","365","1","365","1","365","2","330","365","2","360","365","1"]},"In this example command mapping , only three generic zone control commands (create-zone, add-to-zone and remove-zone) are shown. It is to be understood that a typical command mapping  can contain a mapping for each generic zone control command  provided by the user interface - to corresponding commands for one or more vendors (e.g., IBM and\/or EMC, etc). The generic CREATE_ZONE command includes a ZONE parameter, a SERVERS parameter and a DATA_STORAGE_RESOURCE parameter. This particular generic zone control command - is used to create a zone within a switch (e.g., within switch  or ) by including a server and some data storage in the zone. Note that the EMC zone control command for this same function and the other all appear identical to the generic zone control commands . As such EMC commands need no mapping. Thus, if a management application using this invention receives a generic zone control command  (e.g., CREATE_ZONE) and determines that the switch to which this command is directed is an EMC switch, the system can simply load the EMC dll containing the EMC functionality to control zoning in EMC switches and can forward the generic zone control command to the EMC command set -.","In the case of IBM zoning control commands however, the command mapping  serves to map or translate the generic zone control command  into the corresponding IBM zone control command -. In the case of the CREATE ZONE command, the generic parameter SERVERS is mapped to the IBM specific SERVER_ID parameter, and the generic parameter DATA_STORAGE_RESOURCE is mapped to the IBM specific parameter DATA_STORAGE_ID. Other generic zone control commands  are mapped to corresponding IBM zoning commands - in a similar manner. The command mapping  thus allows the system of the invention, during operation, to convert generic commands  into vendor specific commands  within the vendor specific command sets (IBM command set - for the IBM mapping - in this example) if needed. Note that the example illustration in  includes an IBM command mapping - (loaded into memory upon receipt of a generic zone control command directed to an IBM switch, for example) but no mapping for generic zone control commands  that are issued to the EMC specific command set - (i.e., to control an EMC switch) since the EMC commands -, as explained above, correspond exactly in format to the generic zone control commands .","If command mappings  are required, a software developer (i.e., either a vendor or the developer of the management application ) may create and install such command mappings  into the multi-zone command data database  before operation of the management application . Alternatively, the management application  may create the command mappings  in real-time using, for example, hard-coded knowledge or other logic indicating which parameters of a generic zone control command correspond  map to which parameters of a specific vendor specific device command .","Since the system of the invention provides the systems manager with a set of generic zone control commands , the systems manager need not install any vendor specific systems management applications that are conventionally used to control zoning in the vendor specific devices (switches in the case of zoning) installed into the data storage network . The systems manager only needs to obtain and install the dynamically linked library or other vendor specific command set  (e.g., a vendor supplied dll) into the multi-zone command database . Once the systems manager has installed the vendor commands sets - through -P into the command database , the multi-zone management application  of the present invention can access these functions as explained above to control devices (e.g., control zoning in switches) from many different vendors installed within a single data storage network. As such, the systems manager only needs to learn the multi-zone management application user interface - of the management application , instead of learning many user interfaces provided by different management applications according to each vendor. As new devices such as a new vendor switch are added to the network, as long as the vendor specific command set  for that switch is loaded into the database  (along with any mapping , if required), then the system of the invention can access and control zoning in that switch without modification to the management application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["404","410","404","410","354","352","350","300"]},"After receipt of a generic zone control command  (Step , ), the management application , in step  in , identifies any zone management devices (e.g., IBM switch ) within the zone that are (i.e., that will be) affected by the zoned control command . Next, in step  the management application  identifies vendors (e.g., IBM) of the zone management devices identified in step . Based on this identification, in step , the management application  selects an appropriate set or sets of vendor specific device commands (e.g., the IBM command set -) that can properly control zoning within the zone management device (IBM switch ) to which the generic zone control command is directed. In step , the management application  dynamically loads the set of vendor specific device commands (i.e., loads the IBM dll -, and mapping - if present in database ) into the multi-zone management application  (e.g., into memory ). Next, in step , the management application  selects one or more vendor specific device commands (e.g., CREATE_ZONE) in the set of loaded vendor specific device commands (e.g., -) that correspond to, and perform the zoning operations in the zone management device(s) (e.g., switch ) to which the generic zone control command  is directed, in accordance with the generic zone control command .","In the case of IBM zone control commands, in step , the management application  determines that the mapping - is present (i.e., was loaded in step ) and thus proceeds to step . In step , the management application consults the appropriate command mapping - to map the generic zone control command to a vendor specific command (i.e., to an IBM zone control command). As noted above, generally, in step , the management application  maps any parameters from the generic zone control command  to parameters in the vendor specific device commands  to provide the vendor specific device command  with any data required to properly perform zoning operations in the vendor specific device (e.g., within the switch).","If no mapping is required (e.g., in the case of EMC commands which are identical to generic zone control commands), no command map  is present in memory  and thus the management application  in step  can proceed directly to step .","In step , the management application  performs the vendor specific device command(s)  (using the parameters obtained in step  from the mapping, or obtained directly form the generic zone control command) to carry out the intended zoning operation within the vendor specific switch.","In this manner, the management application  is able to dynamically detect devices such as switches from different vendors within a data storage network (e.g., ) and is able to control zoning within each of those switches using a single consistent multi-zone management application user interface -. By determining the identity of vendors of switches to which generic zone control commands  are directed, the management application  of this invention can dynamically load the appropriate vendor specific command sets (e.g., -, -) and command maps  (if required) to control zoning within any vendor devices without requiring the systems manager to use a separate management application to perform zoning operations in each different vendor device. The invention thus also allows a network designer to incorporate hardware for many different vendors within a data storage network without having to worry about zoning control compatibility issues.","While the example explanations of preferred embodiments presented herein relate to controlling zoning within vendor devices in a data storage network, it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that the mechanisms and techniques of this invention are applicable for control of other types of vendor specific operations (e.g., discovery) within devices installed within a network. For example, the management application  might carry out operations such as device power up, device configuration, port control, discovery, or other such operations that require specific vendor libraries of vendor specific control commands by providing an interface of generic commands for such operations which are then mapped to the vendor specific commands within the vendor-specific libraries that perform the operations in a corresponding vendor specific device.","Those skilled in the art will understand that there can be many variations made to the operations of the user interface explained above while still achieving the same objectives of the invention.
