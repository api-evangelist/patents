{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to authenticating client applications for data access through operating systems.","Data or information security often involves controlling access to specific data by specific entities. Given a set of data, the data's owner may specify which entities are allowed access to the data, or how an entity requesting access to the data should be authenticated before granting it access to the data. There are various ways to control access to a specific set of data. For example, the data may be protected with an access code (e.g., a password or an access token). Only an entity who is able to supply the correct access code is grant access to the data. As another example, each time an entity requests access to the data, an explicit request may be sent to the data's owner, giving the owner the choice of granting or denying the entity access to the data.","A social-networking system, such as a social-networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. The social-networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interests. The social-networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social-networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social-networking system.","Social-networking systems may provide application programming interfaces that allow developers to configure applications that access information maintained by the social-networking system, such as profile information of a user, the identity of social network contacts of a user, a news feed of a user, and the like. Such applications may be web-based applications hosted by a server accessed by browser clients, or may be native applications locally installed on a client device (or a combination of the foregoing). Indeed, in some social-networking systems, a user may add so-called canvas applications to his or her user profile. Canvas applications may be third party applications that a user may access by clicking on a link or other control provided by a web page of the social-networking system. The canvas application may be hosted by a third party system and run in an iframe (or other section) of a web page provided by the social-networking system.","This disclosure generally relates to authenticating client applications for data access through operating systems. More specifically, an operating system acts as a proxy for individual client applications to request access to a set of data associated with or managed by a first party.","In particular embodiments, receiving, by an operating system of the first computing device and from a client application executing on the first computing device, a first request for accessing a set of data associated with a user of the first computing device, wherein the set of data is managed by a second computing device; sending, by the operating system of the first computing device on behalf of the client application and to the second computing device, a second request for accessing the set of data, wherein the second request comprises an application identifier indentifying the client application, a developer identifier indentifying a developer of the client application, and an access type for accessing the set of data; receiving, by the operating system of the first computing device and from the second computing device, a response to the second request; and if the response to the second request grants the client application access to the set of data, then forwarding, by the operating system of the first computing device and to the client application, an access token to be used by the client application for accessing the set of data with the second computing device, wherein the access token is received by the operating system of the first computing device and from the second computing device.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","This disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. However, this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure this disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","Sometimes, an application developed by one party may wish to access data or information associated with, owned, and\/or controlled by another party. For clarification purposes, hereafter, with respect to a specific set of data, the party that is directly associated with the data (such as a user is associated with user profile data of that user) is referred to as the \u201cfirst party\u201d, and a party that wishes to access the data associated with the first party is referred to as a \u201cthird party\u201d. In particular embodiments, when an application developed by a third party wishes to access data associated with or managed by a first party, instead of the third party requesting data access directly from the first party, an operating system may act as a proxy for the third party and request data access from the first party on behalf of the third party.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},"In particular embodiments, a user device , such as a desktop computer or a mobile device (e.g., notebook computer, netbook computer, mobile telephone, a gaming console, etc.), may have an operating system  and a number of client applications . For example, user device  may be an iPhone\u00ae provided by Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. Client applications  may be installed on and execute on user device . In particular embodiments, user device  may have a storage medium (e.g., memory or hard drive), and a section of the storage medium is secure and tamper-proof and may be used to store secure information (e.g., digital certificates  or access tokens ).","In particular embodiments, there is a first party  that is responsible for managing data  stored on remote hosts (e.g., on servers or in databases) associated with first party . In particular embodiments, first party  may be a social-networking system, and a user of user device  may be a member of social-networking system .","Data  may be data of the user maintained by social-networking system , such as the user's profile, social connections and contacts, calendar entries, interests and hobbies, news feeds generated for the user, images uploaded to social-networking system  by the user, messages or posts sent by or sent to the user, and so on. User data  may be stored on remote hosts associated with social-networking system . Social-networking system  may manage the user's data  for the user.","In particular embodiments, social-networking system  may provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable software applications (e.g., applications developed by third-party developers) to access some or all of the user's data either stored on user device  or on remote hosts (e.g., data ). For example, client applications  may access some of the user's data (e.g., profile information, social connections, images, etc.) using the APIs provided by social-networking system . At the same time, social-networking system  may take necessary steps to ensure that only authorized client applications  are able to access user data  (e.g., to protect user privacy). For example, when a client application  wishes to access some specific user data, the client application  needs to be authenticated first before access is granted.","In particular embodiments, operating system  of user device  proxies authentication sessions between client applications  and first-party data manager  (e.g., the social-networking system). In particular embodiments, when a client application  wishes to access user data  stored on remote hosts, instead of requesting an access token directly from first-party data manager , the client application  may send a request to operating system , as illustrated in STEP . For example, the client application  may make an API call to operating system  to open a session with first-party data manger  (e.g., the social-networking system), such as \u201cgetSession (app_id, permissions)\u201d, where \u201cpermissions\u201d are the types of access permissions the client application  desires. For example, access permissions may include read permissions (e.g., read user's profile information, messages sent to the user, etc.) or write permissions (e.g., upload photographs, post to walls, send emails, update status, check-in at events or locations, etc.). In particular embodiments, the request may include an application identifier (app_id) of the requesting client application . Optionally, the request may also include information describing which specific portion of secure data  the requesting client application  wishes to access (e.g., the requesting client application  may not need to access all of data  stored on remote hosts).","In particular embodiments, there may be any number of digital certificates  stored on user device . These digital certificates  may be configured by the device manufacturer for individual users of user device , and may be stored in a secure, tamper-proof section of the storage medium of user device . For example, each authorized user of user device  may have his\/her own digital certificate . When a specific user is running a client application  on user device , if the client application  wishes to access the specific user's data, the user's digital certificate  may be used in connection with the authentication process (e.g., used to establish a secure connection between user device  and first party ).","In particular embodiments, the request may be implemented as a function call (e.g., using Objective-C or C). The function may take the application identifier as an input argument (e.g., function_name (app_id, permissions)). When a client application  wishes to access data , it may invoke this function and pass its own application identifier as the input value to \u201capp_id\u201d and specify the type of access (e.g., read or write) required as the input value to \u201cpermissions\u201d.","In particular embodiments, operating system  may determine a developer identifier (DEV ID, also referred to as \u201cbundle ID\u201d) based on the application identifier of the requesting client application , as illustrated in STEP . The developer identifier indicates the developer (e.g., a software company) of the requesting client application . When each client application  is first installed on user device , operating system  may determine its application identifier and developer identifier and maintain a record of the information (e.g., as a lookup table). Subsequently, operating system  may use this record to lookup the developer identifier based on an application identifier.","In particular embodiments, operating system  may send a request to first-party data manager  on behalf of the requesting client application , as illustrated in STEP . The request, such as proxy.Authorize (app_id, developer_id, permissions), may include both the developer identifier (e.g., \u201cABCD1234\u201d) and the application identifier of the requesting client application . The request may also contain a user identifier (or any other suitable account identifier) that the remote host may associate to a set of data (such as user account data). Optionally, the request may also include information describing which specific portion (permissions) of user data  client application  wishes to access (e.g., the information from the initial request received from client application ). In particular embodiments, operating system  may establish a secure network connection (e.g., SSL connection) with first-party data manager , and send the request over this secure connection. The SSL connection may be established using a digital certificate  stored in the secure section of the storage medium of user device . For example, the SSL implementation on first-party data manger  may be configured with an SSLVerifyClient mandate that requires a client to present a valid digital certificate. By limiting SSL connections to valid digital certificates, some confidence in the identity of the device and\/or user is obtained. This is especially true if the digital certificate is stored in a tamper-resistant storage of the user device and possibly installed by the device manufacture.","In particular embodiments, first-party data manager , upon receiving the request (and assuming the validation of the user device level digital certificate and establishment of an SSL connection), may authenticate the requesting client application  based on its application identifier and developer identifier, as illustrated in STEP . For example, first-party data manager  may maintain a record of all client applications that have access to the user data  associated with the user identifier corresponding to the request (and\/or the client-side digital certificate associated with the SSL connection). If the requesting client application  is one of them (e.g., based on its application identifier and developer identifier), then access to user data  is granted. Otherwise, access to user data  is denied.","Note that the combination of developer identifier and application identifier uniquely identifies each client application . However, there are other means to uniquely identify a set of client applications. For example, a globally unique identifier may be assigned to each client application .","If the requesting client application  is allowed access to user data , first-party data manager  may send an access token to operating system , as illustrated in STEP . In one implementation, the access token may comprise a session key and a session secret, which may be a hashed value for a specific session. Operating system  may then forward the access token to the requesting client application  so that the requesting client application  can use the access token to access data associated with the user on remote host . In particular embodiments, the access token may have an expiration time. For example, a client application , once obtained an access token, may use the access token to access user data  for the current session or for a specific time period (e.g., 24 hours), until the access token expires. Thereafter, the client application  needs to request another access token in order to access user data .","In particular embodiments, upon receiving a valid access token  from first party , operating system  or the requesting client application  may store the access token  on user device  (e.g., in the secure section of the storage medium of user device ). While the access token  has not yet expired, the requesting client application  can use the same access token  to access user data  repeatedly. At the same time, operating system  may ensure that only the requesting client application  can use this specific access token , which has been obtained for the requesting client application , and that other client applications  installed on user device  cannot use this specific access token .","On the other hand, if the requesting client application  is denied access to user data , first-party data manager  does not send any access token to operating system . Instead, first-party data manager  may respond with a predefined signal so that operating system  can notify the requesting client application  that its request to access user data  has been denied.","In particular embodiments, user device  may be associated with a user who is a member of a social-networking website. A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige. In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. Such social-networking websites enable their members, who are commonly referred to as website users, to perform various social activities. For example, the social-networking website operated by Facebook, Inc. at www.facebook.com enables its users to communicate with their friends via emails, instant messages, or blog postings, organize social events, share photos, receive news of their friends or interesting events, play games, etc.","Data  may include the user's information with the social-networking website (e.g., profile, background information, social connections, photographs uploaded to the social-networking website by the user, messages and posts, social calendar and events, check-ins, status updates, notifications, news feeds, etc.). In this case, the social-networking website may be first-party data manager , which controls access to the user's social and other information by client applications . In some cases, the user may specify to the social-networking website which client applications  can have access to which of the user's information (e.g., using setup options provided through the user's account), such as when the user is aware of or has used a specific client application  and thus knows what information the specific client application  needs. In other cases, a client application  may go through the operating system in order to request access permissions from the user. The operating system may display a request for information from the user on behalf of a specific client application , and if the user grants information access to that client application , the operating system may send the user's authorization to the social-networking website. Then, each time when a client application  wishes to access the user's information (e.g., data ), instead of contacting and troubling the user, operating system  may send a request to the social-networking system hosting the social-networking website (i.e., first-party data manager ). The social-networking system may authenticate the client application  according to the specification previously made by the user regarding access to the user's information. In one implementation, a user may specific access permissions (e.g., read or write) for a client application and store the permissions in the user's account with the social-networking websites (e.g., as a part of the configuration settings). Subsequently, the social-networking websites (i.e., the first-party data manager) may determine whether a specific client application has access to the user's data stored with the social-networking websites, and if so, which access permissions the client application has based on the configuration settings stored in the user's account. Of course, the user can modify these settings at any time.","Implementations of the invention can be configured to allow a user to log in to the remote host  once using user device  (such as a smart phone) and, relative to the particular user device , remain logged in until the user explicitly chooses to log out. For example, a user may access remote host  using a client application installed on user device  and explicitly log-in to a user account maintained by the remote host . Once logged into the remote host , the client applications  installed on the user device  may have instant access to the data associated with the user maintained by or available through remote host  without requiring the user to explicitly log in to an account or otherwise provide a user name and password. For example, when processing a proxy authorization request that identifies a particular user, the remote host  may access account information of the user to determine whether that user remains logged in on the particular user device . For example, login status information can be associated with the client-side digital certificate of the user device. The remote host  may access this information to determine whether the user remains logged in relative to that user device  as part of authenticating the proxy authorization request.","In addition, the user may configure which client applications  may access his or her data by adding or removing client applications from his or her account. In some implementations, this list of applications may correspond to mobile and web versions of a given application. For example, assume that a user accesses remote host  using a desktop PC and \u201cinstalls\u201d a particular web-based, canvas application, and later installs a mobile version of the same application on user device . Data access for the mobile version of the application may be allowed based on the user's installation of the canvas application.","Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.  illustrates an example computer system .
