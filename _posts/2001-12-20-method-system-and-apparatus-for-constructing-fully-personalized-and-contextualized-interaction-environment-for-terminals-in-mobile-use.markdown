{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A method, system and apparatus for creating user-interfaces, and more particularly a method, system and apparatus for creating personalized and contextualized interaction environment for terminals in mobile use.","User Interfaces (UIs) are generally organized in terms of hierarchical file systems. This stands in contrast to the way a user thinks, which is generally in terms of an association network of ideas in the form of graphs. However, the easiest way to organize an association network is using a data structure, which can be complicated to understand for lay users. Association networks are referred to as maps hereinafter.","In older Personal Computer (PC) systems and UIs, information has been organized along the structure of the file system of a computer. Mobile phone UIs, in contrast, have been organized task-wise, but they are neither customizable nor map-structured. These older application programs are designed just for organizing and navigating information. However, as can easily be recognized, in today's computing environment there is a great need for application programs that provide a richer system of functionality that allows users to utilize them for a wide variety of functions. The additional functions of creation, innovation, understanding, learning, communication and commerce of information have had to be accessed by means of disparate devices and application programs with various types of UIs. These functions are disparate with respect to each other on a conceptual as well as on the implementation level. Users have been forced to move from one device and\/or application program to another, possibly converting information from one format to another, and\/or synchronizing data between devices and to switch from one mindset to another, in performing these functions.","Further, older systems have UIs that typically organize information in terms of a hierarchical file system. The items can be pictures, videos, links to web pages, text notes, files, and\/or the like. Unfortunately, such hierarchical file systems fail to relate items of information in a user-friendly manner such that a user might be able to access one piece of information from another related piece of information, when the two pieces of information are organized as different items.","Existing systems restrict customization of the UIs as well. Customization of a UI has been confined to the possibility, in some applications, of adding items to menus whose structure has otherwise been decided in advance and designed by a UI designer. For example, the WINDOWS desktop can be customized to some extent, but its menus have structures that are largely pre-programmed by the developers. Moreover, items on such systems cannot be interlinked. Such problems become even more acute when we deal with mobile systems, such as cellular phones.","Another disadvantage of existing systems is that they are device-dependent. Thus, there is a need for a method, system and apparatus for creating user interfaces for terminals in mobile use that are compatible with all sorts of terminals.","Further, there is a need for a mechanism that allows individual users to customize their own terminals in accordance with their own preferences and needs.","The method, system and apparatus for creating fully-personalized and contextualized user interfaces for terminals in mobile use disclosed herein overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages.","The method, system and apparatus provides seamless interaction across various contexts by using a content abstraction layer in coordination with an information layer. The content abstraction layer contains links to content, services and devices in the existing underlying information layer, consisting of web, mobile and stationary domains. The content abstraction layer is a knowledge layer, because it links information in the form of content, applications services and devices to their appropriate contexts, and knowledge can be defined as information associated to the mental contexts of a person. Thus the CIE allows the user to create a fully personalised map of his everyday life contexts, and to link all the information he needs to manage his everyday life to the nodes (i.e. contexts) of that map. Such a map may be thought of as a context map, and likened to roadmaps in a sense: in the same way as a road map helps a person to find his way geographically, a context map helps the user to find his way in his everyday life contexts. This mechanism is a novel way of modeling everyday life contexts and their relationships that allows seamless moving between daily roles, tasks, processes, and the like. The present context map has a network structure, which proves very useful in finding one's way geographically. The present invention offers alternative views to the underlying network structure, such as the tree and outline views. The user can choose the view to the underlying network structure of the map that he finds most intuitive and easy to use.","The disclosed method, system and apparatus for enabling users to create customized user interfaces allows a user to create user interfaces on the fly. The user interface is logically structured as a node map, wherein nodes may be added to the node map in accordance with the user's needs. The nodes may be connected there-between to define relationships between the different nodes. The nodes may have an attachment, an action, an application and\/or the like associated therewith. The user may perform a variety of other functions to customize, alter or expand the information depicted on their user interface.","These aspects and other objects, features, and advantages of the method, system and apparatus for establishing, monitoring and managing connectivity for communication among heterogeneous systems are described in the following Detailed Description, which is to be read in conjunction with the accompanying Figures and the claims.","With reference to the following detailed description, the aforementioned Figures will be described in greater detail below.","Described herein is a method, system and apparatus for creating fully personalized and contextualized interaction environment (hereinafter referred to as CIE) for terminals in mobile use. The disclosed method, system and apparatus for enabling users to create customized user interfaces allows a user to create user interfaces on the fly. The user interface is logically structured as a node map, wherein nodes may be added to the node map in accordance with the user's needs. The nodes may be connected there-between to define relationships between the different nodes. The nodes may have an attachment, an action, an application and\/or the like associated therewith. The user may perform a variety of other functions to customize, alter or expand the information depicted on their user interface. The key feature of the present invention lies in the disclosed meta-level character, which is a dynamic and user-friendly application for constructing UIs and allows users to fully customize their terminals in accordance with their own preferences.","The CIE is context-sensitive in that the user may organize content, devices, applications and services into particular context in the UI of their personal CIE-supported devices. Because each node in a node map represents a context, the possible link to content, devices, applications and services that the node contains implements the \u201ccontent, devices, applications and services in context\u201d idea of the present invention. By means of profiles specific to a node, the user may also specify the visibility, emphasis in appearance, and other attributes of applications, devices, services and content in a novel, user-defined notion of context-sensitivity.","One way of implementing maps is by means of JAVA (or another object-oriented language) class hierarchies. Each node in a map may be implemented by means of a JAVA class, so that the class interface represents the node's context. A context is a collection of variables, and may be defined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"4.40mm","wi":"48.34mm","file":"US07058895-20060606-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The inheritance from a node to its child node, described below, may be implemented as inheritance from a class to its subclass in JAVA. Because a map may now be implemented by means of a JAVA class hierarchy, the map must be resolvable into a tree. This is because a JAVA class hierarchy always has tree form. This requirement can always be achieved by our method of resolving a map in graph form into tree form. When a map has been resolved into a tree, a node may have several occurrences and hence several parent nodes. Combining this with inheritance implies that a map may use multiple instances of inheritance rather than just single inheritance. JAVA does not support multiple inheritance directly, but the same effect for our purposes can be achieved in well-known ways by using class interfaces.","It should be noted that a map template is the same thing as a context space, because maps may contain profiles but map templates do not. An example of a context space (i.e. map without node profiles), consisting of three contexts, is a map consisting of three nodes: Vehicle, Motorbike and Boat, defined so that Motorbike and Boat are children of Vehicle, as shown below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"27.77mm","wi":"32.94mm","file":"US07058895-20060606-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Here, Vehicle has the attributes Name of type String, and Age of type Integer. To describe these attributes, we use the following technical notation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"4.83mm","wi":"56.73mm","file":"US07058895-20060606-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Furthermore, Boat inherits the attributes of Vehicle, and in addition has the attribute Model of type String, i.e. technically:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"5.25mm","wi":"63.58mm","file":"US07058895-20060606-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Profiles define values of node attributes, and so in the above example map the following profiles exist:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"15.07mm","wi":"70.87mm","file":"US07058895-20060606-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Moreover, the user may give or sell his map and\/or the map template (i.e. context space) that consists of the map without the node profiles, to other users. Then, another user might, for example, define the attributes of Boat so that they represent the respective attribute values of his own boat. This might result in the following profile:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"5.33mm","wi":"64.43mm","file":"US07058895-20060606-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Abstracting from this particular example, a context is a sequence of typed variables, such as (x: A, . . . , x: A). Here, x: Ameans that variable xis of type A. A profile is a sequence of definitions of values of variables, such as (x=a, . . . , x=a). When a user gives or sells his map to others, the recipients are not able to modify the node profiles. This is appropriate when the others want to use the map as a link collection to existing content, applications, devices and services. On the other hand, if the others want to use the map to organize their own content, it is appropriate to give or sell to them a map template. Namely, a map template is a map whose profiles are stripped away. The others may then define the profiles according to their own needs of organizing their own content.","CIE inheritance in maps complies with the JAVA notion of inheritance also in selectivity. The user that constructs the map may select which attributes a child node inherits from its parent node, and the child node need not inherit all attributes from the parent.","It should be noted that hereinafter the word \u201cterminal\u201d is used to indicate a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a laptop computer, a hand-held computer, a desktop PC, a digiTV, and\/or any similar computing device. It should be noted that only some types of terminals may be carried along by mobile users. The user can access his personal virtual workspace device-independently, i.e. by using any CIE-enabled computing device that happens to be near him, wherever he happens to be.","According to the invention, users are able to organize their information\/UIs using maps, which relate different types and items of information. The system and method for construction of UIs is access-, content- and device-independent, and actions may be made a function category of the UIs. Examples of the various devices that may be used include:\n\n","Examples of the various types of access that may be used include:\n\n","Examples of the various types of content that may be supported include:\n\n","In addition, the system and method for construction of UIs may be person-dependent, so that the system is fully customizable and includes user created content. The system and method may also be time dependent so that a different device may be in use at different times and access to the system may be obtained from all devices, and user defined profiles may be used to allow time enabled services, which are explained in more detail below. The system and method may be location dependent as well, to allow different services at different locations, with location identification based on user (such as user definable locations). The system and method may further be device-dependent to allow location identification using technologies such as GPS, GPRS and\/or the like.","Two or more users can collaborate simultaneously with each other in performing these functions by terminals, using Bluetooth, WLAN, Internet, GSM, GPRS, UMTS connections and\/or the like. The connection type depends on terminal. For example, a Personal Computer (PC) may use a fixed Internet connection, whereas a mobile phone may use a GPRS connection in a collaboration situation. The system may optionally be implemented in a peer-to-peer system that enables convergence of communication, information management and learning in interfacing them uniformly to the user, as will be explained in more detail below. Because the exact design of the system does not restrict the use of the disclosed invention, it is believed that the scope of the present invention is not limited by the system design.","The invention provides seamless interaction across various contexts, which is achieved by introducing a new content abstraction layer. The new layer contains links to content, services, applications and devices in the existing underlying layer, consisting of web, mobile and stationary domains. In short, the new layer is a knowledge layer, because it links content, services, applications and devices to their appropriate contexts, whereas the existing layer is an information layer.","As will be described in more detail below, the present invention enables a user to interface various types of terminals in mobile use. The user can access the same information regardless of where and when he needs it and\/or the terminal being used. According to one embodiment, it is possible to restrict access to select information, based on some criterion. For example, an employer may restrict access to certain confidential files to the physical premises of the employer. As will be clearer from the discussion below, information is more intuitively organized than in present systems.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, if the user wants to perform an action that he has customized into his UI, he first moves the symbol to the center of the display by pointing at the symbol, and then double-clicking thereon to perform the action.","The terminal is conceptualized as a tool for uniform organization, navigation, creation, innovation, understanding, learning, communication and commerce of information. In other words, the present invention acts as a management tool for information on a computing device. The convergence of communication, information management and learning is supported is by a method for interfacing them uniformly to the user. Further, the user has complete freedom to customize the way he interfaces to a terminal.","In accordance with the present invention, the system for constructing UI's may be run at home, at school or work, on terminals and\/or the like. At home, the system may be run on terminals connected to a master device, or on the master device itself, as will be described below via Bluetooth, WLAN technology and\/or the like. At school or work, the system may be run on terminals connected to the master device via Internet connections provided by X Service Providers (xSPs). It should be noted that the master device may also be a service purchased from a service provider. On cellular terminals, the system may be run anywhere via wireless connections provided by cellular network operators, such as GSM, GPRS, UMTS operators.","The above-mentioned master device may be any computing device that stores data, and communicates with the external world via Internet. The master device communicates via Bluetooth, WLAN or LAN connections with terminals and\/or any other devices, such as coffee makers, refrigerators and\/or the like. One may also purchase a master device service from a service provider, if one does not want to have one of one's own.","The system for creating UIs may run on top of the JAVA programming language, and more particularly on a JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE, which runs on an operating system such as LINUX. However, any Operating System may be used, as long as they support JAVA. The user may interact with a terminal by means of some kind of a pointing device, which may be dependent on the terminal type. The pointing device can be a touch screen pen, a mouse, arrow keys on a keyboard and\/or the like. Terminals may also have a text-inputting device, such as a keyboard, a virtual keyboard on a display device, or a touch screen together with a pen and handwriting recognition functionality.","According to one embodiment, the disclosed system architecture is a peer-to-peer system, which will be described below.","As is described in greater detail below, the user's content is organized around maps, and resides in a map database in the user's master device. When a user inspects or updates his maps, a copy thereof is also transferred temporarily from his master device to the terminal he is using, and the modifications are transferred back to his master device. This updating can be done either manually by the user, or set to take place automatically on a user-determined periodic basis.","With reference to the Figures, various embodiments of the method, system and apparatus for creating UIs to fully customize their terminals in accordance with the users' own preferences will now be described in greater detail. It is to be understood that the tasks shown in the Figures and described in this Detailed Description can be sequenced in many different orders to achieve the desired result. The order or sequence of tasks illustrated in the Figures is merely intended to be exemplary of the concepts defined herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A\u20131B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","110","110","110","100","140","100","120","140","140","110","140"]},"The CIE provider  may contain, for example a backup service, which is important because the user's content may be distributed across various devices. It would be very cumbersome to manually backup all of these devices separately manually.","The CIE master device  contains each individual user's maps as submaps, and may control the user's household appliances like refrigerators and washing machines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["140","120","130","140","150","120","130","140"]},"In accordance with the present invention, the CIE software is installed on personal devices  that are JAVA-enabled.

The term node is used hereinafter to refer to individuals  and categories , and the word edge is used to refer to relationships  in the map , when discussing the visual representation of the map , and when discussing the map on the data structure level (as opposed to the conceptual level).","Individuals  and categories  may be further subdivided into notes, actions, applications, attachments, outlined entries, and\/or the like. A note node may contain a link to another map.","Each terminal has its own API that may support an application. For example, a call application may be supported by mobile phone APIs but not by DigiTV APIs. A terminal may also support actions that are defined in terms of applications derivatively. For example, the action of calling home may be supported by mobile phones but not DigiTVs. In other words, according to one embodiment, terminals primarily support applications, as well as derivatively actions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","500","500","500"]},"Each node may have a profile . The purpose of the profile  varies depending on the node-type. In accordance with one embodiment, in the hierarchical structure , a node  can inherit the profile of its parent node . The profile  consists of attributes and values. The collection of attributes is called a context. In the CIE, each node is a context, whose name is the name of the node . Moreover, each node  may have a profile  that specifies the values of the attributes of the context. Content (i.e. data) may be represented and transferred in XML format.","According to one embodiment, the node description form has a button called \u201cProfile\u201d. If the user clicks this button with a pointing device while filling in the form, a new window opens for defining the profile  of the node. There the user may define which attributes the profile  contains, and which values the attributes have. Therefore profile definition also derivatively defines the context that the node represents.","A map is a network of contexts, possibly with profiles. A map can also be called a context space. A map without any profiles is called a map template. Nodes  may inherit attributes with or without their values from their parent nodes.","As illustrated in , a node can be of various types, such as an Attachment node , a Note node , an Action node  or an Application node . An Attachment node  has an attachment locator linked to it. A Note node  is a single node with a name. An Action node  is a node with built-in capacity of creating nodes, removing nodes and running node applications (as a macro). An Application node  is a node with a built-in application functionality. Alternately, an application node  may be a link to any application, such as a mail program or a schedule tool. Double-clicking a previously defined application node  by a pointing device starts the application. When an attachment that has been created previously is opened for viewing or editing, the application by means of which it was created is launched to do this.","An attachment node  may be for any file, such as for a picture file, video file, sound file and\/or the like. A note node  may contain a link to another map.","One of the attributes of an application node  or action node  may be \u201cActivate\u201d. Its value in the node's profile is a place associated with the user, such as \u201cAt Home\u201d or \u201cAt Work\u201d. These places are specified by the user. When the user is using CIE at a place that is a value of the \u201cActivate\u201d attribute of a node profile, the node is displayed as Active. Otherwise the node is displayed as Passive, which means that the node cannot be run. For example, a user may have one messaging application instance that is Active at home, and another that is Passive at home. This use of the \u201cActivate\u201d attribute applies also to attachment nodes. It can be used to restrict the possibility of opening an attachment file to specific locations.","Referring momentarily to , these figures shed light on the issues of sensored information in relation to CIE, authentication, and device-independence. The location of a user may be communicated to the computing device (with CIE-enablement) to manage his personal (virtual) workspace, by means of a mobile phone (or similar device) via Bluetooth and\/or the like. A mobile phone may thus communicate location, temperature and other kinds of sensored information, as well as the location (address) of the user's master device, to the user's virtual workspace. The user may also authenticate himself to any CIE-enabled device by means of a mobile phone (or similar device). The Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) of a mobile phone (or other similar means) store his identity information, and the identity information is transmitted to the CIE-enabled device via Bluetooth. This authentication submits the CIE-enabled device to his disposal, so that it shows his personal (virtual) workspace until he ends the session. Thus, the user may access his personal (virtual) workspace from any CIE-enabled device anywhere (e.g. at home, at school, at work, in public places of the society etc.) just by authenticating himself by means of a mobile phone (or similar device). The CIE thus replaces the various disparate UIs of the CIE-enabled devices so that the user has a uniform way to manage his personal information in a device-independent way at any time and place.","Returning back to , according to another embodiment, an application node  or action node  may be Active or Passive if the application or action requires a specific API. For example, the phone application or \u201cCall home\u201d action is Active if the device in use has the JavaPhone API, otherwise it is Passive.","According to one of the embodiments, one or more nodes may be invisible in the UI. In other words, the user may specify that an application node, and possibly also its child nodes (i.e. subnodes) be invisible, whereas the subnode copies are visible. The motivation is that the subnode copies are associated to their proper contexts and the user wants to see his content only in context, but keep the totality of the subnodes specific to a given application (the subnodes of the application node) hidden.","It is also possible to switch between the two alternatives of showing and hiding such hidden application nodes and their subnodes. To allow this, the user interface contains (in addition to the symbols for constructing a new node and deleting a node etc) a new symbol to allow for switching between these two views, which is useful, for instance, in the case of the messaging application, if the user wants to inspect his messages either in their respective contexts, or in their totality as subnodes of the Messaging application. In addition to the Messaging application, the schedule\/calendar, search and contacts applications function in a similar manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["620","620","620","620","530","620","530","530"]},"A Note node  may, for instance, have the attribute \u201cColor\u201d with value \u201cBlue\u201d.

The CIE application may be CIE-specific or device-specific. The CIE application can have several context sensitive node instances.

If the user decides to buy a pasta machine in the example, the user selects the item \u201cVendors\u201d on the terminal. Three vendors are displayed in map form (, K), using an association-search across the network. The user may decide to purchase \u201cPasta De Luxe\u201d by selecting that item, as shown in .

The resulting map  could then be shared for free with other users or made an object of commerce that is co-owned by the two users. The \u201cMapper\u201d supports such collaboration by allowing the map  of the user to be displayed simultaneously with the map  of another user, which is achieved by splitting the display area in two by a line. A modification of such collaboration may be that the foreign map on a display is common to a group of users. In such group collaboration, each user sees his own map simultaneously with the common map, with the display split in two by a line.","In another embodiment, in the group collaboration, the user's own map may be placed at the corner of the display device , in a window which may be opened and closed according to the user's needs.

The attribute can also be set to Custom, which means that the user may enumerate a list of users that may access that node and others may not.","Learning by means of UIs constructed by the \u201cMapper\u201d offers many benefits to the user. Navigating maps that have been constructed according to associations of concepts is an efficient method of learning, as is also creating maps to represent, understand, summarize or organize information alone or in co-operation with others.","In addition to these general functionalities offered by the \u201cMapper\u201d, learning by the present invention may be accomplished in many ways, as illustrated by the following examples. In one embodiment, the combination of navigation, learning and understanding takes place. Here, learning may occur by a quiz game. Given a map , one must connect one of the alternative surrounding nodes to the main node by an edge. That relationship represents the user's answer to the quiz. If the answer is correct, the user is provided further information.","In another embodiment, the same cross-functionality of the UI provides a game for small children to teach Finnish language.

The user may select a node pair and submit a search request across the network for node pairs of the same name that are associated. A search may also be carried out for a single node, a relationship, or any number of their attributes.","The user may also specify an automatic search agent operating continuously as a background process that pushes search results that match his query in real time as they are created by other users anywhere in the network. The apparatus of this invention thus contains a search engine and a push mechanism.","The search for associations allows the user to search for other users' maps with the same association, and allows the possibility of associating ideas using the map-based UI.

The context may contain attributes such as time, location, and role (e.g. work, private, study). One may even relate a map to the user's mood, by using, in one example, a dark background in the event of a bad mood or a light one in the event of good mood.","As just noted, the user may choose to relate the emphasis of nodes in a map to temporal cycles, such as time in a day, week, month, or year, and use this rhythm to contextually customize his UI. Thus, for example, information regarding family and hobbies might be deemed as more important in the evening, while work- or study-related information would have more significance during the day time. Family- and hobby-related nodes are then displayed with emphasis on a map in the evening, and work- and study-related nodes in the daytime. Similar customization can be done with respect to season or time of year. For instance, skiing-related information may be more relevant in the winter and swimming-related matters in the summer. Such customizations are implemented by positioning nodes on an ellipse that the UI automatically rotates as time passes, or by emphasis by means of, for example, color or size.","Customization relative to location may be done by making use of Global Positioning System (GPS), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or Bluetooth. Work-related nodes (including application programs) may be displayed with emphasis in a map when the user is at his office, and family-related matters at home.","The user can manually select a role, such as work, study, or private, that is irrespective of time and location, because the role may not always be automatically determined from time and location, and roles may intermingle.","To help the user in selecting the information he wants to inspect at a particular moment, distinct visual symbols and sounds may be associated with classes of pushed information. Thus, arriving electronic mails might have a different symbol or animation or sound than arriving map requests. Additionally, electronic mails from family members can be further associated with different attributes than electronic mails from colleagues at work.","The CIE associates arriving electronic mails, other pushed information and requested services to their proper context.

The center of the circle shows the year, and the concentric rings from center show the month, day, and time respectively. There are two rings for time. The innermost shows the hours from midnight to noon, and the outermost from noon to midnight. The month ring is divided into twelve equal numbered compartments, one for each month. Similarly, the day ring is divided into 28 to 31 equal numbered compartments, depending on the month. And similarly, the two time rings are divided into twelve equal numbered compartments each, the innermost one from 00:00 to 12:00, and the outermost one from 12:00 to 24:00.","Colors may be used to illustrate times. For example, red color may indicate a busy time, and green color may indicate free time. The user may conveniently check his free and busy time for a given occasion by first selecting a month and then a day by a pointing device. The year, by default, may be the present year, but could be changed. The changing may take place by first selecting the center area of the circle by a pointing device, then entering a New Year into a resulting input field, preferably in the center area of the circle itself, then selecting a month, and finally selecting a day.","In the illustrated example, the user enters the time 13:00\u201314:00, 10.4.2004 for the review by selecting that area in the calendar with a pointing device, and as a result the \u201cMapper\u201d encircles that area in the calendar and displays the selected time beside the calendar.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0211","num":"0220"},"figref":"FIG. 26Z","b":["26","26"]},"The user selects the \u201cSchedule\u201d node by a pointing device on FIG. AA. The \u201cMapper\u201d then displays his calendar for that day, as shown in FIG. AB. The user then selects the time zone between 13:00 and 14:00 by means of a pointing device, as shown in FIG. AC. The \u201cMapper\u201d then moves the node where that time entry was made to the display, as shown in FIG. AD. This reminds the user that the time entry in his calendar was associated to the child node \u201cMeetings\u201d of the \u201cMapper Project\u201d, and that its location is \u201cIt\u00e4lahdenkatu 22\u201d. This is another illustration of how the \u201cMapper\u201d allows the user to customize his UI so that it directly reflects associations in his thinking. In addition, contact and calendar information items may be interrelated contextually by the same method using \u201cMapper\u201d.","The user may also select the location node of the meeting, depicted in FIG. AE. Now the \u201cMapper\u201d tells him the distance between his present location and the meeting location, the current speed at which the user is moving, the time after which he has to leave from the present location to the meeting location to get there on time\u2014both in the case of taking public transport or driving by his own car or taking a taxi. Further, in the case of public transport, the \u201cMapper\u201d instructs which bus number or subway to take. All these functionalities are possible when a terminal has a GPS system for determining the location of the terminal, or it is identified by means of WLAN or Bluetooth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0214","num":"0223"},"figref":"FIGS. 27A\u201327D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0215","num":"0224"},"figref":"FIG. 27A","b":["2705","2710","2715"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0216","num":"0225"},"figref":"FIG. 27B","b":["2720","2725","2730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0217","num":"0226"},"figref":"FIG. 27C","b":["2735","2740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0218","num":"0227"},"figref":"FIG. 27D","b":["2745","2750","2755"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0219","num":"0228"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["2800","2810","2820","2830","2840","2850","2840","2850"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0220","num":"0229"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["2900","2905","2910"]},"Once the month's value has been entered, in step , the system redisplays the day ring  that contains the number of days in accordance with the value of the month as well as the year.","Next, in step , the user may select the appropriate day for the calendar. Upon selection, the selected day becomes colored. In step , the two time rings ,  are redisplayed, with available\/busy time of hours being dependent on the day. The busy hours may optionally be shown in red color, while the available hours may be shown in green color.","In step , if the system determines that the user did not click the center of the calendar, then the calendar retains the current year in step . From step , the flow proceeds to step  and continues as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0224","num":"0233"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},"A cycle, and hence a graph that needs to be resolved into a tree, can only be created by giving a new node a name that already occurs in the map. In this circumstance, the \u201cMapper\u201d asks the user whether the same thing is denoted by both occurrences of the name. If the user answers positively, the two nodes are identified internally so that a change to one of the nodes is propagated to the other occurrence on the display. The first created occurrence is displayed normally. Providing another circle around the displayed node, which indicates that there exists another identical node in the map, identifies the second occurrence. If any of the two nodes is thereafter updated, the changes are also displayed at the other occurrence. Thus cycles may never be shown to the user, although they may exist (as shown by the dashed line in ) in the underlying map structure. This resolution method also allows a node to uniquely determine a submap in deleting or copying a submap. The determination is carried out on the basis of the resolved representation.","Such a method of resolving a graph into a tree can be illustrated by the simplest possible example, as shown in . Initially, as shown in the (a) scenario, the map has nodes \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d, which is to be extended with a new node.","The new node has the name \u201cB\u201d, as shown in (b), and the name \u201cB\u201d already exists in the map as denoted by making the second occurrence of \u201cB\u201d doubly circled. The user intends them to denote the same node, which transforms the tree into a graph, as shown in (c). This graph may be resolved into the tree (shown in (b)) when it is displayed. The resolution simply displays the tree (shown in (b)) where the same node (\u201cB\u201d) occurs at two different places. Any changes made by the user to one of the occurrences will automatically be propagated to the other occurrence, except deletion.","Node \u201cA\u201d is the uniquely determined root of the submap of (c), because it was initially the root of the tree that was transformed into a graph by adding a second occurrence of node \u201cB\u201d.","When the terminal in use has a graphical display, the present invention may also display cycles in graphs. To enter or exit this graph display mode, the user may select a special button in the UI by means of a pointing device.","In a terminal without a graphical display, information is always displayed in outline form, which is a linear representation of tree form, irrespective of whether the user has switched into graph display mode or not.","Graphs are then resolved to trees throughout. This is always possible like the display of a Unix file system as a tree structure despite symbolic links that form graphs of a kind.","Thus, as will be evident, the present invention allows two different visual structures that the user may switch between depending on his preference. In graph display mode, the UI displays graphs, and otherwise trees. In graph display mode, the user may choose a two- or three-dimensional display for graphs if he is using a terminal with a graphical display. The three-dimensional display may make complex graph structures easier to grasp.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0242"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["1","1","2","2","2","3"]},"Thus, in summary, herein is disclosed a method, system and apparatus for enabling users to create customized user interfaces. The user interface is logically structured as a node map, wherein nodes may be added to the node map in accordance with the user's needs. The nodes may be connected there-between to define relationships between the different nodes. The nodes may have an attachment, an action, an application and\/or the like associated therewith. The user may perform a variety of other functions to customize, alter or expand the information depicted on their user interface.","Although illustrative embodiments have been described herein in detail, it should be noted and understood that the descriptions have been provided for purposes of illustration only and that other variations both in form and detail can be made thereupon without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.
