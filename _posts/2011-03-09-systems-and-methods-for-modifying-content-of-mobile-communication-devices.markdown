{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention relates to mobile communication devices, and in particular to systems and methods for modifying content of mobile communication devices, such as mobile phones.","Mobile communication devices are prevalent in society today. A mobile communication device usually contains certain preset content when it is delivered to a consumer. The content may include, for example, the operating system for the device (e.g. Graphical User Interface) and standard applications (e.g. calendar, alarm clock, games, etc.).","Generally, the content of the mobile communication device changes over its life cycle. For example, users of the device may customize the device according to their preferences by storing additional personal information (e.g. adding a personal phonebook) or manipulating the factory preset information (e.g. replacing the factory wallpaper with a personal photo, installing additional applications).","In some circumstances, the mobile communication device may be reassigned, passed-on, or otherwise repurposed for a variety of reasons. In such circumstances and in other circumstances, it is desirable for content of the mobile communication device be reset to only contain specified preset content. For this purpose, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the device usually provides one or more tools (e.g. software applications) that can modify the content of the mobile communication device. For example, the OEM content-modification tool may be resident on a computer and is operable to remove all content stored in a mobile communication device connected to the computer and reinstall the operating system for that device.","The content-modification tools supplied by the OEM are generally designed for the end-user. As such, the OEM content-modification tools are not designed, tested nor optimized for use by a user who wishes to modify the content of devices on a larger scale. For example, a user such as a refurbisher or a corporate technology deployment department may wish to bulk-process the modification of the content of the devices.","In the cases described above, the OEM content-modification tool may be found to be lacking for a number of reasons. For example, the OEM content-modification tool usually requires at least some input by an operator of the tool to complete the process of modifying the content of a connected mobile communication device. Generally, the operator input may be required at various stages of the process, which requires an operator to check on the system from time to time to provide the required input.","For some devices, more than one OEM content-modification tools may be required to complete the desired content modification process. For example, to reset the contents of a Blackberry\u2122 device manufactured by Research In Motion inc. (RIM), several operations need to be performed using several tools. This again would require input by the operator to complete the process.","In yet another example, the data communication between the mobile communication device and the computer where the OEM content-modification tool is residing on may be lost. This could be due to issues on the computer (e.g. driver conflicts) or from execution of an operation by the OEM content-modification tool (e.g. removing the operating system from the device would cause the device to be reset, which cause the connection to the computer to be lost). In these cases, an operator is required to re-establish the connection. This may involve the operator having to physically unplug the device and reconnect the device to the computer to re-establish connection. In addition, connection between the device and the computer can be lost at multiple times during the process, which requires the operator to intervene at multiple times for the process to complete successfully. To further complicate matters, if a mobile communication device is unplugged as the process to modify the content is being modified, there is a risk that the device will lose its functionality, resulting in a \u201cbricked\u201d phone.","In view of the above, there is a need for a system and method to modify the content of mobile communication devices that address at least some of the above noted concerns","According to one aspect, there is provided a computer-implemented method for modifying content of mobile communication devices. The method includes the steps of establishing a data communication between at least one mobile communication device from at least one manufacturer and a coordinating computer, the at least one mobile communication device having content stored therein, providing at least one content-modification module for each of the at least one mobile communication device, the content-modification module comprising a plurality of operations that are executable to modify the content of that mobile communication device, providing at least one device-specific modification procedure for that mobile communication device, the modification procedure comprising one or more selected operations of the plurality of operations of the content-modification module and an order of execution of the one or more selected operations, and executing at least one operation of the selected operations based on the at least one device-specific modification procedure to modify the content of that mobile communication device.","According to another aspect, there is provided a system for modifying content of mobile communication devices including at least one coordinating computer having a coordinating processor and at least one hardware connection module operatively coupled thereto, the hardware connection being connectable to at least one mobile communication device and establishing a data communication therebetween. The coordinating processor is operable to provide at least one content-modification module for each of the at least one mobile communication device, the content-modification module comprising a plurality of operations that are executable to modify the content of that mobile communication device, provide at least one device-specific modification procedure for that mobile communication device, the modification procedure comprising one or more selected operations of the plurality of operations of the content-modification module and an order of execution of the one or more selected operations, and execute at least one operation of the selected operations based on the at least one device-specific modification procedure to modify the content of that mobile communication device.","According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a non-transitory computer readable medium having instructions for modifying of content of mobile communication devices. The instructions are executable by a processor to provide at least one content-modification module for each of the at least one mobile communication device, the content-modification module comprising a plurality of operations that are executable to modify the content of that mobile communication device, provide at least one device-specific modification procedure for that mobile communication device, the modification procedure comprising one or more selected operations of the plurality of operations of the content-modification module and an order of execution of the one or more selected operations, and execute at least one operation of the selected operations based on the at least one device-specific modification procedure to modify the content of that mobile communication device.","Other aspects and features of the invention will become apparent, to those ordinarily skilled in the art, upon review of the following description of some exemplary embodiments.","It will be appreciated that numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments described herein. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments described herein. Furthermore, this description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein in any way, but rather as merely describing the implementation of the various embodiments described herein.","The embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both. However, preferably, these embodiments are implemented in computer programs executing on programmable computers each comprising at least one processor, a data storage system (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. For example and without limitation, the programmable computers may be a mainframe computer, server, personal computer, laptop, personal data assistant, slate\/tablet\/pad-form computers, smart phone, or cellular telephone. Program code is applied to input data to perform the functions described herein and generate output information. The output information is applied to one or more output devices, in known fashion.","Each program is preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming and\/or scripting language to communicate with a computer system. However, the programs can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language. Each such computer program is preferably stored on a storage media or a device (e.g. ROM or magnetic diskette) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer, for configuring and operating the computer when the storage media or device is read by the computer to perform the procedures described herein. The inventive system may also be considered to be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein.","The embodiments described herein relate to batch processing of mobile communication devices. In particular, the described embodiments relate to modifying the content of multiple mobile communication devices of one or more type from one or more manufacturers that is implementable in an automated manner without requiring any input from a human operation generally, once the process to modify the content is initiated.","These embodiments could be deployed by an entity that refurbishes mobile devices, a corporate technology-deployment department, or any other entity that wishes to batch-process content of mobile communication devices.","The term \u201ccontent\u201d as used herein should be understood to include any information stored on the mobile communication device. For example and without limitation, the term content includes the operating system resident on the devices as well as any other content including various user data, user customizations and device resident applications.","The term \u201cmodification\u201d as used herein should be understood to mean performing one or more operations on the content of the devices, even if the content of a given device after a number of operations is the same as the content of that device before the performance of the operations. For example, performing operations to remove and reinstall the operating system in a given device should be understood as modifying the content of the given device, even if the end-result content of the operations is the same as the content before the operations were executed. The acts of removing and reinstalling the operating system in themselves are of value as they provide a measure of assurance that the operating system of the device is as intended.","Referring now to , illustrated therein is a system  for modifying content of mobile communication devices according to one embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment as shown, the system  comprises a coordinating computer  connected mobile communication devices , , and . In particular the coordinating computer  is connected to mobile devices A and B through a connection hub , and directly to the mobile communication device A. The coordinating computer  is also connected to a network , and through the network  to a server .","The mobile communication devices ,  and  will sometimes be referred to herein as \u201cthe device(s)\u201d. The devices ,  and , for example and without limitation, may be cellular phones, smart phones, tablet\/slate computers, and\/or eBook readers.","The device  and  are type \u201cA\u201d devices and the device  is a type \u201cB\u201d device. The terms types \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d refer to make and model of the device. For example, as shown, the devices , and  could be two phones of a particular model from a first manufacturer while the device  is a tablet computer from another manufacturer. In other embodiments, the devices could be different models from different manufacturers.","The devices ,  and  may be running various operating systems, which may be model-specific, manufacturer-specific (e.g. iOS developed by Apple Computer Inc.), and\/or operating systems that are not restricted to a particular device or a manufacturer (e.g. Android operating system developed by Google Inc.).","In the embodiment as shown, the connection between the coordinating computer  and each of the devices , ,  is facilitated through hardware compliant with the Universal Serial Bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) specification. The coordinating computer  includes a hardware connection module (not shown) such as an USB connection port and appropriate USB drivers software to support data communication through the USB connection port. The USB drivers may be provided to the coordinating computer  as part of an operating system for the coordinating computer . For example, the USB drivers may be provided as part of Windows\u2122 or UNIX\u2122 operating systems. The system  also comprises an external connection module, namely the connection hub . The connection hub  may be a powered or un-powered USB hub. USB cables are used to connect the coordinating computer , the devices  and the connection hub .","In other embodiments, the connection between mobile communication devices and the coordinating computer  could be facilitated through other types of wired or wireless connections such as IEEE 802.11 standard (\u201cWiFi\u201d), BlueTooth\u2122, cellular data network, infrared, IEEE 1394 serial bus or any other data communication means.","Referring now to , illustrated therein is a block diagram of exemplary modules of the coordinating computer . While the modules are located at the coordinating computer  in this embodiment, it is possible for one or more of these modules to be located at other components of the system  in other embodiments.","As shown, the coordinating computer  includes content-modification modules, namely, a first content-modification module , a second content-modification module , a third content-modification module , and a fourth content-modification module . The first content-modification module  and the second content-modification module  are developed or distributed by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or under authorization of the OEM of the type \u201cA\u201d devices  and . The third content-modification module  is provided by an OEM \u201cB\u201d of the type \u201cB\u201d device . The fourth content-modification module  is provided by an entity other than the OEM of the type \u201cB\u201d device . In other embodiments, number and source of the content-modification modules may vary.","Each of the content-modification modules , , ,  is a software product that can modify the content of the device. For example, one of the content-modification modules , , ,  may be ITunes\u2122 software developed and distributed by Apple inc., which may be used to modify content of various mobile communication devices manufactured by Apple inc. such as the iPhone\u2122 or the iPad\u2122. In another example, one of the content-modification modules , , ,  may be the Blackberry\u2122 desktop manager software produced by Research in Motion inc. (RIM) for its Blackberry\u2122 devices. In another example, one of the content-modification modules , , ,  may be an application programming interface (API) for a particular device. For example, the content-modification module  may be the Blackberry\u2122 Javaloader tool provided by RIM to perform various administrative tasks on a Blackberry\u2122 device.","In the embodiment as shown, the first and second content-modification modules ,  are software applications that are provided by the manufacturer of the devices ,  to modify the content of the devices of that type. Similarly, the third content-modification modules ,  are software applications provided by OEM for the device of type \u201cB\u201d and a non-OEM third-party to modify the content of the devices of that type respectively.","Each of the content-modification modules , , ,  comprises a plurality of operations that are executable to modify the content of the corresponding mobile communication devices , , . For example, the operations could include operations to install an operating system, update a current operating system, install one more applications, or perform other modification of the content of the devices","The operations in each of content-modification modules , , ,  may serve to perform different functionalities. In the current embodiment, executing one or more operations of the first content-modification module  removes the operating system and user content from devices of type \u201cA\u201d such as the devices  and , and executing one or more operations of the second content-modification module  reinstalls the operating system for these devices. One or more of the operations from the third content-modification module  may be executed to install a first application, and those from the fourth content-modification module  to install a second application.","Generally, the operations of each of the content-modification must be executed in a specific order to modify the content the device. For example, to perform a reinstall of an operating system on a Blackberry\u2122 device, the following operations must be executed in the given order: a \u201cresettofactory\u201d operation using the Javaloader tool, followed by a \u201cwipe\u201d command using the Javaloader tool, and reinstalling the operating system to the device using the Blackberry\u2122 desktop manager software. In another example, to perform a reinstall of an operating system on a Blackbery device that has a operations system version prior to version 4.5, the following operations must be executed in the given order: a \u201cwipe\u201d command using the Javaloader tool, followed by reinstalling the operating system to the device using the Blackberry\u2122 desktop manager software, and a \u201cresettofactory\u201d operation using the Javaloader tool.","The order of execution of the operations may be specific to a particular mobile communication device and a particular desired modification (i.e. desired functionality). For example, a given content-modification module may comprise a plurality of operations to modify content in a plurality of devices. However to achieve a desired modification of content of a particular device, it may be necessary for a subset of the operations be selected and executed in a given order.","The content-modification modules , , ,  are also connected to a connection module . The connection module  facilitates data communication between the devices , ,  and the coordinating computer  such that the content-modification modules , , ,  can send appropriate instructions associated with various operations to the mobile devices , ,  to modify the content stored therein.","The connection module , in this embodiment, comprises software USB drivers and USB connection management tools provided by the operating system of the coordinating computer  to manage the hardware associated with the connection module . For example, if the coordinating computer  is running a Windows\u2122 operating system, the connection module  could be the USB controllers that are accessible through the \u201cDevice Manager\u201d interface or though various command prompt operations. In other embodiments, the connection module  could be any other operating system specific application that facilitates data communication between the mobile communication devices , ,  and the coordinating computer  through the hardware connection module.","The coordinating computer  also comprises a coordinating module  connected to the content-modification modules , , , . The coordinating module  is operable to interface with each of the content-modification modules , , , and , and execute the operations of these modules to modify contents of the connected devices.","To execute the operations of the content-modification modules , , , , the coordinating module  interfaces with these content-modification modules , , , . In the embodiment as shown, the coordinating module  interfaces directly with the first content-modification module , and interfaces indirectly with the second, third and fourth content-modification modules ,  and  through a manipulation module .","The manipulation module  is a tool that facilitates manipulation of the interfaces of other applications such as the content-modification modules , , . The manipulation module  may be another software application, or a scripting language. For example, if the content-modification modules , ,  are operating in a Windows\u2122 environment, a freeware scripting language entitled Autolt could be used to manipulate the interfaces of the windows-based content-modification modules. The Autolt tool can be used, for example, to click buttons, extract information from text fields and lists, and recognize and deal with error conditions that may be present in the content-modification modules , , .","The coordinating module  interfaces directly with the content-modification module . Staying with the example that the content-modification module  is the Blackberry\u2122 Javaloader tool, the coordinating module  comprises various command-line operations to use the Javaloader tool to perform various functionalities. For example, the Javaloader tool may be used to perform a wipe of the connected devices , , determine whether the data communication between the coordinating computer  and the devices ,  are available, determine the model of the device, version of operating system installed, and which carrier the devices ,  are associated with.","The coordinating module  is also connected to the connection module  such that the coordinating module  may monitor the data communication between one or more of the devices , , and  and the coordinating computer .","The coordinating module  is also operable to re-establish the data communication by executing at least one operation in the coordinating computer . For example, if the coordinating computer  is a Windows\u2122 operating system environment, the coordinating module  may use a native tool \u201cdevcon.exe\u201d which provides command-line interface to the connection module  (e.g. Device Manager). This tool could be used to reset the connection drivers (e.g. USB drivers) for each device , ,  and the connection hub , either individually or in batch.","As some operations could conflict with other operations, it is necessary to coordinate the activities. For example, if one of the operations of one of the content-modification modules , , ,  is in the process of executing an operation, resetting the connection between the devices , ,  and the coordinating computer  while the execution is in progress may result in the device having a corrupted operating system (e.g. a \u201cbricked\u201d device). As such, the coordinating module  monitors and coordinates the activities of the content-modification modules , , ,  and the coordinating computer .","As stated above, the operations of the content-modification modules , , ,  are generally required to be executed in a specified order to achieve desired result (i.e. modification of the content of the attached device). The coordinating computer  comprises device-specific modification procedure for each type of the mobile communication devices , ,  connected to coordinating computer . The device modification procedure includes one or more selected operations of the plurality of operations of one or more of the content-modification modules , , ,  and order of execution of the selected operations. The selected operations and order of execution of the selected operations may vary based on the desired modification (e.g. install application vs. install operating system) and\/or the device type (e.g. type \u201cA\u201d vs. type \u201cB\u201d).","The device-specific modification procedure may be stored on the server . The server  may be a web server connectable to the coordinating computer  through the Internet. For example, the server  may be a cloud service. When a given device is connected to the coordinating computer , the coordinating computer  might determine the type of the device that is connected (e.g. device types \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d), the content modification that is desired (e.g. reinstall OS, install applications) and whether there is a corresponding device-specific modification procedure for that device for that desired modification. The coordinating computer  may then retrieve the necessary device-specific modification procedure from the server  if it is not already present in the coordinating computer .","Referring now to , illustrated therein are exemplary device-specific modification procedures  and  for devices of type \u201cA\u201d (devices , ) and devices of type \u201cB\u201d (e.g. device ). The procedure  is directed to removing the installed operating system and user content from the devices , , reinstalling the operating system, and loading a selected application to the same. The procedure  is directed to installing a first and second application to the devices of type B (i.e. the device ).","The modification procedure , as shown, includes a plurality of selected operations generally indicated by the reference numeral , that are to be executed on content-modification modules ,  to perform the modification stated above. The plurality of selected operations are selected from each of the content-modification modules , . As shown, the selected operations are to be performed in a serial order, from the top of the list to the bottom of the list. In other embodiments, the order of performance of some of the selected operations may differ without affecting the outcome of the procedure. For example, if installing more than one application, it is generally possible to install the applications in any order, provided that the applications are not dependent on one another.","Modification procedures other than the modification procedure  may have different sets of operations. For example, other modification procedures may include different selected operations from the same and\/or different content-modification modules, and the order of performance of the selected operations may also differ. As shown, the device-specific modification procedure  includes operations  that are different than that of the procedure .","The operations as shown in the example are at a high-level for illustrative purposes. Generally, each operation may further include a series of sub-steps. For example, the detect device operation  may involve sending a command to the connection module  to obtain a list of devices in data communication with the coordinating computer , determine whether any of the devices are devices of type A, and determine whether the specific device  or  is in data communication.","Similarly, the operation  to check connection status may include a plurality of sub-steps. For example, the operation  may include the sub-steps of generating a command for one of the operations of the content-modification module  to detect the connected device , or , executing the command, waiting for a response from the device, if the response indicates the device is not detected, waiting for a specific period of time and\/or sending a command to the connection module  to restart the USB driver corresponding to that device, and repeating one or more of these steps until the data communication between the device  or  and the coordinating computer  is confirmed.","The operation  check connection status may be understood as monitoring the data communication between the device and the coordinating computer . Monitoring the data communication may be particularly helpful in cases wherein one or more of the executed selected operations will restart the device, causing the data communication between the device and the coordinating computer  to be lost. In some cases, the connection may re-establish itself. However, in other cases, the data communication may not re-establish itself for a variety of reasons. In such cases, it may be necessary to execute a command in the coordinating computer  to re-establish the data communication. For example, a connection driver in the connection module  may be reset to force it to re-establish the data communication between the device and the coordinating computer . Additionally, these steps could be automated, that is, performed without input from a human operator.","The system  is operable to modify the content multiple devices , ,  of different types and different manufacturers simultaneously. The coordinating module  may assign a unique identifier to each of the devices , ,  that are connected to the coordinating computer . The unique identifier could be used to track the progress of the device-specific modification procedure. For example as shown in , , and , unique identifier A has been assigned to the device , A to the device  and B to the device .","Referring back to , the coordinating module  also records information about at least one selected operation that has been executed for a particular device. For devices A and A, the recorded information about the executed selected operations are shown generally by reference numerals  and  in , and for the device B, the recorded information is shown generally by reference numeral  in . Recording the selected operations that have been executed for the devices allows the coordinating module  to track the progress of the modification procedures for each of the devices. By tracking the progress of the modification procedures, the coordinating module  may resume the procedure at an appropriate selected operation should the data communication between the coordinating computer  and the devices , ,  are interrupted and re-established without requiring input from a human operator. That is, after the data communication is re-established between one of the devices , ,  and the coordinating computer , the coordinating module  may determine a next operation of the plurality of operations to be executed based on the modification procedure and the recorded information about the operations that had been executed for that device , , or .","Referring now to , illustrated therein is a computer-implemented method  for modifying the content of mobile communication devices according to an embodiment of the invention. One or more of the steps of method  may be automated. That is, one or more of the steps of these methods may be implemented and performed without requiring any input from a human operator. The method  may be executed by a computer. For example and without limitation, the method  may be executed by the coordinating computer  as described hereinabove.","The method  begins at step . At step , the data communication between at least one mobile communication device from at least one manufacturer and a coordinating computer is established. The step  may include connecting the mobile communication device to a connection module. The connection module facilitates data communication between the at least one mobile communication device and the coordinating computer. The connection may be one or more wired\/wireless hardware connection module, located within the coordinating computer and\/or external to the coordinating computer. The step  may also include assigning a unique identifier to the at least one mobile communication device in data communication with the coordinating computer.","At step , at least one content-modification module from the at least one manufacturer for each of the at least one mobile communication device is provided. The content-modification module comprises a plurality of operations that are executable to modify the content of that mobile communication device. The step  may include the step of retrieving the at least one content-modification module from a network resource. For example and without limitation, the at least one content-modification module may be the content-modification modules , ,  and\/or  described herein above.","At step , at least one device-specific modification procedure for that mobile communication device is provided. The modification procedure comprises one or more selected operations of the plurality of operations of the content-modification module and an order of execution of the one or more selected operations. For example and without limitation, the at least one device-specific modification procedure may be the device-specific modification procedure  and  as described above.","At step , at least one operation of the selected operations is executed in the order of execution provided to modify the content of that mobile communication device. Depending on the type of the content-modification module, the step  may include using a manipulation module to manipulate an interface of the content-modification module, and\/or generating and executing command prompt commands. For example and without limitation, the executed operation may be the operations  or  described above.","At step , information about the executed selected operation at step  is recorded. For example and without limitation, the recorded information about the executed selected operation may be the recorded information indicated by reference numeral  described above and shown in .","At step , the data communication between the at least one device and the coordinating computer is monitored to determine whether the data communication to the at least one mobile communication device is lost. This step may comprise executing one of the selected operations at the at least one content-modification module and\/or at connection module of the coordinating computer. In other embodiments, the data communication may be monitored by checking the connection module at defined intervals. The intervals may be defined based on temporal considerations (e.g. time elapsed since the last check). The intervals may also be defined based on one or more of the selected operations that were executed. For example, if it is known that execution of a given selected operation entails the risk of the data communication being lost, the data communication may be monitored after each execution of that operation.","At step , it is determined whether the data communication between the at least one mobile communication device and the coordinating computer is lost. If it is determined that the data communication is lost, the method proceeds to step . If the data communication is active, the method proceeds to step .","At step , the data communication is re-established by executing at least one operation in the coordinating computer. The data communication is re-established without manipulating a physical connection between the at least one mobile communication device and the coordinating computer. For example and without limitation, the data communication can be re-established by executing one or more selected operations at least one content-modification module and\/or execution one or more connection module operations at the connection module. After the data communication is re-established, the method  proceeds to step .","At step , it is determined whether to execute another operation of the selected operations based on the device-specific modification procedure and the information about at least one operation that has been executed.","If it is determined that there is another selected operation is to be executed, the method  returns to step  to execute that operation. If there are no more additional selected operations to be executed, the method ends at step .","The foregoing aspects of the method and the electronic device are provided for exemplary purposes only.
