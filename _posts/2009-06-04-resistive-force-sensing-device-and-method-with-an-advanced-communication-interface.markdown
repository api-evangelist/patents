It will be appreciated that the various embodiments discussed herein need not necessarily belong to the same group of exemplary embodiments, and may be grouped into various other embodiments not explicitly disclosed herein. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments.","A spring assembly, which overcomes the problems of relaxation, creep, hysteresis, set, and\/or off-axis loading, is disclosed in one embodiment. The spring assembly in its various embodiments has the property that when a force is applied to the spring assembly, the spring assembly deflects both longitudinally (e.g., along a direction of the applied force) and perpendicularly to the direction of the applied force. However, at the points where the spring assembly contacts other surfaces and\/or layers, the perpendicular deflection is negligible, which reduces the problem of friction and, therefore, hysteresis. A member may include at least one of a spring assembly positioned between a fixed surface and a movable surface.","The various embodiments of a spring assembly may be used in different types of force measuring devices (e.g., a gap-change sensing device, an area-change sensing device, etc.). The spring assembly may include a conical washer. The conical washer may provide several substantial advantages. The conical washer may have a large base (e.g., 3\u00d7) compared to a height thereof combined with a large flat top surface, which makes it unlikely that the applied force will cause the movable surface to suffer off-axis loading, thereby rendering the movable surface non-parallel. Further, metals may be less susceptible to set and creep than other materials.","In another embodiment, a spring assembly may include two conical washers placed back to back in such a way that a top surface and\/or a bottom surface are wide, but not as wide as the middle. In another embodiment, the spring assembly may include multiple pairs of conical washers placed back to back. Yet another embodiment of a spring assembly includes multiple sets of conical washers placed base to base, each set including at least one conical washer.","The various embodiments of a spring assembly may be used in different types of force measuring devices (e.g., a gap-change sensing device, an area-change sensing device, etc.). In a gap-change sensing device, the spring assembly can be positioned between the fixed surface and the movable surface which is substantially parallel to a fixed surface. When a force is applied perpendicular to the movable surface, the height of the spring assembly may be changed, and this may cause change in a gap between the fixed surface and the movable surface. The change in the gap between the fixed surface and the movable surface may cause a change in an electrical property (at least one of conductance, resistance and inductance) between the fixed surface and the movable surface, which can algorithmically be measured as a force.","In an area-change sensing device, a sensor may have a fixed surface and a movable surface substantially parallel to the fixed surface, the fixed layer being perpendicular to the fixed surface, and at least a spring assembly, positioned between the movable surface and the fixed layer, being caused to alter in height in response to a force applied adjacent to the movable surface, and to cause a change in an overlap area between the fixed surface and the movable surface, and a circuit to determine a measurement based on an algorithm that considers a change in an electrical property when the overlap area changes.","A few embodiments of a spring assembly have been shown in  by way of illustration. The various embodiments of the spring assembly may be used in different types of force measuring devices (including, e.g., a gap-change sensing device, an area-change sensing device, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","140","170","110","105","140","140","140","120","160","105","105","140","110","150","105","170","110","170"]},"At the points where the conical washer is in contact with other surfaces and\/or layers (e.g., the movable surface ), the perpendicular deflection (e.g., perpendicular to the direction of a force ) may be negligible.

The fixed surface  and the movable surface  may be painted (e.g., sputtered, coated) on multiple non-conductive printed circuit boards (e.g., the printed circuit boards , , and  of ).

For example, the change in capacitance of the sensor may be inversely proportional to the change in distance.","The spring assembly  of  may be coated with an insulating material at the ends where it comes in contact with the fixed surface  and the movable surface  (e.g., to avoid a short circuit). In one embodiment, the spring assembly  may be created from a conductive synthetic material rather than solely one or more metals. A spring assembly  may create a gap between the surface  and the surface . The gap can be filled with air or any other gas (e.g., an inert gas). A conductive material may be stretched to the limits of elasticity such that an increase in length and decrease in width may cause an increase in resistance. The aforementioned increase in resistance may be sensed and, therefore, for example, the change in resistance of an appropriate sensor may be directly proportional to the change in length and inversely proportional to the change in cross-sectional area.","The surface  as illustrated in  and the surface  as illustrated in  may be separated by the spacer as illustrated in . The surface  and the surface  may form a reference sensor according to one embodiment. Since the surface  and the surface  may not alter positions with respect to each other, when a force  is applied to a top layer , the electrical property thereof may not change.

The environmental factors may be at least one of a humidity in a gap between the first surface and the second surface, a temperature of a resistive sensor device , and an air pressure of an environment surrounding a resistive sensor device . Therefore, the effect of these environmental conditions can be removed from a measurement of a change in electrical property of a sensor.
