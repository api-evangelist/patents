No. 12\/638,532, filed Dec. 15, 2009, now abandoned which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 11\/676,469, filed Feb. 19, 2007, now U.S. Pat.

Each of these applications is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with Government support under contracts N00014-95-C-0278 and N00014-96-C-0395 awarded by the Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention involves aerosol production of finely-divided particles of a variety of compositions. The present invention also involves the particles so manufactured and electronic devices made using the particles.","Powdered materials are used in many manufacturing processes. One large use for powders is for thick film deposition to prepare films of a variety of materials. Some thick film applications include, for example, deposition of phosphor materials for flat panel displays, and patterning of electrically conductive features for electronic products.","For thick film applications, and for other applications, there is a trend to use powders of ever smaller particles. Generally desirable features in small particles include a small particle size; a narrow particle size distribution; a dense, spherical particle morphology; and a crystalline grain structure. Existing technologies for preparing powdered products, however, often could be improved with respect to attaining all, or substantially all, of these desired features for particles used in thick film applications.","One method that has been used to make small particles is to precipitate the particles from a liquid medium. Such liquid precipitation techniques are often difficult to control to produce particles with the desired characteristics. Also, particles prepared by liquid precipitation routes often are contaminated with significant quantities of surfactants or other organic materials used during the liquid phase processing.","Aerosol methods have also been used to make a variety of small particles. One aerosol method for making small particles is spray pyrolysis, in which an aerosol spray is generated and then converted in a reactor to the desired particles. Spray pyrolysis systems have, however, been mostly experimental, and unsuitable for commercial particle production. Furthermore, control of particle size distribution is a concern with spray pyrolysis. Also, spray pyrolysis systems are often inefficient in the use of carrier gases that suspend and carry liquid droplets of the aerosol. This inefficiency is a major consideration for commercial applications of spray pyrolysis systems.","There is a significant need for improved manufacture techniques for making powders of small particles for use in thick film and other applications.","Not only would improved particle manufacture techniques be desirable, but improved materials would also be desirable for a variety of applications. For example, there is a significant problem in cofire processes, such as cofiring of multi-layer ceramic capacitors and other components, of delaminations and other failures that can occur due to sintering\/densification\/shrinkage mismatch between adjoining layers. Improved techniques for providing high quality particles to reduce these problems would be desirable.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a method that includes depositing a composition onto a substrate, the composition comprising metallic particles having a weight average particle size lower than 2 microns. The metallic particles comprise multi-phase particles comprising a first phase and a second phase. The method continues with heating the deposited composition to form an electrically conductive feature. In one example case, the second phase is in the form of a coating around a core of the first phase. In another example case, the first phase is a metallic phase. In another example case, the second phase is a metallic phase different from the first phase. In another example case, the composition further comprises a glass frit. In one specific such case, the second phase comprises the glass frit. In another example case, the second phase comprises an oxide. In one such case, the oxide comprises an oxide of zinc, tin, barium, molybdenum, manganese, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, tungsten, iron, silver, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, yttrium, iridium, beryllium, silicon, zirconium, aluminum, bismuth, magnesium, thorium or gadolinium. In another such case, the oxide comprises silica, alumina, titania, zirconia or yttria, or an oxide of copper, bismuth or tin. In another example case, at least 90 weight percent of the metallic particles are smaller than twice the weight average size of the particles. In another example case, the second material phase comprises less than 30 weight percent of the particles. In another example case, the metallic particles are not jagged in shape. In another example case, the metallic particles are formed through an aerosol method. In another example case, the metallic particles comprise metal nanoparticles. In another example case, the metallic particles comprise an alloy.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a device that includes a substrate, and an electrically conductive feature formed on the substrate, wherein a composition deposited onto the substrate is heated to form the electrically conductive feature. The composition comprises metallic particles having a weight average particle size lower than 2 microns, wherein the metallic particles comprise multi-phase particles comprising a first phase and a second different from the first phase. In one example case, the second phase is in the form of a coating around a core of the first phase, or is dispersed throughout a matrix of the first phase. In another example case, the composition further comprises a glass frit. In another example case, the electrically conductive feature forms at least part of an internal electrode of a multi-layer capacitor, a display circuit, a window heater\/defogger circuit, an electrically conductive pathway of a multi-chip module, an electrode for a display, or a via or metallized termination for a multi-layer microelectronic device. Variations will be apparent in light of this disclosure.","For example, another embodiment of the present invention provides a device that includes a substrate and an electrically conductive feature formed on the substrate, wherein a composition deposited onto the substrate is heated to form the electrically conductive feature. In this example case, the composition comprises glass frit, as well as metallic particles having a weight average particle size lower than 2 microns. The metallic particles having a weight average particle size lower than 2 microns comprise multi-phase particles having a first phase and a second phase. The first phase comprises a metal, and the second phase comprises one of an oxide or a metal different from the first phase metal.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing a particulate product. A feed of liquid-containing, flowable medium, including at least one precursor for the desired particulate product, is converted to aerosol form, with droplets of the medium being dispersed in and suspended by a carrier gas. Liquid from the droplets in the aerosol is then removed to permit formation in a dispersed state of the desired particles. Typically, the feed precursor is pyrolyzed in a furnace to make the particles. In one embodiment, the particles are subjected, while still in a dispersed state, to compositional or structural modification, if desired. Compositional modification may include, for example, coating the particles. Structural modification may include, for example, crystallization, recrystallization or morphological alteration of the particles. The term powder is often used herein to refer to the particulate product of the present invention. The use of the term powder does not indicate, however, that the particulate product must be dry or in any particular environment. Although the particulate product is typically manufactured in a dry state, the particulate product may, after manufacture, be placed in a wet environment, such as in a slurry.","The process of the present invention is particularly well suited for the production of particulate products of finely divided particles having a weight average size, for most applications, in a range having a lower limit of about 0.1 micron, preferably about 0.3 micron, more preferably about 0.5 micron and most preferably about 0.8 micron; and having an upper limit of about 4 microns, preferably about 3 microns, more preferably about 2.5 microns and more preferably about 2 microns. A particularly preferred range for many applications is a weight average size of from about 0.5 micron to about 3 microns, and more particularly from about 0.5 micron to about 2 microns. For some applications, however, other weight average particle sizes may be particularly preferred.","In addition to making particles within a desired range of weight average particle size, with the present invention the particles may be produced with a desirably narrow size distribution, thereby providing size uniformity that is desired for many applications.","In addition to control over particle size and size distribution, the method of the present invention provides significant flexibility for producing particles of varying composition, crystallinity and morphology. For example, the present invention may be used to produce homogeneous particles involving only a single phase or multi-phase particles including multiple phases. In the case of multi-phase particles, the phases may be present in a variety of morphologies. For example, one phase may be uniformly dispersed throughout a matrix of another phase. Alternatively, one phase may form an interior core while another phase forms a coating that surrounds the core. Other morphologies are also possible, as discussed more fully below.","Referring now to , one embodiment of the process of the present invention is described. A liquid feed , including at least one precursor for the desired particles, and a carrier gas  are fed to an aerosol generator  where an aerosol  is produced. The aerosol  is then fed to a furnace  where liquid in the aerosol  is removed to produce particles  that are dispersed in and suspended by gas exiting the furnace . The particles  are then collected in a particle collector  to produce a particulate product .","As used herein, the liquid feed  is a feed that includes one or more flowable liquids as the major constituent(s), such that the feed is a flowable medium. The liquid feed  need not comprise only liquid constituents. The liquid feed  may comprise only constituents in one or more liquid phase, or it may also include particulate material suspended in a liquid phase. The liquid feed  must, however, be capable of being atomized to form droplets of sufficiently small size for preparation of the aerosol . Therefore, if the liquid feed  includes suspended particles, those particles should be relatively small in relation to the size of droplets in the aerosol . Such suspended particles should typically be smaller than about 1 micron in size, preferably smaller than about 0.5 micron in size, and more preferably smaller than about 0.3 micron in size and most preferably smaller than about 0.1 micron in size. Most preferably, the suspended particles should be able to form a colloid. The suspended particles could be finely divided particles, or could be agglomerate masses comprised of agglomerated smaller primary particles. For example, 0.5 micron particles could be agglomerates of nanometer-sized primary particles. When the liquid feed  includes suspended particles, the particles typically comprise no greater than about 25 to 50 weight percent of the liquid feed.","As noted, the liquid feed  includes at least one precursor for preparation of the particles . The precursor may be a substance in either a liquid or solid phase of the liquid feed . Frequently, the precursor will be a material, such as a salt, dissolved in a liquid solvent of the liquid feed . Typical precursor salts include nitrate, chloride, sulfate, acetate and oxalate salts and the like. The precursor may undergo one or more chemical reactions in the furnace  to assist in production of the particles . Alternatively, the precursor material may contribute to formation of the particles  without undergoing chemical reaction. This could be the case, for example, when the liquid feed  includes, as a precursor material, suspended particles that are not chemically modified in the furnace . In any event, the particles  comprise at least one component originally contributed by the precursor.","The liquid feed  may include multiple precursor materials, which may be present together in a single phase or separately in multiple phases. For example, the liquid feed  may include multiple precursors in solution in a single liquid vehicle. Alternatively, one precursor material could be in a solid particulate phase and a second precursor material could be in a liquid phase. Also, one precursor material could be in one liquid phase and a second precursor material could be in a second liquid phase, such as could be the case when the liquid feed  comprises an emulsion. Different components contributed by different precursors may be present in the particles together in a single material phase, or the different components may be present in different material phases when the particles  are composites of multiple phases.","When the liquid feed  includes a soluble precursor, the precursor solution should be unsaturated to avoid the formation of precipitates. Solutions of salts will typically be used in concentrations in a range to provide a solution including from about 1 to about 50 weight percent solute. Most often, the liquid feed will include a solution with from about 5 weight percent to about 40 weight percent solute, and more preferably to about 30 weight percent solute. Preferably the solvent is aqueous-based for ease of operation, although other solvents, such as toluene or other organic solvents, may be desirable for specific materials. The use of organic solvents, however, can sometimes lead to undesirable carbon contamination in the particles. The pH of the aqueous-based solutions can be adjusted to alter the solubility characteristics of the precursor or precursors in the solution.","The carrier gas  may comprise any gaseous medium in which droplets produced from the liquid feed  may be dispersed in aerosol form. Also, the carrier gas  may be inert, in that the carrier gas  does not participate in formation of the particles . Alternatively, the carrier gas may have one or more active component(s) that contribute to formation of the particles . In that regard, the carrier gas may include one or more reactive components that react in the furnace  to contribute to formation of the particles .","The aerosol generator  atomizes the liquid feed  to form droplets in a manner to permit the carrier gas  to sweep the droplets away to form the aerosol . The droplets comprise liquid from the liquid feed . The droplets may, however, also include nonliquid material, such as one or more small particles held in the droplet by the liquid. For example, when the particles  are composite, or multi-phase, particles, one phase of the composite may be provided in the liquid feed  in the form of suspended precursor particles and a second phase of the composite may be produced in the furnace  from one or more precursors in the liquid phase of the liquid feed . Furthermore the precursor particles could be included in the liquid feed , and therefore also in droplets of the aerosol , for the purpose only of dispersing the particles for subsequent compositional or structural modification during or after processing in the furnace .","An important aspect of the present invention is generation of the aerosol  with droplets of a small average size, narrow size distribution. In this manner, the particles  may be produced at a desired small size with a narrow size distribution, which are advantageous for many applications.","The aerosol generator  is capable of producing the aerosol  such that it includes droplets having a weight average size in a range having a lower limit of about 1 micron and preferably about 2 microns; and an upper limit of about 10 microns, preferably about 7 microns, more preferably about 5 microns and most preferably about 4 microns. A weight average droplet size in a range of from about 2 microns to about 4 microns is more preferred for most applications, with a weight average droplet size of about 3 microns being particularly preferred for some applications. The aerosol generator is also capable of producing the aerosol  such that it includes droplets in a narrow size distribution. Preferably, the droplets in the aerosol are such that at least about 70 percent (more preferably at least about 80 weight percent and most preferably at least about 85 weight percent) of the droplets are smaller than about 10 microns and more preferably at least about 70 weight percent (more preferably at least about 80 weight percent and most preferably at least about 85 weight percent) are smaller than about 5 microns. Furthermore, preferably no greater than about 30 weight percent, more preferably no greater than about 25 weight percent and most preferably no greater than about 20 weight percent, of the droplets in the aerosol  are larger than about twice the weight average droplet size.","Another important aspect of the present invention is that the aerosol  may be generated without consuming excessive amounts of the carrier gas . The aerosol generator  is capable of producing the aerosol  such that it has a high loading, or high concentration, of the liquid feed  in droplet form. In that regard, the aerosol  preferably includes greater than about 1\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter of the aerosol , more preferably greater than about 5\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter, still more preferably greater than about 1\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter, and most preferably greater than about 5\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter. That the aerosol generator  can produce such a heavily loaded aerosol  is particularly surprising considering the high quality of the aerosol  with respect to small average droplet size and narrow droplet size distribution. Typically, droplet loading in the aerosol is such that the volumetric ratio of liquid feed  to carrier gas  in the aerosol  is larger than about 0.04 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas  in the aerosol , preferably larger than about 0.083 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas  in the aerosol , more preferably larger than about 0.167 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas , still more preferably larger than about 0.25 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas , and most preferably larger than about 0.333 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas .","This capability of the aerosol generator  to produce a heavily loaded aerosol  is even more surprising given the high droplet output rate of which the aerosol generator  is capable, as discussed more fully below. It will be appreciated that the concentration of liquid feed  in the aerosol  will depend upon the specific components and attributes of the liquid feed  and, particularly, the size of the droplets in the aerosol . For example, when the average droplet size is from about 2 microns to about 4 microns, the droplet loading is preferably larger than about 0.15 milliliters of aerosol feed  per liter of carrier gas , more preferably larger than about 0.2 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas , even more preferably larger than about 0.25 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas , and most preferably larger than about 0.3 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas . When reference is made herein to liters of carrier gas , it refers to the volume that the carrier gas  would occupy under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.","The furnace  may be any suitable device for heating the aerosol  to evaporate liquid from the droplets of the aerosol  and thereby permit formation of the particles . For most applications, maximum average stream temperatures in the furnace  will generally be in a range of from about 500\u00b0 C. to about 1500\u00b0 C., and preferably in the range of from about 900\u00b0 C. to about 1300\u00b0 C. The maximum average stream temperature refers to the maximum average temperature that an aerosol stream attains while flowing through the furnace. This is typically determined by a temperature probe inserted into the furnace.","Although longer residence times are possible, for many applications, residence time in the heating zone of the furnace  of shorter than about 4 seconds is typical, with shorter than about 2 seconds being preferred, shorter than about 1 second being more preferred, shorter than about 0.5 second being even more preferred, and shorter than about 0.2 second being most preferred. The residence time should be long enough, however, to assure that the particles  attain the desired maximum average stream temperature for a given heat transfer rate. In that regard, with extremely short residence times, higher furnace temperatures could be used to increase the rate of heat transfer so long as the particles  attain a maximum temperature within the desired stream temperature range. That mode of operation, however, is not preferred. Also, it is preferred that, in most cases, the maximum average stream temperature not be attained in the furnace  until substantially at the end of the heating zone in the furnace . For example, the heating zone will often include a plurality of heating sections that are each independently controllable. The maximum average stream temperature should typically not be attained until the final heating section, and more preferably until substantially at the end of the last heating section. This is important to reduce the potential for thermophoretic losses of material. Also, it is noted that as used herein, residence time refers to the actual time for a material to pass through the relevant process equipment. In the case of the furnace, this includes the effect of increasing velocity with gas expansion due to heating.","Typically, the furnace  will be a tube-shaped furnace, so that the aerosol  moving into and through the furnace does not encounter sharp edges on which droplets could collect. Loss of droplets to collection at sharp surfaces results in a lower yield of particles . More important, however, the accumulation of liquid at sharp edges can result in re-release of undesirably large droplets back into the aerosol , which can cause contamination of the particulate product  with undesirably large particles. Also, over time, such liquid collection at sharp surfaces can cause fouling of process equipment, impairing process performance.","The furnace  may include a heating tube made of any suitable material. The tube material may be a ceramic material, for example, mullite, silica or alumina. Alternatively, the tube may be metallic. Advantages of using a metallic tube are low cost, ability to withstand steep temperature gradients and large thermal shocks, machinability and weldability, and ease of providing a seal between the tube and other process equipment. Disadvantages of using a metallic tube include limited operating temperature and increased reactivity in some reaction systems.","When a metallic tube is used in the furnace , it is preferably a high nickel content stainless steel alloy, such as a 330 stainless steel, or a nickel-based super alloy. As noted, one of the major advantages of using a metallic tube is that the tube is relatively easy to seal with other process equipment. In that regard, flange fittings may be welded directly to the tube for connecting with other process equipment. Metallic tubes are generally preferred for making particles that do not require a maximum tube wall temperature of higher than about 1100\u00b0 C. during particle manufacture.","When higher temperatures are required, ceramic tubes are typically used. One major problem with ceramic tubes, however, is that the tubes can be difficult to seal with other process equipment, especially when the ends of the tubes are maintained at relatively high temperatures, as is often the case with some embodiments of the present invention.","One configuration for sealing a ceramic tube is shown in ,  and . The furnace  includes a ceramic tube  having an end cap  fitted to each end of the tube , with a gasket  disposed between corresponding ends of the ceramic tube  and the end caps . The gasket may be of any suitable material for sealing at the temperature encountered at the ends of the tubes . Examples of gasket materials for sealing at temperatures below about 250\u00b0 C. include silicone, TEFLON\u2122 and VITON\u2122. Examples of gasket materials for higher temperatures include graphite, ceramic paper, thin sheet metal, and combinations thereof.","Tension rods  extend over the length of the furnace  and through rod holes  through the end caps . The tension rods  are held in tension by the force of springs  bearing against bearing plates  and the end caps . The tube  is, therefore, in compression due to the force of the springs . The springs  may be compressed any desired amount to form a seal between the end caps  and the ceramic tube  through the gasket . As will be appreciated, by using the springs , the tube  is free to move to some degree as it expands upon heating and contracts upon cooling. To form the seal between the end caps  and the ceramic tube , one of the gaskets  is seated in a gasket seat  on the side of each end cap  facing the tube . A mating face  on the side of each of the end caps  faces away from the tube , for mating with a flange surface for connection with an adjacent piece of equipment.","Also, although example embodiments of the present invention are described with primary reference to a furnace reactor, which is preferred, it should be recognized that, except as noted, any other thermal reactor, including a flame reactor or a plasma reactor, could be used instead. A furnace reactor is, however, preferred, because of the generally even heating characteristic of a furnace for attaining a uniform stream temperature.","The particle collector , may be any suitable apparatus for collecting particles  to produce the particulate product . One preferred embodiment of the particle collector  uses one or more filters to separate the particles  from gas. Such a filter may be of any type, including a bag filter. Another preferred embodiment of the particle collector uses one or more cyclones to separate the particles . Other apparatus that may be used in the particle collector  includes an electrostatic precipitator. Also, collection should normally occur at a temperature above the condensation temperature of the gas stream in which the particles  are suspended. Also, collection should normally be at a temperature that is low enough to prevent significant agglomeration of the particles .","The process and apparatus of the present invention are well-suited for producing commercial-size batches of extremely high quality particles. In that regard, the process and the accompanying apparatus provide versatility for preparing powder including a wide variety of materials, and easily accommodate shifting of production between different specialty batches of particles.","Of significant importance to the operation of the process of the present invention is the aerosol generator , which must be capable of producing a high quality aerosol with high droplet loading, as previously noted. With reference to , one embodiment of an aerosol generator  of the present invention is described. The aerosol generator  includes a plurality of ultrasonic transducer discs  that are each mounted in a transducer housing . The transducer housings  are mounted to a transducer mounting plate , creating an array of the ultrasonic transducer discs . Any convenient spacing may be used for the ultrasonic transducer discs . Center-to-center spacing of the ultrasonic transducer discs  of about 4 centimeters is often adequate. The aerosol generator , as shown in , includes forty-nine transducers in a 7\u00d77 array. The array configuration is as shown in , which depicts the locations of the transducer housings  mounted to the transducer mounting plate .","With continued reference to , a separator , in spaced relation to the transducer discs , is retained between a bottom retaining plate  and a top retaining plate . Gas delivery tubes  are connected to gas distribution manifolds , which have gas delivery ports . The gas distribution manifolds  are housed within a generator body  that is covered by generator lid . A transducer driver , having circuitry for driving the transducer discs , is electronically connected with the transducer discs  via electrical cables .","During operation of the aerosol generator , as shown in , the transducer discs  are activated by the transducer driver  via the electrical cables . The transducers preferably vibrate at a frequency of from about 1 MHz to about 5 MHz, more preferably from about 1.5 MHz to about 3 MHz. Frequently used frequencies are at about 1.6 MHz and about 2.4 MHz. Furthermore, all of the transducer discs  should be operating at substantially the same frequency when an aerosol with a narrow droplet size distribution is desired. This is important because commercially available transducers can vary significantly in thickness, sometimes by as much as 10%. It is preferred, however, that the transducer discs  operate at frequencies within a range of 5% above and below the median transducer frequency, more preferably within a range of 2.5%, and most preferably within a range of 1%. This can be accomplished by careful selection of the transducer discs  so that they all preferably have thicknesses within 5% of the median transducer thickness, more preferably within 2.5%, and most preferably within 1%.","Liquid feed  enters through a feed inlet  and flows through flow channels  to exit through feed outlet . An ultrasonically transmissive fluid, typically water, enters through a water inlet  to fill a water bath volume  and flow through flow channels  to exit through a water outlet . A proper flow rate of the ultrasonically transmissive fluid is necessary to cool the transducer discs  and to prevent overheating of the ultrasonically transmissive fluid. Ultrasonic signals from the transducer discs  are transmitted, via the ultrasonically transmissive fluid, across the water bath volume , and ultimately across the separator , to the liquid feed  in flow channels .","The ultrasonic signals from the ultrasonic transducer discs  cause atomization cones  to develop in the liquid feed  at locations corresponding with the transducer discs . Carrier gas  is introduced into the gas delivery tubes  and delivered to the vicinity of the atomization cones  via gas delivery ports . Jets of carrier gas exit the gas delivery ports  in a direction so as to impinge on the atomization cones , thereby sweeping away atomized droplets of the liquid feed  that are being generated from the atomization cones  and creating the aerosol , which exits the aerosol generator  through an aerosol exit opening .","Efficient use of the carrier gas  is an important aspect of the aerosol generator . The embodiment of the aerosol generator  shown in  includes two gas exit ports per atomization cone , with the gas ports being positioned above the liquid medium  over troughs that develop between the atomization cones , such that the exiting carrier gas  is horizontally directed at the surface of the atomization cones , thereby efficiently distributing the carrier gas  to critical portions of the liquid feed  for effective and efficient sweeping away of droplets as they form about the ultrasonically energized atomization cones . Furthermore, it is preferred that at least a portion of the opening of each of the gas delivery ports , through which the carrier gas exits the gas delivery tubes, should be located below the top of the atomization cones  at which the carrier gas  is directed. This relative placement of the gas delivery ports  is very important to efficient use of carrier gas . Orientation of the gas delivery ports  is also important. Preferably, the gas delivery ports  are positioned to horizontally direct jets of the carrier gas  at the atomization cones . The aerosol generator  permits generation of the aerosol  with heavy loading with droplets of the carrier liquid , unlike aerosol generator designs that do not efficiently focus gas delivery to the locations of droplet formation.","Another important feature of the aerosol generator , as shown in , is the use of the separator , which protects the transducer discs  from direct contact with the liquid feed , which is often highly corrosive. The height of the separator  above the top of the transducer discs  should normally be kept as small as possible, and is often in the range of from about 1 centimeter to about 2 centimeters. The top of the liquid feed  in the flow channels above the tops of the ultrasonic transducer discs  is typically in a range of from about 2 centimeters to about 5 centimeters, whether or not the aerosol generator includes the separator , with a distance of about 3 to 4 centimeters being preferred. Although the aerosol generator  could be made without the separator , in which case the liquid feed  would be in direct contact with the transducer discs , the highly corrosive nature of the liquid feed  can often cause premature failure of the transducer discs . The use of the separator , in combination with use of the ultrasonically transmissive fluid in the water bath volume  to provide ultrasonic coupling, significantly extends the life of the ultrasonic transducers . One disadvantage of using the separator , however, is that the rate of droplet production from the atomization cones  is reduced, often by a factor of two or more, relative to designs in which the liquid feed  is in direct contact with the ultrasonic transducer discs . Even with the separator , however, the aerosol generator  used with the present invention is capable of producing a high quality aerosol with heavy droplet loading, as previously discussed. Suitable materials for the separator  include, for example, polyamides (such as Kapton\u2122 membranes from DuPont) and other polymer materials, glass, and plexiglass. The main requirements for the separator  are that it be ultrasonically transmissive, corrosion resistant and impermeable.","One alternative to using the separator  is to bind a corrosion-resistant protective coating onto the surface of the ultrasonic transducer discs , thereby preventing the liquid feed  from contacting the surface of the ultrasonic transducer discs . When the ultrasonic transducer discs  have a protective coating, the aerosol generator  will typically be constructed without the water bath volume  and the liquid feed  will flow directly over the ultrasonic transducer discs . Examples of such protective coating materials include platinum, gold, TEFLON\u2122, epoxies and various plastics. Such coating typically significantly extends transducer life. Also, when operating without the separator , the aerosol generator  will typically produce the aerosol  with a much higher droplet loading than when the separator  is used.","One surprising finding with operation of the aerosol generator  configured in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention is that the droplet loading in the aerosol may be affected by the temperature of the liquid feed . It has been found that when the liquid feed  includes an aqueous liquid at an elevated temperature, the droplet loading increases significantly. The temperature of the liquid feed  is preferably higher than about 30\u00b0 C., more preferably higher than about 35\u00b0 C. and most preferably higher than about 40\u00b0 C. If the temperature becomes too high, however, it can have a detrimental effect on droplet loading in the aerosol . Therefore, the temperature of the liquid feed  from which the aerosol  is made should generally be lower than about 50\u00b0 C., and preferably lower than about 45\u00b0 C. The liquid feed  may be maintained at the desired temperature in any suitable fashion. For example, the portion of the aerosol generator  where the liquid feed  is converted to the aerosol  could be maintained at a constant elevated temperature. Alternatively, the liquid feed  could be delivered to the aerosol generator  from a constant temperature bath maintained separate from the aerosol generator . When the ultrasonic generator  includes the separator , the ultrasonically transmissive fluid adjacent the ultrasonic transducer disks  are preferably also at an elevated temperature in the ranges just discussed for the liquid feed .","The design for the aerosol generator  based on an array of ultrasonic transducers is versatile and is easily modified to accommodate different generator sizes for different specialty applications. The aerosol generator  may be designed to include a plurality of ultrasonic transducers in any convenient number. Even for smaller scale production, however, the aerosol generator  preferably has at least nine ultrasonic transducers, more preferably at least 16 ultrasonic transducers, and even more preferably at least 25 ultrasonic transducers. For larger scale production, however, the aerosol generator  includes at least 40 ultrasonic transducers, more preferably at least 100 ultrasonic transducers, and even more preferably at least 400 ultrasonic transducers. In some large volume applications, the aerosol generator may have at least 1000 ultrasonic transducers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIGS. 7-24","FIGS. 7 and 8","FIG. 5"],"b":["106","124","124","172","156"]},"As shown in , four hundred transducer mounting receptacles  are provided in the transducer mounting plate  for mounting ultrasonic transducers for the desired array. With reference to , the profile of an individual transducer mounting receptacle  is shown. A mounting seat  accepts an ultrasonic transducer for mounting, with a mounted ultrasonic transducer being held in place via screw holes . Opposite the mounting receptacle  is a flared opening  through which an ultrasonic signal may be transmitted for the purpose of generating the aerosol , as previously described with reference to .","A preferred transducer mounting configuration, however, is shown in  for another configuration for the transducer mounting plate . As seen in , an ultrasonic transducer disc  is mounted to the transducer mounting plate  by use of a compression screw  threaded into a threaded receptacle . The compression screw  bears against the ultrasonic transducer disc , causing an o-ring , situated in an o-ring seat  on the transducer mounting plate, to be compressed to form a seal between the transducer mounting plate  and the ultrasonic transducer disc . This type of transducer mounting is particularly preferred when the ultrasonic transducer disc  includes a protective surface coating, as discussed previously, because the seal of the o-ring to the ultrasonic transducer disc  will be inside of the outer edge of the protective seal, thereby preventing liquid from penetrating under the protective surface coating from the edges of the ultrasonic transducer disc .","Referring now to , the bottom retaining plate  for a 400 transducer array is shown having a design for mating with the transducer mounting plate  (shown in ). The bottom retaining plate  has eighty openings , arranged in four subgroups  of twenty openings  each. Each of the openings  corresponds with five of the transducer mounting receptacles  (shown in ) when the bottom retaining plate  is mated with the transducer mounting plate  to create a volume for a water bath between the transducer mounting plate  and the bottom retaining plate . The openings , therefore, provide a pathway for ultrasonic signals generated by ultrasonic transducers to be transmitted through the bottom retaining plate.","Referring now to , a liquid feed box  for a 400 transducer array is shown having the top retaining plate  designed to fit over the bottom retaining plate  (shown in ), with a separator  (not shown) being retained between the bottom retaining plate  and the top retaining plate  when the aerosol generator  is assembled. The liquid feed box  also includes vertically extending walls  for containing the liquid feed  when the aerosol generator is in operation. Also shown in  is the feed inlet  and the feed outlet . An adjustable weir  determines the level of liquid feed  in the liquid feed box  during operation of the aerosol generator .","The top retaining plate  of the liquid feed box  has eighty openings  therethrough, which are arranged in four subgroups  of twenty openings  each. The openings  of the top retaining plate  correspond in size with the openings  of the bottom retaining plate  (shown in ). When the aerosol generator  is assembled, the openings  through the top retaining plate  and the openings  through the bottom retaining plate  are aligned, with the separator  positioned therebetween, to permit transmission of ultrasonic signals when the aerosol generator  is in operation.","Referring now to , a plurality of gas tube feed-through holes  extend through the vertically extending walls  to either side of the assembly including the feed inlet  and feed outlet  of the liquid feed box . The gas tube feed-through holes  are designed to permit insertion therethrough of gas tubes  of a design as shown in . When the aerosol generator  is assembled, a gas tube  is inserted through each of the gas tube feed-through holes  so that gas delivery ports  in the gas tube  will be properly positioned and aligned adjacent the openings  in the top retaining plate  for delivery of gas to atomization cones that develop in the liquid feed box  during operation of the aerosol generator . The gas delivery ports  are typically holes having a diameter of from about 1.5 millimeters to about 3.5 millimeters.","Referring now to , a partial view of the liquid feed box  is shown with gas tubes A, B and C positioned adjacent to the openings  through the top retaining plate . Also shown in  are the relative locations that ultrasonic transducer discs  would occupy when the aerosol generator  is assembled. As seen in , the gas tube A, which is at the edge of the array, has five gas delivery ports . Each of the gas delivery ports  is positioned to divert carrier gas  to a different one of atomization cones that develop over the array of ultrasonic transducer discs  when the aerosol generator  is operating. The gas tube B, which is one row in from the edge of the array, is a shorter tube that has ten gas delivery ports , five each on opposing sides of the gas tube B. The gas tube B, therefore, has gas delivery ports  for delivering gas to atomization cones corresponding with each of ten ultrasonic transducer discs . The third gas tube, C, is a longer tube that also has ten gas delivery ports  for delivering gas to atomization cones corresponding with ten ultrasonic transducer discs . The design shown in , therefore, includes one gas delivery port per ultrasonic transducer disc . Although this is a lower density of gas delivery ports  than for the embodiment of the aerosol generator  shown in , which includes two gas delivery ports per ultrasonic transducer disc , the design shown in  is, nevertheless, capable of producing a dense, high-quality aerosol without unnecessary waste of gas.","Referring now to , the flow of carrier gas  relative to atomization cones  during operation of the aerosol generator  having a gas distribution configuration to deliver carrier gas  from gas delivery ports on both sides of the gas tubes , as was shown for the gas tubes A, B and C in the gas distribution configuration shown in . The carrier gas  sweeps both directions from each of the gas tubes .","An alternative, and preferred, flow for carrier gas  is shown in . As shown in , carrier gas  is delivered from only one side of each of the gas tubes . This results in a sweep of carrier gas from all of the gas tubes  toward a central area . This results in a more uniform flow pattern for aerosol generation that may significantly enhance the efficiency with which the carrier gas  is used to produce an aerosol. The aerosol that is generated, therefore, tends to be more heavily loaded with liquid droplets.","Another configuration for distributing carrier gas in the aerosol generator  is shown in . In this configuration, the gas tubes  are hung from a gas distribution plate  adjacent gas flow holes  through the gas distribution plate . In the aerosol generator , the gas distribution plate  would be mounted above the liquid feed, with the gas flow holes positioned to each correspond with an underlying ultrasonic transducer. Referring specifically to , when the ultrasonic generator  is in operation, atomization cones  develop through the gas flow holes , and the gas tubes  are located such that carrier gas  exiting from ports in the gas tubes  impinges on the atomization cones and flow upward through the gas flow holes. The gas flow holes , therefore, act to assist in efficiently distributing the carrier gas  about the atomization cones  for aerosol formation. It should be appreciated that the gas distribution plates  can be made to accommodate any number of the gas tubes  and gas flow holes . For convenience of illustration, the embodiment shown in  shows a design having only two of the gas tubes  and only 16 of the gas flow holes . Also, it should be appreciated that the gas distribution plate  could be used alone, without the gas tubes . In that case, a slight positive pressure of carrier gas  would be maintained under the gas distribution plate  and the gas flow holes  would be sized to maintain the proper velocity of carrier gas  through the gas flow holes  for efficient aerosol generation. Because of the relative complexity of operating in that mode, however, it is not preferred.","Aerosol generation may also be enhanced through mounting of ultrasonic transducers at a slight angle and directing the carrier gas at resulting atomization cones such that the atomization cones are tilting in the same direction as the direction of flow of carrier gas. Referring to , an ultrasonic transducer disc  is shown. The ultrasonic transducer disc  is tilted at a tilt angle  (typically less than 10 degrees), so that the atomization cone  will also have a tilt. It is preferred that the direction of flow of the carrier gas  directed at the atomization cone  is in the same direction as the tilt of the atomization cone .","Referring now to , a gas manifold  is shown for distributing gas to the gas tubes  in a 400 transducer array design. The gas manifold  includes a gas distribution box  and piping stubs  for connection with gas tubes  (shown in ). Inside the gas distribution box  are two gas distribution plates  that form a flow path to assist in distributing the gas equally throughout the gas distribution box , to promote substantially equal delivery of gas through the piping stubs . The gas manifold , as shown in , is designed to feed eleven gas tubes . For the 400 transducer design, a total of four gas manifolds  are required.","Referring now to , the generator lid  is shown for a 400 transducer array design. The generator lid  mates with and covers the liquid feed box  (shown in ). The generator lid , as shown in , has a hood design to permit easy collection of the aerosol  without subjecting droplets in the aerosol  to sharp edges on which droplets may coalesce and be lost, and possibly interfere with the proper operation of the aerosol generator . When the aerosol generator  is in operation, the aerosol  would be withdrawn via the aerosol exit opening  through the generator cover .","The design and apparatus of the aerosol generator  described with reference to , as well as a facility including other process equipment described herein for carrying out the process according to an embodiment of the present invention for making powders are within the scope of the present invention.","Although the aerosol generator  produces a high quality aerosol  having a high droplet loading, it is often desirable to further concentrate the aerosol  prior to introduction into the furnace . Referring now to , a process flow diagram is shown for one embodiment of the present invention involving such concentration of the aerosol . As shown in , the aerosol  from the aerosol generator  is sent to an aerosol concentrator  where excess carrier gas  is withdrawn from the aerosol  to produce a concentrated aerosol , which is then fed to the furnace .","The aerosol concentrator  typically includes one or more virtual impactors capable of concentrating droplets in the aerosol  by a factor of greater than about 2, preferably by a factor of greater than about 5, and more preferably by a factor of greater than about 10, to produce the concentrated aerosol . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the concentrated aerosol  should typically contain greater than about 1\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter, and more preferably from about 5\u00d710to about 5\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter. A concentration of about 1\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter of the concentrated aerosol is particularly preferred, because when the concentrated aerosol  is loaded more heavily than that, then the frequency of collisions between droplets becomes large enough to impair the properties of the concentrated aerosol , resulting in potential contamination of the particulate product  with an undesirably large quantity of over-sized particles. For example, if the aerosol  has a concentration of about 1\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter, and the aerosol concentrator  concentrates droplets by a factor of 10, then the concentrated aerosol  will have a concentration of about 1\u00d710droplets per cubic centimeter. Stated another way, for example, when the aerosol generator generates the aerosol  with a droplet loading of about 0.167 milliliters liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas , the concentrated aerosol  would be loaded with about 1.67 milliliters of liquid feed  per liter of carrier gas , assuming the aerosol  is concentrated by a factor of 10.","Having a high droplet loading in aerosol feed to the furnace provides the important advantage of reducing the heating demand on the furnace  and the size of flow conduits required through the furnace. Also, other advantages of having a dense aerosol include a reduction in the demands on cooling and particle collection components, permitting significant equipment and operational savings. Furthermore, as system components are reduced in size, powder holdup within the system is reduced, which is also desirable. Concentration of the aerosol stream prior to entry into the furnace , therefore, provides a substantial advantage relative to processes that utilize less concentrated aerosol streams.","The excess carrier gas  that is removed in the aerosol concentrator  typically includes extremely small droplets that are also removed from the aerosol . Preferably, the droplets removed with the excess carrier gas  have a weight average size of smaller than about 1.5 microns, and more preferably smaller than about 1 micron and the droplets retained in the concentrated aerosol  have an average droplet size of larger than about 2 microns. For example, a virtual impactor sized to treat an aerosol stream having a weight average droplet size of about three microns might be designed to remove with the excess carrier gas  most droplets smaller than about 1.5 microns in size. Other designs are also possible. When using the aerosol generator  with the present invention, however, the loss of these very small droplets in the aerosol concentrator  will typically constitute no more than about 10 percent by weight, and more preferably no more than about 5 percent by weight, of the droplets originally in the aerosol stream that is fed to the concentrator . Although the aerosol concentrator  is useful in some situations, it is normally not required with the process of the present invention, because the aerosol generator  is capable, in most circumstances, of generating an aerosol stream that is sufficiently dense. So long as the aerosol stream coming out of the aerosol generator  is sufficiently dense, it is preferred that the aerosol concentrator not be used. It is a significant advantage of the present invention that the aerosol generator  normally generates such a dense aerosol stream that the aerosol concentrator  is not needed. Therefore, the complexity of operation of the aerosol concentrator  and accompanying liquid losses may typically be avoided.","It is important that the aerosol stream (whether it has been concentrated or not) that is fed to the furnace  have a high droplet flow rate and high droplet loading as would be required for most industrial applications. With some embodiments of the present invention, the aerosol stream fed to the furnace preferably includes a droplet flow of greater than about 0.5 liters per hour, more preferably greater than about 2 liters per hour, still more preferably greater than about 5 liters per hour, even more preferably greater than about 10 liters per hour, particularly greater than about 50 liters per hour and most preferably greater than about 100 liters per hour; and with the droplet loading being typically greater than about 0.04 milliliters of droplets per liter of carrier gas, preferably greater than about 0.083 milliliters of droplets per liter of carrier gas , more preferably greater than about 0.167 milliliters of droplets per liter of carrier gas , still more preferably greater than about 0.25 milliliters of droplets per liter of carrier gas , particularly greater than about 0.33 milliliters of droplets per liter of carrier gas  and most preferably greater than about 0.83 milliliters of droplets per liter of carrier gas .","One embodiment of a virtual impactor that could be used as the aerosol concentrator  will now be described with reference to . A virtual impactor  includes an upstream plate assembly  (details shown in ) and a downstream plate assembly  (details shown in ), with a concentrating chamber  located between the upstream plate assembly  and the downstream plate assembly .","Through the upstream plate assembly  are a plurality of vertically extending inlet slits . The downstream plate assembly  includes a plurality of vertically extending exit slits  that are in alignment with the inlet slits . The exit slits  are, however, slightly wider than the inlet slits . The downstream plate assembly  also includes flow channels  that extend substantially across the width of the entire downstream plate assembly , with each flow channel  being adjacent to an excess gas withdrawal port .","During operation, the aerosol  passes through the inlet slits  and into the concentrating chamber . Excess carrier gas  is withdrawn from the concentrating chamber  via the excess gas withdrawal ports . The withdrawn excess carrier gas  then exits via a gas duct port . That portion of the aerosol  that is not withdrawn through the excess gas withdrawal ports  passes through the exit slits  and the flow channels  to form the concentrated aerosol . Those droplets passing across the concentrating chamber  and through the exit slits  are those droplets of a large enough size to have sufficient momentum to resist being withdrawn with the excess carrier gas .","As seen best in , the inlet slits  of the upstream plate assembly  include inlet nozzle extension portions  that extend outward from the plate surface  of the upstream plate assembly . The exit slits  of the downstream plate assembly  include exit nozzle extension portions  extending outward from a plate surface  of the downstream plate assembly . These nozzle extension portions  and  are important for operation of the virtual impactor , because having these nozzle extension portions  and  permits a very close spacing to be attained between the inlet slits  and the exit slits  across the concentrating chamber , while also providing a relatively large space in the concentrating chamber  to facilitate efficient removal of the excess carrier gas .","Also as best seen in , the inlet slits  have widths that flare outward toward the side of the upstream plate assembly  that is first encountered by the aerosol  during operation. This flared configuration reduces the sharpness of surfaces encountered by the aerosol , reducing the loss of aerosol droplets and potential interference from liquid buildup that could occur if sharp surfaces were present. Likewise, the exit slits  have a width that flares outward towards the flow channels , thereby allowing the concentrated aerosol  to expand into the flow channels  without encountering sharp edges that could cause problems.","As noted previously, both the inlet slits  of the upstream plate assembly  and the exit slits  of the downstream plate assembly  are vertically extending. This configuration is advantageous for permitting liquid that may collect around the inlet slits  and the exit slits  to drain away. The inlet slits  and the exit slits  need not, however, have a perfectly vertical orientation. Rather, it is often desirable to slant the slits backward (sloping upward and away in the direction of flow) by about five to ten degrees relative to vertical, to enhance draining of liquid off of the upstream plate assembly  and the downstream plate assembly . This drainage function of the vertically extending configuration of the inlet slits  and the outlet slits  also inhibits liquid build-up in the vicinity of the inlet slits  and the e it slits , which liquid build-up could result in the release of undesirably large droplets into the concentrated aerosol .","As discussed previously, the aerosol generator  in some embodiments of the present invention produces a concentrated, high quality aerosol of micro-sized droplets having a relatively narrow size distribution. It has been found, however, that for many applications the process of the present invention in some embodiments is significantly enhanced by further classifying by size the droplets in the aerosol  prior to introduction of the droplets into the furnace . In this manner, the size and size distribution of particles in the particulate product  are further controlled.","Referring now to , a process flow diagram is shown for one embodiment of the process of the present invention including such droplet classification. As shown in , the aerosol  from the aerosol generator  goes to a droplet classifier  where oversized droplets are removed from the aerosol  to prepare a classified aerosol . Liquid  from the oversized droplets that are being removed is drained from the droplet classifier . This drained liquid  may advantageously be recycled for use in preparing additional liquid feed .","Any suitable droplet classifier may be used for removing droplets above a predetermined size. For example, a cyclone could be used to remove over-size droplets. A preferred droplet classifier for many applications, however, is an impactor. One embodiment of an impactor for use with some embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to .","As seen in , an impactor  has disposed in a flow conduit  a flow control plate  and an impactor plate assembly . The flow control plate  is conveniently mounted on a mounting plate .","The flow control plate  is used to channel the flow of the aerosol stream toward the impactor plate assembly  in a manner with controlled flow characteristics that are desirable for proper impaction of oversize droplets on the impactor plate assembly  for removal through the drains  and . One embodiment of the flow control plate  is shown in . The flow control plate  has an array of circular flow ports  for channeling flow of the aerosol  towards the impactor plate assembly  with the desired flow characteristics.","Details of the mounting plate  are shown in . The mounting plate  has a mounting flange  with a large diameter flow opening  passing therethrough to permit access of the aerosol  to the flow ports  of the flow control plate  (shown in ).","Referring now to , one embodiment of an impactor plate assembly  is shown. The impactor plate assembly  includes an impactor plate  and mounting brackets  and  used to mount the impactor plate  inside of the flow conduit . The impactor plate  and the flow channel plate  are designed so that droplets larger than a predetermined size will have momentum that is too large for those particles to change flow direction to navigate around the impactor plate .","During operation of the impactor , the aerosol  from the aerosol generator  passes through the upstream flow control plate . Most of the droplets in the aerosol navigate around the impactor plate  and exit the impactor  through the downstream flow control plate  in the classified aerosol . Droplets in the aerosol  that are too large to navigate around the impactor plate  will impact on the impactor plate  and drain through the drain  to be collected with the drained liquid  (as shown in ).","The configuration of the impactor plate  shown in  represents only one of many possible configurations for the impactor plate . For example, the impactor  could include an upstream flow control plate  having vertically extending flow slits therethrough that are offset from vertically extending flow slits through the impactor plate , such that droplets too large to navigate the change in flow due to the offset of the flow slits between the flow control plate  and the impactor plate  would impact on the impactor plate  to be drained away. Other designs are also possible.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the droplet classifier  is typically designed to remove droplets from the aerosol  that are larger than about 15 microns in size, more preferably to remove droplets larger than about 10 microns in size, even more preferably to remove droplets of a size larger than about 8 microns in size and most preferably to remove droplets larger than about 5 microns in size. The droplet classification size in the droplet classifier is preferably smaller than about 15 microns, more preferably smaller than about 10 microns, even more preferably smaller than about 8 microns and most preferably smaller than about 5 microns. The classification size, also called the classification cut point, is that size at which half of the droplets of that size are removed and half of the droplets of that size are retained. Depending upon the specific application, however, the droplet classification size may be varied, such as by changing the spacing between the impactor plate  and the flow control plate  or increasing or decreasing aerosol velocity through the jets in the flow control plate . Because the aerosol generator  of some embodiments of the present invention initially produces a high quality aerosol , having a relatively narrow size distribution of droplets, typically less than about 30 weight percent of liquid feed  in the aerosol  is removed as the drain liquid  in the droplet classifier , with preferably less than about 25 weight percent being removed, even more preferably less than about 20 weight percent being removed and most preferably less than about 15 weight percent being removed. Minimizing the removal of liquid feed  from the aerosol  is particularly important for commercial applications to increase the yield of high quality particulate product . It should be noted, however, that because of the superior performance of the aerosol generator , it is frequently not required to use an impactor or other droplet classifier to obtain a desired absence of oversize droplets to the furnace. This is a major advantage, because the added complexity and liquid losses accompanying use of an impactor may often be avoided with the process of the present invention.","Sometimes it is desirable to use both the aerosol concentrator  and the droplet classifier  to produce an extremely high quality aerosol stream for introduction into the furnace for the production of particles of highly controlled size and size distribution. Referring now to , one embodiment of the present invention is shown incorporating both the virtual impactor  and the impactor . Basic components of the virtual impactor  and the impactor , as shown in , are substantially as previously described with reference to . As seen in , the aerosol  from the aerosol generator  is fed to the virtual impactor  where the aerosol stream is concentrated to produce the concentrated aerosol . The concentrated aerosol  is then fed to the impactor  to remove large droplets therefrom and produce the classified aerosol , which may then be fed to the furnace . Also, it should be noted that by using both a virtual impactor and an impactor, both undesirably large and undesirably small droplets are removed, thereby producing a classified aerosol with a very narrow droplet size distribution. Also, the order of the aerosol concentrator and the aerosol classifier could be reversed, so that the aerosol concentrator  follows the aerosol classifier .","One important feature of the design shown in  is the incorporation of drains , , ,  and  at strategic locations. These drains are extremely important for industrial-scale particle production because buildup of liquid in the process equipment can significantly impair the quality of the particulate product  that is produced. In that regard, drain  drains liquid away from the inlet side of the first plate assembly  of the virtual impactor . Drain  drains liquid away from the inside of the concentrating chamber  in the virtual impactor  and drain  removes liquid that deposits out of the excess carrier gas . Drain  removes liquid from the vicinity of the inlet side of the flow control plate  of the impactor, while the drain  removes liquid from the vicinity of the impactor plate . Without these drains , , ,  and , the performance of the apparatus shown in  would be significantly impaired. All liquids drained in the drains , , ,  and  may advantageously be recycled for use to prepare the liquid feed .","With some applications, it may be possible to collect the particles  directly from the output of the furnace . More often, however, it will be desirable to cool the particles  exiting the furnace  prior to collection of the particles  in the particle collector . Referring now to , one embodiment of the process of the present invention is shown in which the particles  exiting the furnace  are sent to a particle cooler  to produce a cooled particle stream , which is then feed to the particle collector . Although the particle cooler  may be any cooling apparatus capable of cooling the particles  to the desired temperature for introduction into the particle collector , traditional heat exchanger designs are not preferred. This is because a traditional heat exchanger design ordinarily directly subjects the aerosol stream, in which the hot particles  are suspended, to cool surfaces. In that situation, significant losses of the particles  occur due to thermophoretic deposition of the hot particles  on the cool surfaces of the heat exchanger. According to one example embodiment of the present invention, a gas quench apparatus is provided for use as the particle cooler  that significantly reduces thermophoretic losses compared to a traditional heat exchanger.","Referring now to , one embodiment of a gas quench cooler  is shown. The gas quench cooler includes a perforated conduit  housed inside of a cooler housing  with an annular space  located between the cooler housing  and the perforated conduit . In fluid communication with the annular space  is a quench gas inlet box , inside of which is disposed a portion of an aerosol outlet conduit . The perforated conduit  extends between the aerosol outlet conduit  and an aerosol inlet conduit . Attached to an opening into the quench gas inlet box  are two quench gas feed tubes . Referring specifically to , the perforated tube  is shown. The perforated tube  has a plurality of openings . The openings , when the perforated conduit  is assembled into the gas quench cooler , permit the flow of quench gas  from the annular space  into the interior space  of the perforated conduit . Although the openings  are shown as being round holes, any shape of opening could be used, such as slits. Also, the perforated conduit  could be a porous screen. Two heat radiation shields  prevent downstream radiant heating from the furnace. In most instances, however, it will not be necessary to include the heat radiation shields , because downstream radiant heating from the furnace is normally not a significant problem. Use of the heat radiation shields  is not preferred due to particulate losses that accompany their use.","With continued reference to , operation of the gas quench cooler  will now be described. During operation, the particles , carried by and dispersed in a gas stream, enter the gas quench cooler  through the aerosol inlet conduit  and flow into the interior space  of perforated conduit . Quench gas  is introduced through the quench gas feed tubes  into the quench gas inlet box . Quench gas  entering the quench gas inlet box  encounters the outer surface of the aerosol outlet conduit , forcing the quench gas  to flow, in a spiraling, swirling manner, into the annular space , where the quench gas  flows through the openings  through the walls of the perforated conduit . Preferably, the gas  retains some swirling motion even after passing into the interior space . In this way, the particles  are quickly cooled with low losses of particles to the walls of the gas quench cooler . In this manner, the quench gas  enters in a radial direction into the interior space  of the perforated conduit  around the entire periphery, or circumference, of the perforated conduit  and over the entire length of the perforated conduit . The cool quench gas  mixes with and cools the hot particles , which then exit through the aerosol outlet conduit  as the cooled particle stream . The cooled particle stream  can then be sent to the particle collector  for particle collection. The temperature of the cooled particle stream  is controlled by introducing more or less quench gas. Also, as shown in , the quench gas  is fed into the quench cooler  in counter flow to flow of the particles. Alternatively, the quench cooler could be designed so that the quench gas  is fed into the quench cooler in concurrent flow with the flow of the particles . The amount of quench gas  fed to the gas quench cooler  will depend upon the specific material being made and the specific operating conditions. The quantity of quench gas  used, however, must be sufficient to reduce the temperature of the aerosol steam including the particles  to the desired temperature. Typically, the particles  are cooled to a temperature at least below about 200\u00b0 C., and often lower. The only limitation on how much the particles  are cooled is that the cooled particle stream  must be at a temperature that is above the condensation temperature for water as another condensable vapor in the stream. The temperature of the cooled particle stream  is often at a temperature of from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 120\u00b0 C.","Because of the entry of quench gas  into the interior space  of the perforated conduit  in a radial direction about the entire circumference and length of the perforated conduit , a buffer of the cool quench gas  is formed about the inner wall of the perforated conduit , thereby significantly inhibiting the loss of hot particles  due to thermophoretic deposition on the cool wall of the perforated conduit . In operation, the quench gas  exiting the openings  and entering into the interior space  should have a radial velocity (velocity inward toward the center of the circular cross-section of the perforated conduit ) of larger than the thermophoretic velocity of the particles  inside the perforated conduit  in a direction radially outward toward the perforated wall of the perforated conduit .","As seen in , the gas quench cooler  includes a flow path for the particles  through the gas quench cooler of a substantially constant cross-sectional shape and area. Preferably, the flow path through the gas quench cooler  will have the same cross-sectional shape and area as the flow path through the furnace  and through the conduit delivering the aerosol  from the aerosol generator  to the furnace . In one embodiment, however, it may be necessary to reduce the cross-sectional area available for flow prior to the particle collector . This is the case, for example, when the particle collector includes a cyclone for separating particles in the cooled particle stream  from gas in the cooled particle stream . This is because of the high inlet velocity requirements into cyclone separators.","Referring now to , one embodiment of the gas quench cooler  is shown in combination with a cyclone separator . The perforated conduit  has a continuously decreasing cross-sectional area for flow to increase the velocity of flow to the proper value for the feed to cyclone separator . Attached to the cyclone separator  is a bag filter  for final clean-up of overflow from the cyclone separator . Separated particles exit with underflow from the cyclone separator  and may be collected in any convenient container. The use of cyclone separation is particularly preferred for powder having a weight average size of larger than about 1 micron, although a series of cyclones may sometimes be needed to get the desired degree of separation. Cyclone separation is particularly preferred for powders having a weight average size of larger than about 1.5 microns. Also, cyclone separation is best suited for high density materials. Preferably, when particles are separated using a cyclone, the particles are of a composition with specific gravity of greater than about 5.","In an additional embodiment, the process of the present invention can also incorporate compositional modification of the particles  exiting the furnace. Most commonly, the compositional modification will involve forming on the particles  a material phase that is different than that of the particles , such as by coating the particles  with a coating material. One embodiment of the process of the present invention incorporating particle coating is shown in . As shown in , the particles  exiting from the furnace  go to a particle coater  where a coating is placed over the outer surface of the particles  to form coated particles , which are then sent to the particle collector  for preparation of the particulate product .","In the particle coater , the particles  are coated using any suitable particle coating technology, such as by gas-to-particle conversion. Preferably, however, the coating is accomplished by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and\/or physical vapor deposition (PVD). In CVD coating, one or more vapor phase coating precursors are reacted to form a surface coating on the particles . Preferred coatings deposited by CVD include oxides, such as silica, and elemental metals. In PVD coating, coating material physically deposits on the surface of the particles . Preferred coatings deposited by PVD include organic materials and elemental metals, such as elemental silver, copper and gold. Another possible surface coating method is surface conversion of the surface portion of the particles  by reaction with a vapor phase reactant to convert a surface portion of the particles to a different material than that originally contained in the particles . Although any suitable apparatus may be used for the particle coater , when a gaseous coating feed involving coating precursors is used, such as for CVD and PVD, feed of the gaseous coating feed is introduced through a circumferentially perforated conduit, such as was described for the quench cooler  with reference to . In some instances, the quench cooler  may also act as the particle coater , when coating material precursors are included in the quench gas .","With continued reference primarily to , in a preferred embodiment, when the particles  are coated according to the process of the present invention, the particles  are also manufactured via the aerosol process of the present invention, as previously described. The process of some embodiments the present invention can, however, be used to coat particles that have been premanufactured by a different process, such as by a liquid precipitation route. When coating particles that have been premanufactured by a different route, such as by liquid precipitation, it is preferred that the particles remain in a dispersed state from the time of manufacture to the time that the particles are introduced in slurry form into the aerosol generator  for preparation of the aerosol  to form the dry particles  in the furnace , which particles  can then be coated in the particle coater . Maintaining particles in a dispersed state from manufacture through coating avoids problems associated with agglomeration and redispersion of particles if particles must be redispersed in the liquid feed  for feed to the aerosol generator . For example, for particles originally precipitated from a liquid medium, the liquid medium containing the suspended precipitated particles could be used to form the liquid feed  to the aerosol generator . It should be noted that the particle coater  could be an integral extension of the furnace  or could be a separate piece of equipment.","In a further embodiment of the present invention, following preparation of the particles  in the furnace , the particles  may then be structurally modified to impart desired physical properties prior to particle collection. Referring now to , one embodiment of the process of the present invention is shown including such structural particle modification. The particles  exiting the furnace  go to a particle modifier  where the particles are structurally modified to form modified particles , which are then sent to the particle collector  for preparation of the particulate product . The particle modifier  is typically a furnace, such as an annealing furnace, which may be integral with the furnace  or may be a separate heating device. Regardless, it is important that the particle modifier  have temperature control that is independent of the furnace , so that the proper conditions for particle modification may be provided separate from conditions required of the furnace  to prepare the particles . The particle modifier , therefore, typically provides a temperature controlled environment and necessary residence time to effect the desired structural modification of the particles .","The structural modification that occurs in the particle modifier  may be any modification to the crystalline structure or morphology of the particles . For example, the particles  may be annealed in the particle modifier  to densify the particles  or to recrystallize the particles  into a polycrystalline or single crystalline form. Also, especially in the case of composite particles , the particles may be annealed for a sufficient time to permit redistribution within the particles  of different material phases.","The initial morphology of composite particles made in the furnace , according to some embodiments of the present invention, could take a variety of forms, depending upon the specified materials involved and the specific processing conditions. Examples of some possible composite particle morphologies, manufacturable according to some embodiments of the present invention are shown in . These morphologies could be of the particles as initially produced in the furnace  or that result from structural modification in the particle modifier . Furthermore, the composite particles could include a mixture of the morphological attributes shown in .","Referring now to , an embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention is shown that includes the aerosol generator  (in the form of the 400 transducer array design), the aerosol concentrator  (in the form of a virtual impactor), the droplet classifier  (in the form of an impactor), the furnace , the particle cooler  (in the form of a gas quench cooler) and the particle collector  (in the form of a bag filter). All process equipment components are connected via appropriate flow conduits that are substantially free of sharp edges that could detrimentally cause liquid accumulations in the apparatus. Also, it should be noted that flex connectors  are used upstream and downstream of the aerosol concentrator  and the droplet classifier . By using the flex connectors , it is possible to vary the angle of slant of vertically extending slits in the aerosol concentrator  and\/or the droplet classifier . In this way, a desired slant for the vertically extending slits may be set to optimize the draining characteristics off the vertically extending slits.","Aerosol generation with the process of an embodiment of the present invention has thus far been described with respect to the ultrasonic aerosol generator. Use of the ultrasonic generator is preferred for the process because of the extremely high quality and dense aerosol generated. In other embodiments, however, the aerosol generator for the process may have a different design depending upon the specific application. For example, when larger particles are desired, such as those having a weight average size of larger than about 3 microns, a spray nozzle atomizer may be preferred. For smaller-particle applications, however, and particularly for those applications to produce particles smaller than about 3 microns, and preferably smaller than about 2 microns in size, as is generally desired with the particles of the present invention, the ultrasonic generator, as described herein, is particularly preferred. In that regard, the ultrasonic generator of the present invention is particularly preferred for when making particles with a weight average size of from about 0.2 micron to about 3 microns.","Although ultrasonic aerosol generators have been used for medical applications and home humidifiers, use of ultrasonic generators for spray pyrolysis particle manufacture has largely been confined to small-scale, experimental situations. The ultrasonic aerosol generator of the present invention described with reference to , however, is well suited for commercial production of high quality powders with a small average size and a narrow size distribution. In that regard, the aerosol generator produces a high quality aerosol, with heavy droplet loading and at a high rate of production. Such a combination of small droplet size, narrow size distribution, heavy droplet loading, and high production rate provide significant advantages over existing aerosol generators that usually suffer from at least one of inadequately narrow size distribution, undesirably low droplet loading, or unacceptably low production rate.","Through the careful and controlled design of the ultrasonic generator of the present invention, an aerosol may be produced typically having greater than about 70 weight percent (and preferably greater than about 80 weight percent) of droplets in the size range of from about 1 micron to about 10 microns, preferably in a size range of from about 1 micron to about 5 microns and more preferably from about 2 microns to about 4 microns. Also, the ultrasonic generator of the present invention is capable of delivering high output rates of liquid feed in the aerosol. The rate of liquid feed, at the high liquid loadings previously described, is preferably greater than about 25 milliliters per hour per transducer, more preferably greater than about 37.5 milliliters per hour per transducer, even more preferably greater than about 50 milliliters per hour per transducer and most preferably greater than about 100 millimeters per hour per transducer. This high level of performance is desirable for commercial operations and is accomplished with some embodiments of the present invention with a relatively simple design including a single precursor bath over an array of ultrasonic transducers. The ultrasonic generator is made for high aerosol production rates at a high droplet loading, and with a narrow size distribution of droplets. The generator preferably produces an aerosol at a rate of greater than about 0.5 liter per hour of droplets, more preferably greater than about 2 liters per hour of droplets, still more preferably greater than about 5 liters per hour of droplets, even more preferably greater than about 10 liters per hour of droplets and most preferably greater than about 40 liters per hour of droplets. For example, when the aerosol generator has a 400 transducer design, as described with reference to , the aerosol generator is capable of producing a high quality aerosol having high droplet loading as previously described, at a total production rate of preferably greater than about 10 liters per hour of liquid feed, more preferably greater than about 15 liters per hour of liquid feed, even more preferably greater than about 20 liters per hour of liquid feed and most preferably greater than about 40 liters per hour of liquid feed.","Under most operating conditions, when using such an aerosol generator, total particulate product produced is preferably greater than about 0.5 gram per hour per transducer, more preferably greater than about 0.75 gram per hour per transducer, even more preferably greater than about 1.0 gram per hour per transducer and most preferably greater than about 2.0 grams per hour per transducer.","The concentrations of soluble precursors in the liquid feed  will vary depending upon the particular materials involved and the particular particle composition and particle morphology desired. For most applications, when soluble precursor(s) are used, the soluble precursor(s) are present at a concentration of from about 1-50 weight percent of the liquid feed. . In any event, however, when soluble precursors are used, the precursors should be at a low enough concentration to permit the liquid feed to be ultrasonically atomized and to prevent premature precipitation of materials from the liquid feed . The concentration of suspended particulate precursors will also vary depending upon the particular materials involved in the particular application.","One significant aspect of the process configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for manufacturing particulate materials is the unique flow characteristics encountered in the furnace relative to laboratory scale systems. The maximum Reynolds number attained for flow in the furnace  with the present invention is very high, typically in excess of 500, preferably in excess of 1,000 and more preferably in excess of 2,000. In most instances, however, the maximum Reynolds number for flow in the furnace will not exceed 10,000, and preferably will not exceed 5,000. This is significantly different from lab-scale systems where the Reynolds number for flow in a reactor is typically lower than 50 and rarely exceeds 100.","The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity characterizing flow of a fluid which, for flow through a circular cross sectional conduit is defined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"Re","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03c1","vd"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"\u03bc"}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"where: \u03c1=fluid density;\n        \n        "}}}},"One problem with operating under flow conditions at a high Reynolds number is that undesirable volatilization of components is much more likely to occur than in systems having flow characteristics as found in laboratory-scale systems. The volatilization problem occurs with the present invention, because the furnace is typically operated over a substantial section of the heating zone in a constant wall heat flux mode, due to limitations in heat transfer capability. This is significantly different than operation of a furnace at a laboratory scale, which typically involves operation of most of the heating zone of the furnace in a uniform wall temperature mode, because the heating load is sufficiently small that the system is not heat transfer limited.","With some embodiments of the present invention, it is typically preferred to heat the aerosol stream in the heating zone of the furnace as quickly as possible to the desired temperature range for particle manufacture. Because of flow characteristics in the furnace and heat transfer limitations, during rapid heating of the aerosol the wall temperature of the furnace can significantly exceed the maximum average target temperature for the stream. This is a problem because, even though the average stream temperature may be within the range desired, the wall temperature may become so hot that components in the vicinity of the wall are subjected to temperatures high enough to undesirably volatilize the components. This volatilization near the wall of the furnace can cause formation of significant quantities of ultrafine particles that are outside of the size range desired.","Therefore, with some embodiments of the present invention, it is preferred that when the flow characteristics in the furnace are such that the Reynolds number through any part of the furnace exceeds 500, more preferably exceeds 1,000, and most preferably exceeds 2,000, the maximum wall temperature in the furnace should be kept at a temperature that is below the temperature at which a desired component of the final particles would exert a vapor pressure not exceeding about 200 millitorr, more preferably not exceeding about 100 millitorr, and most preferably not exceeding about 50 millitorr. Furthermore, the maximum wall temperature in the furnace should also be kept below a temperature at which an intermediate component, from which a final component is to be at least partially derived, should also have a vapor pressure not exceeding the magnitudes noted for components of the final product.","In addition to maintaining the furnace wall temperature below a level that could create volatilization problems, it is also important that this not be accomplished at the expense of the desired average stream temperature. The maximum average stream temperature must be maintained at a high enough level so that the particles will have a desired high density. The maximum average stream temperature should, however, generally be a temperature at which a component in the final particles, or an intermediate component from which a component in the final particles is at least partially derived, would exert a vapor pressure not exceeding about 100 millitorr, preferably not exceeding about 50 millitorr, and most preferably not exceeding about 25 millitorr.","So long as the maximum wall temperature and the average stream temperature are kept below the point at which detrimental volatilization occurs, it is generally desirable to heat the stream as fast as possible and to remove resulting particles from the furnace immediately after the maximum average stream temperature is reached in the furnace. With some embodiments of the present invention, the average residence time in the heating zone of the furnace may typically be maintained at shorter than about 4 seconds, preferably shorter than about 2 seconds, more preferably shorter than about 1 second, still more preferably shorter than about 0.5 second, and most preferably shorter than about 0.2 second.","Another significant issue with respect to operating a process configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, which includes high aerosol flow rates, is loss within the system of materials intended for incorporation into the final particulate product. Material losses in the system can be quite high if the system is not properly operated. If system losses are too high, the process would not be practical for use in the manufacture of particulate products of many materials. This has typically not been a major consideration with laboratory-scale systems.","One significant potential for loss with the process of some embodiments of the present invention is thermophoretic losses that occur when a hot aerosol stream is in the presence of a cooler surface. In that regard, the use of the quench cooler, as previously described, with the process provides an efficient way to cool the particles without unreasonably high thermophoretic losses. There is also, however, significant potential for losses occurring near the end of the furnace and between the furnace and the cooling unit.","It has been found that thermophoretic losses in the back end of the furnace can be significantly controlled if the heating zone of the furnace is operated such that the maximum average stream temperature is not attained until near the end of the heating zone in the furnace, and at least not until the last third of the heating zone. When the heating zone includes a plurality of heating sections, the maximum average stream temperature should ordinarily not occur until at least the last heating section. Furthermore, the heating zone should typically extend to as close to the exit of the furnace as possible. This is counter to conventional thought which is to typically maintain the exit portion of the furnace at a low temperature to avoid having to seal the furnace outlet at a high temperature. Such cooling of the exit portion of the furnace, however, significantly promotes thermophoretic losses. Furthermore, the potential for operating problems that could result in thermophoretic losses at the back end of the furnace are reduced with the very short residence times in the furnace for the present invention, as discussed previously.","Typically, it would be desirable to instantaneously cool the aerosol upon exiting the furnace. This is not possible. It is possible, however, to make the residence time between the furnace outlet and the cooling unit as short as possible. Furthermore, it is desirable to insulate the aerosol conduit occurring between the furnace exit and the cooling unit entrance. Even more preferred is to insulate that conduit and, even more preferably, to also heat that conduit so that the wall temperature of that conduit is at least as high as the average stream temperature of the aerosol stream. Furthermore, it is desirable that the cooling unit operate in a manner such that the aerosol is quickly cooled in a manner to prevent thermophoretic losses during cooling. The quench cooler, described previously, is very effective for cooling with low losses. Furthermore, to keep the potential for thermophoretic losses very low, it is preferred that the residence time of the aerosol stream between attaining the maximum average stream temperature in the furnace and a point at which the aerosol has been cooled to an average stream temperature below about 200\u00b0 C. is shorter than about 2 seconds, more preferably shorter than about 1 second, and even more preferably shorter than about 0.5 second and most preferably shorter than about 0.1 second. In most instances, the maximum average stream temperature attained in the furnace will be greater than about 800\u00b0 C. Furthermore, the total residence time from the beginning of the heating zone in the furnace to a point at which the average stream temperature is at a temperature below about 200\u00b0 C. should typically be shorter than about 5 seconds, preferably shorter than about 3 seconds, more preferably shorter than about 2 seconds, and most preferably shorter than about 1 second.","Another part of the process with significant potential for thermophoretic losses is after particle cooling until the particles are finally collected. Proper particle collection is very important to reducing losses within the system. The potential for thermophoretic losses is significant following particle cooling because the aerosol stream is still at an elevated temperature to prevent detrimental condensation of water in the aerosol stream. Therefore, cooler surfaces of particle collection equipment can result in significant thermophoretic losses.","To reduce the potential for thermophoretic losses before the particles are finally collected, it is important that the transition between the cooling unit and particle collection be as short as possible. Preferably, the output from the quench cooler is immediately sent to a particle separator, such as a filter unit or a cyclone. In that regard, the total residence time of the aerosol between attaining the maximum average stream temperature in the furnace and the final collection of the particles is preferably shorter than about 2 seconds, more preferably shorter than about 1 second, still more preferably shorter than about 0.5 second and most preferably shorter than about 0.1 second. Furthermore, the residence time between the beginning of the heating zone in the furnace and final collection of the particles is preferably shorter than about 6 seconds, more preferably shorter than about 3 seconds, even more preferably shorter than about 2 seconds, and most preferably shorter than about 1 second. Furthermore, the potential for thermophoretic losses may further be reduced by insulating the conduit section between the cooling unit and the particle collector and, even more preferably, by also insulating around the filter, when a filter is used for particle collection. The potential for losses may be reduced even further by heating of the conduit section between the cooling unit and the particle collection equipment, so that the internal equipment surfaces are at least slightly warmer than the aerosol stream average stream temperature. Furthermore, when a filter is used for particle collection, the filter could be heated. For example, insulation could be wrapped around a filter unit, with electric heating inside of the insulating layer to maintain the walls of the filter unit at a desired elevated temperature higher than the temperature of filter elements in the filter unit, thereby reducing thermophoretic particle losses to walls of the filter unit.","Even with careful operation to reduce thermophoretic losses, some losses will still occur. For example, some particles will inevitably be lost to walls of particle collection equipment, such as the walls of a cyclone or filter housing. One way to reduce these losses, and correspondingly increase product yield, is to periodically wash the interior of the particle collection equipment to remove particles adhering to the sides. In most cases, the wash fluid will be water, unless water would have a detrimental effect on one of the components of the particles. For example, the particle collection equipment could include parallel collection paths. One path could be used for active particle collection while the other is being washed. The wash could include an automatic or manual flush without disconnecting the equipment. Alternatively, the equipment to be washed could be disconnected to permit access to the interior of the equipment for a thorough wash. As an alternative to having parallel collection paths, the process could simply be shut down occasionally to permit disconnection of the equipment for washing. The removed equipment could be replaced with a clean piece of equipment and the process could then be resumed while the disconnected equipment is being washed.","For example, a cyclone or filter unit could periodically be disconnected and particles adhering to interior walls could be removed by a water wash. The particles could then be dried in a low temperature dryer, typically at a temperature of lower than about 50\u00b0 C.","In one embodiment, wash fluid used to wash particles from the interior walls of particle collection equipment includes a surfactant. Some of the surfactant will adhere to the surface of the particles. This could be advantageous to reduce agglomeration tendency of the particles and to enhance dispersibility of the particles in a thick film past formulation. The surfactant could be selected for compatibility with the specific paste formulation anticipated.","Another area for potential losses in the system, and for the occurrence of potential operating problems, is between the outlet of the aerosol generator and the inlet of the furnace. Losses here are not due to thermophoresis, but rather to liquid coming out of the aerosol and impinging and collecting on conduit and equipment surfaces. Although this loss is undesirable from a material yield standpoint, the loss may be even more detrimental to other aspects of the process. For example, water collecting on surfaces may release large droplets that can lead to large particles that detrimentally contaminate the particulate product. Furthermore, if accumulated liquid reaches the furnace, the liquid can cause excessive temperature gradients within the furnace tube, which can cause furnace tube failure, especially for ceramic tubes. One way to reduce the potential for undesirable liquid buildup in the system is to provide adequate drains, as previously described. In that regard, it is preferred that a drain be placed as close as possible to the furnace inlet to prevent liquid accumulations from reaching the furnace. The drain should be placed, however, far enough in advance of the furnace inlet such that the stream temperature is lower than about 80\u00b0 C. at the drain location.","Another way to reduce the potential for undesirable liquid buildup is for the conduit between the aerosol generator outlet and the furnace inlet to be of a substantially constant cross sectional area and configuration. Preferably, the conduit beginning with the aerosol generator outlet, passing through the furnace and continuing to at least the cooling unit inlet is of a substantially constant cross sectional area and geometry.","Another way to reduce the potential for undesirable buildup is to heat at least a portion, and preferably the entire length, of the conduit between the aerosol generator and the inlet to the furnace. For example, the conduit could be wrapped with a heating tape to maintain the inside walls of the conduit at a temperature higher than the temperature of the aerosol. The aerosol would then tend to concentrate toward the center of the conduit due to thermophoresis. Fewer aerosol droplets would, therefore, be likely to impinge on conduit walls or other surfaces making the transition to the furnace.","Another way to reduce the potential for undesirable liquid buildup is to introduce a dry gas into the aerosol between the aerosol generator and the furnace. Referring now to , one embodiment of the process is shown for adding a dry gas  to the aerosol  before the furnace . Addition of the dry gas  causes vaporization of at least a part of the moisture in the aerosol , and preferably substantially all of the moisture in the aerosol , to form a dried aerosol , which is then introduced into the furnace .","The dry gas  will most often be dry air, although in some instances it may be desirable to use dry nitrogen gas or some other dry gas. If a sufficient quantity of the dry gas  is used, the droplets of the aerosol  are substantially completely dried to beneficially form dried precursor particles in aerosol form for introduction into the furnace , where the precursor particles are then pyrolyzed to make a desired particulate product. Also, the use of the dry gas  typically will reduce the potential for contact between droplets of the aerosol and the conduit wall, especially in the critical area in the vicinity of the inlet to the furnace . In that regard, a preferred method for introducing the dry gas  into the aerosol  is from a radial direction into the aerosol . For example, equipment of substantially the same design as the quench cooler, described previously with reference to , could be used, with the aerosol  flowing through the interior flow path of the apparatus and the dry gas  being introduced through perforated wall of the perforated conduit. An alternative to using the dry gas  to dry the aerosol  would be to use a low temperature thermal preheater\/dryer prior to the furnace  to dry the aerosol  prior to introduction into the furnace . This alternative is not, however, preferred.","Still another way to reduce the potential for losses due to liquid accumulation is to operate the process with equipment configurations such that the aerosol stream flows in a vertical direction from the aerosol generator to and through the furnace. For smaller-size particles, those smaller than about 1.5 microns, this vertical flow should, preferably, be vertically upward. For larger-size particles, such as those larger than about 1.5 microns, the vertical flow is preferably vertically downward.","Furthermore, with the process of the present invention, the potential for system losses is significantly reduced because the total system retention time from the outlet of the generator until collection of the particles is typically shorter than about 10 seconds, preferably shorter than about 7 seconds, more preferably shorter than about 5 seconds and most preferably shorter than about 3 seconds.","Powders of a variety of materials may be made according to an embodiment of the present invention, with the powders so produced being an important aspect of the invention.","With some embodiments of the present invention, these various powders may be made with very desirable attributes for a variety of applications. In that regard, the powders are typically made with a small weight average particle size, narrow particle size distribution, spheroidal particle shape, and high density relative to a theoretical density for the material of the particles. Also, the particles of the powder typically are either substantially single crystalline or are polycrystalline and with a large mean crystallite size.","With respect to particle size, the powders are characterized generally as having a weight average particle size that typically is in the range of from about 0.05 micron to about 4 microns, with most powders having a weight average size of from about 0.1 micron to about 3 microns. With the process of the present invention, however, particle size may generally be controlled to provide particles with a desired size. Particle size is varied primarily by altering the frequency of ultrasonic transducers in the aerosol generator and by altering the concentration of precursors in the liquid feed. Lower ultrasonic frequencies tend to produce larger particles, while higher frequencies tend to produce smaller particles. Also, higher precursor concentrations in the liquid feed tend to produce larger particles and lower precursor concentrations in the liquid feed tend to produce smaller particles.","The particles are typically characterized as having a weight average particle size in a range having a lower limit, depending upon the application, of from about 0.1 micron, or about 0.2 micron, or about 0.3 micron, or about 0.5 micron, or about 0.8 micron, or about 1 micron; and having an upper limit, depending upon the application, of about 4 microns, or about 3 microns, or about 2.5 microns, or about 2 microns, or about 1 micron, or about 0.8 micron, or about 0.6 micron. Powders having a weight average size range defined by any combination of one of the specified upper limits and one of the specified lower limits are within the scope of the present invention, so long as the upper limit is larger than the lower limit. Some particularly preferred ranges for weight average particle size are provided below in discussions specific to certain material.","The powders are also characterized as having a narrow particle size distribution, typically with greater than about 75 weight percent, preferably greater than about 90 weight percent, and more preferably greater than about 95 weight percent of the particles in the powder having a size of smaller than two times the weight average particle size, and even more particularly smaller than about 1.5 times the weight average particle size.","The powders are also typically characterized as being comprised of spheroidal particles. In that regard, the particles are substantially spherical, in that the particles are not jagged or irregular in shape, although the particles may become faceted as the crystallite size in the particles increases. Spheroidal particles are advantageous because they typically have increased dispersibility and flowability in paste formulations relative to jagged or irregular particles.","Although in some instances the powders may be made as very porous or hollow particles, the powders are usually characterized as being very dense, with the particles typically having a density of at least about 80%, preferably at least about 90% and more preferably at least about 95%, of a theoretical density. The theoretical density is that density that particles would have assuming that the particles included zero porosity. As used herein, the density of a particle is as measured by helium pycnometry. High particle density is particularly advantageous for thick film applications involving a fired film, because higher density particles tend to exhibit reduced shrinkage during sintering than highly porous particles.","The powders are further characterized as typically having a high degree of purity, with generally no more than about 0.1 atomic percent impurities and preferably no more than about 0.01 atomic percent impurities. One significant characteristic of the powders of the present invention is that they may be made to be substantially free of organic materials, if desired, and particularly to be substantially free of surfactants. This is a significant advantage over particles made by a liquid route, which typically include residual surfactants. These residual surfactants can significantly impair the utility of the particles, especially in making thick film pastes.","As noted above, one group of powders of the present invention are metal-containing powders. The metal in the particles may include virtually any type of metal and can include both single-component metals and metal alloys. Particularly preferred metal-containing powder batches according to some embodiments of the present invention include at least one of palladium (Pd), silver (Ag), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), aluminum (Al), and the like. Preferred alloys can include a Ag\/Pd alloy, such as one having a Ag:Pd ratio of about 70:30.","Most preferred are metal-containing powders including at least one of palladium, silver, nickel, copper, gold and platinum, and even more particularly those including at least one of palladium, silver, nickel and copper.","The metal may be present in the particles in any convenient form, but is typically present in a metallic phase. The metallic phase may include substantially only a single metal or may include a metal alloy. The metal alloy may include any desired relative amounts of alloy constituents. When the powders include a metal alloy, the alloy is typically made by codissolving metal precursor salts in the liquid feed that is aerosolized to make the powder. Also, when reference is made herein to alloys, it should be recognized that the discussion applies equally to intermetallic compounds, which are not true alloys.","These metal-containing powders are primarily used for the manufacture of electrically conductive thick film features in electronic products. These thick film features are typically made by applying a layer of a paste containing the powder to a substrate, drying the layer to remove volatile components from layer, and firing the layer to form the film. Extremely high quality powders are required for many of these microelectronic thick film applications and the presence of a significant quantities of ultrafine particles should be avoided. Therefore, when making the metal-containing powders in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, care should be exercised during powder manufacture so that the vapor pressure of the metal components does not reach a detrimental level, as previously discussed.","Because of the relative importance of powders including at least one of palladium, silver, nickel, copper, gold and platinum, those particular metals will be discussed in greater detail.","Palladium-containing powders of the present invention are useful in making electrically conductive features for a variety of microelectronic devices. The powders may be used, for example, to make internal electrodes for multi-layer capacitors, conductive lines and other conductive pathways in multi-chip modules, and address electrodes for flat panel displays. One use for the palladium-containing particles is for making metallized terminations for multi-layer ceramic capacitors and other microelectronic devices.","Palladium precursors are typically palladium salts. Preferred precursors are nitrate salts. The palladium is typically present in the powders in a metallic phase, which may include substantially only palladium or may include the palladium in an alloy with one or more other metals. Alloying elements include, but are not limited to, silver (Ag), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), platinum (Pt), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), aluminum (Al), gold (Au), indium (In), lead (Pb), tin (Sn), bismuth (Bi) and the like. Particularly preferred for alloying with palladium are silver and nickel, and particularly silver. The alloying element is typically present in the alloy in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 40 weight percent, with from about 1 to about 30 weight percent being more preferred, based on the total weight of the alloy, with the balance of the alloy typically comprising palladium.","The palladium-containing powders may have any convenient weight average particle size within the range of the invention, which will vary depending upon the application. For most applications, the weight average particle size will be in a range of from about 0.1 micron to about 2 microns. When used to make electrically conductive features in microelectronic devices, such as multi-layer ceramic capacitors or multi-chip modules, the powder preferably has a weight average particle size of from about 0.1 micron to about 0.8 micron. For use in making electrodes for flat panel displays, the particles preferably have a weight average particle size of from about 1 micron to about 3 microns. A preferred average particle size for metallized terminations for multi-layer ceramic capacitors and other microelectronic devices is from about 1 micron to about 3 microns.","Silver-containing powders of some embodiments of the present invention are useful in making electrically conductive features for a variety of microelectronic devices. The powders may be used, for example, to make internal electrodes for multi-layer capacitors, conductive lines and other conductive pathways in multi-chip modules, and address electrodes for flat panel displays. One significant use for the silver-containing particles is for making metallized terminations for multi-layer ceramic capacitors and other microelectronic devices. Another significant use is for use as particulate electrode materials, such as or electrochemical cells, including zinc-air cells.","Silver precursors are typically silver salts, with nitrate salts being preferred. The silver is typically present in the powders in a metallic phase, which may include substantially only silver or may include the silver in an alloy with one or more other metals.

Alternatively, the metal-containing particles may be multi-phase, or composite, particles. In multi-phase particles, the metal is present in a first material phase. The particles also include a second material phase that is different than the first material phase. The multi-phase particles may, however, include more than two material phases.","Single phase particles will typically consist essentially of a single metallic phase of the metal or an alloy including the metal. Multi-phase particles also typically include a metallic phase including the metal and also include at least one other phase. Besides the metal-containing metallic phase, the other phases that may be present are other metallic phases, that are preferably substantially free of the metal, or nonmetallic phases, that are also preferably substantially free of the metal.","For many applications, whether single phase or multi-phase particles are used, the metal-containing metallic phase will frequently comprise greater than about 50 weight percent of the metal, preferably greater than about 60 weight percent of the metal, more preferably greater than about 70 weight percent of the metal, even more preferably greater than about 80 weight percent of the metal and most preferably greater than about 90 weight percent of the metal.","Multi-phase particles may be desirable for a number of reasons, including: (1) a reduction in the amount of the an expensive metal that is used in the particle to provide electrical conductivity by incorporating a second material phase that is a less expensive filler material; (2) to improve flowability of the particles in a paste and to improve resistance of particles to deformations; (3) to modify physical properties of the particles for improved compatibility with a substrate supporting a conductive film made using the particles, including modifications of the thermal coefficient of linear expansion, modification of sintering\/densification characteristics, and modification of surface energy to alter wetability of the particles; and (4) to modify electrical or dielectric properties for customized electronic components. Some examples of uses of the multi-phase, metal-containing particles include use as catalysts or catalytic supports and as particles in paste formulations used in thick film applications, including manufacture of multi-layer capacitors, multi-chip components, super capacitors and other electronic components, batteries and fuel cells.","A significant aspect of some embodiments of the present invention is the extremely high quality, metal-containing, multi-phase particles, preferably including at least one of palladium, silver, nickel, copper, gold and platinum (and especially including at least one of palladium, silver, nickel and copper), that may be made according to the process previously described. These multi-phase powders include multi-phase particles having at least a first material phase and a second material phase. Additional material phases may be present, if desired. The first material phase includes the metal, and is typically an electrically conductive metallic phase, with the metal being in the form of the substantially pure metal or an alloy with one or more other metal. The second material phase, which is different than the first material phase, is typically substantially free of the metal.","The second material phase may be a metallic phase. When the second material phase is a metallic phase, it may be a substantially pure single metal, or may include an alloy of two or more metals. When one of palladium, silver, nickel, copper, gold and platinum is in the first material phase, one or more of the remaining of those metals may be present in the second material phase. Examples of some other metals that may be included in the second material phase include molybdenum, tungsten, tantalum, aluminum, indium, lead, tin, bismuth, and the like.","For most applications, however, the second material phase will be nonmetallic, in which case the second material phase will also typically not be electrically conductive. Preferred in a nonmetallic second material phase are a variety of ceramic materials, glass materials or other materials that would alter the sintering and\/or densification characteristics of the particles. Control of sintering and\/or densification characteristics of the particles is particularly important when the particles are to be used in a thick film paste for manufacture of a metal-containing film on a substrate including a ceramic layer, which is typically dielectric, to more closely match with the sintering and shrinkage characteristics of the powder particles with those of the substrate, thereby reducing the occurrence of problems such as film cracking and delamination. This is particularly important when layers are to be cofired, such as in multi-layer ceramic capacitors and multi-chip modules.","The second material phase may include an oxide material, such as oxides of zinc, tin, barium, molybdenum, manganese, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, tungsten, iron, silver, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, yttrium, iridium, beryllium, silicon, zirconium, aluminum, bismuth, magnesium, thorium and gadolinium. Some preferred oxides are silica, alumina, titania, zirconia, yttria, and oxides of copper, bismuth and tin. Another preferred group of oxides includes borates, titanates, silicates (including borosilicates and aluminosilicates), aluminates, niobates, zirconates and tantalates. Examples include mullite, cordierite, barium titanate, neodymium titanate, magnesium titanate, calcium titanate, strontium titanate and lead titanate. Additional materials that could be used as the second material phase include glass materials, such as glass frits and glazes. Particularly preferred are second material phases including titanates, and especially including a titanate of one or more of barium, strontium, neodymium, calcium, magnesium and lead. The titanate may be of a single metal or may be a mixed metal titanate, such as, for example BaSrTiO. Furthermore, a variety of other ceramic materials may be used in the second material phase, such as carbides, borides and nitrides, including silicon nitride. Also, porcelain could be used in the second material phase.","The multi-phase particles of the present invention may typically be used in place of single phase metallic particles for most application, so long as the proportion of the second material phase making up the particles is small enough not to be detrimental to the application. Often, however, the use of multi-phase particles significantly enhances the performance of films made using the particles relative to the use of single phase metallic particles.","One use for the multi-phase particles of some embodiments of the present invention is to form a film including the metal in a metallic phase, often electrically conductive, adjacent to a layer of nonmetallic material, often dielectric. In that case, the multi-phase particles will typically include in the second phase a nonmetallic material that enhances suitability for use with the nonmetallic layer, resulting in improved compatibility and bonding between the nonmetallic layer and the electrically conductive film including the metallic phase. For many of these applications, the multi-phase metal-containing particles will include in the second material phase a nonmetallic material that is also present in an adjacent nonmetallic layer. Thus, when the nonmetallic layer is of a dielectric material, that dielectric material is also present in the second material phase. When the nonmetallic layer is a ceramic layer, for example, the multi-phase particles could include in the second phase a ceramic material that is also present in the ceramic layer. As one specific example, titanate materials are often used in the dielectric layers of multi-layer capacitors, and the metal-containing particles used to make internal electrodes for the multi-layer capacitor could include in the second material phase the same titanate that is present in the dielectric layers. Electronic devices made using the multi-phase particles of the present invention, and especially multi-layer ceramic capacitors having internal electrode layers made using the particles, and the methods for making such devices are within the scope of the present invention.","Generally, for applications involving the use of multi-phase particles to form a metallic electrically conductive phase adjacent a dielectric layer, the second material phase of the particles typically comprises less than about 30 weight percent of the particles, preferably less than about 20 weight percent of the particles, and more preferably less than about 10 weight percent of the particles.","Multiphase particles having a very low content of the second material phase are generally preferred when the particles will be used to make electrically conductive features, because the second material phase is typically dielectric and reduces electrical conductivity. In many instances, therefore, and especially those including silica, alumina or a titanate as the second material phase, the second material phase typically comprises less than about 10 weight percent of the particles, more preferably less than about 5 weight percent of the particles, and even more preferably less than about 2 weight percent of the particles; but the second material phase will typically be at least about 0.1 weight percent, and preferably at least about 0.5 weight percent, of the particles. In this way, enhanced compatibility between the dielectric layer and the electrically conductive film may be accomplished without significant detrimental impact to electrical conductivity. Also, the use of the multiphase particles to make electrically conductive films will typically result in improved adhesion for better bonding with the dielectric layer, thereby reducing the potential for delaminations.","One particularly preferred powder of multi-phase particles includes a metallic first material phase, which is preferably electrically conductive, and a second material phase including a ceramic material of at least one of silica, alumina, zirconia and titania, with the second material phase preferably being dielectric. Preferred as the first material phase is a metallic phase including at least one of palladium, silver, nickel, copper, gold and platinum. Especially preferred in the first material phase is at least one of palladium, silver, nickel and copper. When the second material phase comprises silica or alumina, the powder will typically include the first material phase as the predominant phase, especially when the particles are designed for use to make electrically conductive thick film features. When the second material phase includes zirconia or titania, however, the second material phase may be the predominant phase, especially when the particles are designed for use as catalysts.","Another particularly preferred powder of some embodiments of the present invention including multi-phase particles includes an electrically conductive metallic first material phase, typically as the predominant phase, and a second material phase including a titanate. Preferably, the titanate is of one or more of barium, strontium, neodymium, calcium, magnesium and lead. The first material phase preferably includes one or more of palladium, silver, nickel, copper, gold and platinum, and especially one or more of palladium, silver, nickel and copper.","Yet another particularly preferred powder of multi-phase particles includes the metallic first phase and a second phase including carbon. The carbon is typically an electrically conductive form of carbon, such as in the form of graphite or carbon black. The metallic phase preferably includes one or more of palladium, silver, nickel, copper, gold and platinum. The particles typically include the second material phase as the predominant phase. The first material phase typically is used as a catalyst. These multi-phase particles are particularly well suited for use as catalysts and, depending upon the metal, electrode materials, and especially as electrode materials in electrochemical cells. These multi-phase powders may also be advantageously used as conductive filler particles in electrically conductive adhesive formulations. One preferred powder includes silver as the metallic phase, especially for use as a cathode material for zinc-air batteries or for fuel cells. Another preferred powder includes platinum, especially for use as cathode material for fuel cells. For most applications, the powder is less than about 20 weight percent of the first material phase and preferably less than about 10 weight percent of the first material phase. The particles will, however, typically include at least about 1 weight percent of the first material phase, preferably at least 2 weight percent of the first material phase and more preferably at least about 5 weight percent of the first material phase. Particularly preferred is for the powder to include from about 5 weight percent to about 10 weight percent of the first material phase, and especially about 7 weight percent of the first material phase.","A number of different variations of the process according to embodiments of the present invention are possible for making the multi-phase particles. In one embodiment, a metal-containing precursor for the first material phase and a second precursor for the second material phase may both be included in the liquid feed  (referring back to  and the discussion relating thereto). In such a case, both precursors could be in solution in a flowable liquid of the liquid feed . Alternatively, one or both of the precursors could be particles suspended in the flowable liquid. Also, it is possible that the liquid feed  could include more than two precursors for the multi-phase particles. In another embodiment, the metal-containing precursor could initially be in the liquid feed , which is then processed in aerosol form in the furnace  to prepare metal-containing precursor particles. The precursor particles are then coated with the second material phase in a separate step, in a manner similar to that described previously with reference to . This two-step process of initially preparing metal-containing precursor particles and then coating the precursor particles on the fly in an aerosol state is particularly advantageous because problems are avoided that are encountered in particle manufacture procedures, such as liquid route precipitation, in which precursor particles would have to be collected and then redispersed prior to coating. Not only is collection and redispersion cumbersome, but problems are often encountered due to particle agglomeration, which is avoided with the on-the-fly coating of some embodiments of the present invention. Avoidance of particle agglomeration is very important when a uniform particle coating is desired.","As noted previously, the multi-phase particles of some embodiments of the present invention may include a variety of particle morphologies. With reference again to , the multi-phase particles may include an intimate mixture of the first material phase and the second material phase, as in the multi-phase particle . Typically, with such an intimate mixture, the first material phase is a continuous phase throughout which the second material phase is dispersed. Another possible morphology is for the first material phase to be in the form of a large core that is covered by a thin coating layer of the second material phase, as shown for particles  and  in . Whether such coatings form a smooth coating, such as shown in particle , or a rough and bumpy coating, such as shown in particle , will depend upon the wetability characteristics of the first and second material phases and the conditions under which the materials are processed, and especially the processing temperature. For example, in gas-to-particle conversion processes, higher temperatures during the coating operation tends to result in smoother, more continuous coatings. The multi-phase particles could also include a small core of one material phase surrounded by a thick layer of the other material phase, as shown for particle . Also, the first and second material phase could completely segregate in a manner shown for particle . Furthermore, the multi-phase particles are not limited to two material phases. For example, particle  in  shows a multi-phase particle including a core of second material phase domains dispersed in a matrix of the first material phase, and with the core being coated by a third material phase.","With continued reference to , it should be noted that the first material phase and the second material phase could constitute any of the phases in particles , , , ,  and . For most applications, however, the first material phase, which includes the metal, will be the more abundant phase, and the second material phase will be the less abundant phase.","In the case of coated particles, the second material phase will often be in the form of a coating around a core including the first material phase. In the case of catalyst materials, however, the first material phase may be a coating or a disperse phase on the surface of a support of the second material phase. For particles including intimate mixtures of the two phases, the first material phase will typically be the continuous phase and the second material phase will typically be the disperse phase.","For most applications, the multi-phase particles will include greater than about 50 weight percent of the first material phase, more preferably greater than about 60 weight percent of the first material phase, even more preferably greater than about 70 weight percent of the first material phase and most preferably greater than about 80 weight percent of the first material phase. In the case of multi-phase particles including thin coating layers of the second material phase, the first material phase may comprise 90 weight percent or more of the particles. Conversely, the second material phase typically will comprise less than about 50 weight percent of the multi-phase particles, preferably less than about 40 weight percent, more preferably less than about 30 weight percent and even more preferably less than about 20 weight percent. In the case of thin coatings of the second material phase, the second material phase may comprise 10 percent or less of the particles. Even in the case of coated particles, however, the second material phase will typically comprise greater than about 0.5 weight percent, and preferably greater than about 1 weight percent, of the particles.","Because most applications for multi-phase particles of the present invention include the use of either a particle including the first material phase in a large core surrounded by a thin coating of the second material phase or an intimate mixture of the first material phase as a continuous phase with the second material as a disperse phase, those particular situations will now be discussed below in greater detail.","One preferred class of multi-phase particles are coated particles in which the first material phase forms a core and the second material phase forms a thin coating layer about the outer surface of the core. The second material phase may include any of the materials previously listed as being suitable for the second material phase.","With the present invention, the coating including the second material phase may be made as a relatively uniform layer that substantially entirely covers the core of the first material phase. One method for making multi-phase particles including the second material phase as a uniform coating is as described previously with reference to . In that regard, the second material phase is typically formed on a precursor particle, which includes the first material phase, by techniques as previously described. A preferred coating technique is CVD. CVD is a well known deposition technique in which a precursor for the second material phase is reacted in the vapor phase to form the second material phase. Generally, precursors for CVD are metal-containing compounds, for example, inorganic compounds, metal organics and organometallics. Examples of some vapor phase precursors for CVD of inorganic coatings include silanes, metal formates, metal acetates, metal oxalates, metal carboxylates, metal alkyls, metal aryls, metal alkoxides, metal ketonates (especially beta-diketonates), metal amides, metal hydrides, metal oxyhalides, and metal halides (especially metal chlorides and metal bromides). For example, to deposit a coating of silica, a vaporous silane precursor, such as silicon tetrachloride, may be decomposed and converted to silica at elevated temperature in the presence of oxygen or water vapor, with the silica then depositing on the surface of metal-containing precursor particles.","Typically, a coating deposited by CVD or by PVD will result in an average coating thickness of from about 10 nanometers to about 200 nanometers. Preferred coatings have an average thickness of thinner than about 100 nanometers, more preferably thinner than about 50 nanometers and most preferably thinner than about 25 nanometers.","Applications for coated multi-phase particles include the manufacture of electrically conductive films for electronic devices, such as multi-layer capacitors and multi-chip modules. In the case of many coatings such as silica, the coating is useful to beneficially alter the sintering and\/or shrinkage characteristics of the particle for improved compatibility with a ceramic substrate.","Another way to make coated multi-phase particles is to provide precursors for both the first material phase and the second material phase in the feed liquid  (as described with respect to ). As noted previously, each precursor in the feed liquid  could be either in the liquid phase, e.g., in solution in a flowable liquid, or in the form of particles suspended by the flowable liquid. The multi-phase particles would then form in the furnace  as liquid is removed from aerosol droplets. It should be noted that, in the case of multiple phases forming simultaneously in the furnace, the different phases are typically initially formed as an intimate mixture of the phases. Generally, higher processing temperatures and longer residence times will result in redistribution of the material phases to the desired morphology of a coating of one material phase about a core of the other material phase, assuming that the two material phases have the proper wetability characteristics. Alternatively, it is possible that redistribution of the phases could result in complete segregation of the phases, as shown by the multi-phase particles  in . When redistribution of the material phases is desired to form a coated particle morphology, a processing embodiment such as that described previously with reference to  may be advantageous.","When making coated particles with precursors for both the first material phase and the second material phase in the liquid feed , a first precursor for the metal-containing first material phase could comprise preformed metal-containing particles to be coated. The precursor for the second material phase could also be in particulate form, or could be in solution in a liquid phase. For example, a soluble precursor, such as from dissolution of a metal alkoxide could be used as a precursor for the second material phase. In the case of metal alkoxides, it should be recognized that in aqueous solution the dissolved metal alkoxide usually reacts to form other soluble components, which will function as a soluble precursor. This could be the case in the preparation of particles including titania or alumina as the second material phase. In the case of silica as the second material phase, the precursor will typically be small silica particles, which are preferably of colloidal size, or silica dissolved in solution.","The manufacture of multi-phase particles with an intimately mixed morphology for the different material phases is typically accomplished by initially including a precursor for both the first material phase and the second material phase in a liquid feed , as previously described. As noted, the process may be substantially the same as the process used to prepare particles with a coating morphology, except the processing conditions may be altered so that the material phases do not redistribute, and are instead retained in an intimately mixed state. Generally, lower operating temperatures in the furnace  and shorter residence times, with rapid particle cooling, promote an intimate mixture of the phases.","Multi-phase particles of an intimately mixed morphology are particularly useful for modifying sintering\/densification temperatures of the particle, reducing shrinkage that occurs during firing in thick film applications, and modifying the electrical or other properties of the particle for special applications.","Another preferred group of powders of the present invention include phosphor particles. Phosphors are materials which are capable of emitting radiation in the visible or ultraviolet spectral range upon excitation, such as excitation by an external electric field or other external energy source. Phosphors include a matrix compound, referred to as a host material, and the phosphor typically further includes one or more dopants, referred to as activator ions, to emit a specific color or to enhance the luminescence characteristics.","Particular phosphor compounds may be preferred for certain applications and no single phosphor compound is necessarily preferred for all possible applications. However, preferred phosphor host materials for some display applications include the Group II sulfides (e.g., CaS, SrS, BaS, MgS, MgSrS and CaSrS) and the Group XII sulfides (e.g., ZnS, CdS and ZnCdS). Among these, ZnS is particularly preferred for many display applications, particularly those utilizing high voltages (i.e. greater than about 2000 volts), due primarily to the high brightness of ZnS. ZnS is typically doped with Cu, Ag, Al, Au, Cl or mixtures thereof. For example, ZnS:Agis a common phosphor used to produce blue light in a CRT device.","Among the oxides, YOdoped with Eu (YO:Eu) is often preferred for emitting red light. BaMgAlO:Eu (BAM:Eu) is also a common oxide for producing red light. Other compounds that would be useful if available include SrGaS:Eu, SrGaS:Ce, CaGaS:Eu and CaGaS:Ce. Preferred phosphor host compounds and activators for particular applications are discussed in more detail hereinbelow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0244","num":"0247"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Examples of Phosphor Materials"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Host Material","Activator Ion","Color"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"BaS","Ce","Yellow"]},{"entry":[{},"CaS","Ce","Green"]},{"entry":[{},"CaS","Mn","Yellow"]},{"entry":[{},"SrS","Ce","Blue-Green"]},{"entry":[{},"MgSrS","Ce","Blue-Green"]},{"entry":[{},"ZnS","Cu","Blue-Green"]},{"entry":[{},"BAM","Eu","Blue"]},{"entry":[{},"ZnO","Zn","Green"]},{"entry":[{},"YO","Eu","Red"]},{"entry":[{},"(Ce,Gd)MgBO","Tb","Green"]},{"entry":[{},"Y0S","Eu","Red"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The powder characteristics that are preferred will depend upon the application of the phosphor powders. Nonetheless, it can be generally stated that the powders should usually have a small particle size, narrow size distribution, spherical morphology, high density\/low porosity, high crystallinity and homogenous dopant distribution. The efficiency of the phosphor, defined as the overall conversion of excitation energy to visible photons, should be high.","For most phosphor applications, the average particle size is more preferably from about 0.1 micron to about 4 microns and even more preferably is from about 0.5 micron to about 2 microns. The phosphor particles producible according to the present invention can be substantially single crystal particles or may be comprised of a number of crystallites. It is possible according to the present invention to produce phosphor particles having large crystallites. Crystallite size can be determined from the width of the x-ray diffraction peaks of the material. Large crystallites give rise to sharp peaks, while the peak width increases as crystallite size decreases.","It is preferred that the average crystallite size within the particles is at least about 50 nanometers and more preferably is at least about 100 nanometers. The average crystallite size most preferably approaches the average particle size such that the particles are mostly single crystals. Preferably, the average crystallite size is at least about 50 percent and more preferably at least about 80 percent of the average particle size. Highly crystalline phosphors (i.e. large crystallite size) are believed to have increased efficiency as compared to phosphors with smaller crystallites.","The phosphor particles producible according to the present invention advantageously have a high degree of purity, that is, a low level of impurities. Impurities are those materials that are not intended in the final product\u2014thus, an activator ion is not considered an impurity. The level of impurities in the phosphor powders of the present invention is preferably less than about 0.1 weight percent and is more preferably less than about 0.01 weight percent. Further, the activator ion is homogeneously dispersed throughout the host material.","The particles of the present invention are also substantially spherical in shape. Spherical particles are particularly advantageous because they are able to disperse and coat a device more uniformly. As a result, the phosphor powder batch of the present invention is substantially non-agglomerated and has good dispersibility in a variety of media.","It is often advantageous to provide phosphor particles with a coating on the outer surface thereof. Coatings are often desirable to reduce degradation of the phosphor material due to moisture or other influences such as the plasma in a plasma display device or electron bombardment in cathodoluminescent devices. For example, metal sulfides such as ZnS are particularly susceptible to degradation due to moisture and should be completely encapsulated to reduce or eliminate the degradation reaction. Other phosphors are known to degrade in an electron beam operating at a high current density, such as in field emission displays and CRT's.","Preferred coatings include metal oxides such as SiO, MgO, AlO, SnOor InO. Semiconductive oxide coatings such as SnO or InOcan advantageously absorb secondary electrons that are often emitted by the phosphor. The coatings can be either particulate coatings or non-particulate (film) coatings. The coatings should be relatively thin and uniform. Preferably, the coating has an average thickness of less than about 1 micron and more preferably the average coating thickness is from about 5 nanometers to about 100 nanometers. Further, the particles can include more than one coating substantially encapsulating the particles to achieve the desired properties.","In addition, the phosphor particles can include organic coatings such as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), polystyrene or the like. The organic coating should be on the order of 1 to 100 nanometers thick and be substantially dense and continuous about the particle. Such coatings can be formed after the powders are prepared by a liquid phase process. The organic coatings can advantageously prevent corrosion of the phosphor particles especially in electroluminiscent lamps and also can improve the dispersion characteristics of the particles.","The coating can also be a monolayer coating formed by the reaction of an organic or an inorganic molecule with the surface of the phosphor particles to form a coating that is essentially one molecular layer thick. In particular, the formation of a monolayer coating by reaction of the surface of the phosphor powder with a functionalized organo silane such as halo- or amino-silanes, for example hexamethyldisilazane or trimethylsilylchloride, can be used to modify\/control the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the phosphor powders. Such coatings allow for greater control over the dispersion characteristics of the phosphor powder in a wide variety of paste compositions.","The monolayer coatings may also be applied to phosphor powders that have already been coated with, for example, 1-100 nanometer organic or inorganic coatings thus providing better control over the corrosion characteristics (through the use of thicker coating) as well as dispersibility (through the monolayer coating) of the phosphor powder.","More specifically, doped metal sulfide phosphors (MS:M\u2032) can be prepared from an aqueous solution by the reaction of a metal carbonate (or oxide or hydroxide) with thiourea or a sulfur-containing acid such as thioacetic acid or thiocarboxylic acid (HS(O)CR) forming a water soluble complex, such as M(S(O)CR)\u00d7HO. Preferably, at least about 2 equivalents of acid are added to ensure complete reaction with the metal compound. The solution, when pyrolyzed under N, leads to the metal sulfide.\n\nMCO+2HS(O)CR\u2014HO\u2192M(S(O)CR)\u00d7HO+CO+HO\n\nM(S(O)CR)\u00d7HO+heat\/N\u2192MS+volatile by-products\n","The solution preferably has a phosphor precursor concentration that is unsaturated to avoid the formation of precipitates and preferably includes from about 1 to about 50 weight percent of the precursor. Preferably the solvent is aqueous-based for ease of operation, although other solvents, such as toluene, may be desirable for specific materials. The use of organic solvents can lead to undesirable carbon concentration in the phosphor particles. The pH of the aqueous-based solutions can be adjusted to alter the solubility characteristics of the precursor in the solution.","The maximum average stream temperature in the furnace when making phosphor powders are typically in a range of from about 500\u00b0 C. to about 1800\u00b0 C., depending upon the phosphor that is being produced.","While particles initially produced by the furnace have good crystallinity, it may be desirable to increase the crystallinity after production. Thus, the powders can be heated for varying amounts of time and in different environments to increase the crystallinity of the phosphor. Increased crystallinity will lead to increased brightness and efficiency of the phosphor. If such annealing steps are performed, the annealing temperature and time should be selected to minimize the amount of interparticle sintering that is often associated with annealing. For example, yttria-based phosphors annealed at 1400\u00b0 C. under air for 58 hours can advantageously increase in brightness intensity by 160 percent or more due to an increase in the crystallite size.","Further, the crystallinity of the phosphors can be increased by using a fluxing agent, either in the precursor solution or in a post-formation annealing step. A fluxing agent is a reagent which improves the crystallinity of the material when the reagent and the material are heated together as compared to heating the material to the same temperature and for the same amount of time in the absence of the fluxing agent. The fluxing agent, for example alkali metal halides such as NaCl or KCl, can be added to the precursor solution where it improves the crystallinity of the particles during their subsequent formation. Alternatively, the fluxing agent can be added to the phosphor powder batches after they have been collected. Upon annealing, the fluxing agent improves the crystallinity of the phosphor powder, and therefore improves the brightness of the phosphor powder.","As is discussed above, it may be desirable to form phosphor particles with coatings thereon to enhance the stability or other properties of the phosphor powders. The phosphor powders of the present invention can be coated using several different methods. For example, a colloidal phosphor powder and a soluble, involatile molecular precursor to the coating can be suspended in the droplets so that the coating forms around the phosphor when passed through the heating zone of the furnace. Alternatively, a soluble precursor to both the phosphor powder and the coating can be used in the precursor solution wherein the coating precursor is involatile (e.g. Al(NO)) or volatile (e.g., Sn(OAc)). In another method, a colloidal precursor and a soluble phosphor precursor can be used to form a particulate colloidal coating on the phosphor.","In yet another coating method, a volatile coating precursor or precursor solution is sprayed into the furnace after a point where the phosphor particles have already been formed. The precursor reacts to form a coating on the phosphor particle surface. These coatings can be generated by two different mechanisms. First, the precursor can vaporize and diffuse to the hot particle surface and thermally react resulting in the formation of a thin-film by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Alternatively, the gaseous precursor can react in the gas phase forming small particles (e.g. less than about 5 nanometers) which can then diffuse to the particle surface and sinter onto the surface forming a coating. This reaction mechanism is referred to as gas to particle conversion (GPC).","In addition, a volatile coating material, such as PbO, MoOor VO, can be introduced into the reactor such that the coating deposits on the particle by condensation.","An additional heating zone, such as a second elongated tubular furnace, can be added after the main furnace, but before the quench system, to coat the phosphor particles with the desired coating.","The following examples are provided to aid in understanding of the present invention, and are not intended to in any way limit the scope of the present invention.","This example demonstrates preparation of multi-phase particles of either neodymium titanate or barium titanate with various metals.","A titanate precursor solution is prepared for each of barium titanate and neodymium titanate. The barium titanate precursor solution is prepared by dissolving barium nitrate in water and then, with rapid stirring, adding titanium tetraisopropoxide. A fine precipitate is formed. Sufficient nitric acid is added to completely dissolve the precipitate. Precursor solutions of various metals are prepared by dissolving the metal salt in water. The neodymium titanate precursor solution is prepared in the same way except using neodymium nitrate.","The titanate precursor solution and the metal precursor solution are mixed in various relative quantities to obtain the desired relative quantities of titanate and metal components in the final particles. The mixed solutions are aerosolized in an ultrasonic aerosol generator with transducers operated at 1.6 MHz and the aerosol is sent to a furnace where droplets in the aerosol are pyrolized to form the desired multi-phase particles. Air or nitrogen is used as a carrier gas, with tests involving copper and nickel also including hydrogen in an amount of 2.8 volume percent of the carrier gas. Results are summarized in Table 2.","A variety of materials are made according to the process of the present invention, with some materials being made with and some being made without droplet classification prior to the furnace. Various single phase and multi-phase (or composite) particles are made as well as several coated particles.
