No. 60\/366,910, filed 22 Mar. 2002 and entitled VARIABLE PRICING FOR AND CONDITIONAL SUSPENSION AND REINSTATEMENT OF ORDERS IN TRADING OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS. The complete contents of said provisional application, including the specification thereof in its entirety, is hereby incorporated in full as a part of this specification, by this reference.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.","This application contains material relating to the trading of financial interests. The trading of some financial interests is regulated, as for example by the United States Government, the various State governments, and other governmental agencies within the United States and elsewhere. The disclosure herein is made solely in terms of logical and financial possibility and advantage, without regard to possible statutory, regulatory, or other legal considerations. Nothing herein is intended as a statement or representation of any kind that any method or process proposed or discussed herein does or does not comply with any statute, law, regulation, or other legal requirement whatsoever, in any jurisdiction; nor should it be taken or construed as doing so.","The invention relates to trading of financial interests, and in particular to programs, methods, and systems for variable pricing and conditionally making available proposals for trading of financial interests.","The invention provides programs, methods, and systems for associating a proposal for a trade in at least one financial interest with at least one other financial interest or index, which may serve as a reference for effecting a condition of the proposal, including for example an availability of terms for the proposal to other traders, the executability of the proposal, etc.","For example, a term of the proposal is associated with a parameter of or otherwise associated with the other financial interest or index. In a preferred embodiment, the price of the proposal is associated with the parameter, for example with a price parameter, of the other financial interest or index. In such an embodiment, availability of the terms of the proposal, a price term associated with the proposal, or the executability of the proposal can depend upon the relationship of the price term of the proposal and a price or other parameter associated with the other financial interest or index.","The relationship between the price term of the proposal and the reference index may be static, as for example in a manner similar to that of a limit order, with the relationship being established between different financial interests; or the relationship may be dynamic, for example, a floating reference such as pegging, but again the relationship is between the financial interest of the proposal and another financial interest of index.","In a preferred embodiment, a trader entering a trading proposal, such as a bid or offer, for a financial interest in a computer trading system, is provided with the option of making the proposal contingent upon a specified relationship between a reference index and a reference index limit selected by the trader, and\/or of tying a price term for the proposal to a reference index, so that the price term of the proposal floats with the reference index according to a specified relationship.","Any suitable value or parameter can be used as reference indices, including prices or other parameters associated with interests other than those for which a trade is proposed, or any other index. The same interest traded in another market, as for example in another country's exchange or on another electronic communications network (ECN) can also be used as a reference index. For example, prices or values associated with any financial interest or derivative, such as stocks, bonds, commercial paper, or commodities, and\/or futures, options, or forwards may be used. Composite prices or indices such as the Dow-Jones or NASDAQ averages are further examples of suitable indices.","Indices can include interests of the same financial class as the interest for which trading is proposed. For example, a second stock may be designated as the reference index in a proposed trade of a first stock; a second bond in a proposal relating to a first bond; a third currency for a trade in first and second currencies, etc. For example, a trade in MicroSoft corporation stock can be proposed using a price associated with an actual or proposed trade in IBM corporation stock as an index.","Any value or other parameter associated with the reference index may be used. For example, various types of pricing data associated with the reference index, such as current best bid and\/or offer, last open, last close, etc., can serve as indices in proposing trades. For indices which are not priced, such as for example composite price indices, the value of the index itself, or any derivative or other associated value or parameter, may be used.","In one embodiment the invention provides a computer readable medium or media for use within a computer system by traders of financial interests in conditionally making available terms for proposed trades. The system comprises a computer readable medium or media having programming stored thereon for causing the computer system to receive from a user of the computer system, such as a trader employed by a securities trading firm, terms for a proposed trade in a financial interest. The terms include an identification of a financial interest the user wishes to trade, a price at which the user wishes to trade the financial interest, an identification of a reference index, a designation of a reference index limit, and may include additional terms such as a quantity or order size. The programming causes the computer system to make available to other users of the computer system, such as for example potential trading counterparties, for so long as the reference index maintains a specified relationship to the reference index limit, terms of the proposed trade including the identification of the financial interest the user wishes to trade.","Terms are made available to other users in any suitable manner, as for example by causing the terms to be displayed on a computer screen or otherwise enabling access by computer terminals or systems available to the other users to a data storage in which the terms are stored, or by sending to or otherwise providing the data for the other users' terminals or systems electronically, as for example via a live data feed, instant message, or e-mail using a computer communications network, and allowing or causing the terms to be displayed on a computer screen or other output device.","Terms for a proposal can also be made available by, for example, making the proposal executable by other traders, so that upon satisfaction of the specified relationship between the reference index and the reference index limit the proposal is made available as an executable order upon action by another user; or making the proposal available for automatic matching in an automatic matching system; making the order available in a blind matching system; or making the terms available to other users as a request for proposal or indicator of interest.","The user entering the proposal can specify, for example, that the proposal will remain valid only so long as the reference index remains above, or below, a specified value, or within a specified range of values.","If a proposal is entered when a specified relationship between the reference index and the reference index limit is not satisfied, the proposal can be made available by holding the proposal until the relationship is satisfied, and making terms available to other system users at that time. If a proposal is made available to other users but then suspended when a specified relationship is no longer satisfied, it can be reinstated upon renewed satisfaction of the relationship.","Specification of conditions under which to make a proposal available to other traders, to suspend a proposal, and to reinstate a suspended proposal can be made by the user making the proposal, by the system, or by a combination of both the user and the system. For example, the user can specify conditions by designating a suitable reference index and index limit, and by specifying the relationship between the index and the index limit to be used in determining whether or when to make the proposal available to other users; or the system may provide defaults, which may optionally be overridden, for one or more of: the reference index, the index limit, and the relationship between the index and the index limit.","In another embodiment the invention provides a computer-readable medium or media for computer systems for use by traders of financial interests using relative pricing, for example by tying the proposed price of the financial interest to a reference index, or to any parameter associated with a reference index. The system comprises a computer readable medium or media having programming stored thereon for causing the computer system to receive from a user of the computer system terms for a proposed trade in a financial interest, the terms including an identification of a financial interest the user wishes to trade, an identification of a reference index, and a designation of a price operand. The medium or media causes the system to determine, using the designated operand and a current value of the reference index, a price term for the proposed trade; and to make available to other users of the computer system terms of the proposed trade including the identification of the financial interest the user wishes to trade and the determined price.","The computer readable medium or media can include programming for causing a computer to redetermine the price term for the proposed trade using the designated operand and a changed value of the reference index; and make available to other users of the computer system terms of the proposed trade including the identification of the financial interest the user wishes to trade and the redetermined price. For example, the computer system can periodically or continuously monitor the reference index, and periodically or continuously redetermine the price and make it available to other users; or the system can redetermine the price only at the command of the user making the proposal. Optionally the process of redetermining the price term and making it available to other traders can continue until the proposal is executed, cancelled, or otherwise suspended or terminated. Optionally a price may be determined only once, or set statically, and left indefinitely at that level, instead of being continuously, or dynamically, redetermined.","The operator and\/or function to be used by the system with the operand and reference index in determining the price term for the proposed trade can be specified by the user proposing the trade, the system, or both. For example, the system may provide default options, preferably overridable, or a menu or selection of choices, for the operator and\/or function, or the system may permit the user to specify the operator and\/or function completely. Examples of operators and\/or functions include multiplication or division by designated factor operands, or addition or subtraction of designated offsets. More complex operators and\/or functions such as rates of change (in the mathematical calculus, referred to as derivatives), integration, etc., may also be used.","Proposed trades, or proposals, can include bids and\/or offers of any type, optionally binding or negotiable, and any indications of interest in trades such as inquiries directed to specified potential counterparties or sets of counterparties. Optionally proposed trades are executable upon acceptance by other users.","The type of proposal to be entered by the user may be designated in any suitable fashion. For example, the user may enter data indicating that the proposed transaction is a bid, an offer, or any other type by entering data in an appropriate data input field on an interactive graphical user interface. The designation may also be made by the system, as for example by an overridable default, or implicitly, as for example by entry of a minimum price for a sale proposal or a maximum price for a purchase proposal.","Other embodiments of the invention provide a computer-readable medium or media useful in a computer system for both variable pricing and conditional making available of orders in trading of financial interests. In such embodiments the invention provides media useful in a computer system for use by traders of financial interests, the system comprising a computer readable medium or media having programming stored thereon for causing the computer system to receive from a user of the computer system, such as a trader, terms for a proposed trade in a financial interest. The terms include an identification of a financial interest the user wishes to trade, an identification of a reference index, a designation of a reference index limit, a designation of a price operand, and optionally additional terms such as a quantity or order size. The medium or media causes the system to determine, using the designated operand and a current value of the reference index, a price term for the proposed trade; and to make available to other users of the computer system terms of the proposed trade including the identification of the financial interest the user wishes to trade and the determined price, for so long as the reference index maintains a specified relationship to the reference index limit, terms of the proposed trade including the identification of the financial interest the user wishes to trade. Optionally the computer readable medium or media includes programming for causing a computer to redetermine the price term for the proposed trade using the designated operand and a changed value of the reference index; and make available to other users of the computer system terms of the proposed trade including the identification of the financial interest the user wishes to trade and the redetermined price, as described herein.","The invention further provides methods and computer systems for variable pricing and\/or conditional availability of proposals for trading of financial interests as described herein.","Additional aspects of the present invention will be apparent in view of the description which follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","150","101","120","121","150","108","106","150","106"]},"In the example of , server system  is connected to client systems  by a computer communications network such as a proprietary electronic communications network (ECN) or a public network such as the Internet. In practice, any suitable communications link will serve, for example, any computer communications network or other direct or indirect connection. Client servers  are connected to user terminals  by any suitable communications link such as a local or wide area network (LAN or WAN). All connections are by any means or type suitable for use with the invention described herein, such as for example wired, fiber optic, or wireless telecommunications networks. Optionally, systems  include conventional security and communications devices such as data security walls , . Data such as terms for trading proposals are carried between terminals and servers in the form of electronic signals, which are encoded to represent financial data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","100","106","100","106","307","313","100","106","108","120","202"]},"One or more terms may also be supplied by system . For example, if the system provides defaults for types interests to be traded (for example, megawatt-hours on an electricity exchange, stocks on an equity exchange, or currency pairs to be traded on a currency exchange system), or for the index, the user may not be required to provide those items. Optionally where default terms are supplied by the system they are overridable by the user.","The determination at  of whether all required data has been received can also include the type of transaction to be proposed. For example, the user may enter data indicating that the proposed transaction is a bid, an offer, firm or negotiable, or any other type of proposal by entering data in an appropriate data input field. The designation may also be made by the system, as for example by a default, overridable or otherwise.","If any item(s) of required data have not been received, the user is prompted at  to provide missing items. The process -- repeats until all required data are received by the system. Preferably the system  stores the data associated with the terms of the proposal entered by the user in memory such as data base  associated with the system.","At  the system determines whether an acceptable relationship between the index and the index limit have been specified. In general, an acceptable relationship includes any mathematically or financially logical relationship. For example, the system determines whether the index limit is an upper or lower limit, and whether the type of limit specified is compatible with the relationship specified for use in determining whether to make the proposal available to other system users. If the relationship is not sufficiently specified, either by user input, system programming and\/or data, or a combination thereof, at  the user and\/or system is prompted to supply or correct any required data. The process -- continues until the condition  is satisfied.","If the index\/index-limit is supplied in acceptable form, at  the system determines whether the relationship is currently satisfied. This can include, for example, obtaining a current value of the reference index, as for example by reading it from a specified data storage location, and checking the current value of the reference index to determining whether the current value satisfies the specified relationship to the index limit. For example, if the reference index is a stock price, a current price of the stock on a public or private exchange can be accessed and compared to the specified index limit; and if, for a buy order the price is lower than the index limit, then the proposed trade, or terms thereof, can be made available to other users. If the proposed trade is a sell order, and the current value of the reference stock price is above the index limit, the order or terms can be made available.","If the specified relationship is satisfied, at  the system releases, or makes available, terms of the proposal available to other users. To release or make terms of a proposal available is to make them available by any means, device, scheme, or process to any one or more users, either by actively writing or sending them to an appropriate data address or data structure on a client or third-party system (preferably secure) or by storing them within a data structure such as data base  and enabling one or more users  to access the data structure. For example, the terms may be made available by storing them on data base  in such a manner that they may be accessed by users of terminals , for example by reading a current proposal listing, and thereafter displayed on a user display. Or, as another example, the proposal may be made available to other users by e-mailing or otherwise forwarding it to the users, for example, by writing it to one or more client servers  for retrieval by or further forwarding to a user at a terminal .","In some embodiments the terms are formatted according to a protocol, as for example the FINANCIAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE PROTOCOL (FIX) described in a document entitled FINANCIAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE PROTOCOL (FIX), Version 4.2 with Errata 20010501, published May 1, 2001, by FIX Protocol Limited; or the TICKET ORDER FEED PROTOCOL.","If the proposal, or some of its terms, are made available to other users at , at  a determination is made as to whether the proposal has been withdrawn by the entering user or acted upon by another user; or should for any other reason be rendered unavailable to other users. For example, the user entering the proposal can cancel, suspend, or withdraw the order on command, or another user of the system can accept the proposal, indicate an interest in accepting it, open negotiations, or take other action. If the proposal has been withdrawn or accepted, at  suitable further processing takes place. For example, a term of a suspended order may be tagged as temporarily withdrawn by associating a suitable flag with the term data, or the terms may be removed from a data structure available to other users and moved to a non-accessible data structure, or they may be deleted. If the order has been accepted by another user, the order data may be passed to a matching and\/or closing process. Negotiations may be opened by similar means, coupled with enabling the potential trading users to negotiate.","If at  it is determined that there is no reason to render the terms of the order unavailable, it is redetermined at  whether the specified relationship between the index and the index limit have been satisfied, or are still satisfied. Process -- continues until the relationship is no longer satisfied or the proposal is otherwise withdrawn.","If at  it is determined that the specified relationship between the index and the index limit is not satisfied, at  the order is suspended. That is, the order is made or held unavailable to other users, as for example keeping it off or removing it from a data structure available to other system users, or associating the term data with one or more flags indicating that it is not accessible and\/or otherwise causing the order's terms not to be displayed at other users' terminals.","If it is possible for a proposal suspended at  to be reinstated, as for example if the user who entered the proposal has not canceled or suspended it, the determination at  whether the specified relationship between the index and the index limit is made again, and the process - repeats until the relationship is no longer satisfied and reinstatement is no longer possible, or the proposal is otherwise accepted or withdrawn at . If reinstatement is not possible, the process stops for the proposal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["250","252"]},"One or more terms may also be supplied by the system. For example, if the system provides defaults for interests to be traded (for example, on an electricity exchange), or for the index, the user may not be required to provide those items.","The determination at  of whether all required data has been received can also include the type of transaction to be proposed. For example, the user may enter data indicating that the proposed transaction is a bid, an offer, firm or negotiable, or any other type of proposal by entering data in an appropriate data input field. The designation may also be made by the system, as for example implicitly by the type or nature of the trading system, by suitable arrangement of input fields, or by default, overridable or otherwise.","If any item(s) of required data have not been received, the user is prompted at  to provide missing items. The process -- repeats until all required data are received by the system. Preferably the system stores the data associated with the terms of the proposal entered by the user in memory such as data base  associated with the system.","At  the system determines whether an acceptable operator for use in setting, with the reference index and the price operand, a price term has been identified. The operator may be identified interactively by the user entering the proposal, or may be identified by the system, or by both, as for example by entry of the operand within a given input field on a user interface screen; or it may be set by the user by default, overridable or otherwise. The operator may be multiplicative, divisive, additive, subtracted, or of any other suitable type of function, including combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integration, or any other mathematical function. The operand may be expressed in absolute terms (for example, a given dollar offset amount, above or below a current index value) or as a ratio (for example, so many dollars per index point, or a percentage).","If the operator is not sufficiently specified, at  the user and\/or system is prompted to supply any required data. The process -- continues until the condition  is satisfied and data stored appropriately.","At  a current value of the reference index is obtained, as for example by reading current value data from a suitable memory address, or consulting a real-time look-up table, or by reading a live data feed. The current value of the reference index may be obtained from any suitable source.","Once the reference index, the operator, the operand, and a current value of the index are available, at  the system determines a price term for the proposal. If, for example, the reference index is a stock price, and the operand is an additive offset, the system adds the operand to the current stock price value and the result is the price term to be used with the proposed transaction in the identified financial interest. As another example, if the reference index is a financial index such as an average bond price, and the operand is a ratio, the system multiplies the ratio by the current average bond price, and the result is the price term to be proposed.","The price term having been determined, it is associated with other terms of the proposal, as for example by being stored as a part of a single data string, with suitable headers and delimiters, optionally in a standard format such as according to the FIX protocol, and the proposed transaction is made available to other users of the system.","While the proposal is accessible to other users the system, from time to time, periodically or occasionally, obtains an updated vale of the reference index and uses the updated value to redetermine a price for the proposal. As the value of the index changes, the price term changes according to application of the specified operator to the operand. Thus the price term floats with the value of the index, as for example at a constant offset or at an established ratio. Optionally the price may be determined once, and left static, by not causing redetermination of the price.","The process - continues until at  the system determines that the proposal has been accepted or otherwise withdrawn. Withdrawn or accepted proposals are processed accordingly at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["101","150","101","106","307"]},"Interface screen  enables a user to tie, or peg, an order stated in terms of a first currency for trading in a second currency, to a price limit in a third currency, so that terms for a posted order for the first currency are released, or made available, to other traders using the system when, or suspended for so long as, the price of the third currency maintains a specified relationship to the specified limit.","Interface screen  is accessed by entering the command \u201cEMON\u201d at command line  of any BLOOMBERG POWERMATCH\u00ae FX screen accessed at a terminal  connected to the BLOOMBERG POWERMATCH\u00ae FX system.
