{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to security, more particularly a method and a system for effectively securing authecation of an application using a two factor authentication technique.","Generally, banks and\/or financial organizations provide portals for performing various activities. Such activities include at least one of an interaction with a customer, login, t ransaction, event functioning etc. For the customer to perform such activities in the portal they need to furnish one or more credentials. These credentials may be considered as a first level of authentication. Such credentials may include a login user-id for the customer and a dedicated password. However, the first level of authentication for performing such activities are more prone to security risk as the criticality of the activities are higher when compared to other activities organized through an e-commerce and any other online usage. The higher security risk makes it essential to have strong authentication methods. Thus, such web application usage i.e. through accessing portal and others systems provides a need for a second level authentication.","The second level authentication is usually carried out by a token generated through a device or client side software in the portal. These methods pose significant disadvantages such as increased cost for providing the token generating device, installing the software on customer's machine, integrating the software with existing system.","Technically, to secure the activities on portal the authentication process are executed in two levels. In the second level authentication step, the user is asked to input a secondary password dedicated for this purpose along with the user credentials such as the user-id and the dedicated password or it is executed with the secondary password generated by the device that the customer may possess. Some portals may require the customer to enter a combination of the customer details such as birth date, address etc. Some services send the second level password to the customer by text, message, e-mail or other communication means. Few portals may require the customer to send text messages in a prescribed format after finishing the first level of authentication.","The second level of authentication may also be performed through text messages. But, the websites that offers second level of authentication such as way2sms provides sending text messages without possessing a mobile phone.","All such mechanism toughed in the prior art for securing activities of the customer in the portal by the second level authentication pose one or more problem. Such problem may include the further increase in security, as the secondary password is generally communicated through a non encrypted means. Accordingly there is a need for providing stronger second level authentication with reduced cost.","The present invention provides a cost efficient two way authentication method in which the authentication module can be provided as a Plug and Play (PnP) architecture enabling dual layer security with reduced cost where the actions are initiated by server and receiving the user input through audio session for added security.","In one embodiment of the present invention a computer method of authenticating a customer or user at a portal is detailed. The method comprises obtaining the customer credentials through the portal and validating the user based on the obtained credentials as a first level authentication. Subsequently, as a part of second level authentication the invention details generating a code at the portal and establishing an audio session with the customer's registered device to receive the code from the customer for authenticating the user at the portal.","In another embodiment of the present invention, as a part of second level authentication of the customer at the portal, the invention teaches obtaining code from the user through the registered device along with the credentials required for first level authentication, if one or more credentials provided by the customer as a part of first level authentication is wrong.","The invention teaches establishing a session with the customer through their registered devices for receiving the code and thereby minimizes the possibility of fraud which may be inevitable with the teachings in the prior art. Also, the invention can be provided as an independent service so that it can be extended to already existing validation.","The following description is full and informative description of the best method and system presently contemplated for carrying out the present invention, which is known to the inventors at the time of filing the patent application. Of course, many modifications and adaptations will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts in view of the following description, in view of the accompanying drawings and the appended claims. While the system and method described herein are provided with a certain degree of specificity, the present technique may be implemented with either greater or lesser specificity, depending on the needs of the user. Further, some of the features of the present technique may be used to advantage without the corresponding use of other features described in the following paragraphs. As such, the present description should be considered as merely illustrative of the principles of the present technique and not in limitation thereof, since the present technique is defined solely by the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","112","108","114","100"]},"The database  may contain user data, transaction data and code for second level authentication. The user data may include user profile information, contact information to establish an audio session and user preferences. The transaction data may include at least one unique identifier for transaction, transaction data associated with a particular user and authentication flag. The transaction code is a number generated randomly and expires after single usage.","The server  may be employed to pass the necessary details to authentication module through the network .","The authentication module  may initiate the call to validate the user for second level authentication. In one embodiment of the present invention, the authentication module  may be maintained in at least one of cloud environment. In another embodiment of the present invention, the authentication module  may be maintained as a distributed, client-server, peer-to-peer and grid network. Maintaining the authentication module  separate from the deployment part facilitates the authentication module to be hosted as Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Also, it facilitates the module to be integrated with existing validating mechanisms without changes in design.","The portal (not shown) accessed through the computer terminal  may prompt the user to enter the user-id and password. The portal may then send the received user credentials to the server  for validation through the network  to the server . The portal may additionally display the code for a second level authentication, after verifying the authenticity of the user through received user-id and password i.e. checking for the used-id or username with corresponding password. The received user name and the code may be passed to the authentication module  by the server  through the network . The authentication module  may then establishes an audio session with a registered user device  to receive the second level authentication code from the user.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the registered user device  may be a mobile. On receiving the code, by the user through the established audio session the authentication module may compare the code entered by the user and the code displayed by sever . If both the codes are same then the authentication module  may send a flag to sever  specifying valid authentication else the authentication module  may send a flag to the server  specifying invalid authentication.","In one embodiment of the present invention the registered user device is authenticated through an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) or a caller identification number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","214","212","202","207","206","210","200","206","210","204","202"]},"The portal (not shown) accessed through the computer terminal , prompts the user to enter the username and password.
