No. 61\/033,642, filed Mar. 4, 2008; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/039,982, filed Mar. 27, 2008 the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with support from the U.S. government under grant number DE-FG02-07ER46394, awarded by the Department of Energy and grant number NCC3-982, awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and grant number IU54CA 119338, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government may have certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to nano-scale energy harvesting devices and, more specifically, to a device for harvesting energy from muscle action.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Nanotechnology has a substantial potential in the biomedical sciences. Many nanodevices are being developed to work in concert with biological systems. Such systems under development include: devices for diagnosing medical conditions and for treating diseases; sensor systems, such as artificial light and sound sensors; and neural communication systems, such as systems for communicating neural potentials to computers and muscles. Generally, it is expected that nanodevices will become powerful tools in human and animal health treatment in the coming decades.","A reliable power source will be a requirement for almost all such nanosystems. Current possible power sources include batteries and externally-excited generators. While progress has been made in reducing the size of batteries, such progress is limited by the complexity of the components of batteries as they approach the nanoscale. Also, batteries have the disadvantage of requiring periodic replacement or recharging. Externally-excited generators (e.g., radio frequency coils) also have problems with scaling and require an external power source (such as a radio frequency signal generator) to be present for the generator to work.","Therefore, there is a need for a small scale generator that does not require periodic replacement or recharging.","There is also a need for a small scale generator that does not require an external device to generate power.","The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention which, in one aspect, is a method of generating electricity, in which a plurality of living cells are grown on an array of piezoelectric nanowires so that the cells engage the piezoelectric nanowires. Induced static potentials are extracted from at least one of the piezoelectric nanowires when at least one of the cells deforms the at least one of the piezoelectric nanowires.","In another aspect, the invention is a cell-driven electrical generator that includes a substrate. A plurality of spaced-apart piezoelectric nanowires is disposed on the substrate. A plurality of spaced-apart conductive electrodes is disposed on the substrate and in electrical communication with the plurality of piezoelectric nanowires. A biological buffer layer that is configured to promote growth of cells is disposed on the substrate so that cells placed on the substrate will grow and engage the piezoelectric nanowires.","In yet another aspect, the invention is a biologically-driven generator that includes a biocompatible substrate. A plurality piezoelectric nanowires extends upwardly from the substrate. A biological buffer is disposed around a portion of the piezoelectric nanowires. The biological buffer is configured to promote growth of cellular tissue and engagement of cellular tissue with the piezoelectric nanowires. A plurality of conductive electrode tips is disposed so as to engage the plurality of piezoelectric nanowires so that a Schottky barrier exists between selected ones of the plurality of piezoelectric nanowires and selected ones of the plurality of conductive electrode tips when the selected ones of the plurality of piezoelectric nanowires become deformed.","These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the following drawings. As would be obvious to one skilled in the art, many variations and modifications of the invention may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure.","A preferred embodiment of the invention is now described in detail. Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. As used in the description herein and throughout the claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise: the meaning of \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d includes plural reference, the meaning of \u201cin\u201d includes \u201cin\u201d and \u201con.\u201d","Relevant to the disclosure that follows, the growth of ZnO nanorods is disclosed in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/608,865, filed on Dec. 11, 2006 by Wang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,310, issued on May 22, 2007 to Wang et al. and U.S. Pat No. 7,351,607, issued on Apr. 1, 2008 to Wang et al., the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The making of components employed in nanogenerators is generally disclosed in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser.

A plurality of spaced-apart piezoelectric nanowires , such as zinc oxide nanowires, are disposed along a first common orientation on the substrate . A plurality of spaced-apart conductive electrodes  is disposed on the substrate and is in electrical communication with the plurality of piezoelectric nanowires . The plurality of spaced-apart conductive electrodes  are disposed along a second common orientation on the substrate , which is transverse to the first common orientation. A biological buffer layer , which includes a cell nutrient, is configured to promote growth of cells  and is disposed on the substrate . (The selection of the cell nutrient depends on the specific cell type being cultured on the substrate . However, many different nutrients and other cell growth factors, which may be used in the present embodiment, are well known to the biochemical arts.) Cells  placed on the substrate will grow as a result of the biological buffer layer  and will engage the piezoelectric nanowires .","In operation, the living cells (which could be muscle cells) are grown on the substrate  so that they engage the piezoelectric nanowires . When the cells  change shape (e.g., through expanding or contracting), they induce static potentials in the piezoelectric nanowires . Because the conductive electrodes  form a Schottky barrier with the piezoelectric nanowires , the induced static potentials may be extracted from the piezoelectric nanowires .","As shown in , another embodiment may be made by growing piezoelectric nanowires , such as zinc oxide nanowires, vertically from a biocompatible substrate . The substrate  could include a material such as, for example, Si, SiO, Au, Ti, a polymer, PDMS, and SU8. A biocompatible insulation layer  is disposed about a bottom portion of each of the plurality of piezoelectric nanowires . The biocompatible insulation layer  could include such materials as SiO, SU8, and SiN coated by PDMS. The biocompatible insulation layer  could be applied as a layer and then etched using known photolithographic techniques to achieve the coating at the base of the nanowires . The substrate , the nanowires  and the insulation  is placed in a biological buffer  that promotes cell  growth and cellular engagement with the piezoelectric nanowires .","As shown in  and A-B, a plurality of conductive electrode tips  is placed opposite of the exposed portion of the piezoelectric nanowires . When the piezoelectric nanowires  are in contact with the conductive electrode tips , a Schottky barrier will form therebetween so that current will flow in a single direction when the piezoelectric nanowires  become deformed. A configuration used with expanding cells  is show in . A cell at rest is shown in , whereas the effect on an electrical load  by an expanded cell  is shown in . A configuration used with contracting cells  is shown in . A cell  at rest is shown in , whereas the contracted cell  is shown in .","A micrograph of a piezoelectric nanowire  coupled between two conductive electrodes  is shown in . A plurality of conductive electrode tips  extending from a substrate  is shown in .","The above described embodiments, while including the preferred embodiment and the best mode of the invention known to the inventor at the time of filing, are given as illustrative examples only. It will be readily appreciated that many deviations may be made from the specific embodiments disclosed in this specification without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
