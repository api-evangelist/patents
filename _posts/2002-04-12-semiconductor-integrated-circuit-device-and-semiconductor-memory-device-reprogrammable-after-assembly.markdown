Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to semiconductor integrated circuit devices capable of storing data for example of a memory circuit and semiconductor memory devices using the same.","2. Description of the Background Art","If a memory circuit such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has defect, a semiconductor integrated circuit device with such a memory circuit mounted thereon is not allowed to be shipped as a product. However, producing a defectless product is disadvantageously associated with significantly reduced yield.","Conventionally, such a defect can be replaced by a spare memory cell. More specifically it is typically substituted by a previously arranged memory cell for redundant repair substitution.","More specifically, for a memory circuit with memory cells arranged in an array of rows and columns, a spare plurality of rows and columns are provided and a defective memory cell or line can be substituted with a spare line and thus repaired to increase the yield of defectless chips on a wafer.","This system requires for example that in conducting an in-line test of a wafer any defective addresses be previously programmed and the wafer be then divided into chips and assembled, and thereafter when it is actually used, row and column addresses input be constantly monitored and when a defective address input is detected it be substituted with a spare line.","One such internal circuit generally used is a fuse bank-address detection circuit using laser to cut a polysilicon interconnection, aluminum interconnection and the like, as described for example in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. SC-18, No. 5, October 1983, pp. 441-446.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":"9000"},"Between an internal node n and a ground potential is connected a set of a fuse element F and a transistor  having a gate receiving an internal address signal al and connected in series with fuse element F. For each of an inverted version of internal address signal al, or an internal address signal \/a, and other internal address signals a, \/a to am, \/am, there is also provided a respective set of one of similar fuse elements F-Fm and one of similar transistors T-Tm.","Internal node n is provided with a precharge transistor TP activated by a signal RP to precharge a level of node N.","In other words, in a decoder of a spare line (hereinafter referred to as a spare decoder) complementary internal addresses are input to the gates of transistors T-Tm.","Of fuse elements F-Fm, a fuse element corresponding to a defective address is previously cut by laser to program the defective address. When an input address and the programmed, defective address match, an inactivation indicating signal \u03c6DA is output to a regular decoder connected to the defective line, to substitute the defective line with a spare line.","Conventional fuse bank-address detection circuit  is disadvantageous as it requires an expensive laser cutter device and the precision in cutting a fuse is also concerned. Such disadvantages are conventionally overcome by an anti-fuse address detection circuit  using an anti-fuse in the form of an electrical fuse.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":"9100"},"As shown in , anti-fuse address detection circuit  includes an inverter INV with an internal node n and an input node coupled, an inverter INV receiving an output from inverter INV in a signal SOUT. Inverter INV includes a P channel MOS transistor PQ and an N channel MOS transistor NQ coupled in series between a power supply potential VCC and a ground potential. Transistors PQ and NQ have their respective gates both receiving signal SOUT. Inverters INVs and  together form a latch circuit. An n channel MOS transistor NQ is provided between internal nodes N and N and has a gate receiving power supply potential Vcc.","Furthermore between node N and a program signal Vpgm is connected a capacitance element AF operating as an anti-fuse element.","Furthermore between node N and power supply potential Vcc is provided a P channel MOS transistor PQ having a gate receiving a precharge signal PG. Between node N and a ground potential is provided an N channel MOS transistor NQ having a gate receiving a signal SA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 31-33","FIG. 30"],"b":"9100"},"Initially with reference to  a fuse blow operation will be described.","At time t1 program signal PG is set low and transistor PQ turns on. Thus the latch circuit formed by inverter INV and transistors PQ and NQ is initialized, and node N attains a high level.","Then at time t2 program signal PG is set low and signal SA is subsequently set high. Thus, after the latch circuit's node N held low, signal SA is set low.","Then at time t3 signal Vpgm is input in a high voltage VCCH. With node N having the low level, transistor NQ thus turns on and node N is driven low.","Between opposite terminals of fuse element AF a difference in potential of program potential Vpgm is introduced. Thus, fuse element AF, receiving a high voltage, would receive high voltage VCCH higher than a breakdown voltage, and thus have breakdown and hence short-circuit.","At time t4 short circuit is introduced, and node N gradually goes high. When a logical value of inverter INV is exceeded, a level held by the latch circuit is inverted. When the latch circuit is inverted and node N goes high, the transistor NQ gate attains a potential equal to that of node N and transistor NQ has a gate-source voltage Vgs of zero volt, and transistor NQ turns off. Since transistor NQ is shut down, current does not flow to the ground from a node receiving signal Vpgm, after fuse element AF has blown.","Herein, inverting a level held by the latch circuit entails a fuse resistance having the same level as the ON resistance of transistor NQ.","Reference will now be made to  to describe an operation provided when fuse element AF is not blown.","At the time t1 signal PG is driven low and the latch circuit is initialized.","At time t2 signal PG is set high to allow the latch circuit to have node N held high.","Furthermore at time t3 signal Vpgm is applied in voltage VCCH higher than power supply voltage Vcc.","However, node N has the high level and the transistor NQ gate receives a high level (the power supply potential VCC level), and transistor NQ thus has a source-gate voltage of 0V and it thus has an OFF state. Thus, node N applies high voltage Vpgm to transistor NQ at the drain and simultaneously rises to potential Vpgm through coupling. Thus also between node N and voltage Vpgm a voltage of approximately 0V is attained and the fuse element thus does not break down.","Reference will now be made to  to describe a read operation of anti-fuse address detection circuit .","Initially, signal Vpgm and signal PG are set high (the power supply voltage Vcc level). Then between time t1 and time t2 signal SA is driven high to initialize the latch circuit. In response, node N attains a low level.","At time t2 signal SA attains a low level and if a fuse is not blown node N is held low.","If a fuse has been blown, the node N potential rises from a low level to a potential equal to potential Vpgm since transistor NQ conducts and fuse element AF is short-circuited, and when the node N potential exceeds a logical threshold value of inverter INV the latch is inverted and node N is held high. These two latch states can be used to program address decision, circuit-tuning, and the like.","As has been described above, in laser-trimming a fuse, a beam of laser is directed to a wire of an LSI still in the form of a wafer to blow the wire and thus program a defective address. If a defect is introduced after packaging, however, the LSI chip of interest in the package cannot receive a beam of laser and it thus cannot be repaired by a laser-trimming fuse (hereinafter referred to as an \u201cLT fuse\u201d). In other words, a semiconductor integrated circuit having been divided into chips and packaged cannot be trimmed if its fuse are adapted to be optically, externally heated and thus cut.","For an electrical fuse, in contrast, stress is applied to a capacitance to program a state, and programming a defective address is thus time-consuming and increases cost relative to time. Furthermore, blowing an electrical fuse requires applying a high voltage. Reliably blowing an electrical fuse requires a high voltage to be applied. However, if the voltage is increased too high, a transistor other than the fuse element receives voltage and a gate which is not subject to destruction may be destroyed. As such, too high a voltage should not be applied.","Thus, for an LT fuse, a beam of laser is used to cut a wire on a wafer to program a defective address. If a defect is introduced after packaging, however, a conventional LT fuse alone cannot repair the defective address.","Furthermore, if an electrical fuse is alone used, stress is applied to a capacitance for destruction, and it is thus time-consuming to program an address to be repaired and it is thus difficult to program it reliably and also in a short period of time.","The present invention contemplates a semiconductor integrated circuit device and semiconductor memory device capable of a program operation in a short period of time reliably.","The present invention generally provides a semiconductor integrated circuit device storing program data therein and outputting data corresponding to the program data stored, including: a plurality of fuse elements capable of optically blowing; a plurality of fuse read circuits provided to correspond to the plurality of fuse elements, respectively, and each changing an output level in response to whether a corresponding one of the fuse elements has been blown; an electrical program circuit capable of storing the program data therein when an external electrical signal is applied; and a switch circuit capable of setting in a non-volatile manner which one of an output of the plurality of fuse read circuits and an output of the electrical program circuit to be output as data corresponding to the program data.","The present invention in another aspect provides a semiconductor integrated circuit device storing program data therein and outputting data corresponding to the program data stored, including: a first fuse program circuit having a plurality of first fuse elements and capable of receiving an external electrical signal to cut off the plurality of first fuse elements to store the program data therein; and a second fuse program circuit having a plurality of second fuse elements and capable of receiving an external electrical signal to cut off the plurality of second fuse elements to rewrite the program data stored in the first fuse program circuit.","The present invention in still another aspect provides a semiconductor memory device including: a memory cell array having a plurality of memory cell arrays arranged in rows and columns, the memory cell array including a regular memory cell array and a spare memory cell array; a regular memory cell select circuit operative in response to an address signal to select a memory cell in the regular memory cell array; a spare memory cell select circuit operative in response to a result of comparing previously stored program data and the address signal, to select a memory cell in the spare memory cell array rather than a memory cell in the regular memory cell array; and a program circuit storing therein the program data in a non-volatile manner, the program circuit including a first non-volatile program circuit having a plurality of first fuse elements to store the program data herein, and a second non-volatile program circuit capable of storing the program data therein in a non-volatile manner in response to an external electrical signal being applied to rewrite the program data stored in the first fuse program circuit.","Advantageously the present semiconductor integrated circuit device still in the form of a wafer can use a fuse element to effect programming and the device after it is packaged can use an electrical fuse to effect programming for repair to change program information in response to a variation introduced after the programming effected by the fuse element. Thus the final yield of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be increased.","Advantageously the present semiconductor memory device still in the form of a wafer can use a fuse element to effect programming to repair a defect and the device after it is packaged can use an electrical to repair a defect. Thus the yield of the device can be increased efficiently. Furthermore the present semiconductor memory device can use an electrical fuse to reprogram one repaired by a fuse element and even after assembly it can flexibly effect programming to repair a defective memory cell more efficiently.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Hereinafter the embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"1000"},"As will be apparent from the following description, the present invention can provide a program circuit applicable not only to a semiconductor chip with DRAM  alone integrated thereon but also to a semiconductor chip with a DRAM and a logic circuit integrated thereon.

Address buffer  responds to address signals A-An and when it receives a row address it generates a row-related predecode signal RA<>-RA<i>, wherein i is a natural number. When address buffer  receives a column address it generates a predecode signal CA<>-CA<i>.","A command decode circuit  receives a signal from address buffer  and a command signal via an external control signal input terminal group , such as a row address strobe signal \/RAS, a column address strobe signal \/CAS, a write enable signal \/WE and the like, and outputs an internal control signal int.
