{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION INCLUDING BEST MODE","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY","APPENDIX A","APPENDIX B","An Examples of Stored Meta-Data for an Audio CD"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to the retrieval of audio-visual data, and in particular, fragments of data from an audio-visual resource.","The advent of technology providing mass-market access to the Internet places vast amounts of on-line information within relatively easy reach. The World Wide Web (WWW) (hereunder, the Web) underpins much of the growth of Internet use, particularly because of the ease of use, and also due to the intuitive user interface presented by Web browsers. Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) are a ubiquitous addressing feature used to locate target resources in the Web context. This is particularly relevant when Web pages are used in conjunction with a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripting application, which allows the Web page to become, in essence, the front end of a myriad of databases accessible over the Internet.","Notwithstanding the explosive progress described however, a Web user is, in most cases, unable to \u201cdrill down\u201d beyond a certain level of data, and must, in many cases, down-load an inconveniently large and cumbersome amount of information in order to locate useful information. Illustrating this fact, consider investigating all flights from London to Moscow departing from Heathrow airport on a given date. In order to make a selection based on a number of criteria such as departure time, airline, number of stops and so on, a long list of flights typically needs to be down-loaded and scanned, either manually or using a back-end application on a local personal computer (PC).","Further exemplifying the problem, certain types of data such as, for example, audio-visual (AV) data, typically manifest themselves as monolithic blocks of information. The internal structure of such data, whether it be a particular video segment, or fragment, in a movie, or a specific movement in a symphony, is neither visible, nor addressable, or consequently accessible in terms of fragments.","Taking a more extreme example, off-line audio-visual data, in the form of celluloid film archives, paper-based libraries, and a wealth of other sources, are also not addressable, and are thus invisible and inaccessible at the \u201cfragment\u201d level. Although particular books can be located, by call number and location in a library, specific chapters thereof are not visible or addressable, and consequently, not accessible.","Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a drill down capability for a limited sub-set of on-line information, namely information which is coded in XML. The overwhelming bulk of available information has been produced in other programming formats such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), or alternatively, is in hard copy form in physical archives and libraries. The aforementioned types of information are referred to as \u201clegacy\u201d information.","Australian Patent No. 759681 discloses an approach referred to as AV addressing (being a shorthand way of referring to audio-visual addressing) for addressing audio-visual fragments by constructing a logical model for the class of audio-visual resources of interest. In accordance with the EBNF syntax convention adopted at [42], this addressing scheme is also referred to as the \u201cmp\u201d addressing scheme.","The logical model is used to form a hierarchical representation of the audio-visual resource including a representation of the audio-visual fragment of interest. A fragment identifier is used in an addressing scheme that is capable of addressing fragments of the audio-visual resource. Evaluating an audio-visual fragment identifier can be difficult, however, as the disclosed approach does not deal with well-defined tokens of a single media format. Instead the approach is concerned with multiple media formats and logical units that are conceptual rather than physical in nature. Furthermore, the semantics of the disclosed audio-visual addressing scheme can lead to very complex expressions which are difficult to resolve.","It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome, or at least ameliorate, one or more disadvantages of existing arrangements.","According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of retrieving a plurality of resource fragments from a audio-visual resource that is encoded using a hierarchical addressing model for the class of resources of which the audio-visual resource is a member, the method comprising the steps of:","inputting a URI reference comprising a Universal Resource Name and a complex fragment identifier comprising a plurality of audio-visual resource specific location steps;","locating the audio-visual resource using the Universal Resource Name;","establishing a logical representation of the structure of the audio-visual resource; and","iteratively evaluating the fragment identifier location steps against the logical representation to resolve the complex fragment identifier into a set of explicit fragment references configured to explicitly address each of the plurality of resource fragments.","According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an apparatus for retrieving a plurality of resource fragments from a audio-visual resource that is encoded using a hierarchical addressing model for the class of resources of which the audio-visual resource is a member, the apparatus comprising:","means for inputting a URI reference comprising a Universal Resource Name and a complex fragment identifier comprising a plurality of audio-visual resource specific location steps;","means for locating the audio-visual resource using the Universal Resource Name;","means for establishing a logical representation of the structure of the audio-visual resource; and","means for iteratively evaluating the fragment identifier location steps against the logical representation to resolve the complex fragment identifier into a set of explicit fragment references configured to explicitly address each of the plurality of resource fragments.","According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an apparatus for retrieving a plurality of resource fragments from a audio-visual resource that is encoded using a hierarchical addressing model for the class of resources of which the audio-visual resource is a member, the apparatus comprising:","a memory for storing a program;

and","code for iteratively evaluating the fragment identifier location steps against the logical representation to resolve the complex fragment identifier into a set of explicit fragment references configured to explicitly address each of the plurality of resource fragments.","According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a computer program product including a computer readable medium having recorded thereon a computer program for directing a processor to execute a method for retrieving a plurality of resource fragments from a audio-visual resource that is encoded using a hierarchical addressing model for the class of resources of which the audio-visual resource is a member, the program comprising:","code for inputting a URI reference comprising a Universal Resource Name and a complex fragment identifier comprising a plurality of audio-visual resource specific location steps;","code for locating the audio-visual resource using the Universal Resource Name;","code for establishing a logical representation of the structure of the audio-visual resource; and","code for iteratively evaluating the fragment identifier location steps against the logical representation to resolve the complex fragment identifier into a set of explicit fragment references configured to explicitly address each of the plurality of resource fragments.","Other aspects of the invention are also disclosed.","APPENDIX A presents examples of pre-defined logical (XML) models for CDAudio and DVD-Video; and","APPENDIX B presents an example of meta-data for an Audio CD.","Where reference is made in any one or more of the accompanying drawings to steps and\/or features, which have the same reference numerals, those steps and\/or features have for the purposes of this description the same function(s) or operation(s), unless the contrary intention appears.","It is to be noted that the discussions contained in the \u201cBackground\u201d section and that above relating to prior art arrangements relate to discussions of documents which form public knowledge through their publication.

More complex fragment identifiers can also be constructed, in which a single fragment identifier returns more than one audio-visual content fragment (eg see [8]-[11]).","Having provided an illustrative description of the disclosed AV addressing approach, a more detailed description is now provided. XML is utilised as a basis for describing a preferred arrangement of the disclosed AV addressing approach. This is both from the standpoint of conceptual and notational convenience, and also because XML has significant support as a recommendation in the context of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).","It is shown how in one arrangement the XML Path Language (XPath), can be extended and used in an AV addressing approach in order to locate fragments of non XML-based audio-visual content.","The XML Linking Language (XLink) uses URI's for locating objects. In principle, modified URIs can be used for locating any resource that has identity, for instance, an electronic document, an image, a service, a collection of other resources, a person, an corporation, or a bound book in a library. Each resource corresponds to an entity or set of entities in a conceptual model. URI's can therefore be used for locating or referencing resources other than XML documents. However, the XPath and XML Pointer Langauge (XPointer) schemes that XLink currently uses for addressing the internal structure of data objects can only be used to locate fragments of XML documents.","As an introduction, the use of XLink, XPointer, and XPath, are considered in the limited context of XML documents. XPath models an XML document as a tree of nodes. There are seven types of nodes, namely root nodes, element nodes, text nodes, attribute nodes, namespace nodes, processing instruction nodes and comment nodes. XPath uses a compact, non-XML syntax to facilitate the use of XPath within URI's. An XPath location path consists of a \u2018\/\u2019-separated list of location steps. Each location step has the form:\n\naxis::node-test [predicate*]\u2003\u2003[1]\n","where axis specifies the tree relationship between the nodes selected by the location step and the context node; node-test specifies the node type or the name; and predicate refines the set of nodes selected by the location step. A location step may specify one or more predicates each enclosed in a pair of square brackets. Boolean expressions of XPath functions and XPath location paths may be used in a predicate to further refine the set of nodes selected by the location step. Take the example of the absolute location path, \/child::para[position( )=1], child is the name of the axis, para is the node test and [position( )=1] is a predicate that uses the XPath function position( ). As a second example, the relative location path para[attribute::type=\u201cwarning\u201d] selects all para children of the context node that have a type attribute with value \u201cwarning\u201d and the expression para[attribute::type=\u201cwarning\u201d][5] selects the fifth para child of the context node that has a type attribute with value \u201cwarning\u201d.","A number of syntactic abbreviations allow common cases to be expressed concisely as follows:\n\n@ is short for attribute::, e.g. attribute::type can be abbreviated as @type, \u2003\u2003[2]\n\n\/\/is short for\/descendant-or-self::node( )\/, \u2003\u2003[3]\n\n.is short for self::node( ), and \u2003\u2003[4]\n\n..is short for parent::node( ). \u2003\u2003[5]\n","An axis specifies the tree relationship between the nodes selected by the location step and the context node. XPath axes include child, parent, descendant, ancestor, following-sibling, preceding-sibling, following, preceding, attribute, namespace, self descendant-or-self and ancestor-or-self The default is the child axis. XPointer extends XPath adding the string and range axes.","A node test specifies the node type or the name (such as the name of an element or an attribute) of the nodes selected by the location step.","There can be zero or more predicates for refining the set of nodes selected by the location step. Predicates are evaluated for each candidate location along the specified axis, and typically test the element type, attributes, positions, and\/or other properties of the candidate nodes.","A function library provides a set of predicate functions such as count( ), position( ), id( ), last( ), etc. Each function takes zero or more arguments and returns a single result. Like XPointer, a new scheme can define new functions to extend the core functions of XPath.","Each location step is evaluated with respect to a context. The context is initially the document root, or more generally the results of a prior location step. The node set selected by the location step is the node set that results from generating an initial node set from the axis and node test, and then filtering that node-set by each of the predicates in turn.","Some examples of XPath location paths are as follows:\n\n\/doc\/chapter[2]\/section[3]\u2003\u2003[6]\n\nselects the third section of the second chapter of doc\n\nchapter[contains(string(title), \u201cOverview\u201d]\u2003\u2003[7]\n\nselects the chapter children of the context node that have one or more title children containing the text \u201cOverview\u201d\n\nchild::*[self::appendix or self::index]\u2003\u2003[8]\n\nselects the appendix and index children of the context node\n\nchild::*[self::chapter or self::appendix][position( )=first( )]\u2003\u2003[9]\n\nselects the first chapter and appendix children of the context node\n\npara[@type=\u201cwarning\u201d]\u2003\u2003[10]\n\nselects all para children of the context node that have a type attribute with value \u201cwarning\u201d:\n\npara[@id]\u2003\u2003[11]\n\nselects all the para children of the context node that have an id attribute.\n","XPath operates on the logical structure of an XML document, this logical structure being defined either explicitly by a Document Type Definition (DTD), or implicitly by arrangement of tags. For instance, the examples given in the previous section assumed an XML document with the structure, in Extended Backus-Naur Form (ENBF) as follows:\n\ndoc::=toc chapter+appendix*index \u2003\u2003[12]\n\nchapter::=section+\u2003\u2003[13]\n\nsection::=para+\u2003\u2003[14]\n\nappendix::=section+\u2003\u2003[15]\n\nwhere \u201ctoc\u201d means \u201ctable of contents\u201d, \u201c+\u201d means \u201cone or more, \u201c*\u201d means zero or more\u201d, and the composite description presented above describes, in expanded form, a document comprising a table of contents, one or more chapters, zero or more appendices, and an index, where each chapter comprises one or more sections, where each section comprises one or more paragraphs, and finally where each appendix comprises one or more sections.\n","In an XML document, each of these structures is marked by a pair of appropriately named tags. The tag markup allows the logical structure of the document to be determined unambiguously. Hence, any application that understands the syntax of XML can determine the location of the document's components. Any application that understands the XPath and XPointer notations can use an URI with an XPath\/XPointer fragment identifier to locate parts of the document.","Audio-visual, or AV content, is not stored as XML documents and cannot be marked up. However, given an unambiguous logical structure, or model, a modified XPath location\/addressing method (referred to herein as an AV addressing method) can be used. Hence, for each class of AV content, in the first instance, an unambiguous logical structure must be defined, and in order to make it widely accessible, the logical structure should preferably be published. By an unambiguous logical structure or model, it is meant that different persons and applications will segment given content in exactly the same way given the model.","Considering one type of AV content, for instance, Digital Video format as used by digital video cameras, this can be modelled as:\n\ndv::=frame* \u2003\u2003[16]\n\nwhere this means a digital video comprising one or more frames.\n","In the case, for example, where compatible digital video cameras generate meta-data to represent and record the instances the camera starts recording (designated a REC event), a shot can be defined as an interval between two REC event. In this case, the model for DV format is:\n\ndv::=shot* \u2003\u2003[17]\n\nshot::=frame+\u2003\u2003[18]\n\nmeaning a digital video comprising zero or more shots, each shot comprising one or more frames.\n","As another example, the logical structure of Compact Disc Audio can be modelled as follows:\n\nCDAudio::=track* \u2003\u2003[19]\n\ntrack::=channel channel index* \u2003\u2003[20]\n\nchannel :=sample* \u2003\u2003[21]\n\nmeaning an audio CD comprising zero or more tracks, each track comprising two channels, and zero or more indices, and each channel comprising zero or more samples.\n","Considering a more complex example, consider Digital Video Disc, or DVD, video which can provide:","over 2 hours of high-quality digital video (over 8 on a double-sided, dual-layer disc),",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["up to 8 tracks of digital audio, each with as many as 8 channels","up to 32 subtitle\/karaoke tracks","up to 9 camera angles (different viewpoints) can be selected during playback","up to 32 separate subpicture channels"]}}}},"Other data types include Video Manager Information files, Video Title Set files, Program Chain Information files, still picture Video Objects, attributes for Title, Part_of_Titles, and Menus, Time Map Tables, Part_of_Title Search Pointers, and Navigation Commands.","DVD-Video content is broken into titles and chapters (or parts of titles). Titles are made up of cells linked together by one or more program chains (PGC). Individual cells can be used by more than one PGC. Different PGCs define different sequences through mostly the same material. Additional material for camera angles and branching is interleaved together in small chunks. The DVD player jumps from chunk to chunk, skipping over unused angles or branches, to stitch together the seamless video.","One logical model for DVD-Video is:\n\ndvdVideo::=mainMenu? title* subpicture* file* \u2003\u2003[22]\n\nmainMenu::=menu* \u2003\u2003[23]\n\nmenu::=menu* \u2003\u2003[24]\n\ntitle::=chapter+\u2003\u2003[25]\n\nchapter::=view+audio+subtitle* \u2003\u2003[26]\n\nview::=frame+\u2003\u2003[27]\n\naudio::=channel+\u2003\u2003[28]\n\nchannel::=sample+\u2003\u2003[29]\n","The previous logical models each relate to a class of AV content, namely digital video, compact disc audio, and digital video disk. As noted, the application of the logical models to the associated AV content produces hierarchical representations of the AV content which supports addressing of fragments of the content. A more detailed description of the AV addressing approach is provided commencing at [42].","Turning to the aspect of addressing, each location step is evaluated with respect to a context. The context is initially the root node, dvdVideo in this case. In general, the context is the results of a prior location step.

If this is the case, then the process follows a \u201cYES\u201d arrow to a step  which constructs an XML model  of the resource  which is referenced by the first location step. The step  firstly determines whether the first (ie the \u201croot\u201d) location step has a spatio-temporal axis (indicating that the resource being referenced by the URI  is an audio-visual resource) or a non- spatio-temporal axis (indicating that the resource being referenced by the URI  is not an audio-visual resource). If the root location step has a non-spatio-temporal axis, then the resource  is deemed to be associated with a pre-defined logical model stored, for example, in a database  (see ). Examples of pre-defined logical models for CDAudio and DVD-Video are presented in APPENDIX A. Such pre-defined logical models are typically industry-standards set, for example, by the record and film industry. If, on the other hand, the root location step is a spatio-temporal axis, then a logical model for the resource  is determined, by inference, from the resource URI  and from meta-data associated with the resource . An example of meta-data for an Audio CD is presented in APPENDIX B. Accordingly, if the root location step has a spatio-temporal axis, the step  collects, from meta-data on the resource or associated with the resource  and stored, for example, in the database  (see ), information that is relevant to the proposed logical model for the resource . The step  uses this collected information to construct the XML representation  of the resource .","Therefore in summary, the step  provides the logical model  for the resource , this model being either pre-defined if the root location step is non-spatio-temporal, or inferred from the URI of the resource or from meta-data associated with the resource  if the root location step is spatio-temporal.","Thereafter, for each location step (apart from the first step) and in a manner similar to that used in a typical XPath evaluator, the evaluator  projects, in a step , the currently selected node set  to the axis specified by the location step. Thereafter, a step  evaluates the node test to select the nodes' projections on the new axis. For the present example [54A] the selected node set  initially contains all <Track> elements. The step  adds the Attribute start_time to the first track. Following the step , the selected node set has been refined to a first <Track> element only. A following step  evaluates the predicates one by one to refine the selected node set.","In the case of spatio-temporal axes it is impractical to define the XML elements to the level required to represent discrete time units as well as pixels and voxels.

It should be noted that, in the example, the selected node set  is depicted in [ ] in the form of XML elements for illustration purposes. In practice however the selected node set  is typically implemented as software objects using programming languages such as Java and C++. Once the selected node set  is completely defined, the Content Processor  can invoke various basic operations such as play, copy, etc. that are supported by the object. The \u201cobject\u201d referred to is the software object in terms of which, as noted in regard to , the term explicit fragment reference is defined, these software objects being usable to explicitly direct processes and\/or devices to play or retrieve the desired AV fragment(s) addressed by the fragment identifier. For instance, a class of objects AudioTrackFragment may be implemented to represent nodes selected from an AudioCD logical model, and AudioTrackFragment has a play method which calls the system operation ","With this approach, complex XPath syntax and semantics are handled by the underlying XPath evaluator . Extensions to the \u201cmp\u201d Audiovisual Addressing scheme only require incremental changes to the \u201cmp\u201d Fragment Evaluator  by modifying the affected node-test step  and predicate function step  or implementing new node-test and predicate functions. While new logical models can be supported by adding code to construct the XML representation of the logical model in the step .","The \u201cmp\u201d Fragment Evaluator  provides a further advantage. The selected node set  compiled by the evaluator  can be output in XML form and examined. This enables the \u201cmp\u201d fragment identifier represented by the selected node set  to be validated by checking that the intended fragments are to be selected from the resource  without requiring the presence of the actual resource . For instance, in the above example, the following XML representation of the final set of selected nodes  can be used to verify that the initial \u201cmp\u201d fragment identifier [54B] actually does select the fragments that are intended to be retrieved:\n\n<Track type=\u201caudio\u201d number=\u201c1\u201d start_frame=\u201c0\u201d mp:start_time=\u201c30\u201d\/>\u2003\u2003[63]\n","To illustrate how the approach of  can deal with complex XPath syntax and semantics with ease.
