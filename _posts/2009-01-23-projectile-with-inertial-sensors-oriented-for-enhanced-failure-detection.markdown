Field","This disclosure relates to guided projectiles.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventional artillery shells are projectiles that are fired from an artillery piece or other launcher and travel on a ballistic trajectory towards an intended target. A ballistic trajectory is a flight path that is governed by forces and conditions external to the projectile, such as the velocity provided at launch, gravity, air drag, temperature, wind, humidity, and other factors. A guided projectile is a projectile that exercises some degree of self-control over its trajectory. Typically, guided projectiles deploy some form of control surfaces after launch and use these control surfaces to control the trajectory. Guided projectiles may home on some feature of the intended target, such as a reflection of a laser designator beam. Guided projectiles may be programmed to navigate to specific geographic coordinates using one or more of inertial sensors, GPS positioning, and other navigation methods.","Throughout this description, elements appearing in figures are assigned three-digit reference designators, where the most significant digit is the figure number and the two least significant digits are specific to the element. An element that is not described in conjunction with a figure may be presumed to have the same characteristics and function as a previously-described element having a reference designator with the same least significant digits.","Referring now to , a guided projectile  may include a projectile body  which may be symmetrical about a longitudinal axis . The longitudinal axis  may be aligned with the direction of flight of the projectile at launch. The longitudinal axis  may deviate slightly from the direction of flight during subsequent guided flight. A plurality of fins  may extend from the projectile body. The fins  may be effective to stabilize the flight of the projectile. The fins  may extend from the projectile body  at or near the back of the projectile body .","One or more control surfaces  may extend from the projectile body . The one or more control surfaces  may be effective to control, to at least some degree, the flight of the projectile . In the example of , the control surfaces  are shown as a plurality of canards or fins extending from the projectile body  near the front of the projectile body . Other types of control surfaces, including drag brakes or scoops, wings, and fins disposed at other locations on the projectile body may be used to control the flight of the projectile. In some instances, the fins  may also function as the control surfaces .","The fins  and control surfaces  may be retained within the projectile body  prior to and during launch. The fins and control surfaces may not necessarily be enclosed by the projectile body but may be folded within the general outline of the projectile body such that the projectile may be launched from the barrel of an artillery piece or other launcher. The fins  and control surfaces  may be automatically or electively deployed or extended after launch. For example, the fins  may be automatically deployed after launch to stabilize the projectile. With only the fins  deployed, the projectile  may follow a ballistic flight path. Subsequently, the control surfaces  may be electively deployed when the guided portion of the projectile flight begins.","The projectile body  may enclose an explosive payload (not shown) and a control system (not shown) to control the flight of the projectile using the control surfaces . The projectile body  may also enclose a navigation system which may include an inertial measurement unit  to measure projectile motion parameters such as acceleration and angular rate. In a conventional guided projectile, an inertial measurement unit typically measures motion parameters with respect to mutually orthogonal x, y, and z axes, one of which (the x axis in ) would be aligned with the longitudinal axis  of the missile body . The other  sensor axes may be aligned to the rotation axes of the control surfaces . Typical inertial measurement units include, for example, accelerometers to measure linear acceleration along the orthogonal x, y, and z axes and gyroscopes or other rate sensors to measure rotation rate about the orthogonal x, y, and z axes.","The missile body  may enclose other navigation equipment (not shown) such as a GPS receiver. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,883,747 B2 describes a projectile guided by a combination of a GPS receiver and an internal inertial measurement unit. The missile body  may also enclose one or more sensors (not shown), such as a semi-active laser (SAL) guidance system, to guide the projectile to a target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["220","120","225","225","225","225","225","225","225","225","225","220","205"],"i":["i","j","k ","i","j","k ","i","j","k "]},"The benefit of the inertial measurement unit  may be understood by considering the motion of the projectile shortly after launch. During launch, the projectile and the inertial measurement unit may be subject to extremely high acceleration which may, on occasion, damage the motion sensors within the inertial measurement unit. Thus the motion sensors are typically not used during launch, but are activated shortly after launch. Shortly after launch, the projectile may experience deceleration along the longitudinal axis \/ due to atmospheric drag. In additional, many projectiles are caused to rotate or roll about the longitudinal axis \/ during launch. Thus, shortly after launch, a typical inertial measurement unit, which has the x axis parallel to the projectile axis  and the y and z axes orthogonal to the projectile axis , may measure deceleration along the x axis and rotation about the x axis, but nearly no motion with respect to either the y or z axes. Thus it may not be possible to determine, shortly after launch, if a prior art inertial measurement unit is functioning and capable of correctly measuring motion parameters with respect to the y and z axes.","Referring again to , deceleration along the projectile longitudinal axis  will have a measurable component along each of the mutually orthogonal i, j, and k axes since the i, j, and k axes are all oriented oblique to the projectile longitudinal axis .  shows the acceleration of an exemplary projectile immediately after launch. As shown in , accelerometers oriented along orthogonal i, j, and k axes will measure deceleration (negative acceleration) Ai, Aj, Ak immediately after launch. In this example, it is assumed that the angles between the i, j, and k axes and the longitudinal axis of the projectile are equal. In contrast, with conventionally oriented sensors, only the accelerometer oriented along the x axis measures the initial deceleration Ax of the projectile.","Further, due to the orientation of the i, j, and k axes, the roll about the projectile axis  will also have a measurable rotation rate component about each of the mutually orthogonal i, j, and k axes.  shows the angular rate of the exemplary projectile immediately after launch. As shown in , rate sensors oriented along orthogonal i, j, and k axes will measure a component Ri, Rj, Rk, respectively, of roll about the longitudinal axis after launch. In contrast, with conventionally oriented sensors, only the rate sensor oriented along the x axis measures the initial roll Rx of the projectile.","Thus, shortly after launch, each of the sensor suites , , may measure a component of the deceleration along the projectile axis  and each of the sensor suites , , may measure a component of the roll about the projectile axis  if roll is introduced during launch. Thus the performance of the sensor suites , , may be verified by comparing the acceleration and\/or rotation rate values measured by each sensor suite. If the inertial measurement unit  is disposed such that the angles \u03c6i, \u03c6j, \u03c6k, are equal, each of the sensor suites , , may measure equal acceleration and rotation with respect to their respective axis in the critical early launch phase. In the case where the angles \u03c6i, \u03c6j, \u03c6k, are not equal, the acceleration and\/or rotation values measured by each sensor suite may be scaled appropriately before comparison.","Referring now to , a projectile  may include an inertial measurement unit  which provides measurement data to a controller . The inertial measurement unit  may be the inertial measurement unit  and may provide the controller  with measurement data Data(i), Data(j), Data(k) with respect to orthogonal i, j, and k axes which are oriented oblique to a longitudinal axis of the projectile .","Shortly after the projectile  is launched, the controller  may make a determination if the inertial measurement unit  is functioning within predetermined tolerances. For example, the controller  may receive from the inertial measurement unit  measurement data indicating acceleration along and rotation rate about the orthogonal i, j, and k axes. Shortly after launch, the controller  may compare the measured acceleration and rotation rate data with respect to each of the i, j, and k axes and determine if one or more measurement is outside of an expected tolerance range relative to the other measurements. In the event that the controller  determines that the inertial measurement unit  is not functioning within predetermined tolerances, the controller  may inhibit deployment of the one or more control surfaces . In the case where deployment of the control surfaces is inhibited, the projectile  may continue along a ballistic flight path.","In the event that the controller  determines that the inertial measurement unit  is functioning within predetermined tolerances, the controller  may provide one or more control signals to cause the control surfaces  to deploy when a guided portion of the projectile flight is to start. Subsequently, the controller  may control one or more control surfaces  based, at least in part, on the measurement data received from the inertial measurement unit . The controller  may provide one or more control signals to drive or control the control surfaces  to guide the flight of the projectile . For example, each of the one or more control surfaces  may be coupled to a motor, a solenoid, or another actuator effective to adjust the position of the control surface. The controller  may provide control signals to drive the actuator coupled to each control surface.","The controller  may control the one or more control surfaces  based, at least in part, on inputs from one or more of a GPS receiver , a target sensor  within the projectile , and a programming interface . The controller  may also include or perform the function of a fuse to detonate an explosive payload (not shown) within the projectile . The programming interface may be used prior to the launch of the projectile  to program a mission for the projectile including an intended destination and fuse parameters.","The controller  may include software, firmware, and\/or hardware for providing functionality and features described herein. The hardware and firmware components of the controller  may include various specialized units, circuits, software and interfaces for providing the functionality and features described here. The controller  may therefore include one or more of: memories, analog circuits, digital circuits, and processors such as microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), programmable logic devices (PLDs) and programmable logic arrays (PLAs). The functionality and features of the controller  may be embodied in whole or in part in software which operates on one or more processors within the controller  and may be in the form of firmware, an application program, an applet (e.g., a Java applet), a dynamic linked library (DLL), a script, one or more subroutines, or an operating system component or service. The hardware and software and their functions may be distributed such that some functions are performed by the controller  and others by other devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["642","644","643","645","644","646"]},"Ideally, navigation and control systems within a guided projectile compensate for random variations and atmospheric effects and cause the guided projectile to follow the intended flight path  and to impact precisely at the target point . However, in the event of a fault or failure in the navigation and control systems, a guided projection may have a potential to follow a flight path that deviates substantially from the intended flight path . For example, a faulty guided projectile may follow a flight path such as the exemplary faulty flight path . The shaded polygon  indicates the locations of all hypothetical impact points for a specific projectile having a faulty navigation and control system. The polygon  is provided as an example. The locus of possible impacts points may be highly dependent on the projectile design, and thus may be different for each type of guided projectiles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["750","752","754"]},"The programmed projectile may be launched at . After launch, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) may be activated at . At , shortly after the projectile launch, the projectile may be experiencing deceleration (negative acceleration) along a direction of motion parallel to a longitudinal axis of the projectile and rotation or roll about the longitudinal axis. The IMU, which may be the IMU , may have three sensor suites adapted to measure motion parameters with respect to three mutually orthogonal measurement axes, each of which may be oblique to the longitudinal axis of the projectile. Since each axis of the IMU is oblique to the longitudinal axis of the projectile, each sensor suite of the IMU may measure a component of the acceleration along the longitudinal axis and the roll about the longitudinal axis at .","At , a determination may be made if the inertial measurement unit is functional within predetermined tolerances. Specifically, the acceleration values measured by each of the three sensor suites may be compared to determine if the inertial measurement unit is capable of accurately measuring acceleration along all three measurement axes. In addition, the rotation or angular velocity values measured by each of the three sensor suites may be compared to determine if the inertial measurement unit is capable of accurately measuring rotation and\/or rotation rate about all three measurement axes.","For example, the inertial measurement unit may be disposed such that the angles between the three measurement axes and the longitudinal axis of the projectile (\u03c6i, \u03c6j, \u03c6k as shown in ) are equal. In this case, the acceleration measurement portions of the inertial measurement unit may be determined to be functional if the acceleration values measured by each of the three sensor suites are equal within a predetermined acceleration tolerance. Similarly, the rotation\/rotation rate measurement portions of the inertial measurement unit may be determined to be functional if the rotation and\/or rotation rate values measured by each of the three sensor suites are equal within a predetermined acceleration tolerance. In the case where the angles \u03c6i, \u03c6j, \u03c6k, are not equal, the acceleration and rotation\/rotation rate values measured by each sensor suite may be scaled appropriately before comparison.","When a determination is made at  that the inertial measurement unit is not functioning within predetermined tolerances, the deployment of the control surfaces of the projectile may be inhibited and the projectile may continue along a ballistic flight path at  until the flight terminates at impact at . When a determination is made at  that the inertial measurement unit is not functioning within predetermined tolerances, the projectile fuse may not be armed such that the flight terminates at  with a kinetic impact but without detonation.","Guided projectiles generally do not allocate space for a command receiver and a self-destruct mechanism. However, when a self destruct mechanism is available, and a determination is made at  that the inertial measurement unit is not functioning within predetermined tolerances, the projectile may be commanded to self-destruct at .","The mode of the projectile, as programmed at , may be considered at  when determining if the inertial measurement unit is functional. In the test mode, safety may be of paramount importance. Thus, in the test mode, the predetermined tolerance on the data measured by the inertial measurement unit may be very small, such that the projectile continues on a ballistic flight path at  if there is even a small error is the relative measurements made by the three sensor suites of the inertial measurement unit. In the tactical mode, the trade-off between the need to complete the projectile's mission and the need for safety may result is looser tolerances on the relative measurements made by the three sensor suites of the inertial measurement unit.","When a determination is made at  that the inertial measurement unit is functioning within predetermined tolerances, the control surfaces of the projectile may be deployed at  and the projectile may continue along a guided flight path at . In the tactical mode, the projectile fuse may be armed, possibly near the anticipated end of the flight, and the flight may terminate by impact or detonation at .","In some circumstances, and particularly in the tactical mode, a determination may be made at  that the inertial measurement unit is partially functional or functioning but outside required precision. In this case, the inertial measurement unit may be \u201crecalibrated\u201d at  in order to continue a guided flight. In this context, \u201crecalibrate\u201d is intended to mean that one or more data parameters measured by the inertial measurement unit may be offset, scaled, estimated, or otherwise processed to allow a guided flight to continue at .","Referring now to , a process  for controlling the flight of a guided projectile may be suitable for use at  in .","At  motion parameters of the guided projectile may be determined. The motion parameters may include a present position, a velocity vector, and an acceleration vector for the guided projectile. The motion parameters may be determined from one or more data sources such as an inertial measurement unit and a GPS receiver. The motion parameters may be determined with some redundancy. For example, the present position of the projectile may be determined from a GPS receiver and by integrating acceleration and angular rate data measured by an inertial measurement unit. The motion parameters may be filtered or otherwise processed to remove noise.","At , the motion parameters determined at  may be compared with predicted or desired motion parameters derived from a Kalman filter or other predictive process. The results of this comparison may be used at  to provide or adjust commands or signals used to control the flight of the projectile via one or more control surfaces. While the actions at , , and  have been shown as consecutive for ease of explanation, the actions at ,  and  may be performed concurrently or nearly concurrently as parts of a real-time closed-loop control system. The real-time control of the projectile may continue until the projectile arrives at or near an intended target at .","During the real-time control of the guided projectile, a determination may be made at  that the projectile is a casualty, which is to say that the projectile has incurred a failure that prevents the projectile from being accurately guided to the intended target. For example, a substantial difference between a projectile position indicated by the GPS receiver and a projectile position derived from inertial measurements may indicate that one of the navigation systems may have failed. For further example, continued deviation of the projectile from the intended flight path in spite of attempts to control the flight path using the control surfaces may indicate a failure of the control surface actuation system. These and other circumstances may lead to a determination at  that the projectile cannot be guided to its intended destination and is a casualty.","When the projectile is determined to be a casualty at , the projectile may be placed into a semi-ballistic casualty flight mode at . Specifically, at , the control surfaces of the projectile may all be commanded to an extreme position in the same direction, with the intention of causing the projectile to roll about its longitudinal axis without introducing any net steering. The effect of one or more erroneously positioned control surfaces may be overwhelmed and rendered moot if a majority of the control surfaces are positioned to cause the projectile to roll. Thus the projectile may be forced to continue in its present direction along a ballistic flight path until the flight terminates in a kinetic impact at .","Throughout this description, the embodiments and examples shown should be considered as exemplars, rather than limitations on the apparatus and procedures disclosed or claimed.
