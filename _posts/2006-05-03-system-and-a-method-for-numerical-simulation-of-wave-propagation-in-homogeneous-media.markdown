title: System and a method for numerical simulation of wave propagation in homogeneous media
abstract: The present invention provides a method to construct stable, high-order explicit discretization for the wave equation based on the discretization of the evolution formula. The present invention provides independent computation of discretization in one, two, or more spaces for bulk propagation, near boundaries propagation, and discretization of a projection operator to enforce boundary conditions. More specifically, the method includes an act of discretizing propagation operators Lby using an identity that is derived using central differencing in time. The method also includes an act of providing a high-order discretization of a boundary projection operator that enforces boundary conditions independent of the discretization of the propagation operators L. Additionally, the method includes an act of alternating an application of a discretization of an evolution formula having a spatial filtering operator Lwith a boundary projection operation for stepping forward in time to determine wave propagation in the media.

The slope at any point on a line is the tangent line through a particular point, which has the same direction as the line at that point. In other words, the derivative of a point on a line is construed as a local statement about the local change in the direction of the line. The partial differential equation of a function with four variables is defined in much the same way, by using a tangent to a three dimensional function in a way analogous to the way tangent line is used for a single variable function. Partial differential equations may be used to represent a particular point of a field in space and time. The slope (derivative) of a field at which any one point exists depends on the three variables for space in x, y, and z directions and one variable for time t. Therefore, partial differential equations can be construed as local statements about local changes in a three dimensional entity, such as a wave, in space and time.","The wave Equation (1) is represented by a partial differential equation because it involves a function of four variables, which are the three dimensions of space in the x, y, and z directions and one variable for time t as follows,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mo":"\u2207","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mo":"\u2202","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2202","msup":{"mi":"t","mn":"2"}}}}}},{"mi":"\u03c8","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":["x","\u03c1"]},"mo":",","mi":"t"}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},"mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msup":{"mo":"\u2207","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msup":{"mo":"\u2202","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2202","msup":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"}}},{"msup":{"mo":"\u2202","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2202","msup":{"mi":"y","mn":"2"}}},{"msup":{"mo":"\u2202","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2202","msup":{"mi":"z","mn":"2"}}}],"mo":["+","+"]}}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001","he":"3.89mm","wi":"1.78mm","file":"US07822585-20101026-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.12mm","file":"US07822585-20101026-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}]},"Wave fields are continuous entities in both space and time, which means that they have a value at every point in space and time. This makes the use of partial differential equations for an exact representation of a field at every point in space and time impractical and difficult because an infinite number of points must be used to provide an exact representation of the total field at every point in space and time. Other analyzing techniques must therefore be used to avoid the use of partial differential equations for representing a continuous entity such as a wave.","Numerical Analysis is one method for computing a solution for partial differential equations. This is done by first discretizing a partial differential equation, bringing it into a finite dimensional subspace, then solving the resulting linear system in the finite dimensional subspace. One such technique for first discretizing the wave Equation (1) involves using a finite differencing method. This method approximates the solution of partial differential equations by using a finite collection of points to represent a wave. The approach taken for partial differential equations is to approximate differential operators such as u\u2032(x) by a difference operator such as (u(x+h)\u2212u(x))\/h for some small but finite h, where h may represent a small rate of change \u0394. Doing this substitution for a sufficient number of points in the domain of definition (for instance 0, h, 2h . . . 1 in the case of the unit interval) provides a system of equations that can be solved algebraically.","The process of representing a continuous entity by a finite collection of points is known as discretization. In other words, discretization is a way of approximating a problem that has an infinite number of variables with a problem that has a finite number of variables. A discretization process divides geometry into smaller pieces (finite elements) to prepare for analysis. A discretized model of a continuous entity such as a wave can be manipulated using an analyzing technique such as a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD), in which all the simple geometric components of a model are evaluated simultaneously. To apply the FDTD, the differential equation of the wave is replaced by a finite difference equation. This is done by replacing the partial derivatives by central difference quotients, which replaces partial differential equations with algebraic expressions. In the next operations, the interval to be computed is subdivided into a suitable number of equal subintervals, and then the difference equation at each point where the value of the function is unknown is determined. At the final operation, the system of equations created is solved to obtain approximation values for the solution of the differential equation at discrete points on the interval.","Using FDTD, at a given position in space, the field at each current step can be calculated from the previous values of the fields (hence the difference in time). If time is considered discretized into discrete steps, then fields are simply increased or decreased from their previously calculated values by adding or subtracting an amount given by the","calculations at current time. The partial differential equations, which describe the infinitesimal local behavior of the field, are replaced with algebraic equations having to do with differences in the field in nearby space and time points. This avoids the partial differential operations because the equations are transformed into algebraic expressions. Dividing a real problem into appropriately-sized unit cells, and then calculating the field equations, iterated for as long as the response is of interest, therefore solves a real problem.","To use FDTD, a computational domain, which is the space in which the simulation of a wave will be performed, must be established. The field will be determined at every point within the computational domain, requiring a cell or grid structuring of the domain. In addition, since a computational domain must end at some point, a boundary must be established. Once the computational domain is determined, a source is then specified. The source can be an impinging plane wave or a current on a wire, depending on the type of situation to be modeled.","Since FDTD requires that the entire computational domain be formed of grids, and because these grids must be small compared to the smallest wavelength and smaller than the smallest feature model, very large computational domains can be developed, which result in very long solution times. Models with long, thin features are difficult to model in FDTD because of the excessively large computational domain required. In addition, although fields can be found directly everywhere in the computational domain when using FDTD, if, however, calculations or models of fields at some distance are desired, it is likely that the distance will force the computational domain to be excessively large. It should be noted that far-field extensions are available for FDTD, but require some amount of post-processing.","As is described in the Published Patent Application 2002\/0099510 to Namiki, portions of which are repeated herein for completeness, conventionally, FDTD solutions are numerically obtained through explicit methods.

Because of the constraints discussed above, the maximum time-step size in explicit methods is dependent on the minimum cell size.

This computation makes extreme demands on the computer memory and processing power, even when fine meshing is required. The result is that implicit methods are as time-consuming as explicit methods, even when the simulation model has a fine geometrical feature that needs a smaller cell size.","There are two main issues with respect to performance of a numerical solution of the wave equations, stability and efficiency. The numerical stability of a method describes how that method responds to the differences between the calculation and the function being approximated. In a stable method, the errors due to the approximations are damped out as the computation proceeds. In an unstable method, any errors in processing are magnified as the calculation proceeds. Unstable methods quickly generate worthless data, and are useless for numerical processing. Therefore, any method used to compute the approximate solution of a wave equation must be stable.","The second issue is with respect to the efficiency in the numerical solutions of partial differential equations, which relates to the precision of the approximated solution. Recall that numerical solutions are mere approximations of the partial differential equations, and hence, the error between the approximate solution and the true solution must somehow be accounted for to determine the precision of the approximation. For example, is the approximation error small enough that it provides an acceptable solution for which the partial equations were modeled? In general, the error between the approximate solution and the true solution is determined by the truncation error that is made by going from a differential operator to a difference operator. The truncation error reflects the fact that a difference operator can be viewed as a finite part of the infinite series of the differential operator. Therefore, in general, a higher number of series (an increased number of steps or values closer together in space and time) can be used in the numerical solution to better approximate the partial differential equation to reduce the approximation error. In fact, the approximation error should reduce to zero if enough points in space and time are used to approximate the solution to the partial differential equations, which is the definition of convergence for an infinite series.","Assuming that the method is convergent, then a determination must be made as to how rapidly the approximation error reduces to zero (or the solution converges), which is the measure of the efficiency of the method being used. Most of the methods that are used today are low-order discretization methods, which means that the approximation error is decreased by a very low factor despite an increased use of points (numbers) in space and time. Discretizations with approximation errors that reduce rapidly as more points are used are known as high-order discretization methods.","The difficulty in changing a low-order time-domain simulation to a high-order one is that, in general, the low-order time-domain simulations tend to be unstable high-order solutions. Another difficulty is that in order to achieve a high-order solution, the algebraic equations that replace the partial differential equations would have to relate to the values of the field at many steps (time and or space). One major problem with this is initialization. For example, if the value of a previous four time steps are needed, then initial conditions for the four time steps are required, and not just one. On the other hand, the more time steps that are required, the greater the possibility of introducing extraneous and unstable solutions.","In light of the current state of the art and the drawbacks to current systems mentioned above, a need exists for a system and a method that would allow for stable, high-order discretization for evolution of the wave equation.","The present invention provides a method for causing a processor to perform acts for numerical simulation of wave propagation in a media. For example, the method includes an act of discretizing propagation operators Lby using an identity that is derived using central differencing in time. The method also includes an act of providing a high-order discretization of a boundary projection operator that enforces boundary conditions independent of the discretization of the propagation operators L. Additionally, the method includes an act of alternating an application of a discretization of an evolution formula having a spatial filtering operator Lwith a boundary projection operation for stepping forward in time to determine wave propagation in the media.","In another aspect, the act of discretizing the propagation operator Lfurther comprises the acts of:","selecting a set of suitable

propagation operator corresponds to a discretization point on the lattice, and border points are those points that remain;","computing a discretization of the propagation operator for each of the border points using the border point and its neighbor points;","selecting points on a boundary, and using neighboring discretization points, computing differentiators and extrapolators to the selected

In other words, using the Alpert et al. approach of equations that are exact in discrete time, the present invention provides an approximation of those exact equations in space.","The present invention further provides a prescription for handling boundary conditions, which separates the bulk (the propagation region) from the boundary, independent of each other, and includes the enforcement (projection) of solutions to obey the boundary conditions without compromising the stability or the high order convergence of the discretization. In other words, the present invention separates the process of computing the evolution of the wave in space and time in a propagation region from that evolved at the boundary region. That is, first the evolution of the wave in the propagation region is computed in some space s and time t, and then computations are made to correct the solutions at the boundaries. Then at the next (s+\u0394s) space and (t+\u0394t) time, the evolution of the wave in the propagation region is computed again, and then computations are made to correct the solutions at the boundaries for the (s+\u0394s) space and (t+\u0394t) time. This process is iterated for the desired number of space and time steps \u0394. In addition, the step size may be selected to be (\u0394). This means that the approximation error will reduce very rapidly, as finer resolutions of space and time are used. The present invention further provides an explicit prescription that handles evolution of a field near boundary regions, independent of the boundary and boundary conditions for stable, and high-order discretization.","Before providing details regarding various methodologies of the invention, first a glossary of terms is provided as a reference for the reader.

Finally, a results section is provided, which presents non-limiting examples of the operation of the present invention (in two space dimensions plus a time dimension) in order to provide a more tangible understanding of the operation of the invention.","(2) Glossary","This section presents an exemplary glossary of some of the terms used in the description and claims. The glossary is intended to provide the reader with a general understanding of various terms as they are used in this disclosure, and is not intended to limit the scope of these terms. Rather, the scope of the terms is intended to be construed with reference to this disclosure as a whole and with respect to the claims below. Further, the definitions provided should not be considered limiting to the extent that the terms are known in the art. These definitions are provided to assist in the understanding of the present invention.\n\n","Using the well-known Lax-Wendroff method, which is based on the identity Equation (13), the present invention uses an exact relation that relates the fields at multiple times as taught by Alpert et al., but discretizes the linear propagation operator Lthat appears at each discrete time rather than an integral representation thereof. Hence, the present invention discretizes the linear propagation operator L, and not the integral representation from which the linear propagation operator Lis derived. In other words, the present invention uses the Alpert et al. evolution formula to provide an exact representation of a wave equation at discrete times, and then discretizes the space within each discretized time. This approach provides a hierarchy of discretizations that can be obtained by representing the linear operator Lto the desired order. The present invention recognizes that Equation (13) provides an explicit formula for \u03c8(,\u0394t) in terms of \u03c8(,0) and \u03c8(,\u2212\u0394t), meaning that no linear equations need be solved to compute \u03c8(,\u0394t):\n\n\u03c8(,\u0394)=2\u03c8(,0)\u2212\u03c8(,\u2212\u0394).\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nTherefore, the present invention provides a prescription for an explicit discretization of Equation (13) in multi-space dimensions, along with a projection operator that enforces the desired boundary conditions. An important feature of the present invention is the independent computation of three discretizations, one for bulk (away from boundaries) propagation, one for propagation near boundaries, and a projection operator to enforce boundary conditions.\n","Features of the present invention include a straight-forward discretization of the linear propagation operator L, a high-order discretization of a projection operator that enforces the desired boundary conditions independently of the discretization of the propagation operator L, and a consistent discretization of the implicit identity operation on the first \u201ctime slice\u201d \u03c8(,\u2212\u0394t) on the right hand side of Equation (15). In other words, the present invention applies a high-order filter to the field \u03c8(,\u2212\u0394t). This is essential to preserve stability. Another feature includes the applicability of the methodologies of the present invention to both structured and unstructured meshes. It should be noted that the efficiency of the method presented depends on a regular mesh being used in as much of the modeled volume as possible.","With the present invention, the evolution of the field steps forward in time by alternating the application of the discretization of the evolution formula (Equation (15)) with the identity operator exhibited,\n\n\u03c8(,)=2\u03c8(,)\u2212\u03c8(,),\u2003\u2003(16)\n\nwith the boundary projection operation,\n\n\u03c8(,)\u2190\u03c8(,),\u2003\u2003(17)\n\nwhere Pis the projection operator (the boundary condition), that enforces the desired boundary condition independently of the discretization of the linear propagation operator Lon the field \u03c8. In other words, portions of the field \u03c8 that do not obey the boundary conditions are removed (filtered) from the field by the application of the projection operator P.

As was stated above, the numerical stability of a method describes how that method responds to the differences between the calculation and the function being approximated. In a stable method, the errors due to the approximations are damped out as the computation proceeds. In an unstable method, any errors in processing become magnified as the calculation proceeds. Because the (discretized) propagation is invariant to translations in both space and time, the present invention uses the well-known Von Neumann stability criteria to determine stability.

As stated above, the present invention requires that the discretization to be exact for a suitable set of functions, namely polynomials up to some degree d. Therefore, the first act is to select the desired degree d of the polynomial. The next act in the discretization process is to select the lattice ratio \u03c4=\u0394t\/\u0394x, i.e., the time steps versus the space steps. The third act is to find the minimum discretization radius M such that the stability conditions with respect to Equation (36) are satisfied; that is, M\u2267d\/2.","Table 1 lists the minimum stencil radii M for \u03c4=\u00bd, 3\/2, and 2\u2266d\u22668. The size of the stencil is 2M+1. The actual equations used to obtain the minimum stencil radii M are Equation (39) to (41), which first calculate the discretized propagation operator {circumflex over (L)}. The results so obtained from Equations (39) to (41) are then used within Equation (35) and (36) to eventually determine the propagation stability. Of course, if the result violates the conditions of Equation (36), a larger value of M must then be selected. For \u03c4=\u00bd, the stencil are of minimum size to achieve the discretization order. For \u03c4= 3\/2and d=2, the stencil is of minimum size to cover the past light cone. In these cases the system of Equation (31) is square, and a particular exemplary solution to the wave equation is {circumflex over (L)}, which is the identity matrix, which is to say that there is no filtering of the field at the earliest (t\u2212\u0394t) time step.

The degree to which this apparently violates the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraint (\u0394t\/\u0394x)\u22661 without losing stability demonstrates its utility because it allows fine discretization near boundaries. Of course, more generally, one could regard the discretization as consistent with CFL constraint in the sense that there are always points in the stencil outside the past light cone. The use of a tapered mesh near the boundaries only results in less error for high discretization orders and fine discretization. This does not mean that tapered meshes in higher dimensions will not be useful\u2014in one-space dimension, there is no need to resolve more detail at the

Regarding balance of pre-computation with propagation computation, as in frequency domain computations, there will be some tradeoffs between pre-computation and solution. For large problems, pre-computation will be dominated by the discretization of the boarder propagation, the boundary constraints, and the decomposition of the coefficient matrix B=\u03a3bb, which appears in Equation (48). Because of its local structure, this decomposition can be accelerated by employing nested dissection. Nested dissection is disclosed in a publication by A. George, J. W. H. Liu, entitled, \u201cComputer Solution of Large Sparse Positive Definite Systems,\u201d published by Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1981.","For the frequency problems, the use of wave discretizations that are specified by minimization of RMS error over some spectrum of sine waves (rather than exactitude for low-order polynomials) results in more efficient calculation for a given accuracy.

The methods provided in this section (I) are formulated in a manner that are extendable to implement in any number of dimensions. In the following section (II), the methods in section (I) are extended to two or more space dimensions plus the time dimension.","(II) Two or More Space Plus the Time Dimension (2+1)","In the previous section (I), it was described that consistent high-order discretization can make Lax-Wendroff method stable in the presence of small cells near the boundary in one space and one time dimension.

Numerical examples were illustrated that alternated the use of the resultant propagation and projection operators that provided stable results with discretization error that decreased as a high power of the discretization scale. An essential ingredient of that approach was recognizing the implicit identity operator (L) when Equation (13) was solved for \u03c8(,\u0394t), which resulted in Equation (16). Discretizing Lby the same prescription as was used for Lresulted in a low pass filter that facilitated stability. In this section (II), the present invention describes an extension of the approach in section (I) to two space dimensions. Section (II) describes (a) generalized discretization prescription, which is then followed by (b) Propagation Operator in Bulk Region, (c) Propagation Operator In Border Region, and (d) Boundary Condition Projection Operator.","(a) Generalized Discretization Prescription","The generalized discretization prescription discretizes all the linear operators, which include the propagation operator L, interpolation, extrapolation, and differentiation operators.

the border region, the propagation operator is discretized differently than in the bulk because (by definition) a bulk stencil centered on a border point will not entirely overlay discretization points. However, the requirement that the discretization operator provide a correct answer (Equation (73)) for polynomials up to the selected degree remains the same. The general discretization method described above within this section (II) is used, selecting the near-neighbor discretization points to each border point (these will usually include both border and bulk points). In general, this must be done independently for each border point, but symmetries of the problem and the discretization point set could be used to reduce the necessary pre-computations. The number of points used can be the same as that (M) in the bulk region, but in some cases, it has been found empirically that more points are necessary to avoid instability. If a finer discretization were used near the boundary, one would expect this necessity to have a greater tendency to occur.","(d) Boundary Condition Projection Operator","The boundary condition projection operator computations for two or more dimensions exhibit the biggest change from one dimensional space because in one dimension, there are only two boundary points. In two dimensions, there is a need to select a set of points on the boundary \u2202S at which to impose the boundary conditions. A reasonable approach is to take their separation to be commensurate with the spacing of discretization points near the boundary. For example, with the discretization points all on a square lattice, the present invention uses boundary points along aS separated by the distance nearly equal to the lattice constant. In the case of a non-uniform mesh, points separated on the boundary by a distance commensurate with the smallest spacing in the nearby propagation region would be appropriate. For each boundary point, extrapolation\/differentiation estimators are computed for the quantities constrained by desired boundary condition, and powers of the Laplacian operating on these. For example, for Dirichlet conditions, one computes estimators
