No. 61\/165,122, filed Mar. 31, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Embodiments of the invention relate generally to carrier network connectivity and, more particularly, to providing and managing carrier-neutral network access connectivity.","The traditional telecommunications carrier model provides bundled access to voice, data, and Internet services to all users. This carrier strategy places negotiating control between the carrier and users in the hands of the carrier. By requiring access as part of the bundled solution, the carrier model restricts users and limits future options based on past design decisions made by the carriers.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to systems and methods for providing distributed network solutions to end user customers by acting as a neutral demarcation point between the last mile and the long haul portion of a telecommunications network. The network provisioning platform in embodiments of the invention evaluate transport alternatives to identify routes and networks having the highest reliability metrics. Access circuits are aggregated to the optical level at the earliest possible point in the network. Service to on-net networks are provisioned rapidly.","The following description of the embodiments is provided as an enabling teaching of the invention and its best, currently known embodiments. Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that many changes can be made to the embodiments described, while still obtaining the beneficial results. It will also be apparent that some of the desired benefits of the embodiments described can be obtained by selecting some of the features of the embodiments without utilizing other features. Accordingly, those who work in the art will recognize that many modifications and adaptations to the embodiments described are possible and may even be desirable in certain circumstances, and are a part of the invention. Thus, the following description is provided as illustrative of the principles of the embodiments of the invention and not in limitation thereof, since the scope of the invention is defined by the claims.","As illustrated in , the core network access provisioning platform (also referred to herein as \u201cCore180\u201d) provides secure and dedicated long haul transport over the platform's private backbone network. The platform acts as a neutral gateway and virtual point of presence into significantly more providers than those that are available to the customer premise. The platform intersects hundreds of carrier networks and enables additional control including, but not limited to, location, speed, and value. The platform can deliver local connectivity to any endpoint in North America. The dashed lines in the figure represent future segments of the backbone network.","The core network access provisioning platform proactively manages company and client (customer) networks by providing: (1) network visibility through either a web-based portal, or application programming interface (API) integration; (2) managed cross connections, circuit mapping, and testing for end-to-end control; (3) a 24\u00d77 network control center for integrated trouble ticketing and resolution; and (4) real time remote monitoring and diagnostics.","In one embodiment, a customer Order Management System (OMS) manages a plurality of operational functions, including, but not limited to, sales quotes, requests for vendor pricing, equipment inventory, costs, selection and management of vendors (i.e., carriers), order fulfillment, and trouble ticketing. The OMS facilitates the unique process flow for fulfilling orders and supplier management, from creating customer quotes to final customer acceptance of service to management and maintenance of the service. The unique process flow captures the network access provisioning platform model, which involves identifying, ordering and integrating multiple carrier services into the platform's own value added services. Unlike traditional carriers, that typically route the bulk of their services through their own networks, integrating only tail circuits from other carriers, the network access provisioning platform integrates a variety of services and segments from many suppliers at unique integration points in the provisioning platform's backbone network to provide the best price\/performance value to end user customers.","The OMS provides a plurality of screens, processes and data to support the network access provisioning platform. The OMS can obtain orders from multiple customers and\/or resellers; design end-to-end services with selection of any available supplier for any segment or section; manage the ordering, installation and integration of multiple supplier services; and maintain these services across multiple suppliers through the lifetime of the service.","The major components of the network access provisioning platform can include one or more of the following functions:\n\n","In an exemplary embodiment, OMS utilizes a unique workflow capability. The workflow identifies a series of tasks for users to perform and complete based on steps for fulfilling a process. The process can be any process requiring user interaction with screens and data to fulfill the process steps. The workflow engine is defined generically herein so that a workflow (WF Item) can be created for any set of data (e.g., a customer order, a carrier order, a trouble ticket, an engineering work request, creation of a customer invoice), using configuration capabilities only, without recoding any software. An example of a new \u201cInstall Customer Order\u201d workflow is show in . The resulting tasks for this workflow are shown in . The tasks for a particular customer order are shown in .","The workflow engine is capable of attaching workflows to other workflows, so that a chain of workflows can be created. For example, a workflow for carrier orders can be attached to a workflow for customer orders, so that a single customer order can initiate tasks for multiple carrier orders.","As can be seen in , the workflow also defines a baseline set of tasks, that represent the expected start and end dates of tasks for that instance of a workflow. The actual tasks may start and end before or after the baseline start and end dates. The discrepancies can be flagged and reported on, as required.","Workflows can be ordered in a number of ways: (1) a task can lead to one or more subsequent tasks, (2) a task can be initiated by one or more preceding tasks, (3) completion of tasks can be made contingent on the status or value of variables associated with the WF Item. For the first method of ordering, a task can lead to one or more subsequent tasks either after all subsequent tasks are initiated, or after only a subset of the subsequent tasks are initiated. For the second method, a task can be initiated by one or more preceding tasks either after all preceding tasks are completed, or after one or more of the preceding tasks have been completed. For the third method, completion of tasks can be made contingent on the status of a variable associated with the WF Item, such as the entry of a FOC date before the get FOC date task can be completed.","Workflows can be owned by specific workgroups and the manager of the workgroup can assign individuals to that workflow, or to specific tasks in the workflow. In that case, only the manager sees the tasks until they are assigned, at which point the tasks become visible to the assigned individual, as well as to the manager. The manager can also reassign tasks at any time, as required.","The workflow engine can also generate ad-hoc tasks based on conditions defined by data configuration. For example, if a task is overdue by a certain number of days, a reminder task can be initiated, such as a customer update task, to provide information to the customer on that date. E-mail can be sent out to individuals or groups on task initiation or task completion, as required. A more detailed description of the OMS and its components follows the description of the price generator application.","In another embodiment, a Price Generator application provides and manages pricing requests from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). The Price Generator allows DISA users to request and obtain prices for circuits between any combinations of nearly 500 military locations. The circuits can be used for voice, data and Internet traffic, with circuit speeds (bandwidths) ranging from 56 Kbps to OC-192 (9953 Mbps). Optical Carrier (OC) levels describe a range of digital signals that can be carried on SONET fiber optic networks. OC-192 is a network line with transmission speeds of up to 9953 Mbps. Pricing is based on the end locations and the speed of the circuits and is provided separately for each year of the DISA contract. The tool, the user interface and the pricing database for this embodiment were developed based on extensive analysis of DISA's requirements, the geographic distribution of the 500 military locations, network costs over time, location accessibility, currently available network services, network transition status, among other factors, and, as such, represents a unique tool that captures a significant corporate knowledge base. The resulting pricing database contains nearly 10,000 price point combinations, which is expected to continue growing.","The Price Generator software, user interface and data represent inseparable components of an integrated application built specifically to meet the needs of DISA's extensive pricing requirements in terms of the number of locations serviced, the range of services, and the number of years (10) over which pricing is provided.","To effectively manage pricing efforts, the following activities have to be coordinated: (1) Sales requesting pricing for customers; (2) Operations requesting costs from carriers, (3) Operations\/Management setting the customer price based on costs and margin; (4) Sales providing a quote to the customer; and (5) capturing customer feedback on the price. In the following description, references to price relate to quotes to customers, and references to cost relate to payments to vendors.","The Pricing Tool is separate from OMS in order to avoid creating facility records and establishing network segments in order to get quotes that may not turn into orders.","Step 1: Sales Requests for Quotes","A standard interface enables Sales to request pricing from Operations for each distinct customer requirement. In one embodiment, an input screen is provided that Sales can populate with the quote details. The applicable data entry fields for the input screen could include:\n\n","Once the salesperson has created a customer RFQ, Operations could receive an e-mail notification that a Customer RFQ has been created, with the data entered in the fields above.","Step 2: Carrier Request for Quote Generation","The pricing requests sent to each carrier, and their responses, need to be tracked. The Carrier RFQs can be sent to multiple vendors, and may include several network segments per Customer RFQ. In one embodiment, the fields that drive the carrier RFQ (Customer RFQ Number, Customer Name, Customer A\/Z Loc, Speed and Term), would be carried over from the Sales input screen. Operations would define the network segments that require Carrier RFQs. Operations would select the carriers to receive Carrier RFQs (from a list of carrier options). The system would automatically assign a Carrier RFQ number (e.g., the Customer RFQ number plus a suffix for each segment), and create a database entry for each quote requested. Operations populates the cost fields for each Carrier RFQ as vendor quotes are received.","For example, a Customer RFQ (#123) could include three network segments, two of which are off-net and need quotes. Segment  could be sent to three carriers, and Segment  could be sent to two vendors. This would mean that five entries would be generated in the Carrier Request for Quote database: Verizon Business, XO and Cavalier could have an entry for Carrier RFQ #123-01, and Verizon Business and Qwest could have an entry for Carrier RFQ #123-02. The on-net segment would be priced as part of the Sales Quote Generation process.","The applicable data entry fields for each Carrier RFQ entry could include:\n\n","A table having the following fields would be sent to the vendors: (1) Carrier RFQ Number; (2) Network A and Z Loc Address\/City\/Zip\/NPA-NXX; (3) Speed; (4) Term; (5) MRC; (6) NRC; and (7) Notes\/Special Terms.","The system can query the Carrier RFQ database on the following fields: (1) Customer RFQ number; (2) Carrier RFQ Number; (3) Customer A and Z Locs; (4) Network Segment A and Z Locs; (5) Speed; (6) Customer Name; (7) Carrier.","Step 3: Sales Quote Generation","For each segment, Operations can review\/populate the following components:\n\n","Step 4: Sales Quote Form","After the Sales Quote is completed, a form is automatically sent to the Sales originator, and\/or can be created by Sales. The form could include standard language for disclaimers and the following data fields:","1. Customer Name","2. A and Z Loc Address\/City\/Zip\/NPA-NXX","3. Speed","4. Term","5. Customer Request for Quote (RFQ) Number","6. Customer MRC","7. Customer NRC","8. Notes\/Special Terms","9. Sales Quote Date","10. Valid through Date (30 days after sales quote generated).","Step 5: Customer Response","After the quote process, the system tracks whether the Sales Quote resulted in an order. The applicable fields for Sales to update include the following:","1. Order Received Status (Y\/N)","2. If N, Reason","3. If N, Winning Price Point","4. Sales Notes","The Sales Request for Quote database could be queried on the following fields: (1) Customer Name; (2) Customer A and Z Locations; (3) Speed; (4) Order Received Status; and (5) Sales Notes.","Simple Order Management","The general functionality of order management includes the following: (1) customer circuit orders (enter, edit, show status); (2) design segments of circuit; (3) request carrier quotes for segments or whole circuit; (4) order segments from carrier; (5) close order\u2192send completion notice; and (6) show status of order to customer and resellers.","The roles of customer, user, and reseller are as follows: (1) customer\u2014can view only customer order status; (2) user\u2014all functions; and (3) reseller\u2014can enter\/edit customer orders and view order status.","The functionality of the customer orders process includes the following:","Enter Order (User or Reseller)","The steps in entering the order are:\n\n","The general information entered on the order entry screen includes:\n\n","The circuit information entered on the order entry screen includes: (1) speed; (2) CCSD; (3) framing; (4) line code; (5) protection; (6) channelization required (yes\/no); and (7) TSP Authorization Code.","The site information entered on the order entry screen includes the following:\n\n","When customer order is entered, the following fields are set as indicated:\n\n","Customer orders (user or reseller) can be searched and\/or edited as follows: (1) order ID; (2) circuit ID; (3) CCSD; (4) speed; (5) received date (date range); (6) customer requested date (date range); (7) site A; (8) Site Z.","Design Segments (User)","The purpose of the design segments process is to take an end to end customer circuit and design possible segments that will support the circuit. The segments are sequenced, 1, 2, 3, . . . starting from Site A of the circuit to Site Z of the circuit. Each segment record has one site, a site that represents either an intermediate site between Site A and Site Z of the circuit, or, if it's the last segment (or the only segment), the Site information is the Site Z of the circuit. Each segment can be an existing facility, an in service facility, a facility being installed or a potential facility that does not exist and may never actually exist. The designer should be able to create many different designs for the same circuit, each design with different segments or different number of segments.","The designer selects the circuit to be designed, starts with the first segment, selects either an existing segment or creates a new segment, and adds information about the segment. The designer then goes to the second segment and repeats the process until all segments desired have been added. The designer can then designate a certain design as the preferred design.","The functionality of the design segments process includes the following:","The user searches customer orders or circuits (design screen)\u2014the search criteria would be similar to search order screen. The user selects the order desired from a grid. A screen is displayed with circuit information (including Site A and Site Z). Design options are then created as below.","1. Enter Design Option name (for example \u201cOption 1\u201d)","2. The screen adds a grid with one line for the first segment of the option","3. Insert a segment into the first line\n\n","1. Add a new segment\n\n","2. Mark desired segments as \u201cCarrier Query\u201d","Create Carrier Queries","Creating Carrier Queries involves selecting a segment from a design that does not have a carrier associated with (design segment) and requesting quotes from a number of carriers for the MRC, NRC and term of that segment. The queries are e-mailed to the selected carriers (e-mail addresses obtained from contact who are listed as the carrier query\/ordering contacts). The e-mail contains a link to allow the carrier to enter the quote directly into the system. The carriers may also return quotes by e-mail, by letter or telephone, in which case, the quotes need to be entered into the system manually.","The create carrier queries process includes the following steps:\n\n","Validity of quote (e.g., number of days or months quote is good for), carrier quote number. The e-mail also should provide the following data: requested date, query ID, speed, site A (full address), site Z (full address), expedite, TSP authorization code, protection.\n\n","Carrier Orders (User) Process:\n\n","Complete Order (User)\n\n","Customer Order Status (User, Reseller, Customer)\n\n","Carrier Order Status (User)\n\n","Customer Control System Requirements","The network access provisioning platform provides a port cross connect service, in which customers, with communications equipment located at major hub facilities around the world, can manage the data associated with the infrastructure at these locations and request from the network access provisioning platform service provider cross connects between customer equipment and selected carriers. The customers can also make port assignments, select the carriers and request network access provisioning platform work. The network access provisioning platform service provider arranges for the implementation of the cross connects at the customer locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0241"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"]},"The network access provisioning platform allows customers to assign and order their cross connects and manage the data on an ongoing basis. The system provides the following functions: (1) maintain the inventory of hub facilities, devices at the facilities, circuits and interconnections for customers; (2) allow customers to select devices, ports and carriers for interconnection of circuits at the hub facilities; (3) allow customers to request manual work from the network access provisioning platform service provider, local field operations or carriers for installation of equipment and circuits, installation of cross connects, test and turn-up of equipment and circuits, and maintenance activities, such as troubleshooting; (4) allow service provider personnel to act as agents for the customers; (5) allow the network access provisioning platform service provider to generate, manage, issue and receive Letters of Agency (LOAs) to perform work on behalf of their customers; (6) allow field operations forces to receive and complete work orders; (7) allow the network access provisioning platform service provider to track billable events and billable time; and (8) provide a high level of data segregation and security between customers.","For work requests the system is generally expected to work as a process flow; work requests will flow from requestors to provisioners to field operations personnel and carriers. At each step some manual work (tasks) will be performed, information about that work step will be updated and the work will flow to the next step of the process. In some cases, work steps may split and subsequently merge. Examples of provisioner screens are illustrated in .","The high level functions of the system are illustrated in the use case diagram of .

The ticketing system described herein provides a system foundation for enhanced ticket functionality.","The platform supports \u201cTrouble Ticket\u201d type tickets. These are defined as network outages as reported to the network access provisioning platform service provider or customer troubles as reported by DISA and others, and then assigned to the network access provisioning platform service provider. Customers have the ability to directly enter tickets into the ticketing system, as well as provide\/request updates via the \u201cwork log\u201d functionality provided within the system.","This paragraph describes some of the key features of the Ticketing System. Direct access support and segregated customer access are provided for the network access provisioning platform via a web-based interface. Access permissions are User ID based. Group definitions and user contact information associations are supported for all User IDs. Support is provided for Trouble Ticket entry and updates. Customers can add new tickets and make work log entries. Customer email alerts are sent to indicate when a ticket is opened or updated directly by a customer. Users are allowed to add new contacts and update existing contacts within the system. Order, circuit and contact information are imported automatically into Trouble Tickets from OMS. Improved ticket management includes (1) ticket reason and RFO reason tracking, (2) ticket status tracking, (3) ticket assignment and related interval tracking, (4) related vendor ticket tracking, and (5) TSP restoration priority support. Data management and integrity includes system enforced data entry to support open and closure of tickets. The data driven solution provides enhanced reporting capabilities. The system further provides system support for mean time to repair (MTTR) calculations. Email support is provided for work log entries.","System Access","Access to the ticketing system is provided via a web interface using Internet Explorer. Other browsers can also be used once they are tested with the system. The ticket system functionality is supported within OMS. Once the user navigates to the network access provisioning platform web site, the user will be presented with the OMS login screen, and example of which could be the login screen illustrated in . If a valid User ID and password are entered, the main OMS system screen shown in  could be provided.","In one embodiment, the Ticket System Access screen is as illustrated in . The trouble ticket drop down list provides the user with two options as shown, i.e., to enter a ticket or to update a ticket. Once a ticket is entered into the system, the remaining activity for that ticket will be performed in the \u201cUpdate Ticket\u201d area of the ticketing system.","Enter Ticket Screen","In one embodiment, the \u201cEnter Ticket\u201d screen as illustrated in  provides the user with the ability to open a ticket within the Ticketing System. Users must enter all mandatory data and save the ticket. If the data entered is acceptable to the system, a \u201cTicket Number\u201d is generated and associated with the ticket. Once the ticket is successfully saved, the ticket Status is considered to be \u201cOpened\u201d and can only be accessed via the \u201cUpdate Ticket\u201d screens. Therefore, the user is pushed by the system into the \u201cUpdate Ticket\u201d Screen (not shown) for that ticket to gain access to the ticket number that was generated and associated with the new ticket.","The following paragraphs describe the fields within the \u201cEnter Ticket\u201d screen in one embodiment.","The \u201cTicket Number\u201d is a unique identifier that is generated by the system and associated with the ticket once it has been opened and saved. The \u201cTicket Number\u201d can include a three character \u201cTicket Type\u201d and an eight digit number incremented by \u201cTicket Type.\u201d","The \u201cTicket Type\u201d is the type of the ticket within the system.

With multiple options available, the ticket type selection will become mandatory and must be entered for all tickets. In addition, \u201cTicket Type\u201d options will also be determined by user group permissions.","The \u201cCompany Name\u201d is the name of the company that either opened or requested the ticket to be opened and is selected from a drop down list. If the ticket is opened by an actual customer via direct access to the system, the system will auto populate this field based on the company associated with the User ID used to gain access to the system. In this case, the Company name will not be allowed to be changed by the user. This is a mandatory field and must be entered for all tickets.","The \u201cTicket Reason\u201d is a short text reason that indicates why the ticket was opened. The reason is user selectable, but is limited to the options provided within the drop down. The user is required to select the reason that best indicates why the ticket was opened. Any additional detail must be entered into the \u201cOpen Issue Detail\u201d field.
