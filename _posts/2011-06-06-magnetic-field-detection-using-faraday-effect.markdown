In particular, this invention relates to quantum enhanced magnetometry for detecting feeble longitudinal magnetic fields using weak value amplification of a Faraday Effect.","Detecting the presence of feeble background or fluctuating magnetic fields can become necessary for various operations, such as for metal detection. However, conventional devices and processes exhibit deficiencies in cost and\/or portability.","Conventional magnetometers yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Various exemplary embodiments provide a magnetometer for detecting a magnetic field of strength B by using the Faraday effect. The magnetometer includes a photon emitter, a first polarizer, a prism, a second polarizer, a detector and an analyzer. The emitter projects an emitted light beam substantially parallel to the magnetic field and having wavelength \u03bb. The prism has an interface surface and is composed of a Faraday medium having Verdet value V.","In various exemplary embodiments, the emitted light beam passes through the first polarizer and then the prism, exiting from the interface surface making an incident angle \u03b8to normal of the surface and then refracting into a secondary medium as first and second circularly polarized light beams separated by a small angular divergence \u03b4. These polarized light beams have average refraction angle \u03b8 to the normal and pass through a post-selection polarizer before the detector measures the pointer rotation angle Aassociated with the polarized light beams. The magnetic field strength is determined as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"B","mo":"\u2248","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u025b","\u03c0","cos","\u03b8"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":["A","w"]},{"mi":"n","mn":"0"}]},{"mi":["V","\u03bb","sin"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"0"}}]},"mo":"."}}}}}},"The parameters include nas index of refraction of the secondary medium, and \u03b5 as amplification factor.","For sufficiently small \u03b5, the pointer rotation angle Acan be approximated as A\u2248\u03b4\/2\u03b5 and corresponds to amplification of the small divergence angle \u03b4.

Such measurements can be made using either classically intense laser light or single photon streams. The disclosure describes how a combined application of a recently discovered Faraday effect and weak value amplification can be used to detect and measure feeble longitudinal magnetic fields. The methodology has potential utility in such areas as detecting metallic objects, determining spatial orientation of magnetic fields, non-intrusive early warning of electrical machine failure, and measuring Verdet constants of Faraday materials.","A longitudinal magnetic field induces a circular differential refraction of a linearly polarized photon beam at the boundary between a Faraday medium and a medium with negligible Verdet constant as reported by A.

For this, the pointer rotation angles Aregister as \u03b4\/2\u03b5, where \u03b4\u03b5\u02dc[0.5\u00d710rad, 3.1\u00d710rad] constitutes the range of Ghosh's experimentally measured angular divergences induced by field strengths B\u03b5\u02dc[0.25 Tesla, 1.2 Tesla].","Thus, for a measured pointer range in rotation angle Aequal to the \u03b4 range, this magnetometer with a post-selection polarizer amplifies angular divergences in the range \u03b4\u03b5\u02dc[1.0\u03b5\u00d710rad, 6.2\u03b5\u00d710rad]. This therefore enables detection of longitudinal field strengths equal to 2\u03b5 times the magnetic field strengths used in Ghosh's experiment.","For example, if \u03b5=10, then this exemplary magnetometer amplifies angular divergences in the range \u03b4\u03b5\u02dc[1.0\u00d710rad, 6.2\u00d710rad] and thus detects field strengths in the range B\u03b5\u02dc[0.5\u00d710Tesla, 2.4\u00d710Tesla]\u2014provided that the angular rotation uncertainty satisfies \u0394\u03b8>>3.1\u00d710rad. Clearly, in an operational version of such a magnetometer, one would prefer a Faraday medium , laser wavelength, and \u03b8combination that would produce a divergence \u03b4 as large as possible.","Further, one may observe that a magnetometer such as this could be used to detect electric currents which produce feeble magnetic fields, perform non-intrusive diagnostics on electrical machinery, as well as determine the spatial orientation of magnetic fields. In addition, the temporal behavior of magnetic fields could also be accurately measured and it may be possible to couple such a magnetometer to a (Kalman) filter in order to provide precision control of varying magnetic fields.","Thus, the technique provides for detection of a weak longitudinal magnetic field by the Faraday effect on a light beam. The technique employs this effect by the apparatus and method presented herein, and improves such sensitivity detection over conventional techniques by improved amplification of the divergence angle between the refracted circularly polarized light beams.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
