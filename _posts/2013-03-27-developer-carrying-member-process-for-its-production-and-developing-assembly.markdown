Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a developer carrying member used in image-forming apparatus such as copying machines and printers that utilize electrophotography, a process for its production, and a developing assembly making use of the developer carrying member.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, in order to meet a demand for making electrophotographic images higher in image quality, developers are being made smaller in particle diameter. Such developers having a small particle diameter come large in particle surface area per unit mass. Hence, the developers tend to come to have a large surface electric charge during the step of development. Meanwhile, in order to keep developers low consumable in quantity, spherical-particle developers have come to be used. Such developers have particle surfaces having been made smooth, compared with merely pulverized-particle developers, and tend to be electrostatically charged in excess to tend to result in an unstable charge quantity. As the result, they have a tendency to tend to cause faulty images such as sleeve ghost and density non-uniformity.","In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H5-346727, a method is reported in which an iron complex compound is added to a surface layer of a developer carrying member so as to control the charge quantity of a developer.","In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2010-055072, a developer carrying member is disclosed which has a surface layer containing a specific quaternary phosphonium salt and a specific resin, and a method is reported by which developers made spherical-particle and negatively chargeable developers produced by polymerization are prevented from any excess charging such as charge-up.","However, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H5-346727 is what aims to improve developing performance by promoting the triboelectric charging for a developer. Hence, it has sometimes come about that a readily chargeable developer is rather made to more undergo charge-up, thus it has been impossible in some cases to keep the developer from being triboelectrically charged in excess, and thereby form good images.","As for the developer carrying member disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2010-055072, it can keep a developer from undergoing charge-up, and can have a further stable charge-providing performance. However, especially where the quaternary phosphonium salt is added in a large quantity in order to keep a readily chargeable developer from being charged in excess, the surface layer increases in volume resistivity to tend to cause sleeve ghost. Also, the surface layer may come to have a low wear resistance, thus a further improvement has been sought.","Further, in recent years, there are increasing needs for electrophotographic apparatus to maintain image density in their continuous service, to keep sleeve ghost from occurring and to keep blotches (spotty images or wave-pattern images, caused by faulty triboelectric charge-providing to a developer) from occurring. Under such circumstances, it is sought to make further improvement for the controlling of triboelectric charging of the developer carrying member surface during the continuous service.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to providing a developer carrying member on the surface of which a developer can be made stable by controlling its triboelectric charging and which can maintain a high image quality over a long period of time even where a highly triboelectrically chargeable developer is used, and provide a process for producing such a developer carrying member.","Further, the present invention is directed to providing a developing assembly which contributes to stable formation of high-grade electrophotographic images over a long period of time.","According to the present invention, there is provided a developer carrying member having a substrate and a surface layer;","wherein the surface layer is a cured product of a resin composition containing a binder resin, conductive particles, a quaternary phosphonium salt and an azo metal complex compound; and wherein:","the binder resin has in the molecular structure at least one structure selected from the group consisting of an \u2014NHgroup, an \u2550NH group and an \u2014NH\u2014 linkage, and the azo metal complex compound is a compound represented by the following formula (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"24.72mm","wi":"60.28mm","file":"US08792810-20140729-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (1), X, X, Xand Xeach independently represent a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene group, a substituted or unsubstituted naphthylene group or a substituted or unsubstituted pyrazolene group; M represents Fe, Cr or Al; and J: represents a cation. A substituent the phenylene group, the naphthylene group and the pyrazolene group may each independently have is at least one selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom(s), a nitro group, a halogen atom, an anilide group which may have a substituent and a phenyl group which may have a substituent, where the substituent the anilide group and the phenyl group may each independently have is at least one selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom(s) and a halogen atom.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a developing assembly which has at least a negatively chargeable developer, a developer container in which the negatively chargeable developer is held, a developer carrying member supported rotatably which carries and transports the negatively chargeable developer thereon, and a developer layer thickness regulating member for regulating the layer thickness of a negatively chargeable developer layer formed on the developer carrying member;","the developer carrying member being the developer carrying member described above.","According to further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for producing a developer carrying member having a substrate and a surface layer comprising the steps of:","forming on the substrate a coat of a coating material containing at least a binder resin having in the molecular structure at least one structure selected from the group consisting of an \u2014NHgroup, an \u2550NH group and an \u2014NH\u2014 linkage, conductive particles, a quaternary phosphonium salt and an azo metal complex compound represented by the above formula (1); and\n\ncuring the coat to form the surface layer.\n","According to the present invention, a developer carrying member can be obtained on the surface of which a developer can be made stable by controlling its triboelectric charging and which can maintain a high image quality over a long period of time even where a highly triboelectrically chargeable developer is used.","According to the present invention, a developing assembly can also be obtained which contributes to stable formation of high-grade electrophotographic images.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","\u2014Developer Carrying Member\u2014","The developer carrying member according to the present invention has a substrate and a surface layer and, in addition thereto, may have, e.g., an intermediate layer (e.g., an elastic layer) between the substrate and the surface layer. The developer carrying member of the present invention may be used as a developer carrying member used in electrophotographic apparatus (a developer carrying member for electrophotographic apparatus). The surface layer may also be formed directly on the surface of the substrate. The developer carrying member of the present invention is described below in detail.","Substrate:","As the substrate, any substrate known in the field of the developer carrying member may be used, and its shape may appropriately be selected from shapes of a hollow cylinder, a solid column, a belt and the like. As this substrate, a substrate may be used which is obtained by shaping a non-magnetic metal such as aluminum, stainless steel or brass into a hollow cylinder or solid column followed by polishing or grinding.","Surface Layer:","The surface layer is a cured product of a resin composition containing a binder resin, conductive particles, a quaternary phosphonium salt and an azo metal complex compound represented by the above formula (1). Here, this binder resin has in its molecular structure at least one structure (linkage) selected from the group consisting of an \u2014NHgroup, an \u2550NH group and an \u2014NH\u2014 linkage. The resin composition may also contain other additive(s) such as unevenness-providing particles described later.","The developer carrying member of the present invention has the surface layer constituted as above, and this enables the developer to be kept from being triboelectrically charged in excess where a negatively chargeable developer is used. Hence, this enables such a negatively chargeable developer to be stably provided with proper triboelectric charges. As the result, even where a developer more highly triboelectrically chargeable than conventional ones is used, the developer can achieve triboelectric charge quantity having been made proper over a long period of time, and hence can enjoy a good developing performance.","Incidentally, as to a developer carrying member having a surface layer formed by using a resin composition having the same formulation as the above except that the quaternary phosphonium salt is not used, the effect of keeping the highly triboelectrically chargeable developer from undergoing the charge-up has been found to be low. On the other hand, as to a developer carrying member having a surface layer formed by using a resin composition having the same formulation as the above except that the azo metal complex compound is not used, the effect of keeping the highly triboelectrically chargeable developer from undergoing the charge-up has been found to be obtained to a certain extent.","However, the developer carrying member having the surface layer formed by using a resin composition containing the binder resin, the quaternary phosphonium salt, the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles has brought a much greater effect of keeping the developer from being charged in excess, than when compared with the above two cases, and has been found to be remarkably effective in making the developer stable in its triboelectric charge quantity.","This effect is so much great as not to be explainable from the result obtained when either of the quaternary phosphonium salt and the azo metal complex compound is used as stated above, and is considered to be brought out by a synergetic effect of these materials. The mechanism by which the effect of keeping the developer from being charged in excess is so much great that is brought out by the combination of these materials was examined in the following way.","First, a surface layer made up by using the binder resin, the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles but without using the quaternary phosphonium salt was immersed in an organic solvent such as chloroform, in which the azo metal complex compound was soluble, to allow the azo metal complex compound to be extracted. As the result, the azo metal complex compound dissolved out in a quantity that was very small with respect to the quantity of the azo metal complex compound added.","This is because the azo metal complex compound came to be incorporated in the binder resin as part of a polymer, with the curing of the binder resin, as so considered.","Subsequently, a surface layer made up by using the binder resin, the quaternary phosphonium salt, the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles was likewise immersed in the organic solvent, to allow the azo metal complex compound to be extracted. As the result, the azo metal complex compound came much extracted by tens of times to hundreds of times the above case where the quaternary phosphonium salt was not added to the resin composition. This quantity in which the azo metal complex compound dissolved out was very large even when the quantities of the quaternary phosphonium salt and azo metal complex compound having been added are taken into account.","This is because, though both the azo metal complex compound and the quaternary phosphonium salt came to be incorporated in the binder resin as part of a polymer, with the curing of the binder resin, the quaternary phosphonium salt combines with the binder resin preferentially in the presence of the binder resin having a specific structure, as so considered. The reason why the quaternary phosphonium salt combines with the binder resin preferentially to the azo metal complex compound is not known in detail, and it is considered that, this makes it easy for the azo metal complex compound to be present singly in the surface layer. As the result, the azo metal complex compound, which is ionic, comes much present singly in the surface layer, and this prevents the surface layer from increasing in its volume resistance and makes the developer greatly kept from being charged in excess, as so considered. Then, as the result, this enables faulty images such as sleeve ghost, stains and blotches to be kept from occurring.","The fact that the azo metal complex compound is much present singly in the surface layer is evident from the fact that the azo metal complex compound came much extracted into the organic solvent from the surface layer made up by using the binder resin, the quaternary phosphonium salt, the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles in combination.","The resin composition containing the binder resin, the quaternary phosphonium salt, the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles is also very superior in storage stability. This is because the quaternary phosphonium salt is so highly compatible with the binder resin as to make the azo metal complex compound not easily dissolve therein, and hence they are low reactive at normal temperature, thereby making the resin composition not easily cause any change in its viscosity or any agglomeration of particles therein during its long-term storage, as so considered. Thus, any seeding may less occur in coating, promising a superior coating stability, even where the resin composition used in the present invention is used in a coating material after its long-term storage.","Surface Layer Forming Resin Composition:","\u2014Binder Resin","The binder resin is one having at least one structure selected from the group consisting of an \u2014NHgroup, an \u2550NH group and an \u2014NH\u2014 linkage (hereinafter also called \u201cNHn structure\u201d in some cases). Having the NHn structure in the molecular structure enables blotches, ghost and the like to be kept from occurring which are considered to be caused by excess triboelectric charging of the developer.","As specific examples of this binder resin, it may include the following: Polyurethane resins, polyamide resins, melamine resins, guanamine resins, epoxy resins making use of polyamide as a curing agent, phenol resins having the NHn structure, and resins having the NHn structure outside the backbone chain, such as urethane-modified epoxy resins.","Of these, the phenol resins having the NHn structure may particularly preferably be used because it promises a high hardness of the layer having been cured, and also is highly effective when used in combination. Such a phenol resin may include phenol resins produced by using a nitrogen-containing compound such as ammonia as a catalyst in their production steps, and may preferably be used. The nitrogen-containing compound that is a catalyst participates directly in polymerization reaction and exists in the phenol resin even after the reaction has been completed. It is commonly ascertained that, when, e.g., polymerized in the presence of an ammonia catalyst, an intermediate called an ammonia resol is formed, which exists in the phenol resin even after the reaction has been completed, as a structure as represented by the following formula (4).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"23.54mm","wi":"71.37mm","file":"US08792810-20140729-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The nitrogen-containing compound used in producing the above phenol resins may be either of acidic and basic, which may preferably be used.","The binder resin in the resin composition used to form the surface layer (a surface layer forming resin composition) may preferably be in a content of 50% by mass or more from the viewpoint of the retention of a pigment to a resin layer, and 80% by mass or less from the viewpoint of resistance control of the resin layer. Also, in regard to the binder resin, its structure may be analyzed by making analysis with an analyzer for IR (infrared absorption spectroscopy), NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) or the like.","\u2014Quaternary Phosphonium Salt","The quaternary phosphonium salt is necessary to stabilize the triboelectric charge-providing performance for developer, of the developer carrying member according to the present invention. Its structure may preferably be, from the viewpoint of keeping the developer from being charged in excess, be a salt (compound) represented by the following formula (3).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"18.54mm","wi":"57.32mm","file":"US08792810-20140729-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (3), Zto Zeach independently represent an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom(s), a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl group. Q represents an anion.","It is also preferable that at least three functional groups of Zto Zare any of the substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, the substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl group and the substituted or unsubstituted benzyl group. This enables easy improvement of dispersion uniformity of the quaternary phosphonium salt in the binder resin (e.g., a phenol resin having the NHn structure). The substituents the phenyl group, the naphthyl group and the benzyl group may each independently have may include, e.g., a halogen group, a nitro group, a sulfo group and an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom(s).","Qin the formula (3) may be, e.g., an anion selected from a halogen ion, OHand an organic acid ion. This organic acid ion may include organic sulfate ions, organic sulfonate ions, organic phosphate ions, molybdate ions, tungstate ions, and heteropolyacid ions containing molybdenum atoms or tungsten atoms. Also, in view of an advantage that, as the developer carrying member, it can keep the developer from being charged in excess when the quaternary phosphonium salt is mixed with the other materials to form the surface layer, it is preferable for Q to be a halogen ion or OH.","Quaternary phosphonium salts preferably usable in the present invention are enumerated in Tables 1-1 and 1-2 below, to which, however, the present invention is by no means limited.

A typical production method is described below.","First, to an amine component such as 4-chloro-2-aminophenol, a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is added, where, after the liquid temperature has come to 5\u00b0 C. or less, sodium nitrite dissolved in water is dropwise added while maintaining the liquid temperature at 10\u00b0 C. or less. The mixture obtained is stirred at 10\u00b0 C. or less for 30 minutes or more to 3 hours or less to carry out reaction to make this amine component into a diazo form to obtain a diazo compound. Then, to the reaction solution obtained, sulfamic acid is added, and potassium iodide starch paper is used to make sure that any nitric acid does not remain in excess in the reaction system.","Next, separately, a coupling component such as 3-methyl-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-pyrazolone, an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, sodium carbonate and an organic solvent such as n-butanol are stirred (mixed) at room temperature. To the solution obtained, the above diazo compound is added, and these are stirred at room temperature for several hours to carry out coupling reaction. After the stirring, resorcinol is added to the reaction solution to make sure that no reaction takes place between the diazo compound and the resorcinol, where the reaction is set to be completed. To the reaction solution obtained, water is added, and thereafter these are thoroughly stirred and then left to stand, followed by separation. An aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is further added, followed by stirring, washing and then separation to obtain a monoazo compound.","The amine component and the coupling component may be used under appropriate selection in accordance with the molecular structure of the desired azo metal complex compound. As an organic solvent other than the n-butanol used in carrying out the coupling, any solvent usable in carrying out the coupling is available, and monohydric alcohol, dihydric alcohol or a ketone type organic solvent is preferred. The monohydric alcohol may include, e.g., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, 2-propanol, isobutyl alcohol, sec-butyl alcohol, n-amyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers (the alkyl group of which has 1 to 4 carbon atoms). The dihydric alcohol may include, e.g., ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. The ketone type one may include, e.g., methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone.","Next, metal complexing reaction is carried out. To a n-butanol solution of the above monoazo compound, water, salicylic acid, n-butanol and sodium carbonate are added, and these are stirred. Where, e.g., iron is used as the coordination metal, an aqueous ferric chloride solution and sodium carbonate are added. The liquid temperature is raised to 30\u00b0 C. or more to 40\u00b0 C. or less, where the reaction is started and then the reaction is followed up by TLC (thin-layer chromatography). After 5 hours and within 10 hours from the start of the reaction, the TLC is used to make sure that raw-material spots have disappeared, where the reaction is set to be completed. After the stirring has been stopped, the reaction system is left to stand to effect separation. Further, water, n-butanol and an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution are added to carry out alkali washing. Filtration is carried out, and a solid (cake) is taken out, followed by washing with water.","Where any desired counter ion is to be provided, for example sodium hydroxide is added to water, and these are stirred while being heated, until the mixture obtained has come to have an internal temperature of 85\u00b0 C. or more to 90\u00b0 C. or less, where a liquid dispersion of the above cake is dropwise added thereto. This is stirred at 97\u00b0 C. or more to 99\u00b0 C. or less for 1 hour, followed by cooling and filtration, and thereafter the cake is washed with water. Then, the product obtained may sufficiently be dried by vacuum drying to obtain the azo metal complex compound usable in the present invention.","\u2014Conductive Particles","The conductive particles may be used under appropriate selection of any conductive particles known in the field of the developer carrying member. Such conductive particles may include, e.g., fine powders of metals such as aluminum, copper, nickel and silver, particles of conductive metal oxides such as antimony oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, molybdenum oxide and potassium titanate, crystalline graphite, all kind of carbon fibers, and conductive carbon black such as furnace black, lamp black, thermal black, acetylene black and channel black, and may include metal fibers. Any of these may also be used alone or in combination of two or more types.","Of these, carbon black and graphite are particularly preferable because of their superior dispersibility and superior electrical conductivity. Of these, conductive amorphous carbon is preferable because it has especially superior electrical conductivity, may be filled in high-molecular materials to provide them with conductivity, and can achieve any desired conductivity to a certain degree by merely controlling its amount when added. Also, in virtue of a thixotropic effect obtained when it is used in a coating material, it can improve dispersion stability and coating stability.","The conductive particles may preferably have a volume average particle diameter of 10 nm or more from the viewpoint of dispersion stability, and 20 \u03bcm or less from the viewpoint of resistance uniformity of the resin composition.","The conductive particles in the surface layer forming resin composition may preferably be in a content of from 1 part by mass or more to 100 parts by mass or less, based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin, which may differ depending on their particle diameter. As long as they are in a content of 1 part by mass or more, the surface layer can easily be improved in making it low in resistance, and, inasmuch as they are in a content of 100 parts by mass or less, the resistance can easily be lowered to a preferable value without greatly lowering the strength (wear resistance) of the conductive resin.","\u2014Other Additives","The resin composition may preferably be incorporated with unevenness-providing particles for forming surface unevenness, from the viewpoints of providing the surface layer with uniform surface roughness and maintaining its proper surface roughness. The unevenness-providing particles need not have any conductivity, and are added for the purpose of forming an unevenness profile on the surface of the resin composition surface layer. The unevenness-providing particles may preferably have a volume average particle diameter of 1 \u03bcm or more from the viewpoint of providing the unevenness, and 30 \u03bcm or less from the viewpoint of maintaining the wear resistance of the resin composition surface layer. In the surface layer forming resin composition, the unevenness-providing particles may also preferably be added thereto in an amount of 5 parts by mass or more from the viewpoint of the effect to be brought by their addition, and 100 parts by mass or less from the viewpoint of maintaining wear resistance, based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin.","Layer Thickness, Volume Resistivity and Surface Roughness of Surface Layer:","The surface layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 4 \u03bcm or more to 50 \u03bcm or less, and particularly preferably from 6 \u03bcm or more to 30 \u03bcm or less. As being 4 \u03bcm or more, the surface layer can easily cover the substrate and hence the effect of forming the surface layer can easily be obtained, and, as being 50 \u03bcm or less, the roughness of the surface layer can easily be controlled by the materials to be added thereto.","The surface layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of from 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, and particularly preferably from 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. As long as it has a volume resistivity of from 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, it is easy to make resistance control by the addition of the conductive particles to the surface layer.","The developer carrying member surface, i.e., the surface layer may preferably have a surface roughness, as arithmetic-mean roughness (Ra) prescribed in JIS B 0601-2001, of from 0.15 \u03bcm or more to 3.00 \u03bcm or less. As being 0.15 \u03bcm or more to 3.00 \u03bcm or less, this can easily bring out a transport power satisfactory as the developer carrying member.","In particular, in a developing assembly shown in  as will be described later, as making use of a magnetic developer and having as a developer layer thickness regulating member a magnetic blade disposed leaving a gap between it and a developer carrying member, it is also desirable for the above Ra to be from 0.15 \u03bcm or more to 2.50 \u03bcm or less. Setting it within this range can easily achieve good developing performance.","Further, in the case of developing assemblies as shown in , in which an elastic member is used in pressure contact with a developer carrying member, it is preferable for the surface layer to have a surface roughness Ra of from 0.30 \u03bcm or more to 3.00 \u03bcm or less. Setting it within this range can easily bring out a transport power satisfactory as the developer carrying member.","\u2014Developer Carrying Member Production Process\u2014","In the process for producing the developer carrying member of the present invention, a coat of a coating material containing at least the binder resin, conductive particles, quaternary phosphonium salt and azo metal complex compound described above is formed on the surface of the substrate, and the coat formed is cured (or may be dried to harden) to form the surface layer. Here, when the materials for forming the surface layer are mixed, it is preferable to disperse and mix these materials in a solvent to make up a coating material, which is coated on the surface of the substrate. In making the surface layer, it is preferable to use a coating material prepared by mixing the binder resin, the conductive particles, the quaternary phosphonium salt and the azo metal complex compound in a solvent in which the binder resin is soluble (as exemplified by methanol or isopropyl alcohol).","To disperse and mix the above materials, a known media dispersion system such as a ball mill, a sand mill, an attritor or a bead mill, or a known medialess dispersion system that utilizes impact atomization or thin-film spin methodology, may preferably be used. Also, as a method of coating the coating material obtained, it may include known methods such as dipping, spraying, roll coating, electrostatic coating and ring coating. As a curing method, it may include, e.g., heat curing.","\u2014Developing Assembly\u2014","The developing assembly making use of the developer carrying member of the present invention is described next by giving examples of embodiments, which, however, are by no means limited to the following embodiments.

Into its water tank, a stated amount of ion-exchanged water is put, and about 2 ml of the above CONTAMINON N is fed into this water tank.","In the measurement, the flow type particle image analyzer is used, carrying an objective lens \u201cUPlanApro\u201d (trade name; magnification: 10 times; number of aperture: 0.40), and a particle sheath \u201cPSE-900A\u201d (trade name; available from Sysmex Corporation) is used as a sheath solution. The liquid dispersion having been controlled according to the above procedure is introduced into the flow type particle analyzer, where 3,000 developer particles are counted in an HPE measuring mode and in a total count mode. Then, the binary-coded threshold value at the time of particle analysis is set to 85% and the diameter of particles to be analyzed are limited to circle-equivalent diameter of from 1.985 \u03bcm or more to less than 39.69 \u03bcm, where the average circularity of developer particles is determined.","In the measurement, before the measurement is started, autofocus control is performed using standard latex particles (e.g., trade name: \u201cRESEARCH AND TEST PARTICLES Latex Microsphere Suspensions 5200A\u201d; available from Duke Scientific Corporation; having been diluted with ion-exchanged water). Thereafter, the autofocus control may preferably be performed at intervals of 2 hours after the measurement has been started.","In working examples given later, a flow type particle image analyzer is used on which correction is operated by Sysmex Corporation and for which a correction certificate issued by Sysmex Corporation is issued. Measurement is made under the measurement and analysis conditions set when the correction certificate is received, except that the diameters of particles to be analyzed are limited to the circle-equivalent diameter of from 1.985 \u03bcm or more to less than 39.69 \u03bcm.","(9) Measurement of Glass Transition Point (Tg) of Binder Resin and Melting Point of Wax, Used in Developer:","Peak temperatures of maximum endothermic peaks of the wax and toner are measured according to ASTM D3418-82, using a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer \u201cQ1000\u201d (trade name; manufactured by TA Instruments Japan Ltd.).","The temperature at the detecting portion of the instrument is corrected on the basis of melting points of indium and zinc, and the amount of heat is corrected on the basis of heat of fusion of indium.","Stated specifically, about 10 mg of the toner is precisely weighed, and this is put into a pan made of aluminum and an empty pan made of aluminum is used as reference. Measurement is made at a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/min within the measurement temperature range of from 30\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. Here, in the measurement, the toner is first heated to 200\u00b0 C., then cooled to 30\u00b0 C. and thereafter heated again. In the course of this second-time heating, a maximum endothermic peak of a DSC curve in the temperature range of from 30\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. is taken as a maximum endothermic peak of the toner used in the present invention, in its DSC measurement. In that case, changes in specific heat are also found within the range of temperature of from 40\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. The point at which the middle-point line between the base lines of a differential thermal curve before and after the appearance of the changes in specific heat thus found and the differential thermal curve intersect is regarded as the glass transition temperature Tg of the binder resin.","(10) Measurement of Magnetic Properties of Magnetic Iron Oxide Particles Used in Developer:","Magnetic properties of the magnetic iron oxide particles are measured with use of a vibration sample type magnetic-force meter VSM-P7 (trade name), manufactured by Toei Industry, Co., Ltd., at a sample temperature of 25\u00b0 C. and under application of an external magnetic field of 795.8 kA\/m.","(11) Measurement of Average Primary Particle Diameters of Magnetic Iron Oxide Particles, Silica Particles and Titanium Oxide Particles, Used in Developer:","The average primary particle diameters of these particles may be specified by observing the respective particles on a scanning electron microscope (40,000 magnifications or more to 400,000 magnifications or less) and measuring Ferret's diameters of 200 particles for the respective particles to determine their number-average particle diameters.

Here, the images were reproduced after an image where no image was formed and no developer was consumed was reproduced on 3 sheets immediately before they were reproduced.","A: Any difference in tone is not seen at all.","B: A slight difference in tone is seen.","C: Some difference in tone is seen, but the hieroglyphic images are not clearly recognizable in shape.","D: A difference in tone appears for sleeve one round.","E: A difference in tone appears for sleeve two or more rounds.","(3) Blotches:","In making image evaluation for each developer carrying member, the surface of the developer carrying member surface layer was observed to visually observe whether or not any spotty images or wave-pattern images (blotches) were present which were caused by faulty triboelectric charge-providing to the developer. A case in which the blotches were present was marked with \u201cNG\u201d in the column of evaluation results of the table, and a case in which no blotches were present was marked with \u201cOK\u201d. Where the blotches occurred, the other evaluations were stopped.","(4) Wear Resistance of Developer Carrying Member Surface Layer:","The outer diameter of the developer carrying member was measured, and wear depths of the surface layer were calculated from differences between the values before service and the values after running, and an average value thereof was taken as the wear depth of the whole surface layer. Incidentally, in measuring the values after running, the surface of the developer carrying member was cleaned with isopropanol. Here, in measuring the values after running, a developer carrying member having been put to the running in the normal temperature and normal humidity environment (N\/N) of temperature 23\u00b0 C. and humidity 50% RH was used.","(5) Surface Roughness Ra of Surface Layer:","The arithmetic-mean roughness Ra of the surface of the developer carrying member was measured before and after the running. Here, in the measurement after the running, a developer carrying member having been put to the running in the normal temperature and normal humidity environment (N\/N) of temperature 23\u00b0 C. and humidity 50% RH was used.","Developer carrying members T2 to T23 were produced in the same way as the developer carrying member T1 according to Example 1 except that the constitution of each developer carrying member was changed as shown in Table 11. Note that, in Example 6, the solid content of the coating material used to form the surface layer was 15% by mass. For the developer carrying members T2 to T23 obtained, the developer Z-1 was used and the images formed were evaluated in the same way as Example 1. Evaluation results obtained are shown in Tables 12 and 13.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0294","num":"0293"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"287pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
