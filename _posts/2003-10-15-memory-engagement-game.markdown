{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST IN THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention was developed with government support under a Small Business Innovation Research Program Grant awarded by the National Institute of Health's National Institute on Aging. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to engaging persons with memory loss and, more particularly, to a game adapted to provide therapy for persons suffering from memory loss.","2. Description of the Prior Art","It is well known that many persons suffer increasing loss of memory with advanced age due to a variety of factors. However, memory loss is limited not only to the elderly, as victims of head injuries, strokes and other illnesses also can suffer memory loss. Memory loss often is frustrating for these individuals, and can lead to a reduction in quality of life and additional health problems. While significant advances in therapy and treatment have been made in recent years, it remains difficult to reverse memory loss, especially memory loss due to advanced age. Many people with memory loss require care in long-term care, assisted living and adult day-care facilities. Activities staff and\/or family members try to provide cognitive stimulation through a variety of techniques, such as playing games, making crafts, and providing entertainment, but such efforts often are not effective.","It is believed that the activities with the most therapeutic benefit are those that actively engage the mind, such as solving problems or answering questions, rather than those that passively engage the mind, such as watching television. It further is believed that an environment involving a number of people instead of a solitary environment also is therapeutic. Games that provide mental stimulation and mental engagement, and which provide opportunities for a number of people to interact, are best for persons having memory impairment. While games directed specifically to memory-impaired persons are known, such games have a number of drawbacks.","For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,244,577 discloses a diagnostic memory skill game that is played by students together with a teacher. The game is played on a game board having player areas. One of the player areas is occupied by the teacher, who plays the game with the students. Individual question cards are read one at a time to each of the players by the teacher. If the question is answered correctly, the question card is placed in a \u201cmastered\u201d area. If the question is answered incorrectly, the question card is placed in a \u201crecycling\u201d area. The object of the game is for each player to respond correctly to each question so that all of the player's question cards are placed in the mastered area before the teacher's question cards are placed likewise. The student players are motivated by competition with the teacher, while the teacher has an opportunity to diagnose student memory skill deficiencies.","Although the competition engendered by the game according to the '577 patent might be desirable in a student-teacher learning environment, it is extremely undesirable for persons who suffer from memory loss. Moreover, the game presumes that the teacher will be as challenged by the questions as the students. Such a situation would be wholly inappropriate for a game played by persons suffering from memory deficiencies.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,077 discloses a non-competitive memory enhancement game. The game according to the '077 patent is played with the assistance of family members, friends, and\/or volunteers who coordinate play. The game has a question and answer format that is similar to flash-card games. Questions may relate to general knowledge or may be personalized. Personalized questions are developed by family, friends, and others using the player's personal memorabilia. The questions are provided in the form of a photograph or other pictorial image on one side of a card, and questions and\/or comments relating to the picture on the opposite side. A game board has a playing path that is divided into positions identified by subject matter categories. Questions related to a given subject matter are asked based on the player's position on the board. Since the game is not competitive, there is no final goal or winning position on the board. The object of the game is to share memories and to receive a reward after participating for a predetermined period of time or number of plays.","While the game according to the '077 patent is desirable in the sense that it is non-competitive, it may not be enjoyed by certain participants due to the personalized nature of some of the questions. In other words, some participants may not want personal information to be shared in a public environment or they may not want to be informed of others' personal information. In addition, the nature of the board requires the participants to sit together around a table. Such an arrangement of the participants relative to each other may be undesirable in certain circumstances. In addition, the use of a game board limits the number of participants to those who can fit around the board. Yet additionally, the game has the potential to be boring because there is no inherent object to be accomplished.","In view of the drawbacks of the prior art, there remains a need for an effective and enjoyable memory engagement game. Any such game desirably would be non-competitive or largely non-competitive, could be played by individuals or a group of players, would permit players to be arranged in any desired position relative to each other, and would not involve the disclosure of personal information. Any such game desirably could be played by persons of different cognitive levels. Perhaps most importantly, the game would be interesting and entertaining to play and would have an inherent object to be accomplished.","The present invention provides a new and improved memory engagement game that is based on Montessori educational principles, and which employs elements of a trivia game and a bingo game. In the preferred embodiment, the game according to the invention comprises a plurality of game cards, each of which contains answers to certain pre-determined questions. The invention also includes a plurality of calling cards, each of which contains a pre-determined question on one side and various information on the other side, such as the answer to the question, clues to answer the question, and \u201ctalking points\u201d to facilitate a discussion related to the question. The invention preferably includes game boards into which the game cards can be inserted. Each game board has a plurality of openings, each of which has a movable cover associated therewith. When a game card is inserted into the game board, the answers to the pre-determined questions are registered with the openings so that a player can see each of the answers. The player can move any given cover in order to mask the answer displayed in the associated opening.","The game according to the invention can be provided in different levels of difficulty and subject matter. Typical subjects would be Presidents, historical events, famous people, nursery rhymes, and so forth. The game cards can be provided with answers to two or more games slightly out of register with each other. Accordingly, by suitably positioning the game card in the game board, two or more separate games can be played on each side of the game card. If double-sided game cards are provided, each game card can contain four or more separate games.","In use, a game board containing a game card is distributed to each player. An activity leader holds up a calling card with the question displayed to the players. The question is read aloud, either by the leader or one or more of the players. If a player sees the answer to the question in one of the game board openings, the player announces the answer and closes the cover to mask the answer. The steps of asking questions and covering the answers are repeated until one or more players covers all of the openings on the game board, signifying the end of that particular game. By choosing games suited to different cognitive levels, the players will be suitably challenged in an interesting and entertaining manner, and will be able share thoughts and memories with each other in a non-competitive environment.","The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention are fully described in the specification and claims that follow. The accompanying drawings constitute a part of the specification and illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the invention.","Referring to the various drawing FIGS., apparatus for playing the game according to the invention includes one or more game boards , a plurality of game cards , and a plurality of calling cards . The board  has a rear face  and a front face . The front face  has a plurality of openings  arranged in a rectangular array in the manner of a bingo game. The board  can be placed on any surface for purposes of playing the game, but it preferably will be placed atop a flat playing surface such as a tabletop (not shown).","The front face  is secured to the rear face , typically by fasteners such as screws. The front face  and the rear face  are spaced from each other so as to define a cavity  therebetween. The game board  further includes a slot  disposed along one edge of the connected front face  and rear face . In the preferred embodiment, the game board  is rectangular, but it may be shaped differently, if desired.","The rear face  is generally planar and includes a peripheral lip . The lip  extends toward the front face . A pair of movable legs  are disposed adjacent the upper corners of the rear face . The rear face  includes a pair of compartments  to house the legs . The legs  may be placed in a first position where the legs  are completely disposed within the compartments  or in a second position where the legs  extend outside the compartments . The first position permits the rear face  to lie flat upon the playing surface or for storage, and the second position permits the board  to be positioned at an angle to the playing surface for improved viewing by players. In the second position, the legs  extend from the rear face  generally perpendicularly to the rear face .","The front face  comprises a frame  and a front cover . The front cover  has an exterior face  as illustrated in , and an interior face  that is illustrated in . The openings  are formed in the front cover . The frame  has a first side, shown in , and a second side shown in . The frame  includes two or more beams  that are disposed along opposed edges of the frame . The beams  are parallel to each other. The frame  further includes one or more interior cross-supports  and a pair of peripheral cross-supports . The cross-supports ,  are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the beams . The cross-supports ,  are connected at their ends to the beams . The peripheral cross-supports  cooperate with the beams  to form an outer periphery of the frame .","A pair of tracks  are disposed along the opposed edges of each interior cross-support . The peripheral cross-supports  have an outer edge  along the outer periphery of the game board , and an inner edge . A track  is disposed along each inner edge . As shown in , the beams  are thicker than the interior cross-supports  and peripheral cross-supports . This permits the beams  to assist in holding the front cover  in place because the front cover  is disposed between the beams .","The game board  includes a plurality of covers  that can be positioned to cover or uncover the openings . Each cover  includes a panel  that is substantially planar and generally rectangular. A tab  extends outwardly from one edge of the panel . A pair of flanges  extend outwardly of the panel  on opposed sides of the panel . The flanges  generally define an extension of the panel . When viewed from above, the flanges  are perpendicular to the tab . An enlarged formation  is disposed along the outer edge of each flange . It is expected that the panels  will be opaque, and will have dimensions that approximate that of the openings , for example, about 1.3 inches by about 3.4 inches. Preferably, the covers  are formed in a molding operation from a colored or dyed plastics material such as clarified polypropylene.","The front cover  is substantially planar and fits on top of the interior cross-supports  and peripheral cross-supports  between the beams  on the first side of the frame . The front cover  includes side edges  that extend over the outer edge  of the peripheral cross-supports . The side edges  extend to meet the lip  of the rear face , thereby defining the outer boundaries of the cavity . The interior face  of the front cover  further includes raised edges  () that border each opening . The raised edges  are disposed adjacent the tracks . During assembly of the game board , the front cover  is installed so that it rests upon the first side of the frame . The tabs  of the covers  extend outwardly through the openings . The tracks  and the raised edges  engage the flanges  so as to compress the flanges  therebetween. The tracks  and the raised edges  fit together in a manner that is tight enough to prevent the covers  from moving unless force is applied to the tabs  by a player.","Referring to , game cards  according to the invention are illustrated. Each game card  has front and rear sides ,  and a pair of opposed side edges , each of which includes a pair of notches . Each game card  has indicia  thereon. As will be described in more detail below, the indicia  represent answers to pre-determined questions. Preferably, each side ,  includes answers  for two games. In use, one or more game cards  are inserted through the slot  into the cavity . The answers  for a selected game are visible through the openings  when the covers  are retracted. If the game card  is shifted slightly within the cavity , answers  corresponding to the other game will be visible through the openings .","Referring to , calling cards  according to the invention are illustrated. Each calling card  has two sides , . Indicia  in the form of a question is displayed on the side . The question  preferably is a \u201cfill-in-the-blank\u201d question where a player is asked to complete a sentence. The answers  on each game card  correspond to and provide answers to the questions  displayed on the sides . The other side of each calling card  displays information for an activity leader. The information for the activity leader includes the question , the answer  to the question , the game number and description of the category (indicated by the reference numeral ), a clue  that rhymes with the answer  to the question , and one or more talking points . The talking points  are intended to facilitate discussion among the players. The talking points  relate to facts about the question  and the answer .","The game board  is provided with a release  that locates the game cards  in a desired position within the cavity . As illustrated in FIGS.  and A\u2013C, the release  includes a button  that extends through an aperture  in the rear face . The release  additionally includes a holder  disposed adjacent the button , and a pair of deformable wings . Each wing  terminates in a cylindrical end . The ends  contact the lip  of the rear face , and provide support for the wings  to position the holder  in a position that engages the game cards . One of the peripheral cross-supports  is provided with a pair of notches . The ends  move along the lip  when the button  is pressed. The ends  extend through the frame , and the notches  provide room for unrestricted movement of the ends . The holder  fits into one of the notches  and prevents the game card(s)  from sliding within the cavity .","To operate the release  and remove a game card  (or move it to another position), pressure is applied to the button . Movement of the button  causes the wings  to bend, thereby moving the holder  in a direction away from the game card  and disengaging the notch . After the holder  has been disengaged from the notch , the card  can be moved.","The use of slidable covers  is an example of one technique for selectively covering and uncovering the openings . Other techniques also may be employed. For example, the cover  could be hinged such that the cover  could be lifted to uncover the associated opening , or lowered to cover the opening . The cover  could be removable. Such a removable cover  would be sized to fit the opening , and would have a slight interference fit with the openings  to hold the cover  in place. The removable cover  would include a handle or other gripping means for a player to maneuver the cover . Magnets also may be used to secure the covers  in place. The above-described alternate techniques for covering and uncovering the openings  are examples only, and other suitable techniques for selectively covering and uncovering the openings  will be apparent to those skilled in the art.","It is preferred that the openings  will be large enough to print the answers  in large font. A font size of 36 or larger is preferred, and a plain font such as a sans-serif style also is preferred. Additionally, the tabs  are sized so that they may be gripped by persons with difficulties resulting from diminished motor skills or arthritis. The game board  typically could have dimensions of approximately 11.4 inches by 13.2 inches. The answers  are arranged on the game card  so that when the game board  is inclined at an angle of approximately 15 degrees above the playing surface, the answers  appear to be centered in the openings .","The game board  preferably is formed from a sturdy, lightweight plastics material. The front face  and the rear face  preferably are opaque and may be colored in a neutral color. The covers  may be translucent or opaque and preferably will have a color that contrasts with the color of the front face  and rear face  to aid players in locating the covers . Most color schemes are suitable for the front face , the rear face , and the covers ; however, it is preferred that the color scheme does not include fluorescent colors or colors that contrast in a vivid manner. In one preferred embodiment, the front face  and the rear face  are ivory, and the covers  are purple. The game cards  and the calling cards  preferably are formed from a non-glare cardstock.","The memory engagement game according to the invention may be played in assisted-living adult day care, long-term care, or similar settings. For use in such settings, a game kit preferably includes 15 game boards , a plurality of double-sided game cards  for each game board , a plurality of double-sided calling cards  (for example, 15 for each game), and an instruction manual. Each game board  has a plurality of openings  (preferably nine), and each game card  has a plurality of answers  (preferably 15) on each side , , wherein each game card  may be used for a plurality of games, preferably four. The game kit thus provides game boards, game cards , and calling cards  for 15 players. Because the game boards  are stand-alone units, there is no limitation on the arrangement of players relative to each other.","Before play begins, each player is provided with a game board  and one or more game cards . Each side of each game card  has displayed thereon the answers  for a plurality of games. With reference to the game card  illustrated in , each of the two sides ,  of each game card  has a plurality of answers  printed thereon. The answers  preferably are printed so that the printing for each game contrasts with the printing for the other game or games. For example, a game card  could display answers  for \u201cGAME 5\u201d in white print on a black background, and for \u201cGAME 6,\u201d the answers  could be displayed in contrasting black print on a white background. The answers  are spaced on the game card  so that only the answers  for a particular game show through the openings . For example, when the game card  is inserted entirely into the cavity , the answers  to \u201cGAME 6\u201d may be viewed through the openings . When the button  is pressed and the game card  is moved slightly outwardly from the cavity , the answers  to \u201cGAME 5\u201d may be viewed through the openings .","Each game relates to a particular category . Typical game categories  include historical events, Presidents, nursery rhymes, and so forth. Each game has a set of game cards  and corresponding calling cards . If desired, some game cards  can contain identical answers . In that case, the game will be non-competitive because each of the players will answer the same questions at the same time. It also is possible for the game cards to have different combinations of answers . In such a circumstance, the game will be somewhat competitive. For a game having nine answers  printed on each game card , there preferably are 15 calling cards  associated with that game.","To begin play, each player inserts the game card  for a selected game into the game board . A game leader then reads a question  from one of the calling cards  that corresponds to that game. If a player determines the answer , the player covers the opening  in which the answer  is displayed. If the players are unable to determine the answer , the leader may read a clue  displayed on the calling card  to assist players in answering the question . The leader also may bring up some talking points  listed on the calling card  to promote discussion among the players. The process of reading questions  and covering answers  continues until one or more of the players covers all of the openings  and indicates to the leader that all of the openings  are covered. When a player covers all of the openings , it signifies the end of that particular game. The covering of all of the openings  thus represents an inherent object to be accomplished by the players. The game card  may be moved within the cavity  or turned over to reveal the answers  that correspond to another game, and the process may be recommenced with a different set of calling cards .","To accommodate players having different levels of cognitive functioning, or to speed up play, the play of the game may be modified. For example, play may begin with several of the openings  covered. It is possible to provide more difficult questions  for higher-functioning players, and simpler questions  for players with low-to-mid levels of functioning. The talking points  provided on each calling card  can be of further therapeutic benefit to players' memory abilities and may be used to extend the game. If it is desired to shorten the game, all or some of the talking points  may be omitted.","As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, the game according to the invention is non-competitive or largely non-competitive, can be played by individuals or a group of players, permits players to be arranged in any desired position relative to each other, and does not involve the disclosure of personal information. The game can be played by persons of different cognitive levels or needs. The game is interesting and entertaining to play and has an inherent object to be accomplished.","Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to certain preferred embodiments, equivalent alterations and modifications to the embodiments may be apparent to others skilled in the art upon the reading and understanding of this specification. The present invention is limited only by the scope of the following claims, and includes all such alterations, modifications, and equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A","b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
