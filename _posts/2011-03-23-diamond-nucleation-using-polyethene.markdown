The government has certain rights in this invention.","The combined properties of good electrical insulation, high thermal conductivity, and low dielectric constant make diamond well suited for use in electronic device packaging and multichip module technologies. The deposition of micro, nano and ultrananocrystalline diamond has been reported on various kinds of substrates. The substrates can be classified into three groups viz. ones that form carbides (Si, Mo, W); those which dissolve carbon but do not form carbides (Pt, Pd, Rh); and those which neither dissolve carbon nor form carbides (Cu, Ag, Au). Diamond films on Cu substrates or Cu surfaces are of significant interest with respect to present-day electronics (copper interconnects) and microelectronics. The growth of well-adhered and dense diamond films on non-carbide forming and non-carbon dissolving substrates or surfaces like Cu Ag, Au is important in view of electrical applications but it is usually considered impractical because of poor adhesion, low nucleation density, and their immiscibility with carbon.","Diamond nucleation on non-diamond surfaces without pre-treatment is usually very difficult and slow. Various methods are employed in the existing art to improve the nucleation density. Diamond nucleation on non-diamond surfaces can be enhanced by the surface pretreatments including scratching, seeding, electrical biasing, ion implantation, ultrasonic abrasion with diamond powder mixture suspensions and pre-coating silicon substrate nucleation layers such as tungsten followed by ultrasonic agitation with nanodiamond powder.","It is a well established fact known to those skilled in the art that the nucleation density is enhanced by various pre-treatment methods but at the same time, the surface alteration or damage (usually by the formation of nano-scale pits and scratches and defect concentration) and contamination of the substrate surface in varying degrees as a result of any kind of pre-treatment cannot be overruled and is inevitable. Also, these pretreatment methods cannot be easily applied to substrates of complex geometry and shape, and are incompatible with many real-life applications requiring such diamond films viz. electronic devices, and optical window materials and they even add to the expenditure. Thus, pre-treatment of the substrate surface to enhance nucleation density renders it unsuitable for integration into electronics line of production.","Hence, there exists the need of an effective method of diamond nucleation on an electrically viable surface that does not require any pre-treatment and exhibits high nucleation density. The present invention overcomes the drawbacks of the pre-treatment methods and leads to the direct integration of diamond in electronic chips and also reduces the production cost.","The present invention is directed to a method of diamond nucleation that utilizes a cheap seeding material in the form of polyethene for the diamond film deposition on a substrate surface that neither forms carbide nor dissolves carbon and is electrically viable.","The present invention overcomes the drawbacks of the seeding methods known in the art and uses polyethene as nucleating agent to deposit diamond on a non-carbide forming and non-carbon dissolving, electrically viable substrate surface. The method of the present invention allows covering of large substrate surfaces cheaply and completely and reduces the production cost to a point at which it becomes economically viable to use diamond as a material of choice.","According to an aspect of the invention, a novel method of diamond nucleation using polyethene followed by chemical vapor diamond deposition is presented.","According to another aspect of the invention, a non-abrasive, non-destructive method of diamond nucleation comprises: providing a substrate surface, depositing polyethene layer on the substrate surface, and exposing the substrate surface to a gaseous mixture.","According to still another aspect of the invention, the gaseous mixture comprises at least a carbon-containing gas and hydrogen at a substrate temperature of 400-800\u00b0 C. in presence of an energy source that can break the gaseous molecules into radicals.","According to another aspect of the invention, the substrate surface is a metal that neither forms carbide nor dissolves carbon.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the substrate surface is selected from a group of metals that neither form carbide nor dissolve carbon, such as but not limited to Cu, Ag, and Au. These substrate surfaces usually give poor nucleation density without using any conventional seeding method but surprisingly, the method of the present invention, results in a well-adhered diamond film with a high nucleation density, without exposing the substrate surface to any mechanical damage.","According to one aspect of the invention, a non-destructive, non-abrasive, scalable and economic process of diamond nucleation is provided.","According to another aspect of the invention, the polyethene comprises at least one of low density polyethene (LDPE), medium density polyethene (MDPE), high density polyethene (HDPE), linear low density polyethene (LLDPE) and very low density polyethene (VLDPE).","In yet another aspect of the invention, polyethene has a density between 0.80-0.95 g\/cm.","According to another aspect of the invention, the carbon-containing gas comprises at least one of hydrocarbons, hydrocarbons containing oxygen and\/or nitrogen, hydrocarbons containing halogens, carbon vapor, CO and CO2.","According to one aspect of the invention, polyethene can be deposited on the substrate surface by techniques such as but not limited to melting, sputtering, spin coating, dipping, and dip pen lithography. Any technique that can result in a polyethene layer on the substrate surface can be used in conformation with the process of the present invention.","According to another aspect of the invention, the polyethene layer is at least 100 nm thick.","According to still another aspect of the invention, the ratio of the carbon-containing gas and hydrogen is about 0.1-3.0:100.","According to one aspect of the invention, the ratio of the carbon containing gas and hydrogen is about 0.3-1.0:100.","According to still another aspect of the invention, a sulfur containing species in the concentration range of about 100 ppm to about 1000 ppm is added to the gaseous mixture for enhancing the density of diamond nucleation and growth rate.","According to another aspect of the invention, the total pressure of the gases in the gaseous mixture is in the range of about 10-100 Torr.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a method of diamond nucleation is provided, wherein the polyethene is a \u2018kitchen-wrap\u2019 or \u2018food-wrap\u2019 polyethene. The \u2018kitchen wrap\u2019 or \u2018food-wrap\u2019 polyethene is a simple and cheap seeding material for diamond nucleation as compared to any conventionally used seeding process.","According to another aspect of the invention, the method of diamond thin film nucleation is made on a copper substrate by \u2018food-wrap\u2019 polyethene under chemical vapor deposition conditions.","According to still another aspect of the invention, the method of nucleation of diamond film is made on a silver substrate by \u2018food-wrap\u2019 polyethene under chemical vapor deposition conditions.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method of fabrication of diamond using polyethene as nucleating agent is provided, said method comprising: providing a substrate surface, depositing polyethene layer on the substrate surface, and exposing the substrate surface to a gaseous mixture comprising of at least a carbon-containing gas, and hydrogen at a substrate temperature of 400-800\u00b0 C. for a period of at least 0.5 hours, in presence of an energy source that can break the gaseous molecules into radical; wherein the said substrate surface is a metal that neither forms carbide nor dissolves carbon.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method of fabrication of diamond using polyethene as nucleating agent is provided wherein, the substrate surface comprises at least one of Cu, Ag, and Au.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the carbon-containing gas comprises at least one of hydrocarbons, hydrocarbons containing oxygen and\/or nitrogen, hydrocarbons containing halogens, carbon vapor, CO and CO2.","According to still another aspect of the invention, a method of diamond nucleation using polyethene is provided that is a significant step towards non-cumbersome, non-abrasive and non-destructive nucleation of diamond for commercial production particularly in the field of electronics.
