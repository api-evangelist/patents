When mapping phycocyanin pigment, coliform bacteria, and bacteria in Lake Erie and its tributaries with LANDSAT 7 data, it had to be determined which or how many of bands 1-5 and 7 (which have 30-m spatial resolution and relatively narrow spectral bands, as opposed to the 60-m spatial resolution of band 6 and the relatively wide band-width of the 15-m-resolution band 8) to use. A mathematical procedure (multiple regressions) was applied to seek the best combinations of those bands to correlate with each one of these targets (phycocyanin, coliform, and ) separately. It was determined that the use of the single band radiances (even if they were reduced to spectral reflectances from theoretical atmospheric models) as inputs to this procedure, the resulting algorithm would not be very robust (i.e., repeatable under different solar illumination and atmospheric conditions). Therefore, spectral ratios (ratios of spectral bands, after empirical correction for atmospheric haze through a process referred to as \u201cdark object subtraction\u201d were input to the mathematical procedure for each pixel from which a water sample had been collected. These 15 non-reciprocal ratios (R21, R31, R32, R41, . . . R75) became the dependent variables and phycocyanin (or coliform or ) became the independent variable, which was the result of lab analysis of the water samples. For the LANDSAT 7 overpass, 30 water samples were collected, which were measured for both phycocyanin and coliform content. The best subsets of spectral ratios were determined, and then the ones with the highest R(Adjusted) values were tested to see if they passed the Durbin-Watson test. The model with the highest R(Adjusted) that also passed the Durbin-Watson test was the model that was considered to be the best.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0159"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0160"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0161"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0163"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0164"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0165"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0166"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0162","num":"0167"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0168"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0169"},"figref":"FIG. 11","i":"E.

However, the models clearly show that the predicted and actual values of coliform content in one case and content in the other case are pretty well correlated.","Unlike the preferred phycocyanin and algorithms, the preferred coliform algorithm only uses spectral ratios of TM bands 2, 3, and 4, which are in the wavelength range of silicon detectors. Therefore, very inexpensive sensors are available, such as the ones used for video cameras. The algorithms for and phycocyanin, however, require use of TM bands 5 and\/or 7, and they can be done with more expensive sensors on or near the Earth's surface.","Having shown and described a preferred embodiment of the invention, those skilled in the art will realize that many variations and modifications may be made to affect the described invention and still be within the scope of the claimed invention.
