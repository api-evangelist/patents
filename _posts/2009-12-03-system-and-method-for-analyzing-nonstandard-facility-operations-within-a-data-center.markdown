{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","At least one aspect in accord with the present invention relates generally to apparatus and processes for modeling data centers, and more specifically, to apparatus and processes for analyzing the impact of nonstandard operation of one or more elements of a data center.","2. Discussion of Related Art","In response to the increasing demands of information-based economies, information technology networks continue to proliferate across the globe. One manifestation of this growth is the centralized network data center. A centralized network data center typically consists of various information technology equipment, collocated in a structure that provides network connectivity, electrical power and cooling capacity. Often the equipment is housed in specialized enclosures termed \u201cracks\u201d which integrate these communications, power and cooling elements. In some data center configurations, rows of racks are organized into hot and cold aisles to decrease the cost associated with cooling the information technology equipment. These characteristics make data centers a cost effective way to deliver the computing power required by many software applications.","Various processes and software applications have been developed to aid data center personnel in designing data centers. To enable the data center design process, some of these tools allow users to create logical models of data centers. These logical models allow users to plan, test and reconfigure a variety of data center layouts to determine which layouts can be expected to satisfy desired data center performance and cost characteristics.","Aspects in accord with the present invention manifest an appreciation that conventional data center management systems lack the ability to provide timely analysis of the overall impact to a data center of nonstandard operation of one or more elements included in a data center. These nonstandard operations may include any state of operation that is out of compliance with the expected operational performance of a data center element, such as sluggish operations, operations at decreased efficiency or capacity, and outright failure to operate. According to various examples, aspects provide for a prospective, multi-dimensional analysis of the effect of one or more data center element operating in a nonstandard fashion. In these examples, the analysis is conducted in response to a request from an external entity, such as a user or another system, and the results of the analysis are provided to the external entity. Thus examples can provide external entities with prospective, rather than retrospective, notifications detailing the potential impact of the nonstandard operation of one or more data center elements.","According to one example, a computer implemented method for simulating nonstandard operation of an element of a data center is provided. The method includes acts of determining at least first one data center resource affected by at least one first data center element, selecting at least one first simulator from a plurality of simulators based at least in part on the at least one first data center resource and the at least one first data center element and generating a first impact analysis of the nonstandard operation of the at least one first data center element using the at least one first simulator, wherein generating the analysis includes identifying at least one second data center element affected by the nonstandard operation of the at least one first data center element.","In the method, the act of determining the at least one first data center resource may include an act of receiving configuration management information from a database of benchmarks calculated at least in part on modeled information and at least in part on measurements taken during operation of the data center. In addition, the act of selecting the at least one first simulator may include an act of selecting at least two simulators and the act of generating the impact analysis may include an act of generating an impact analysis that spans at least two data center resources.

Moreover, the act of generating the first impact analysis may include acts of generating a list of critically impacted data center elements and generating a list of data center elements with affected redundancy.","The method may further include acts of determining at least one second data center resource affected by at least one third data center element identified in the list of critically impacted data center elements, selecting at least one second simulator from the plurality of simulators based at least in part on the at least one second data center resource and the at least one third data center element and generating a second impact analysis of nonstandard operation of the at least one third data center element using the at least one second simulator. In addition, the method may further include an act of providing the impact analysis to an external entity. In the method, the act of providing the impact analysis to the external entity may include an act of providing the impact analysis to an external system via a system interface. In addition, the act of providing the impact analysis to the external entity may include an act of providing the impact analysis to a user via a user interface.","According to another example, a data center management appliance is provided. The data center management appliance includes a network interface, a memory and a controller coupled to the network interface and the memory. In this example, the controller is configured to determine at least one first data center resource affected by at least one first data center element, select at least one first simulator from a plurality of simulators based at least in part on the at least one first data center resource and the at least one first data center element and generate a first impact analysis of nonstandard operation of the at least one first data center element using the at least one first simulator, the first impact analysis identifying at least one second data center element affected by the nonstandard operation of the at least one first data center element.","In the data center management appliance, the controller configured to determine the at least one first data center resource may be further configured to receive configuration management information from a database of benchmarks calculated at least in part on modeled information and at least in part on measurements taken during operation of the data center. In addition, the controller configured to select the at least one first simulator and generate the impact analysis may be further configured to select at least two simulators and generate an impact analysis that spans at least two data center resources. Further, the controller configured to select the at least one first simulator from the plurality of simulators may be further configured to select the at least one first simulator from a plurality of simulators including at least one of a cooling simulator and a power simulator. Moreover, the controller configured to generate the first impact analysis may be further configured to generate a list of critically impacted data center elements and generate a list of data center elements with affected redundancy.","In the data center management appliance, the controller may be further configured to determine at least one second data center resource affected by at least one third data center element identified in the list of critically impacted data center elements, select at least one second simulator from the plurality of simulators based at least in part on the at least one second data center resource and the at least one third data center element and generate a second impact analysis using the at least one second simulator.

Examples of data center resources include power, cooling, physical space (such as physical floor space and rack U space), remote equipment control capability, virtualized resources, distributed computing resources, shared data storage, software provisioning, network time synchronization, physical and logical security and physical and logical network connectivity and data transmission. According to one example, a computer system is specially configured to conduct a multi-dimensional analysis which calculates the effect of a data center element operating in a nonstandard way on the provision and consumption of one or more data center resources. In some examples, the specially configured computer system is a data center management appliance, as discussed further below. In these examples, the calculated effect on data center resource availability is ultimately translated into an overall impact assessment potentially involving all of the elements of the data center.","Examples of the methods and apparatuses discussed herein are not limited in application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Further, aspects may be located on a single computer system or may be distributed among a plurality of computer systems connected to one or more communications networks.","For example, various aspects and functions may be distributed among one or more computer systems configured to provide a service to one or more client computers, or to perform an overall task as part of a distributed system. Additionally, aspects may be performed on a client-server or multi-tier system that includes components distributed among one or more server systems that perform various functions. Consequently, examples are not limited to executing on any particular system or group of systems. Further, aspects may be implemented in software, hardware or firmware, or any combination thereof. Thus, aspects may be implemented within methods, acts, systems, system elements and components using a variety of hardware and software configurations, and examples are not limited to any particular distributed architecture, network, or communication protocol.","Referring to , there is illustrated a block diagram of a distributed computer system , in which various aspects and functions may be practiced. The distributed computer system  may include one more computer systems that exchange, i.e. send or receive, information. For example, as illustrated, the distributed computer system  includes computer systems ,  and . As shown, the computer systems ,  and  are interconnected by, and may exchange data through, communication a network . The network  may include any communication network through which computer systems may exchange data. To exchange data using the network , the computer systems ,  and  and the network  may use various methods, protocols and standards, including, among others, Token Ring, Ethernet, Wireless Ethernet, Bluetooth, TCP\/IP, UDP, DTN, HTTP, FTP, SNMP, SMS, MMS, SS7, JSON, SOAP, CORBA, REST and Web Services. To ensure data transfer is secure, the computer systems ,  and  may transmit data via the network  using a variety of security measures including, for example, TSL, SSL or VPN. While the distributed computer system  illustrates three networked computer systems, the distributed computer system  is not so limited and may include any number of computer systems and computing devices, networked using any medium and communication protocol.","Various aspects and functions may be implemented as specialized hardware or software executing in one or more computer systems including the computer system  shown in . As depicted, the computer system  includes a processor , a memory , a bus , an interface  and a storage . The processor  may perform a series of instructions that result in manipulated data. The processor  may be a commercially available processor such as an Intel Xeon, Itanium, Core, Celeron, Pentium, AMD Opteron, Sun UtraSPARC, IBM Power5+, or IBM mainframe chip, but may be any type of processor, multiprocessor or controller. The processor  is connected to other system elements, including one or more memory devices , by the bus .","The memory  may be used for storing programs and data during operation of the computer system . Thus, the memory  may be a relatively high performance, volatile, random access memory such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or static memory (SRAM). However, the memory  may include any device for storing data, such as a disk drive or other non-volatile storage device. Various examples may organize the memory  into particularized and, in some cases, unique structures to perform the functions disclosed herein.","Components of the computer system  may be coupled by an interconnection element such as the bus . The bus  may include one or more physical busses, for example, busses between components that are integrated within a same machine, but may include any communication coupling between system elements including specialized or standard computing bus technologies such as IDE, SCSI, PCI and InfiniBand. Thus, the bus  enables communications, for example, data and instructions, to be exchanged between system components of the computer system .","The computer system  also includes one or more interface devices  such as input devices, output devices and combination input\/output devices. Interface devices may receive input or provide output. More particularly, output devices may render information for external presentation. Input devices may accept information from external sources. Examples of interface devices include keyboards, mouse devices, trackballs, microphones, touch screens, printing devices, display screens, speakers, network interface cards, etc. Interface devices allow the computer system  to exchange information and communicate with external entities, such as users and other systems.","The storage system  may include a computer readable and writeable nonvolatile data storage medium in which instructions are stored that define a program that may be executed by the processor . The storage system  also may include information that is recorded, on or in, the medium, and this information may be processed by the processor  during execution of the program. More specifically, the information may be stored in one or more data structures specifically configured to conserve storage space or increase data exchange performance. The instructions may be persistently stored as encoded signals, and the instructions may cause the processor  to perform any of the functions described herein. The medium may, for example, be optical disk, magnetic disk or flash memory, among others. In operation, the processor  or some other controller may cause data to be read from the nonvolatile recording medium into another memory, such as the memory , that allows for faster access to the information by the processor  than does the storage medium included in the storage system . The memory may be located in the storage system  or in the memory , however, the processor  may manipulate the data within the memory , and then copy the data to the medium associated with the storage system  after processing is completed. A variety of components may manage data movement between the medium and integrated circuit memory element and examples is not limited thereto. Further, examples are not limited to a particular memory system or storage system.","Although the computer system  is shown by way of example as one type of computer system upon which various aspects and functions may be practiced, aspects are not limited to being implemented on the computer system  as shown in . Various aspects and functions may be practiced on one or more computers having a different architectures or components than that shown in . For instance, the computer system  may include specially programmed, special-purpose hardware, such as for example, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) tailored to perform a particular operation disclosed herein. While another example may perform the same function using a grid of several general-purpose computing devices running MAC OS System X with Motorola PowerPC processors and several specialized computing devices running proprietary hardware and operating systems.","The computer system  may be a computer system including an operating system that manages at least a portion of the hardware elements included in the computer system . Usually, a processor or controller, such as the processor , executes an operating system which may be, for example, a Windows-based operating system, such as, Windows NT, Windows 2000 (Windows ME), Windows XP or Windows Vista operating systems, available from the Microsoft Corporation, a MAC OS System X operating system available from Apple Computer, one of many Linux-based operating system distributions, for example, the Enterprise Linux operating system available from Red Hat Inc., a Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems, or a UNIX operating systems available from various sources. Many other operating systems may be used, and examples are not limited to any particular implementation.","The processor  and operating system together define a computer platform for which application programs in high-level programming languages may be written. These component applications may be executable, intermediate, bytecode or interpreted code which communicates over a communication network, for example, the Internet, using a communication protocol, for example, TCP\/IP. Similarly, aspects may be implemented using an object-oriented programming language, such as .Net, SmallTalk, Java, C++, Ada, or C# (C-Sharp). Other object-oriented programming languages may also be used. Alternatively, functional, scripting, or logical programming languages may be used.","Additionally, various aspects and functions may be implemented in a non-programmed environment, for example, documents created in HTML, XML or other format that, when viewed in a window of a browser program, render aspects of a graphical-user interface or perform other functions. Further, various examples may be implemented as programmed or non-programmed elements, or any combination thereof. For example, a web page may be implemented using HTML while a data object called from within the web page may be written in C++. Thus, the examples are not limited to a specific programming language and any suitable programming language could be used.","The examples disclosed herein may perform a wide variety of functions and may be implemented using various tools. For instance, aspects of an exemplary system may be implemented using an existing commercial product, such as, for example, Database Management Systems such as SQL Server available from Microsoft of Seattle, Wash., Oracle Database from Oracle of Redwood Shores, Calif., and MySQL from Sun Microsystems of Santa Clara, Calif. or integration software such as Web Sphere middleware from IBM of Armonk, N.Y. A computer system running, for example, SQL Server may be able to support both aspects in accord with specific examples disclosed herein and databases for sundry other applications not discussed in the present disclosure. Thus, functional components disclosed herein may include a wide variety of elements, such as executable code, data structures or objects, configured to perform their described functions.","System Context Diagram",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["222","222"]},"Information may flow between the elements, components and subsystems described herein using any technique. Such techniques include, for example, passing the information over the network via TCP\/IP, passing the information between modules in memory and passing the information by writing to a file, database, or some other non-volatile storage device. In addition, pointers or other references to information may be transmitted and received in place of, or in addition to, copies of the information. Conversely, the information may be exchanged in place of, or in addition to, pointers or other references to the information. Other techniques and protocols for communicating information may be used without departing from the scope of the examples discussed herein.","Referring to , a system  includes a user , a nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  and a data center . The elements of the data center  include a set of data center resource providers and consumers. Examples of data center resource providers may include power generation and distribution equipment, cooling generation and distribution equipment, floor space, racks, logical network connectivity software, sensor equipment and data transmission equipment, physical network connectivity equipment, physical access control equipment, data storage equipment, distributed application services equipment, network time synchronization equipment and remote device control equipment.","A non-limiting list of various exemplary data center resource providers follows. Other examples may employ other data center resource providers. Exemplary power generation and distribution equipment may include transformers, automatic transfer switches (ATSs), uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), generators, single-phase and three-phase power distribution units (PDUs), rack mounted PDUs and individual outlets in PDUs. Examples of coolant generation and distribution providers may include computer room air handlers (CRAHs), computer room air conditioners (CRACs), fluid distribution systems, refrigerant distribution systems, rack-mounted air conditioners (RMACs), rack fans, raised floors, dropped ceilings, plenum, perforated tiles and non-perforated tiles. Exemplary logical network connectivity software and data transmission equipment may include Domain Name System servers, Microsoft Active Directory servers, Virtual Local Area Networks, Remote Authentication Dial In User Service servers, Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus servers, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol directories, Remote Authentication Dial In User Service servers, network access control systems, firewalls, Ethernet switches Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Services servers, File Transfer Protocol servers, Remote Direct Memory Access over Internet Protocol connections, load balancers and InfiniBand switches. Examples of physical network connectivity equipment may include network cabling, patch panels, and physical matrix switches. Exemplary physical space access control equipment may include security cameras, room door locks, rack door locks, door contact sensors, card readers and radio frequency identification readers. Examples of shared data storage equipment include Network File System servers, Network Attached Storage servers and storage area network servers. Exemplary distributed application services include Web Services servers. Exemplary network time synchronization equipment may include Network Time Protocol servers. Examples of remote equipment control equipment may include console port servers and Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) switches. Examples of sensor equipment may include environmental sensors, such as temperature, humidity and airflow sensors.","While many of these data center resource providers primarily provide a singular type of data center resource (for example, PDUs primarily provide power), any given data center resource provider is not limited to providing a single type of data center resource. For example, as discussed above, racks may provide several types of data center resources to data center equipment. More specifically, in many examples, racks provide cooling, power, physical space and weight support resources to data center equipment housed within the racks. In addition, data center resource providers may also be data center resource consumers. For example, PDUs provide power but consume floor space.","Some data center elements may include enough computing resources to control the operation of the data center resource element. These computing resources are typically limited and tailored to support the operation of the data center resource element. In at least one example, these limited computer resources may be disposed upon a Network Management Card (NMC) such as a UPS NMC available from APC by Schneider Electric.","The particular data center elements shown in  include a data center management appliance , a communications network , a PDU , a CRAH , a CRAC , a UPS  and a RMAC , and a sensor device . The network  may be, among other types of networks, a private network (such as a LAN, WAN, extranet or intranet) or may be a public network (such as the internet). In the example shown, the network  is a LAN. Each of the data center elements shown in  may transmit information via the network  to the data center management appliance . This information may include both direct and circumstantial evidence indicating an existing or imminent nonstandard operational state for a data center element, such as sluggish or inoperative data center resource provider behavior, nonstandard environmental conditions or other information showing the lack of normal provision or consumption of data center resources.","As shown in , the data center management appliance  is configured to provide the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  to an external entity, such as the user . A data center management appliance is an industrial computer system designed to be installed in, and to accommodate the rigors of, the data center environment. Data center management appliances are manufactured to perform a well-defined set of functions directed toward data center modeling, monitoring and control.","In another example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  is configured to accept an indication of one or more data center elements for nonstandard operation analysis and to present the results of the nonstandard operation analysis to the user . In at least one example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  is a browser-based user interface served and rendered by the data center management appliance . In another example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface is a system interface that receives and responds to calls made according to a predetermined interface protocol. In other examples, other suitable user and system interfacing technologies may be used. Thus, according to a variety of examples, the nonstandard operation impact analysis  may include a plurality of individual interfaces that provide for initiation of a nonstandard operation analysis and review of the results.","According to various examples, the data center management appliance  is configured to conduct an analysis of the nonstandard operation of one or more data center elements. In some examples, the analysis includes calculations that determine the impact of the nonstandard operation across multiple types of data center resources. In these examples, the analysis also considers both whether the data center element is a data center resource provider, consumer or both.","For instance, a user may wish to determine the affect of a CRAC operating in a nonstandard fashion under a particular data center configuration. Given this goal, the user can select the CRAC for analysis. When conducting the analysis, a data center management appliance may calculate the impact of the nonstandard operation of the CRAC on two types of data center resources, namely power and cooling. More specifically, these calculations may reflect the fact that the CRAC provides cooling and also consumes power. Thus examples provide for a rigorous, multidimensional analysis of the impact of data center element nonstandard operations.","Example System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"206"},"In the example shown in , the data center management appliance  includes a nonstandard operation impact analysis interface , a cooling simulator , a power simulator , a network connectivity simulator , weight support simulator  and a configuration management database . As shown, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  exchanges analysis information with external entities, such as the user , and the cooling simulator , the power simulator , the network connectivity simulator , the weight support simulator  and the configuration management database . This analysis information may include information related to analyzing the impact of nonstandard operations of one or more data center elements. Examples of analysis information include information indicating data center elements targeted for nonstandard operation impact analysis, qualitative and quantitative information describing the nonstandard operation, data center resources affected by the nonstandard operation and the like. Each of the simulators , ,  and  exchange analysis information with the nonstandard operation impact analysis  and data center configuration information with the configuration management database .","In the example depicted in , the configuration management database  includes elements configured to store and retrieve configuration management information. In general, this configuration management information may include any information that describes characteristics or elements of a data center. Thus, configuration management information may include the physical dimensions of the data center, the location and identity of data center equipment and of other data center elements, and data center resource capacity, redundancy and runtime requirements. Configuration management information may also include data center element characteristics such as data center resource consumption and production information. This consumption and production information may include historical, empirical measurements of the data center resources produced or consumed by data center elements. The consumption and production information may also include production and consumption rate values based on theoretically modeled values (e.g. nameplate values) or based on stored, empirical historical measurements.","In some examples, the data center management appliance  uses the historical measurements to maintain, within the configuration management database , a set of data center resource consumption and production benchmarks. In one example, these benchmarks, which are specific to the manufacturer and model of data center elements, are summaries that are based on actual, practical usage of the data center elements rather than theoretical values (e.g. nameplate values). In another example, the benchmarks are based on a combination of empirical and theoretical values i.e. measured and modeled data. Examples of summaries that may be used as a benchmarks include, among others, minimum, maximum and average data center resource consumption or production, data center resource consumption or production as a function of time, e.g. power or cooling consumption or production by day of week, week of year, etc., actual data center resource consumption or production when a change in either is requested, and data center resource consumption or production as a function of data center element utilization. The information used to calculate the summaries may be gathered from the initial design on the data center, including customer or system provider entered benchmarks, and ongoing parameter measurement. Utilizing actual, historical measurements may lead to more accurate summaries than the nameplate values and, in turn, may provide more accurate simulations.","The configuration management database  may take the form of any logical construction capable of storing information on a computer readable medium including flat files, indexed files, hierarchical databases, relational databases or object oriented databases. In addition, links, pointers, indicators and other references to data may be stored in place, of or in addition to, actual copies of the data. The data may be modeled using unique and foreign key relationships and indexes. The unique and foreign key relationships and indexes may be established between the various fields and tables to ensure both data integrity and data interchange performance.","Furthermore, the structure and content of each of these various fields and tables depends on the type of data stored therein. Thus, in at least one example, the data structures and objects within the configuration management database  are specially configured to store configuration management information. Consequently, in this example, any process that accesses this data must be specially configured to account for the type of data accessed.","In some examples in accord with , the simulators , ,  and  include elements configured to model the effect of nonstandard data center element operation on the availability of certain data center resources within the data center. Based on the resulting data center resource availability, the simulators , ,  and  determine how other data center elements will be affected by the nonstandard data center element operation. More particularly, in this example, each of the simulators , ,  and  includes elements configured to provide an interface through which the simulator can receive information regarding one or more data center elements targeted for nonstandard operation impact analysis. This information may include information indicating which data center elements are targeted for nonstandard operation impact analysis and may include information qualitatively and quantitatively defining the nonstandard operations exhibited by the targeted data center elements. In the example shown in , each of the simulators , ,  and  can receive this information from the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface .","In addition, in this example, each of the simulators , ,  and  includes elements configured to provide an interface through which the simulator can receive configuration management information from the configuration management database . This configuration management information may include data center resource production and consumption information, such as benchmark consumption and production rates, for various data center elements included within the modeled data center. According to this example, each of the simulators , ,  and  has elements configured to use information received from the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  and the configuration management database  to simulate the nonstandard operational state for the target data center element. These simulators also include elements configured to determine the availability of data center resources as influenced by the nonstandard data center element operation and produce and store a list of data center elements expected to be impacted by resulting data center resource availability. This list may include indications of data center elements expected to be affected by the nonstandard operations and data quantitatively and qualitatively defining the altered operations of the affected data center elements. Also, in this example, each of the simulators includes elements configured to provide the results of the analysis to the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface . The results provided by the simulators may include, for example, the list of impacted data center elements.","In the example shown, each of the simulators , ,  and  is focused on modeling the availability of a particular data center resource and how, in turn, the modeled availability of the data center resource impacts other elements of the data center. In particular, cooling simulator  is focused on analyzing cooling, power simulator  is focused on analyzing power, network connectivity simulator  is focused on analyzing network connectivity and weight support simulator  is focused on analyzing weight support. Each of these simulators may employ specialized modeling techniques to determine the impact of nonstandard data center element operation. For instance, in one example, the cooling simulator  employs the modeling techniques discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,596,476 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/342,300, both entitled \u201cMETHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MANAGING FACILITY POWER AND COOLING,\u201d each of which is hereby incorporate by reference in its entirety. While the example shown in  illustrates  simulators, other simulators may be used and examples are not limited to any particular set of simulators. Moreover, in some examples, hybrid simulators that focus on a plurality of data center resources may be employed.","As depicted in , the data center management appliance  exposes the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  to exchange nonstandard operation analysis data with external entities, such as the user . This nonstandard operation analysis data may include, among other information, information associated with particular data center elements selected by an external entity for nonstandard operation analysis and information associated with the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis. In one example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  includes elements configured to receive configuration management information regarding data center elements, such as routers, CRACs and UPSs, from the configuration management database . According to this example, the elements of the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  are also configured to use the configuration management information to present indications of the data center elements to an external entity. In addition, according to this example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  has elements configured to receive indications of which data center elements have been selected for nonstandard operation analysis by the external entity.","In some examples in accord with , the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  includes elements configured to determine the data center resources that would be affected by a nonstandard operation of the selected data center elements. For instance, according to this example, if the user  requests a nonstandard operation impact analysis for a CRAC unit, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  would determine, with reference to configuration management information stored in the configuration management database , that both cooling and power would be affected. Further, as shown in , elements included in the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  are configured to initiate one or more simulators that correspond to the data center resources that would be affected by the nonstandard operation. In the example of , simulators , ,  and  are available to model the impact of nonstandard operations that affect consumption or production of cooling, power, network connectivity and weight support, respectively. Other examples may employ additional simulators. Also, in this example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  includes elements configured to receive analysis results from the simulators , ,  and  and return the results to the external entity that requested the nonstandard operation impact analysis, i.e. in this example user . In other examples, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  stores the results within a database which may be used to perform further analysis and thereby gain an increased understanding of the performance characteristics of particular data center configurations.","Table 1 illustrates one example of the information that may result from a nonstandard operation impact analysis of a data center that includes Rack 1, Rack 2, Rack 3, RMAC 1, RMAC 2 and PDU1. Examples may include other types of result information and examples are not limited to a particular set of result information or particular relationships within the result information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Rack 1","Rack 2","Rack 3"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"RMAC 1","Fail","Fail","No impact"]},{"entry":[{},"RMAC 2","No impact","Fail","Fail"]},{"entry":[{},"PDU 1","Fail","No impact","No impact"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As illustrated in Table , if RMAC 1 fails, Rack 1 and Rack 2 fail and Rack 3 sustains no impact. If RMAC 2 fails, Rack 1 sustains no impact and Rack 2 and Rack 3 fail. Finally if PDU 1 fails Rack 1 fails and Rack 2 and Rack 3 encounter no impact. This information shows that Rack 1 is impacted by RMAC 1 and PDU1, Rack 2 is impacted by RMAC 1 and RMAC 2, and Rack 3 is only impacted by RMAC 2. Data center personnel may use this information to design data center configurations that minimize the likelihood of failure in certain important racks. With regard to pre-existing data centers, data center personnel may use this information to determine dependencies between data center elements and give priority maintenance to data center elements that supply resources to important racks. Thus, examples provide for a comprehensive analysis of the nonstandard operation of data center elements by calculating the impact of the nonstandard operation across all affected data center resources.","In at least one example in accord with , the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  also includes elements configured to initiate additional, cascading nonstandard operation simulations when the results of a previous nonstandard operation simulation indicate that the operation of additional data center elements will be affected. For instance, the results of a simulated nonstandard operation of a perforated raised floor tile may indicate that a UPS will also fail. The nonstandard operation of the raised floor tile may be reduced air flow through the tile caused by one of a number of conditions. When encountering this circumstance, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  will initiate an addition simulation to analyze the impact of a nonstandard operation of the UPS. Analysis of the results of the simulated UPS nonstandard operation may, in turn, lead to additional nonstandard operation simulations. In this way, examples accurately model any downstream or upstream effects of data center element nonstandard operations.","According to various examples, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  has elements configured to take corrective action in response to the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis. In some examples, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  is configured to take this corrective action by altering the operation of data center elements to compensate for the effects of the nonstandard operation. In one example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  can shift the load on data center elements experiencing nonstandard operations to other data center elements with sufficient capacity to supplement at least a portion of the load. For instance, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  can respond to a failed PDU by instructing two other PDUs to supply power to the load of the failed PDU. In another instance, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  can respond to a failure of a server that is a part of a particular virtual machine by initiating the addition of another server to the virtual machine or by moving the virtual machine to an entirely new set of servers.","In another example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  can change the demand for affected data center resources by initiating a shutting down of a subset of data center elements. In this example, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  is configured to determine which subset of data center elements to shutdown based on the potential benefits of shutting down the subset with respect to the availability of the affected data center resources and based on the importance of the processes supported by the subset compared to the importance of the processes supported by the data center elements operating in a nonstandard fashion and the affected data center elements. The importance of the processes may be determined, for example, with reference to the importance of the business operations supported by the process. In some instances, the subset shutdown may include all or portion of the affected data center elements. Thus some examples provide for rapid and intelligent response to the potential impact of nonstandard operational behavior of data center elements.","In various examples, the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  employs a wide variety of technologies, user interface elements and interface metaphors to exchange information with external entities.  illustrate two screens  and  that are included within an example nonstandard operation impact analysis interface, such as the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface . As shown, the screen  includes a data center drill down menu , a floor editor , an active alarm section  and view impact button . The drill down menu  includes elements configured to present a logical representation of a hierarchy of data center elements. According to various examples, the levels presented within the hierarchy are configurable. In the example shown, the levels of the hierarchy include a base level, termed \u201cworld\u201d and progress through levels that specify the location of data center elements with greater precision. As shown, these levels include a data center level, a room level, a row level and a rack level. When a particular level is actuated, the drill down menu  reveals data center elements that fall beneath the actuated level.","In addition, in the example illustrated in , the drill down menu  includes elements configured to indicate data center elements that are operating in a nonstandard way. These indications may take various forms including, but not limited to, highlighting, coloring, shade, bold font and the like. In the example shown, the drill down menu shows that RM PDU1 has stopped communicating with the data center management appliance presenting the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface .","As depicted, the floor editor  presents a visual representation of the physical layout of the data center. In this example, the floor editor also presents an indicator  that indicates RM PDU1 has stopped communications. Also as illustrated, the active alarm section  provides additional information regarding data center elements that are operating in nonstandard fashion. In this instance, as shown the active alarm section  provides additional information regarding RM PDU1. Also as shown, the view impact button , when actuated, will cause the nonstandard operation impact analysis interface  to initiate a nonstandard operation impact analysis of the selected data center element and provide the results of the analysis using the screen  shown in . In the instance shown, the data center element selected for nonstandard operation impact analysis is RM PDU1.","As discussed above,  illustrates the screen  for presenting the results of a nonstandard operation impact analysis. In the example shown, the screen  includes a data center drill down menu , an IT impact section , a power impact section , a cooling impact section , a group\/tag impact section . As shown, the drill down menu  includes elements configured to indicate data center elements that will be affected according to the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis. In the example shown, the affected data center elements are Server 103984, Web server 1, Batman and Internet in a box.","The other sections of the screen  provide greater detail regarding the results of the nonstandard operation analysis. For example, the power impact section  includes elements configured to present indications of data center elements whose power will be affected according to the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis. In the instance shown, the power impact section  indicates that all data center elements that consume power distributed via RM PDU1 are expected to be influenced by the nonstandard operation of RM PDU1. Also as depicted, the cooling impact section  section include elements configured to present indications of data center elements whose cooling will be affected according to the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis. In the instance shown, no data center elements that consume or produce cooling are expected to be affected by the nonstandard operation of RM PDU1.","In the example shown, the group\/tag impact section  includes elements configured to present an indication of which logical groups defined within the configuration management database  will be impacted according to the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis. In the instance shown, data center elements that are members of the following groups will be affected according to the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis: Web Development, Hennik Leeberg, CAT5e and CAT6. Also as shown, the IT impact analysis section  has elements configured to present an indication of data center elements whose network connectivity will be affected according to the results of the nonstandard operation impact analysis. In addition, the IT impact section  has elements configured to provide additional information regarding the affected data center elements and how the operations of the affected data center elements will be altered. In the instance shown, both Server 103984 and Web server 1 are expected to no longer be connected to the network. Batman and Internet in a box are expected to simply experience a loss of redundancy, but remain active on the network. Thus, examples provide for nonstandard operation impact analysis interfaces that provide nonstandard operation analysis information which incorporates actual nonstandard operation information, such as the illustrated nonstandard operation of RM PDU1, and modeled nonstandard operation information that spans data center resources and the data center elements that consume and produce these data center resources.","Each of the interfaces disclosed herein exchange information with various providers and consumers.

Nonstandard operation impact analysis processes in accord with process  allow data center operational personnel to identify potential weaknesses in particular data center configurations and to prioritize action responsive to nonstandard data center element behavior in a manner appropriate to the severity of the impact. Processes such as process  may be initiated for a variety of reasons. In one example, process  is initiated upon detection, by a management system, of one or more data center elements operating in a nonstandard fashion. In another example, process  is executed at the request of an external entity to determine the effect of a hypothetical nonstandard operation.","As discussed above with regard to act  shown in , various examples provide processes for determining data center resources affected by nonstandard operation of data center elements.  illustrates one such process  that includes acts of receiving data center elements targeted for nonstandard operation impact analysis, reading configuration management information and storing the data center resources that will be affected by the nonstandard operation.
