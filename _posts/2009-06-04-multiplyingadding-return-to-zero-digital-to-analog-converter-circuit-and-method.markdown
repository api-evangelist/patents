title: Multiplying-adding return to zero digital to analog converter circuit and method
abstract: A digital to analog converter (DAC) method and apparatus employs a multiplying-adding DAC, eliminating digital adder circuitry. Examples are given for multiplying a 3-bit binary number by a 2-bit binary number; however, there are no limitations to the bit-widths of the numbers to be multiplied. The multiplying-adding DAC method can be scaled up or down in bit-width by feeding the DAC with partial sums and adjusting the DAC weights accordingly. An analog to digital converter (ADC) can be placed after the DAC to generate a digital output. By multiplexing preset digital data into the DAC core for return to zero (RTZ), a true zero that is the midpoint of the DAC output range is achieved. It does not return to a rail for single-ended outputs. RTZ in DAC circuits doubles the null frequency of sin(x)/x roll-off inherent in DACs and also helps reduce switching glitches in the DAC output.

The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to digital to analog converters (DACs), and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for enhanced performance through improved spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and accurate return to zero (RTZ) performance.","DACs are used in an increasing number of applications, many requiring lower power consumption and higher operating frequencies. Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) is one of these applications. Basic DDS circuits include an electronic controller, random access memory, a frequency reference, a counter, and a DAC. Some versions of DDS circuits include random access memory (RAM).","Multiplying-Adding","Within direct digital synthesizer circuits, improved spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) is desired. One method to achieve improved SFDR is by adding interpolation to the output of the DDS. To determine the interpolation, an approximation of X sin(theta)+Y cos(theta) can be used. This approximation necessitates the need for an efficient method of multiplication in order to preserve high speed operation of the DDS and minimize power consumption. The traditional method of multiplying two binary numbers involves the use of digital adder circuitry. Digital adder circuitry increases the power consumption of the circuit and reduces operating speed.","The following explanatory discussion involves quotients A and B. A is a 3-bit binary number and B is a 2-bit binary number. The notation for the expanded version of A is A2 A1 A0 and the notation for the expanded version of B is B1 B0. The use of the specific bit-widths is convenient for illustration and implementation, but any bit-widths could be used.","In a traditional binary multiplier approach, each bit of the multiplier is multiplied against the multiplicand and positioned according to the position of the bit within the multiplier, and the resulting products are then summed to form the final result.","Using A and B, this would

It can be used as-is in more general circuits where an analog output is desired, and it could be followed by an analog to digital converter (ADC) in circuits where a digital output is desired.","RTZ","A circuit and method of implementing a high-speed RTZ DAC using NPN transistors, including SiGe technology, is disclosed. By multiplexing preset digital data into the DAC core, a true zero that is the midpoint of the DAC output range can be achieved instead of a zero that is a rail as in prior art.","Embodiments provide true RTZ (midpoint of DAC output range) for both differential and single-ended outputs. They can support arbitrary return location for single-ended outputs. They also provide improved slew rate, since the return is to the midpoint of the DAC output range instead of a rail.","Embodiments provide: use as a return to an arbitrary level for single ended outputs; DAC switches require one less level of input, so lower supply voltage\/power is required; RTZ compensation switch steers \u00bd*I through both legs, or 1*I through a single leg. The technique is transferable to other types of devices\/technologies in addition to NPN transistors and SiGe. RTZ also helps to reduce switching glitches in the DAC output.","Embodiments include a digital to analog converter (DAC) device comprising analog domain computation of summing of multiplication operation, wherein digital adder circuitry is excluded, and whereby spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) is improved and power consumption is reduced. Other embodiments comprise a multiplying-adding DAC (MAcDAC). In further embodiments the DAC operates in a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) circuit and the MAcDAC is scaled by providing partial sums. For some embodiments, the MAcDAC is scaled by adjusting DAC weights. Other embodiments comprise weights of 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, and 8. Yet other embodiments comprise a 30 GHz clock in, and in others, operation of the MAcDAC comprises multiplying a 3-bit binary number by a 2-bit binary number. Additional embodiments comprise a separate clock input.","Embodiments provide a digital to analog converter (DAC) method comprising a return to zero (RTZ) method comprising multiplexing preset digital data into a DAC core whereby a true zero midpoint is achieved for output range of the DAC and wherein switching glitches are reduced. Other embodiments comprise selecting steering one-half of a current through both legs of a circuit or a full current through a single leg of a circuit. In still other embodiments, the preset data is sent to RTZ at midpoint of DAC output range whereby slew rate is improved. In some embodiments output is single-ended, and in some output is differential. For other embodiments, the method comprises arbitrary return location for single-ended outputs and in some, preset data compensates for a difference between a 2weight of DAC most significant bit (MSB) and a 2\u22121 weight of DAC least significant bits (LSBs) by acting as a weight of 0 in normal operation and a weight of 1 in RTZ operation. In yet further embodiments, the method comprises eleven data bits and two RTZ compensation bits. Additional embodiments comprise true RTZ weights of 4-16*I thermocoded weights for high; 3-16*I thermocoded weights for low; 8*I, 4*I, 2*I, 1*I binary weights for low; and 2\u00bd*I RTZ compensation weights for both low, wherein output level is 64*I.","Yet another embodiment is a digital to analog converter (DAC) comprising analog domain computation of summing of multiplication operation, wherein digital adder circuitry is excluded, and whereby spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) is improved and power consumption is reduced; and return to zero (RTZ) circuits whereby multiplexed preset digital data achieves a true zero midpoint for output range of the DAC, and wherein the RTZ comprises NPN transistors in SiGe technology.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","Multiplying-Adding DAC","The multiplying-adding DAC eliminates digital adder circuitry. Less complex logic is used, circuitry is faster and power consumption is lower from reduced gate count. The non-binary DAC reduces skew by eliminating the weight of 16. Overall current is reduced by 10 weights, since the 16 weight is removed and extra 2 and 4 weights are added. Examples are given for multiplying a 3-bit binary number by a 2-bit binary number; however, there are no limitations to the bit-widths of the numbers to be multiplied. The multiplying-adding DAC method can be scaled up or down in bit-width by feeding the DAC with partial sums and adjusting the DAC weights accordingly. An analog to digital converter (ADC) can be placed after the DAC to generate a digital output.
