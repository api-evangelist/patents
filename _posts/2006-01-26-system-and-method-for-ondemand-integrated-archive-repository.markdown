title: System and method for on-demand integrated archive repository
abstract: System, method and computer program product for creating, managing, and accessing an information repository including a source database and an archive database. A source database and the archive database are defined to a same schema. A user terminal presents a common user interface for accessing the source database and the archive database. A timed archive agent, an end user archive agent, and a criteria based archive agent archive source data from the source database as archive data to the archive database. A criteria based restore agent and an end user restore agent are provided to restore archive data from the archive database as source data to the source database. An integrated functions agent assembles compiled data from source data and archive data and present the compiled data to the user interface.

No. 11\/122,584, filed 5 May 2005, entitled \u201cMETHOD, SYSTEM, AND PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR USING ANALYSIS VIEWS TO IDENTIFY DATA SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEMS BETWEEN DATABASES\u201d, and Ser. No. 10\/040,844, filed 7 Jan. 2002, for a workstation management tool, are assigned to the same assignee hereof and contain subject matter related, in certain respects, to the subject matter of the present application. The above-identified patent applications are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates to computer databases. More particularly, it relates to a system and method for creating, managing, and accessing an archive database (information repository).","2. Background Art","Very often a database will grow too large or may contain sensitive information that needs to be isolated from general use. Such information is generally considered \u201cold data\u201d, and is moved to an archive, generally for the purpose of maintaining an audit trail.","There is a need in the art, however, for not discarding or simply archiving excess information, but rather for maintaining such information out of the way of end-users and yet kept within a production setting where it can be queried in live time along with the production data.","System, method and computer program product for creating, managing, and accessing an information repository including a source database and an archive database, by defining the source database and the archive database to a same schema; providing to a user terminal a common user interface for accessing the source database and the archive database; selectively executing a timed archive agent, an end user archive agent, and a criteria based archive agent for archiving source data from the source database as archive data to the archive database; selectively executing a criteria based restore agent and an end user restore agent to restore archive data from the archive database as source data to the source database; and executing an integrated functions agent to assemble compiled data from source data and archive data and present the compiled data to the user interface.","Other features and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a system and method is provided for creating, maintaining, and using an integrated archive repository, or mirror database application, having a schema identical in all relevant respects to that of an original database source application, or production repository or database.","In accordance with some criteria, such as a straight scheduled archive, archive on demand, information becoming sensitive, soft document deletion, and so forth, information is moved from the source application to a mirror archive where the information is available for secure direct access by qualified personnel and also for restoration on demand to the source application and for integration with the source information to support reports, measurements, audits, and so forth.","Thus, information is not merely archived, but placed in an alternative repository where it remains integrated with the original repository, thus keeping the information in a production setting. That alternative repository is a database which sits outside of the production application and to which information is removed when no longer used by the application. This can be queried in live time along with the production data, but it is still out of the end-user's way.","Referring to , source database  information is directed to and received from archive database  by way of several agents, including timed archive , end user archive , criteria based archive , criteria based restore , and end user restore . Measurements, reporting, audits and integrated functions  receives data from both archive database  and source database . End user terminal  accesses source database  and archive database .","Referring to , in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a work station life cycle management system  includes a set of applications, including a client information manager  and database , a workstation planning and deployment manager  and database , and an archive client manager  and database . The client information manager (CIM), or source program for archived data, may be, for example, a database and an access program.","The client information manager (CIM)  includes a database  with information about people in an organization (such as a division of a corporation) and the type of computing equipment they have at their workstation or otherwise in their respective offices or otherwise allocated for a person's use.","The workstation planning and deployment manager  includes a deployment database  showing for each such division the personal workstation computing budget to which the division is entitled, and provides for the scheduling and deployment of equipment, and related reporting, according to that budget.","The archive client manager  and database  provides for storage of information which must be isolated for security reasons. This is a criteria based archived database of persons who had a machine deployed, including transitioned employees, and includes the same information in the same format as for the client information manager .","Another example of information stored to archive database , and of uses of such information, include new hires and transfers between divisions who need to be moved into CIM database  and deployed equipment upon arrival on the job. An asset manager may enter such information to archive database  and move it into CIM database  at his discretion.","A timed archive of information from CIM database  to archive database  may be a complete or partial archive of database , which enables CIM database to be purged of selected records to manage the size of that database .","In order to provide certain reporting features, including measurements and auditing, all databases , , and  are connected through a refresh plan reports function, or agent, . For example, such reports may provide for each information technology (IT) representative for each division a report of business areas supported and the deployment of equipment against a deployment budget. Agent , in this example, in order to show how many individuals have received laptops will need to access both CIM database  and archive database .","A specific example of how this reporting function may work: suppose an employee, who was scheduled for a desk top in the first quarter, experiences a job change that requires that he be deployed a lap top immediately. Deployment and reporting agent  is operated by asset manager  to show from CIM database  allocation of the latest equipment deployed to this employee and to show from archive database  previous deployments to this employee during the planning period.","The design of each database , ,  is common so that agent  can generate reports accessing them all. Each database is provided lookup views at a user interface (UI) which is the same. This is so that the user can get the same data from each of the databases listed and do comparisons and compilations upon the data contained in each, including the archive repository.","Referring to , , , , , , and , several exemplary user interfaces (UIs) illustrate user access to databases , , and  for entering and extracting information and facilities for defining, maintaining and selecting execution agents , , and .","Referring to , a typical user interface  includes a title bar , and plurality  of action selection tabs, a tool bar , a navigation bar , application tabs , and an application window , in this embodiment showing tabs ,  for selecting client information manager  and CIM archive manager , respectively.","Referring to , illustrates a UI  for looking at employees, or clients. Selection of button  brings up a view for accessing client information manager  under tab . Selection of tab  displays table of contents (TOC) , a portion of which is shown (a scroll bar for positioning the TOC to the illustrated portion is not shown). Selection of item  in TOC  brings up in panel  a list of clients from CIM source database , with each row including fields  for PLAN, QUARTER, TYPE, IT REP (information technology representative), BA (business area), and STATUS.
