No. 61\/064,784, filed on 26 Mar. 2008 which is incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.","This invention was made in whole or in part with government support under EB005743 awarded by the National Institutes of Health and under CA119402 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention provides devices and methods of use thereof in concentrating a charged species of interest in solution. This invention provides a concentration device, which is based on electrokinetic trapping of a charged species of interest, which can be further isolated and analyzed.","One of the major challenges of proteomics is the sheer complexity of biomolecule samples, such as blood serum or cell extract. Typical blood samples could contain more than 10,000 different protein species, with concentrations varying over 9 orders of magnitude. Such diversity of proteins, as well as their huge concentration ranges, poses a formidable challenge for sample preparation in proteomics.","Conventional protein analysis techniques, based on multidimensional separation steps and mass spectrometry (MS), fall short because of the limited separation peak capacity (up to \u02dc3000) and dynamic range of detection (\u02dc10). Microfluidic biomolecule analysis systems (so-called \u03bcTAS) hold promise for automated biomolecule processing. Various biomolecule separation and purification steps, as well as chemical reaction and amplification have been miniaturized on a microchip, demonstrating orders of magnitude faster sample separation and processing. In addition, microfluidic integration of two different separation steps into a multidimensional separation device has been demonstrated. However, most microfluidic separation and sample processing devices suffers from the critical issue of sample volume mismatch. Microfluidic devices are very efficient in handling and processing 1 pL\u02dc1 nL of sample fluids, but most biomolecule samples are available or handled in a liquid volume larger than 1 \u03bcL. Therefore, microchip-based separation techniques often analyze only a small fraction of available samples, which significantly limits the overall detection sensitivity. In proteomics, this problem is exacerbated by the fact that information-rich signaling molecules (cytokines and biomarkers, e.g.) are present only in trace concentrations (nM\u02dcpM range), and there is no signal amplification technique such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for proteins and peptides.","What is needed is an efficient sample concentrator, which can take typical sample volume of microliters or more and concentrate molecules into a smaller volume so that it can be separated and detected much more sensitively. Several strategies are currently available to provide sample preconcentration in liquid, including field-amplified sample stacking (FAS), isotachophoresis(ITP), electrokinetic trapping, micellar electrokinetic sweeping, chromatographic preconcentration, and membrane preconcentration. Many of these techniques are originally developed for capillary electrophoresis, and require special buffer arrangements and\/or reagents. Efficiency of chromatographic and filtration-based preconcentration techniques depends on the hydrophobicity and the size of the target molecules.","Electrokinetic trapping is another means for such charged biomolecule concentration. When applying an electric field across an ion-selective membrane, a charge-depletion region is developed, which in combination with tangential flow (either pressure-driven or electroosmosis-driven), can concentrate the charged analytes inside a channel. Currently, however, the fabrication of such devices is cumbersome and complex, since the integration of sufficiently thin (\u02dc5 um) ion-selective membranes into the device has been challenging. Thin Nafion membranes are easily breakable and handling requires extreme care since the membrane can be easily wrapped around itself, confounding planar device fabrication methods.","Another attempt at planar devices sandwiched a thin ion-selective membrane between two planar microchips, each chip containing a microchannel, however this led to imperfect sealing of the device, resulting in gap formation around the membrane and thereby current leakage.","The invention provides, in one embodiment, a concentrating device comprising:\n\n","In one embodiment, the means for inducing an electric field in the channel is a voltage supply, which in one embodiment is supplied at between 50 mV and 1500 V.

Such methods are described herein, and exemplified in example 1 herein below.","In some embodiments, the patterning methods of this invention, and devices made thereby comprise, inter alia, flowing a resin through a micro- or nano-channel in a device under negative pressure, flushing the resin, and curing the adhered thin layer which in turn forms a membrane structure.

Ion selectivity may then be imparted to the supporting matrix by infiltrating the membrane with a resin, which imparts such properties, for example, infiltrating the membrane with Nafion resin. According to this aspect of the invention and in one embodiment, due to the capillary force of the membrane, the pores of the polyelectrolyte membrane fill with the Nafion resin imparting to the membrane ion selectivity. In some embodiments, removing excess Nafion resin residue from the channel is accomplished by flushing the channel with deionized water.","It is to be understood that any liquid resin, or liquid polymer or a solution of monomers capable of polymerizing which when patterned and cured according to the methods as described herein, produces an ion-selective membrane is to be considered as part of this invention, and the invention is not to be limited to the examples of constituents of such resins as herein described.","In some embodiments, such membranes can be constructed so as to comprise a perfluorosulfonated membrane comprised of a polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE)-crosslinked hydrophobic backbone impregnated with hydrophilic sulfonic acid sites.

In some embodiments, films constructed from LPEI and PAA exhibit an ionic conductivity as high as 10S\/cmat 100% relative humidity and room temperature, and thus are useful in the devices of this invention.","In some embodiments, a membrane of PEO and PAA can be constructed via hydrogen-bonding interactions, films with conductivities from 10to as high as 10S\/cmat ambient conditions may be obtained. In some embodiments, the method comprising flowing a resin through a micro- or nano-channel in a device under negative pressure, flushing the resin, and curing the adhered thin layer is useful for producing the desired ion-selective membrane in the devices of this invention, using polyelectrolyte multilayers as described hereinabove.","In some embodiments, unique to the methods and devices of this invention is the absence of a requirement for the physical manipulation of fragile membranes in order to integrate such membranes into the devices of this invention. In some embodiments, the invention comprises processes for patterning\/depositing a resin into a trench in the fluidic chip followed by curing of the resin to form a membrane, which in turn is readily integrated in the device without further physical manipulation of the formed membrane. In some embodiments, the devices of this invention and processes for preparing the same comprise curing a resin to form the membrane, as part of the construction of the device, and makes use of materials which are disposable, thus providing a simply manufactured device, which can readily be mass produced, to form arrays of parallel concentrators on a medium that can be disposable.","In some embodiments, the methods for producing micro- or nano-fluidic devices with ion-selective membranes of this invention, may comprise, the preparation of a high-aspect-ratio ion selective membrane, as exemplified in some embodiments herein. In some embodiments, such method may comprise building a high-aspect ratio membrane with a microbead-based approach, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.

Microfabrication technology allows one, in one embodiment, to precisely design features (e.g., wells, channels) with dimensions in the range of <1 mm to several centimeters on chips made, in other embodiments, of silicon, glass, or plastics. Such technology may be used to construct the microchannels of the concentrator, in one embodiment.","In another embodiment, construction of the microchannels of the concentrator may be accomplished according to, or based upon any method known in the art, for example, as described in Z. N. Yu, P. Deshpande, W. Wu, J. Wang and S. Y. Chou, Appl. Phys. Lett. 77 (7), 927 (2000); S. Y. Chou, P. R. Krauss, and P. J. Renstrom, Appl. Phys. Lett. 67 (21), 3114 (1995); Stephen Y. Chou, Peter R. Krauss and Preston J. Renstrom, Science 272, 85 (1996) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,905 hereby incorporated herein, in their entirety, by reference. In one embodiment, the microchannels can be formed by imprint lithography, interference lithography, self-assembled copolymer pattern transfer, spin coating, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam milling, photolithography, reactive ion-etching, wet-etching, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, electron beam evaporation, sputter deposition, stamping, molding scanning probe techniques and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the methods for preparation of the devices of this invention may comprise or be modifications of Astorga-Wells J. et al, Analytical Chemistry 75: 5207-5212 (2003); or Joensson, M. et al, Proceedings of the MicroTAS 2006 Symposium, Tokyo Japan, Vol. 1, pp. 606-608. Alternatively, other conventional methods can be used to form the microchannels.","In one embodiment, the microchannels are formed as described in J. Han, H. G. Craighead, J. Vac. Sci. Technol., A 17, 2142-2147 (1999) and J. Han, H. G. Craighead, Science 288, 1026-1029 (2000), hereby incorporated fully herein by reference.","In one embodiment, a series of reactive ion etchings are conducted, after which nano- or micro-channels are patterned with standard lithography tools. In one embodiment, the etchings are conducted with a particular geometry, which, in another embodiment, determines the interface between the microchannels, and\/or nanochannels. In one embodiment, etchings, which create the microchannels, are performed parallel to the plane in which etchings for the nanochannels are created. In another embodiment, additional etching, such as, for example, and in one embodiment, KOH etching is used, to produce additional structures in the concentrator, such as, for example, for creating loading holes.","In another embodiment, electrical insulation of the concentrator is accomplished. In one embodiment, such insulation is accomplished via nitride stripping and thermal oxidation of the concentrator. In another embodiment, a surface of the concentrator, which in another embodiment is the bottom surface, may be affixed to a substrate, such as, for example, and in one embodiment, a Pyrex wafer. In one embodiment, the wafer may be affixed using anodic bonding techniques.","In one embodiment, construction of the fluidic chip comprising a planar array of channels may be accomplished by methods known to one skilled in the art, or adaptation of such methods, such as, for example those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,753,200, fully incorporated herein by reference.","In one embodiment, the fabrication may use a shaped sacrificial layer, which is sandwiched between permanent floor and ceiling layers, with the shape of the sacrificial layer defining a working gap. When the sacrificial layer is removed, the working gap becomes a fluid channel having the desired configuration. This approach, in one embodiment, allows a precise definition of the height, width and shape of interior working spaces, or fluid channels, in the structure of a fluidic device.","The sacrificial layer is formed on a substrate, is shaped by a suitable lithographic process, for example, and is covered by a ceiling layer. Thereafter, the sacrificial layer may be removed with a wet chemical etch, leaving behind empty spaces between the floor and ceiling layers which form working gaps which may be used as flow channels and chambers for the concentrator. In such a device, the vertical dimension, or height, of a working gap is determined by the thickness of the sacrificial layer film, which is made with precise chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, and accordingly, this dimension can be very small.","In order to provide access to the sacrificial layer contained in the structure for the etching solution, which is used to remove the sacrificial layer, one or more access holes may be cut through the ceiling layer, with the wet etch removing the sacrificial layer through these holes. An extremely high etch selectivity may be required between the sacrificial layer and the dielectric layers in order to allow the etch to proceed in the sacrificial layer a significant distance laterally from the access holes without consuming the floor and ceiling layers which compose the finished device. One combination of materials, which may be used for such a process is polysilicon and silicon nitride, for the sacrificial layer and for the floor and ceiling layers, respectively. Extremely high etch selectivities can be obtained with basic solutions such as, in some embodiments, potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), or in another embodiment, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH).","In some embodiments, the ceiling layer is the rigid substrate with which the ion-selective membrane is associated.","The access holes cut in the top layer may be covered, in another embodiment. For this purpose, a sealing layer of silicon dioxide may be deposited on top of the ceiling lay to fill in the access holes, and this additional thin film layer provides a good seal against leakage or evaporation of fluids in the working gap. SiOCVD techniques, represent other embodiments, which yield a low degree of film conformality, such as very low temperature oxide (VLTO) deposition, form a reliable seal without excessive loss of device area due to clogging near the access holes. If desired, the access holes may be drilled through the bottom layer, instead of or in addition to the holes in the ceiling layer, and later resealed by depositing a layer of silicon dioxide.","For example, in some embodiments, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) may be used to deposit the device materials, including permanent wall materials, which are usually a dielectric material such as silicon nitride or silicon dioxide, and nonpermanent sacrificial layer materials, such as amorphous silicon or polysilicon.","In some embodiments, micro-channels and\/or nano-channels are oriented in parallel on the chip, forming an array of channels, wherein each channel may represent a concentrator, such that multiple parallel concentrations may be accomplished on a single chip. In some embodiments, the channels intersect, such that material concentrated in a channel can, under appropriate conditions be conveyed to another concentrator on the chip, for example, post assay or exposure to a particular reagent. According to this aspect, and in some embodiments, the array or channels, which intersect, allow for multi-step concentration, for example following manipulation or exposure to a dilute environment, and repeat concentration is desirable.","In some embodiments, the microchannels are positioned in any desired orientation, for example as befitting to suit a particular purpose or collection scheme, etc. axis of another.","In one embodiment, an interface region is constructed which connects the channels on the chip, for example two microchannels of the concentrator of this invention. In one embodiment, diffraction gradient lithography (DGL) is used to form a gradient interface between the channels of this invention, where desired. In one embodiment, the gradient interface region may regulate flow through the concentrator, or in another embodiment, regulate the space charge layer formed in the microchannel, which, in another embodiment, may be reflected in the strength of electric field, or in another embodiment, the voltage needed to generate the space charge layer in the microchannel. In some embodiments, the ion-selective membrane is positioned at such an interface.","In one embodiment, the gradient interface area is formed of lateral spatial gradient structures for narrowing the cross section of a value on a desired scale, for example, from the micron to the nanometer length scale. In another embodiment, the gradient interface area is formed of a vertical sloped gradient structure. In another embodiment, the gradient structure can provide both a lateral and vertical gradient.","In one embodiment, the concentrating device may be fabricated by diffraction gradient lithography, by forming a microchannel or microchannels on a substrate and forming a gradient interface area between the desired channels. The gradient interface area can be formed, in one embodiment, by using a blocking mask positioned above a photo mask and\/or photoresist during photolithography. The edge of the blocking mask provides diffraction to cast a gradient light intensity on the photoresist.","In one embodiment, a concentrator may comprise a plurality of channels, including a plurality of microchannels, and\/or a plurality of nanochannels, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the phrase \u201ca plurality of channels refers to more than two channels, or, in another embodiment, more than 5, or, in other embodiments, more than 10, 96, 100, 384, 1,000, 1,536, 10,000, 100,000 or 1,000,000 channels, or in any number desired to suit a particular purpose. Similarly, arrangement of the channels on the chip may be so designed as to suit a particular application.","In one embodiment, a device may contain a plurality of high aspect ratio, ion selective membranes. In one embodiment a plurality of high-aspect ratio ion selective membranes can be fabricated on a chip. In one embodiment fabrication of a plurality of high-aspect ratio ion selective membranes may be done using multi-blade fabrication. In one embodiment multi-blade fabrication can be used for commercialization of a device containing a self-sealed membrane. In one embodiment a self-sealed membrane refers to the high aspect ratio ion selective membrane. In one embodiment \u201cself-sealed\u201d means that after infiltration, or passage or filling of the trench or the gap, or the scratch made by the blade with a liquid polymer solution, unbending the chip and solidifying the polymer causes a self-sealing process of the scratch or the gap or the trench by the polymer.","In one embodiment, multi-blade fabrication can be used for massive parallelization of the membrane or the device fabrication process. In one embodiment, multi-blade fabrication can be used to make a plurality of membranes in parallel. In one embodiment, multi-blade fabrication renders the fabrication process fast. In one embodiment, multi-blade fabrication renders the device a low-cost device. In one embodiment multi-blade fabrication is combined with multi-syringe or multi dispenser system that enables parallel injection of liquid polymer to all trenches or cuts made by the multiple blades. In one embodiment the multi-blade fabrication technique is part of an automated fabrication technique, in which all steps of forming the high aspect ratio ion selective membranes are automated, and all steps are performed in parallel on many channels or on many device parts or on many devices. In one embodiment such automation enables mass production of devices, low cost, high yield and reproducibility of device properties. In one embodiment parallel multi-blade fabrication facilitates quality control and reliability measurements to be done on selected devices. In one embodiment multi-blade fabrication and\/or automation of the process are achieved using computers, computer programs, robotics or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the number of high aspect ratio ion selective membranes produced is equal to the number of channels described herein above.

A PDMS device comprising microchannels was fabricated.","A Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt. % in lower aliphatic alcohols and water containing 15-20% water) was used to form a high aspect ratio Nafion membrane embedded within the PDMS chip. The membrane was cured and integrated into the chip. The cover glass was adhered to the chip by plasma bonding the PDMS chip containing the channels on top of the glass substrate.","An embodiment of a detailed scheme of the preparation of a device of this invention was carried out as follows: desired PDMS microchannels were obtained from a standard PDMS chip fabrication process. Microchannels with various dimensions were fabricated. Dimensions of channels fabricated were 50 micron width\u00d75 micron depth, 100 micron width\u00d710 micron depth, 1000 micron width\u00d7100 micron depth. The center microchannel was connected to side channels through one side wall in a single gate (SG) device and through both side walls in a double gate (DG) device. A mechanical cut was made across the microchannels using a conventional razor blade for guiding Nafion infiltration after punching sample loading holes. The depth of the cutting was large enough to reach over the microchannel depth. The depth of the cut was typically 500-1000 micron. Once the gap was created, PDMS tended to restore its inherent geometric structure due to its flexibility. By bending the chip, the gap was opened and a drop of 1.5 \u03bcL Nafion 117 solution (Fluka) was applied to the edge of the gap. The Nafion solution immediately filled the both the gap and a portion of the microchannels by capillary forces. Nafion is a sulfonated tetrafluorethylene copolymer, widely used as a proton conductor for proton exchange membranes. After 10 minutes of curing at 95\u00b0 c, solvents in the Nafion resin evaporated, and the gap was bonded by Nafion resin with the adhesive-assisting role of the Nafion resin. The elastic nature of PDMS seals the Nafion junction rather tightly between the PDMS walls in the gap. Any remaining Nafion resin on the top of the PDMS surface and in the channels was removed by taping and peeling, and vertical type junctions were created within the PDMS, proximal to the microchannel bottom and proximal to the microchannel walls. Finally, a glass plate was bonded on top of the device using plasma treatment.","Biomolecule and Reagent Preparation","Molecules and dyes used included B-phycoerythrin, rGFP (BD bioscience, Palo Alto, Calif.), HTC-BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), FITC-Ovalbumin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), HTC-BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), HTC dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), Mito Orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), and lambda-DNA (500 \u03bcg\/ml). DNA molecules were labeled with YOYO-1 intercalating dyes (Molecular Probles, Eugene, Oreg.) by following manufacturer's instruction","Scanning Electron Microscopy of Devices","The microscope image of fabricated junctions and of the microchannels of DG devices were taken and are shown in . The images show three microchannels that were connected to each other by the high aspect ratio ion selective membrane which was assembled across the microchannels. is an SEM image showing an image of a cross section (A-A\u2032) of the device. Nafion resin was filled perpendicular to the plane of the cover glass and its thickness was estimated to be about 2-4 microns, as shown in the magnified image. Since the Nafion resin reached over 100 microns in depth, it can be used as a \u201cvertical type junction\u201d. Voids in the junction that could lead to unwanted leakage along the junction could not be seen. This vertical type Nafion junction had the dimensions of \u02dc1000 micron depth\u00d7\u02dc1 micron width. The cross sectional area of the formed junctions which is critical for high currents is theoretically at least 1\u00d710times larger than in the case of low aspect ratio or planar membranes.","Repeatability Test","The DC ion current through the polymeric junction is an indicator for testing reliability and repeatability of the performance of devices of the present invention. The initial ion currents were measured and compared for different devices. The measurement was done using Keithley 236 Current\/Voltage Source-Measure Unit (Keithley Instruments, Inc.) which was connected to the SG device with microchannels dimensions of 50 micron width\u00d75 micron depth. In order to control the level of electrical double layer overlapping, 1 mM phosphate buffer was used. Four devices were fabricated and tested. Each device was tested three times. The current was proportional to the applied voltage and showed an excellent linearity when the applied voltage was under 50 V. For most applications the voltage does not exceed this limit. The results demonstrate the reliability and reproducibility of the fabrication method and of the devices. The devices measured were compared to a device lacking the Nafion membrane. In this device the current was less than 10 nA which was not sufficient to induce ion concentration polarization (ion depletion).","Optical Detection Setup","All the experiments were conducted on an inverted microscope (IX-51) with fluorescence excitation light source attached. A thermoelectrically cooled CCD camera (Cooke Co., Auburn Hill, Mich.) was used for fluorescence imaging. Sequences of images were analyzed by IPLab 3.6 (Scanalytics, Fairfax, Va.). A home-made voltage divider was used to distribute different potentials to reservoirs. The built in 100 W mercury lamp was used as a light source.","Channels were filled with 40 nM, 4 nM and 4 \u03bcM B-phycoerythrin solutions, and the fluorescence intensity was determined. The camera shutter was opened only during periodical exposures (\u02dc1 sec) to minimize photobleaching of the collected molecules.","The preconcentration factors of BODIPY disulfonate (Invitrogen) were measured using a device and methods of this invention. Three different solution concentrations were used. The concentrations used were 0.1 nM, 1 nM and 10 nM, in a 1 mM phosphate buffer solution. A DG device was used. Microchannels had dimensions of 100 microns width\u00d710 micron depth as shown in . The average tangential electric field was 50 V\/cm. The fluorescent intensities were measured and analyzed as described in the method section herein above. Compared with its standard signal intensities (0.1 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM) the results showed that preconcentration factors of up to 1\u00d710were achieved within 15 minutes. The preconcentration of \u03b2-phycoerythrin (\u03b2-PE) protein in the same device was measured. The preconcentration for two initial concentrations (1.67 nM and 16.7 pM) was measured and is shown in The 1\u00d710preconcentration factors were achieved after 22 minutes. It was concluded that the concentration factors largely depend on the operating conditions such as applied voltage, charges of target species, buffer concentrations and the dimensions of the microchannel.","Pressure driven preconcentration operations were conducted in devices of the present invention.  shows the preconcentration operation using external pressure fields. Operation voltages of 120 V were applied at both reservoirs causing a depletion voltage condition. External pressure flow was induced by a syringe pump (Harvard) at 35 nL\/min from right to left. This tangential pressure flow (35 nL\/min corresponding to 2.6 mm\/sec in linear fluid velocity in this microchannel dimension) was at least 20 times faster than the electrokinetic velocity that can be obtained by the tangential field of 50 V\/cm used in . The speed of preconcentration was enhanced approximately 2\u00d7 compared to the speed shown in . The preconcentration reached 1\u00d710within 7 minutes in .","The ionic concentration inside the ion depletion zone created near the membrane junction is so low that the solution can be considered desalted (below a few \u03bcM). In such a case the electric field inside this zone increases up to \u02dckV\/cm, even when an external electric field of 10 V\/cm was applied. Thus the flow inside the zone experienced extremely high electric field and pushed the sample liquid all along the microchannel. This flow has reversed the pressure flow from opposite reservoir as shown in A syringe pump was connected to the right center reservoir with 0.1 \u03bcL\/min flow. Initially, all liquid flew from right to left without external electric field. While keeping the 0 V at the right center reservoir, increasing the voltage at the left center reservoir initiated a concentration polarization near the membrane. After a certain voltage (60 V) was reached, the ion depletion zone was successfully created at the left hand side of the junction and it acted as a high performance pump. This operation can push the flow against the external pressure field as shown in ","In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the high aspect ratio ion selective membrane devices, a larger microchannel was fabricated. The channel dimensions were 1000 \u03bcm width\u00d7100 \u03bcm depth. Since the deeper microchannel gives higher ion current, in the high aspect ratio configuration ion current through the membrane was approximately 10 times larger than in the smaller (100 \u03bcm width\u00d710 \u03bcm depth) channel. This is shown in and is compared with Due to this high ion current through the ion selective membrane, ion depletion was demonstrated in an SG device as shown in and ion preconcentration in a DG device as shown in The volume of the preconcentration plug was nearly 10 nL which was never demonstrated before and is suitable for applications in which the device is connected to commercial analytical systems such as mass spectrometers and matrix assisted laser desorption\/ionization (MALDI) instruments.","It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
