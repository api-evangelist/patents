title: Combined in-plane shear and multi-axial tension or compression testing apparatus
abstract: An in-plane shear and multi-axial tension or compression testing apparatus having four-bar linkages pivotable to two sleeves on an opposite vertices with the sleeves of each vertex rotationally attached to each other. Lateral links of each linkage are pivotally attached to load transfer plates in which the plates secure a test specimen. Each linkage is rotatable to the other linkages while the vertices are subjected to a compression or tensile load. The vertices are also capable of rotation by a testing machine for shear testing. During compression or tension of the vertices of the apparatus, the plates respectfully move toward or away from each other thereby applying compression or tension to the specimen. The bars of one linkage can be rotated with respect to the other, thereby applying torsional loading to the specimen.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a combined in-plane shear loading and multi-axial tension or compression testing apparatus in which the apparatus is capable of determining the mechanical properties of metals, plastics, woods, fabrics, elastomers and other materials.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Plain-woven fabrics are widely utilized as structural materials in air-inflated structures and rapidly deployable structures such as temporary shelters, tents, temporary bridges and space structures. Unlike metallic structures, these structures are primarily designed to be lightweight, self-erecting and deployable to volume-storage ratios that may be 1000-to-1. Air-inflated structures utilize pressurized fabric tubes and pressure-stabilized beams (known as air beams) as load-carrying members.","Although, the structures are well-known in the art, the technology for the structures has not been refined such that reliable structures can be analytically designed. Specifically, this analysis has gained in importance due to advancements in the material of the structural fiber and the weaving\/braiding of the structural fiber, both of which have improved the load carrying capacity of the structures. Accordingly, there is a recognized need to model the mechanical properties of woven fabrics.","Presently, modeling the mechanical properties of woven fabrics results in complex responses because of the complex microstructures of the composite materials used. Unlike traditional composite materials, plain-woven fabrics used in inflated structures exhibit high non-linearity with a dependence on internal pressure and contact interactions within the woven fabric.","Accordingly, there is a need for a testing apparatus which measures the elastic and shear moduli of air beams as a function of inflation pressure. To measure the elastic modulus of the fabric, a multi-axial loading has been shown to be preferable and to measure the shear moduli of the fabric; an in-plane shear loading has been shown to be preferable. As such, there is a need for a testing apparatus capable of combining in-plane shear and multi-axial loading. For non-orthogonal composite or fabric materials, such as braids or knits, there is a further need for a testing apparatus capable of loading the specimen in varying non-orthogonal positions.","While biaxial testing apparatuses with compression and tension loading or in-plane shear testing apparatuses exist in the prior art, there are no apparatuses that exist with a combined feature of in-plane shear and compression\/testing capabilities. Also, a testing apparatus does not exist that is capable of applying non-orthogonal multi-axial loading.","Additionally, testing apparatuses of the prior art employ two or more separate actuators in complex test fixtures or pressurization techniques for applying a biaxial load to a test specimen. An apparent disadvantage is the need for two or more loading devices and the associated high cost of equipment.","In regard to specific references, Lynch et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,776,028) describes an apparatus requiring three independent loading mechanisms. Holt (U.S. Pat. No. 4,192,194) describes an apparatus for biaxial loading of a specimen by pressurizing the inside surface of a cylinder. A restrictive disadvantage of the apparatus is the requirement of the cylindrical shape of the specimen and a high cost associated with pressurization of the cylinder. Additionally, the disadvantages include restriction to orthogonal loads about the axial, hoop and radial directions and an apparatus that is not capable of applying an in-plane shear stress to the specimen.","Mathiak et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,144,844) describes a cruciform planar specimen for biaxial material testing which has the disadvantage of being limited to use in two loading directions. Ward et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,166) describes an apparatus for self-alignment of a biaxial loading device. The apparatus requires that the two axial loading directions be orthogonal with a maximum of two loading directions. The apparatus also has no capability for applying an in-plane shear load to the specimen.","Tucchio (U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,918) describes an apparatus with an X-shape that is only used for compression load. Clay (U.S. Pat. No. 5,905,205) describes an in-plane biaxial test apparatus comprising linkages to transfer the load to an orthogonal direction of loading. A disadvantage of this apparatus is that it is not capable of applying in-plane shear to the test specimen. Another disadvantage of this apparatus is that the biaxial loading is limited to an orthogonal configuration.","As noted above, none of the references are capable of combining the in-plane and compression\/tension loading of a specimen while only using one loading system. As such, there exists a need for an apparatus capable of applying a combined in-plane shear and tension\/compression load to a specimen. Such an apparatus would be cost-effective due to reduced space and a reduced amount of equipment normally needed for material testing.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for testing a specimen with a multi-axial in-plane tension or compression loading.","A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for applying a non-orthogonal multi-axial tension or compression loading to the specimen.","A still further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for applying in-plane shear loading to the specimen when the specimen is subjected to multi-axial loading.","A still further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for employing a loading system compatible with conventional prime mover testing equipment.","A still further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for applying an unequal and multi-axial loading to the specimen.","To attain the objects described, there is provided an apparatus for simultaneous or independent in-plane shear and tension or compression loading of a test specimen such as metals, plastics, composites, woods, fabrics or anisotropic materials. The loading of the test specimen can orthogonal or non-orthogonal.","With the apparatus, the uniaxial tensile or compressive  load of a test machine can be converted to an equal or unequal stress state on a planar test specimen and an orthogonal or an oblique (non-orthogonal) stress state on the specimen by the use of load transfer systems comprising four-bar linkages movable to define the borders of varying rhombus-shapes.","The apparatus also provides flexibility by the ability to apply an unequal stress state or multi-axial load to the test specimen by utilizing load transfer plates of different lengths. Additionally, the apparatus provides flexibility by the ability to apply a non-orthogonal multi-axial loading by utilizing a different angle, other than exact angles between the vertices of the four-bar linkages. The angle of rotation of the linkages between the vertices can be measured directly by the test machine through load cells or other conventional instrumentation.","More specifically in structure, the apparatus comprises two four-bar linkages for biaxial testing and capable of the addition of other four-bar linkages for testing along additional axes. The four-bar linkages defining a rhombus-shape are pivotally connected to one another at opposing ends or vertices by sleeve bearings positioned at each vertex. The sleeve bearings at each vertex are axially connected to one another with a pin and thrust bearings between the sleeve bearings  thereby allowing the sleeve bearings to rotate freely with respect to one another while connected in the axial (vertical direction). Load transfer plates are pivotally attached to lateral links for each of the four-bar linkages. A securing clamp for the specimen is attached to the distal end of each of the load transfer plates.","When testing a specimen, an exposed end (two ends for uniaxial loading, four ends for biaxial loading, six ends for triaxial loading etc.) of the specimen is rigidly secured by the clamp. The vertices of the apparatus are attached to the crossheads of a conventional uniaxial tensile\/torsion machine. Upon a movement of the vertices of the linkages toward each other, their lateral links will extend outward thereby increasing the distance between the corresponding load transfer plates of each linkage. This movement applies planar tension on the specimen. Additionally, by rotating one linkage with respect to the other, the specimen will be subjected to the in-plane shear.","Similarly, upon movement of the vertices of the two linkages away from each other, their lateral links contract inward; thereby, decreasing the distance between the corresponding load transfer plates of each linkage. This movement applies planar compression on the specimen. Additionally, by rotating one linkage with respect to the other, the specimen will be subjected to the in-plane shear.","An added feature of the invention would be affixing a camera or optical recording device to a vertex of the apparatus. Another added feature would be the affixing a draping or puncturing mechanism to a vertex of the apparatus to conduct drape and\/or puncture tests on the specimen.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, one sees that  depicts a preferred embodiment of a testing apparatus  of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the apparatus  for biaxial loading generally comprises four-bar linkages  and  defining a perimeter of a variable rhombus shape, a first (or as shown) a top joint assembly , a second (or as shown) a bottom joint assembly , load transfer plates , ,  and  and an associated strain and displacement measurement system .","The linkage  includes two pairs of oblong and rigid members  and . Each end of each member is rigidly connected to a bracket  in which each bracket is pivotally connected to the top joint assembly  and the bottom joint assembly . The linkage  includes two pairs of oblong and long rigid members  and .

Each load transfer plate , ,  and  includes a clamp of a type known to those skilled in the art, either a clamp with a first wedge  for tensile loading (described further below), a clamp with a second wedge  for compressive loading (described further below), a clamp with a tongue and groove  for loading of fabric or similarly flexible materials (described further below) or a clamp  with a pre-tensioning roller  for loading  of fabric or similarly flexible materials (described further below). Each of the clamps secures a test specimen  by clamping or attaching to an exposed side of the specimen.","Referring now to the cross-sectional view of , the top joint assembly  comprises a first sleeve  and a second sleeve , a first thrust bearing , a second thrust bearing , a connecting rod  and a pin . The second sleeve  includes apertures  at the distal end of its extending arms as pivoting connecting points for the rigid members . Similarly, the first sleeve  includes apertures  at the distal end of its extending arms as pivoting connecting points for the rigid members . During loading for a test, the height of the apertures  and  of the top joint assembly  are on a horizontal plane  in which the horizontal plane is allowed by the second sleeve  having upward extending arms  and the first sleeve  having downward extending arms . As shown in , an additional pair of extending arms  are positioned on the second sleeve  to support a third four-bar linkage (not shown) in which tri-axial loading can be accomplished by load transfer plates of the third four-bar linkage. In this manner, additional linkages can be added to the second sleeve  for further multi-axial loading.","For the configurations of both figures, the pin  restrains the vertical motion of the sleeves  and , yet allows rotation of one sleeve with respect to the other. A crosshead  of a testing machine (not shown) is rigidly connected to the top joint assembly  by the pin .","Referring again to , the bottom joint assembly  is similar to the top joint assembly with the bottom joint assembly comprising a first sleeve , a second sleeve , a first thrust bearing , a second thrust bearing  and a pin . An additional pair of extending arms can be positioned on the first sleeve , similar to the positioning of extending arms  to support the other end of the third four-bar linkage. In this manner, additional linkages can be added to the first sleeve  for further multi-axial loading.","Similar to the top joint assembly , the vertical motion of the sleeves  and  is restricted by a pin , yet the sleeves rotate with respect to the other. A crosshead  of a testing machine (not shown) is rigidly connected to the bottom joint assembly  by the pin .","During a setup of the apparatus , the crosshead  and crosshead  are rigidly connected to a testing machine by the pins  and . An exposed section of the specimen  is rigidly secured by the clamps of the load transfer plates , ,  and . For tensile loading of the specimen  and preferable if the specimen is a planar solid, the first wedge  attached to the load transfer plate  of  is used to secure the specimen. For compressive loading of the specimen , the second wedge  attached to the load transfer plate  of  is used to secure the specimen. For loading of fabric or other bendable material as the specimen , the tongue and groove clamp  attached to the load transfer plate  of  is used to secure the specimen. Alternatively, for loading of the specimen , the clamp  with the pre-tensioning roller  and attached to the load transfer plate  of  is used to secure the specimen. By a series of fasteners or by other fastening means known to those skilled in the art, wedges  and  as well as clamps  and  can be rigidly attached to the individual load transfer plates , ,  and .","During a test and depicted by the configuration of the assembly  in , the downward or compressive movement in direction \u201cA\u201d of the crosshead  causes lateral links , ,  and  of the linkages  and  to move outward from a longitudinal axis  thereby increasing in distance from each other to the assembly configuration of FIG. . More specifically, a compressive force is transmitted from the crosshead  by the rigid and oblong members , ,  and  to vary the rhombus shape defined by the linkages  and . By rotation of the members , ,  and  on the lateral links , ,  and , the linkages  and  move outward. The increase in distance by the linkages  and  reflects the conversion of the compressive load by the crosshead  into a biaxial tension in the specimen . By positioning the third four-bar linkage in the same direction \u201cA\u201d, tri-axial tension on the specimen  can be accomplished by the load transfer plates of the third four-bar linkage.","Separately or combined with the movement of the crosshead , the upward or compressive movement in direction \u201cB\u201d of the crosshead  causes lateral links , ,  and  of the linkages  and  to move outward from the longitudinal axis  thereby increasing in distance from each other to the assembly configuration of FIG. . The increase in distance by the linkages  and  reflects the conversion of the compressive load by the crosshead  into a biaxial tension in the specimen . Similarly, by positioning the third four-bar linkage in the same direction \u201cB\u201d, tri-axial tension on the specimen  can be accomplished by the load transfer plates of the third four-bar linkage.","Conversely, the upward or tensile movement of the crosshead B in direction \u201cC\u201d in  causes the lateral links , ,  and  of the linkages  and  to move toward the axis  thereby decreasing a distance from each other. More specifically, a separating force similar to a tensile movement is transmitted from the crosshead  by the rigid members , ,  and  to vary the rhombus shape defined by the linkages  and . By rotation of the members , ,  and  on lateral links , ,  and , the linkages  and  move to the axis . The decrease in distance between the linkages  and  reflects the conversion of the tensile load by the crosshead  into a compressive biaxial load in the plane of the specimen . Similarly, by positioning the third four-bar linkage in the same direction \u201cC\u201d, tri-axial compression on the specimen  can be accomplished by the load transfer plates of the third four-bar linkage.","Separately or combined with the movement of the crosshead , the downward or tensile movement of the crosshead  in direction \u201cD\u201d in  causes the lateral links , ,  and  of the linkages  and  to move toward the axis  thereby decreasing a distance from each other. The decrease in distance between the linkages  and  reflects the conversion of the tensile load by the crosshead  into a compressive biaxial load in the specimen . Similarly, by positioning the third four-bar linkage in the same direction \u201cD\u201d, tri-axial compression on the specimen  can be accomplished by the load transfer plates of the third four-bar linkage.","Additionally, upon rotation of the crosshead  in direction \u201cE\u201d, the first sleeve  of  rotates with respect to the second sleeve  thereby rotating the linkage  with respect to the linkage . This rotation thereby rotates the load transfer plates  and  of the linkage  with respect to the load transfer plates  and  of the linkage  such that an in-plane shear or torsional stress is applied to the specimen .","Separately, upon rotation of the crosshead  in direction \u201cE\u201d, the first sleeve  rotates with respect to the second sleeve  thereby rotating the linkage  with respect to the linkage . This rotation thereby rotates the load transfer plates  and  of the linkage  with respect to the load transfer plates  and  of the linkage  such that an in-plane shear or torsional stress is applied to the specimen .","During any of the testing described above, the measurement system , typical of measurement systems known to those skilled in the art, measures the multi-axial displacements due to compression or tensile loading of the specimen. The measurement system  includes a conventional displacement wire transducer  placed on the load transfer plate . By a connecting wire , the transducer  is rigidly attached to a hook  on the load transfer plate  parallel to one transverse axis  of the biaxial loading. For a second transverse axis  of the biaxial loading, a separate transducer  and a separate connecting wire  (shown in ) are positioned on the bottom surface of the load transfer plates  and . For a third transverse axis of a triaxial loading, a separate transducer and a separate connecting wire (not shown) may be on an alternate plane from the connecting wires  for the axis  and  in order not to interfere with either. Strain gauges  are placed on the sidewalls of the load transfer plates ,  and on (but not shown) load-transfer plates ,  to directly monitor the loading of the specimen .","To visually record the deformation of the specimen , a camera or another optical recording device  may be affixed to the second sleeve  of the joint assembly . Another feature would be the affixing of a puncturing or the shown draping mechanism  to the second sleeve  of the joint assembly  to conduct puncture and\/or drape tests on the specimen .","As shown and described above, the specimen  is subject to an equal biaxial loading wherein the length of the load transfer plates , ,  and  are equal. In a first variant of the embodiment of the present invention, an unequal biaxial loading of the specimen  is capable. To have an unequal biaxial loading ratio, the length of the load transfer plates  and  of the linkage  would differ from those of the load transfer plates  and  of the linkage . The displacement relationship caused by the unequal biaxial loading can easily be extracted by using the Pythagorean theorem.","In a second variant of the embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus  is also capable of non-orthogonal (oblique) multi-axial loading of the specimen . Non-orthogonal multi-axial loading is particularly important for testing of braided or knitted fabrics and other non-orthogonal composite materials. As depicted in  for a test, the angle  between the axis's  and  of the linkages  and  can be varied by rotating either linkage to match an angle defined by non-orthogonal fiber directions.","As is obvious in view of the prior description of the movements of the apparatus , the apparatus is capable of loading the specimen  for uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, biaxial tension, biaxial compression, in-plane shear, biaxial tension with in-plane shear, biaxial compression with in-plane shear and unequal biaxial compression with in-plane shear as well as any other loading and resultant testing derivable by those skilled in the art.","Thus by the present invention its objects and advantages  are realized and although preferred embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein, its scope should be determined by that of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00032","num":"00032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00033","num":"00033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
