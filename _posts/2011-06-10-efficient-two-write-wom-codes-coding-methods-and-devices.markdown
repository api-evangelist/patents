No. 61\/353,419, which was filed Jun. 10, 2010, and is incorporated by reference herein.","A field of the invention is data coding and compression. Embodiments of the invention provide WOM (Write Once Memory) coding methods and devices.","A Write Once Memory (WOM) is a storage medium with binary memory elements, called cells, that can change from the zero state to the one state only once, except, in some types of memory, upon a block erase. WOM-codes were originally designed for memories that consist of binary memory elements that could physically only be changed from a zero state to a one state. Examples of such memories are punch cards and optical disks. More recently, WOM-codes have been designed for general usage in different types of memories, including flash memories. See, e.g., A. Jiang, \u201cOn the Generalization of Error-Correcting WOM-codes,\u201d in Proc. IEEE Int. Symp. Inform. Theory, pp. 1391-1395, Nice, France (2007); A. Jiang and J.

Wolf, and E. Yaakobi, \u201cA Nearly Optimal Construction of Flash Codes,\u201d in Proc. IEEE Int. Symp. Inform. Theory. pp. 1239-1243, Seoul, Korea, (July 2009).","A WOM-code allows the reuse of a write-once medium by introducing redundancy into the recorded bit sequence and, in subsequent write operations, observing the state of the medium before determining how to update the contents of the memory with a new bit sequence.","A simple example enables the recording of two bits of information in 3 memory elements, twice. The encoding and decoding rules for this WOM-code are described in a tabular form in the table below. It is easy to verify that after the first 2-bit data vector is encoded into a 3-bit codeword, if the second 2-bit data vector is different from the first, the 3-bit codeword into which it is encoded does not change any code bit  into a code bit , ensuring that it can be recorded in the write-once medium.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Data Bits","First Write","Second Write"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["00","000","111"]},{"entry":["10","100","011"]},{"entry":["01","010","101"]},{"entry":["11","001","110"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The sum-rate of the WOM-code is the sum of all the individual rates for each write. While there are different ways to analyze the efficiency of WOM-codes, we find that the appropriate figure of merit is to analyze the sum-rate under the assumption of a fixed number of writes. In general, the more writes the WOM-code can support, the better the sum-rate it can achieve. The goal is to give upper and lower bounds on the sum-rates of WOM-codes while fixing the number of writes t to a desired number.","An embodiment of the invention provides a family of 2-write WOM-codes, preferred embodiments of which provide improved WOM-rates. Embodiments of the invention provide constructs for linear codes C having a 2-write WOM-code. Embodiments of the invention provide 2-write WOM-codes that improve the best known WOM-rates known to the present inventors at the time of filing with two writes. Preferred WOM-codes are proved to be capacity achieving when the parity check matrix of the linear code C is chosen uniformly at random.","Preferred embodiments of the invention provide an electronic device utilizing an efficient coding scheme of WOM-codes with two write capability. The coding method is based on linear binary codes and allows the electronic device to write information to the memory twice before erasing it. This method can be applied for any kind of memory systems, and in particular for flash memories. The method is shown to outperform all well-known codes.","The invention addresses two problems related to 2-write WOM-codes 1) The number of messages written to the memory on each write is the same; 2) Different number of messages can be written on each write. For the case of 2-write WOM-codes, the theoretical bound on the WOM-rate for the first problem is approximately 1.5458 and in the second problem it is approximately 1.58. Since the best known WOM-rate for the first problem is approximately 1.34 and 1.37 for the second problem, there is still room for improvement in closing these gaps. The invention provides a family of 2-write WOM-codes, preferred embodiments of which provide improved WOM-rates. Embodiments of the invention provide constructs for linear codes C having a 2-write WOM-code. Embodiments of the invention provide 2-write WOM-codes that improve the best known WOM-rates known to the present inventors at the time of filing with two writes. Preferred WOM-codes are proved to be capacity achieving when the parity check matrix of the linear code C is chosen uniformly at random.","Preferred embodiments of the invention provide an electronic device utilizing an efficient coding scheme of WOM-codes with two write capability. The coding method is based on linear binary codes and allows the electronic device to write information to the memory twice before erasing it. This method can be applied for any kind of memory systems, and in particular for flash memories. The method is shown to outperform all well-known codes.","Preferred embodiments of the invention are applicable to memories having cells that can change their state from zero to one but not from one to zero except upon an erase of the entire memory. Preferred embodiments of the invention are t-write WOM-codes that conform to Thoerem 1 in the description below.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings may include schematic representations, which will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art and the description that follows. Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale.","Preferred embodiment methods and devices use a two-write WOM-codes construction that reduces the gap between the upper and lower bound on the sum-rates for both fixed- and unrestricted-rate WOM-codes. In Reference [28], a \u201ccoset-coding\u201d is used only on the second write in order to generate an \u03b5-error two-write WOM-codes. However, in \u03b5-error two-write WOM-codes, the second write is not guaranteed in the worst case but is allowed with high probability. Methods and codes of the invention guarantee from every linear code a two-write WOM-code. A \u201ccoset-coding\u201d scheme only on the second write is used as in Reference [28], but the first write is modified such that the second write is guaranteed in the worst case. Preferred specific embodiment WOM-codes have better sum-rates than the previously best known codes discussed above. Preferred embodiment WOM-codes choose uniformly at random the parity-check matrix of the linear code, such that there exist WOM-codes that achieve all points in the capacity region of two-write WOM-codes. An example application of a preferred method generate from each two-write WOM-code a code for the Blackwell channel.","A. Two-Write WOM-Codes Construction","Let C[n,k] be a linear code with parity-check matrix . For each v\u03b5{0,1}we define the matrix as follows. The i-th column of , 1\u2266i\u2266n, is the i-th column of  if v=0 and otherwise it is the zeros column. The set Vc is defined to be\n\n0,1}|rank()=\u2003\u2003(1)\n","We first note the following position. If a vector v belongs to Vc, its weight is at most k.","The support of a binary vector v, denoted by supp(v), is the set {i\/v=1}. The dual of the code C is denoted by C\u22a5. The next lemma is a variation of a well known result (see e.g. Reference [5]).","Lemma 1. Let C[n, k] be a linear code with parity-check matrix . For each vector v\u03b5{0, 1}, rank()=n\u2212k if and only if v does not cover any non-zero codeword in C\u22a5.","Lemma 1 implies that if two matrices are parity-check matrices of the same linear code C, then their corresponding sets Vc are identical, and so we can define the set Vc to be","Vc={v\u03b5{0, 1}|v does not cover any non-zero c\u03b5C\u22a5}.","The next theorem presents the preferred embodiment two-write WOM-codes,","Theorem 1.","Let C[n,k] be a linear code with parity-check matrix  and let Vc be the set defined in (1).

The encoding and decoding maps E, Dare defined as follows. For each m\u03b5{1, . . . , |V|}, E(m)=vand D(v)=m.","2) On the second write, we write a vector sof n\u2212k bits.
