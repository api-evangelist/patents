{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES"],"p":["The present invention relates to a conductive film that can be used as a part of a defroster (defrosting device) or a window glass for a vehicle, as a heating sheet for heat generation under an electric current, or as an electrode for a touch panel, an inorganic EL device, an organic EL device, or a solar cell, and to a transparent heating element containing the conductive film.","A device described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2005-197234 has recently been proposed as an electroluminescence device capable of large-area (e.g., 0.25 mor more) light emission with high luminance and long lifetime.","Meanwhile, structures described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2007-026989 and 10-289602 have been known as a vehicle light containing a conductive film capable of preventing illuminance reduction of the light.","The illuminance of a vehicle light may be reduced due to the following causes:\n\n","The structure described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2007-026989 is obtained by attaching a heating element containing a transparent electricity insulating sheet and a conductive pattern printed thereon to a formed lens using an in-mold method. Specifically, the conductive pattern of the heating element is composed of a composition containing a noble metal powder and a solvent-soluble thermoplastic resin.","The structure described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-289602 is obtained by attaching a heating element into a lens portion of a vehicle lamp. The lens portion is heated by applying an electric power to the heating element under a predetermined condition. The document describes that the heating element comprises a transparent conductive film of ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), etc.","Furthermore, a device described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2006-190585 has been proposed as a dye-sensitized solar cell capable of reducing adverse effects of reflected electromagnetic waves without significant reduction of the power generation efficiency. In addition, in the field of electromagnetic-shielding films, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-221565 has disclosed a technology for determining a thickening ratio of line intersections in a mesh to minimize PDP image quality deterioration due to moire or the like.","In the heating element described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2007-026989, one conductive wire may be arranged in a zigzag manner on a headlamp front cover or the like to form a long conductive line in view of obtaining a desired resistance value (e.g., about 40 ohm). However, a potential difference may be disadvantageously generated between adjacent conductive line portions to cause migration.","In the heating element described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-289602, the transparent conductive film of ITO, etc. is used. The film cannot be formed on a curved surface of a formed body by a method other than vacuum sputtering methods. Thus, the heating element is disadvantageous in efficiency, cost, etc.","In addition, since the transparent conductive film is composed of a ceramic such as ITO, the film may be cracked when a sheet on which the transparent conductive film is formed is bent in an in-mold method. Therefore, the film can hardly be used in a vehicle light front cover or the like having the curved-surface body and the transparent heater though it can be used in a window glass with relatively less curved surface.","Thus, the conventional heating elements are less versatile and exclusively used in a vehicle light front cover, a window glass, etc.","In the case of using a conductive film as an electrode of a touch panel, an inorganic EL device, or an organic EL device, a conductive portion has to be formed in view of light refraction and diffraction in the portion to prevent glare caused by a backlight, etc.","The solar cell described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2006-190585 utilizes a transparent conductive film of ITO, etc., thereby resulting in the same problems as Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-289602. Also, the electromagnetic-shielding film technology described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-221565 still has room for improvement.","Under such circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a conductive film and a transparent heating element which is usable as a heat generating sheet by applying electric current thereto, and can exhibit an improved heat generation efficiency, can prevent glare caused by a vehicle or outdoor light, and can be versatilely used in a vehicle light front cover, a window glass, etc.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a conductive film that can be used as an electrode of a touch panel, an inorganic EL device, or an organic EL device to prevent glare caused by a backlight, etc.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a conductive film that can be used as an electrode of a solar cell to shield electromagnetic waves and to lower the surface resistance without reduction of the power generation efficiency.","For the purpose of realizing a highly versatile transparent heating element usable for a vehicle light front cover, a building window glass, a vehicle window glass, etc., the inventor has examined a conductive film according to a comparative example having a plurality of conductive portions and a plurality of opening portions, which provide mesh shapes in combination. Specifically, the conductive portions are formed in a straight line shape and are crossed to form the mesh shapes in the conductive film.","When the heating wire is arranged in a zigzag manner in the conventional structure, a potential difference is generated between the adjacent conductive line portions to cause migration disadvantageously. In contrast, when the conductive portions are formed in the mesh shapes, the adjacent conductive portions are intrinsically in the short-circuited condition, and the migration is never a problem.","The conductive portions can be composed of a thin metal wire or the like excellent in malleability and ductility, and therefore can be formed along a three-dimensional curved surface having a minimum curvature radius of 300 mm or less.","However, it has been found that in the conductive film according to the comparative example, diffracted lights generated in the ends of the straight conductive portions interact with each other in diffraction points arranged linearly on the intersections to emit an intense interfering light. Also, on the conductive portions, diffraction points are arranged linearly to emit an intense light, though the light is weaker than the interfering light from the intersections. Therefore, when the conductive film is incorporated in a window glass, significant glare or the like is disadvantageously caused due to the interference of the diffracted lights.","Thus, in the present invention, the problem has been solved by using the following structure.","[1] A conductive film according to a first aspect of the present invention comprising a plurality of conductive portions and a plurality of opening portions, wherein the combination of the conductive portions and the opening portions has mesh shapes, the conductive portions are formed in a wavy line shape containing arcs extending in alternate directions, and at least one of the arcs is disposed between intersections.","In this structure, the conductive portions hardly have a straight section, so that diffraction points are not arranged linearly on the intersections of the conductive portions, and an interfering light from the intersections has a low intensity. The same phenomenon is caused on the conductive portions, and also an interfering light from the conductive portions has a low intensity. In the present invention, the mesh shapes can prevent glare or the like caused by the interference of the diffracted lights. Therefore, the conductive film is suitable for a transparent heating element to be incorporated in a window glass (such as a building window glass or a vehicle window glass), a vehicle light front cover, etc. The straight section may be appropriately formed if necessary depending on the product using the conductive film (such as the window glass or the vehicle light front cover), the period or amplitude of the wavy line shape, etc.","Furthermore, when the conductive film of the present invention is used as an electrode of a touch panel, an inorganic EL device, or an organic EL device, the conductive film can prevent glare or the like caused by a backlight and thus can prevent visibility deterioration of a displayed image.","Furthermore, when the conductive film is used as an electrode of a solar cell, the conductive film can act as an electromagnetic-shielding film and can exhibit a low surface resistance to prevent reduction of power generation efficiency.","[2] A conductive film

each mesh shape is 2n (n=1, 2, 3, . . . ).","[4] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the arcs have a central angle of approximately 90\u00b0, and the number of the arcs on the circumference line of each mesh shape is 4n (n=1, 2, 3, . . . ).","[5] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein in a line connecting the central points of optional adjacent two mesh shapes disposed along the arrangement of the intersections of the conductive portions, the length of a first line segment connecting the central point of one mesh shape and the intersection is equal to the length of a second line segment connecting the central point of the other mesh shape and the intersection.","[6] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein in a line connecting the central points of optional adjacent two mesh shapes disposed along the extending direction of one conductive portion, the length of a third line segment connecting the central point of one mesh shape and another conductive portion is equal to the length of a fourth line segment connecting the central point of the other mesh shape and the other conductive portion.","[7] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein in a line connecting the central points of optional adjacent two mesh shapes disposed along the extending direction of one conductive portion, the length of a third line segment connecting the central point of one mesh shape and another conductive portion is different from the length of a fourth line segment connecting the central point of the other mesh shape and the other conductive portion.","[8] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the arrangement period of the arcs varies along the extending direction of the conductive portion.","[9] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the arrangement period of the arcs between one intersection and a first intersection adjacently disposed at one side of the one intersection along the extending direction of one conductive portion is different from the arrangement period of the arcs between the one intersection and a second intersection adjacently disposed at the other side of the one intersection.","[10] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the arrangement period of the arcs between the one intersection and a third intersection adjacently disposed at one side of the one intersection along the extending direction of another conductive portion is different from the arrangement period of the arcs between the one intersection and a fourth intersection adjacently disposed at the other side of the one intersection.","[11] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the arcs have a central angle of 75\u00b0 to 105\u00b0, preferably approximately 90\u00b0.","[12] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the conductive portions have a crossing angle of 90\u00b0 in the intersections.","[13] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the conductive portions have a crossing angle of 0\u00b0 in the intersections.","[14] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the wavy line shape has a constant period.","[15] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the wavy line shape has a constant amplitude.","[16] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the conductive film has a total light transmittance of 70% or more but less than 99%.","[17] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the wavy line shape has a line width of 5 to 50 \u03bcm.","[18] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the distance between adjacent wavy line shapes is 150 to 2000 \u03bcm.","[19] A conductive film according to the first aspect, wherein the conductive portions contain a metallic silver portion formed by exposing and developing a photosensitive silver salt layer disposed on a transparent support.","[20] A transparent heating element according to a second aspect of the present invention comprising a conductive film according to the first aspect.","As described above, when the conductive film or the transparent heating element of the present invention is used as a heat generating sheet by applying electric current, it can exhibit an improved heat generation efficiency, can prevent glare caused by a vehicle or outdoor light, and can be versatilely used in a vehicle light front cover, a window glass, etc.","When the conductive film of the present invention is used as an electrode of a touch panel, an inorganic EL device, or an organic EL device, glare or the like caused by a backlight can be prevented.","When the conductive film of the present invention is used as an electrode of a solar cell, it can act as an electromagnetic-shielding film and can exhibit a low surface resistance to prevent reduction of the power generation efficiency.","Several embodiments of the conductive film and the transparent heating element of the present invention will be described below with reference to .","As shown in , a conductive film according to a first embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the first conductive film A) contains a plurality of conductive portions  and a plurality of opening portions , and the combination of the conductive portions  and the opening portions  has mesh shapes M. Each mesh shape M is a combined shape of one opening portion  and four conductive portions  surrounding the opening portion .","The first conductive film A can be used as a part of a defroster (defrosting device) or a window glass for a vehicle. The first conductive film A can be used also in a transparent heating element capable of heat generation by applying electric current. As shown in , the first conductive film A has a transparent film substrate , and the conductive portions  and the opening portions  formed thereon. As shown in , when the first conductive film A is used in a first transparent heating element A, a first electrode and a second electrode are disposed on the opposite ends of the first conductive film A (e.g., the right and left ends of ), and electric current is applied from the first electrode to the second electrode . Thus, the first transparent heating element A generates heat, whereby a heating object that is brought into contact or equipped with the first transparent heating element A (such as a building window glass, a vehicle window glass, or a vehicle light front cover) is heated. As a result, snow or the like attached to the heating object is removed.","As shown in , the conductive portions  in the first conductive film A have a mesh pattern  formed by crossing a plurality of first thin metal wires arranged at a first pitch L in one direction (the x direction of ) and a plurality of second thin metal wires arranged at a second pitch L in another direction (the y direction of ). The first pitch L and the second pitch L may be selected within a range of 150 \u03bcm to 6000 \u03bcm (6.0 mm). The line width d of each of the first and second thin metal wires may be selected within a range of 5 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm (0.2 mm). It is to be understood that the line width d may be selected within a range of 5 to 50 \u03bcm to improve the transparency.","The term \u201cfirst pitch L\u201d is suitable for the first thin metal wires arranged at the constant distance. However, the first pitch L may vary between some of the first thin metal wires , and in this case the term \u201cdistance between adjacent first thin metal wires \u201d is more appropriately used. Also, the second thin metal wires may be arranged in this manner. Thus, the distance between adjacent first thin metal wires and the distance between adjacent second thin metal wires are preferably 150 to 6000 \u03bcm, more preferably 300 to 1000 \u03bcm.","The conductive portions  have the mesh pattern  containing a large number of lattice intersection points (intersections ) formed by the first thin metal wires and the second thin metal wires . Each of the conductive portions  is formed in a wavy line shape containing at least one curve between the intersections .","Specifically, in the first conductive film A, the wavy line shape contains arcs , and two arcs  extending in alternate crest and trough directions are continuously formed between the intersections . Each arc  has a central angle of 75\u00b0 to 105\u00b0, preferably approximately 90\u00b0. The conductive portions  have a crossing angle of approximately 90\u00b0. Though the preferred central angle and the preferred crossing angle are represented by the term \u201capproximately 90\u00b0\u201d in view of production tolerance, it is desired that the central angle and the crossing angle are ideally 90\u00b0.","The wavy line shape of the conductive portions  has a constant period. The period is the arrangement period of the arcs. Thus, the length, in which two arcs  extending in alternate crest and trough directions are continuously formed, is considered as one period. In the example of , the intersections  are positioned at a distance of the one period. The one period is preferably 50 to 2000 \u03bcm. The arrangement pitch of the intersections  along the conductive portions  can be represented by the period of the wavy line shape. In , the arrangement pitch of the intersections  along the conductive portions  corresponds to the one period of the wavy line shape. Thus, the arrangement pitch of the intersections  may be controlled at n period (n is a real number) of the wavy line shape in the production of the conductive film. Though the conductive portions  have a wavy line shape with a constant period in this embodiment, the adjacent parallel conductive portions  in the mesh pattern  may be formed in different wavy line shapes with different periods.","The wavy line shape of the conductive portions  has a constant amplitude h. When an imaginary line  connects two adjacent intersections  and a line perpendicular to the imaginary line  extends from a crest of the wavy line shape, the amplitude h is a distance from the crest to the intersection point of the perpendicular line and the imaginary line . The amplitude h is preferably 10 to 500 \u03bcm. Though the conductive portions  have a wavy line shape with the constant amplitude h in this embodiment, adjacent two arcs  between the intersections  may have different amplitudes, and the adjacent parallel conductive portions  may be in different wavy line shapes with different arc amplitudes.","As schematically shown in , in the first conductive film A, in a line connecting the central points C and C of two optional mesh shapes M and M adjacently disposed along the arrangement of the intersections , the length La of a first line segment connecting the central point C of one mesh shape M and the intersection  is equal to the length Lb of a second line segment connecting the central point C of the other mesh shape M and the intersection .","Furthermore, as shown in , in a line connecting the central points C and C of two optional mesh shapes M and M adjacently disposed along the extending direction of the second thin metal wire , the length Lc of a third line segment connecting the central point C of one mesh shape M and the first thin metal wire is equal to the length Ld of a fourth line segment connecting the central point C of the other mesh shape M and the first thin metal wire ","In addition, as shown in , a pair of optional tangent lines, which are positioned on the circumference line of each mesh shape M symmetrically about the central point C of the mesh shape M, are parallel to each other. Specifically, in , for example, a pair of first tangent lines ()(), a pair of second tangent lines ()(), and a pair of third tangent lines ()() are parallel to each other, respectively, and have different tangent directions. In general, a light is highly refracted and diffracted in a tangent direction. In the first conductive film A, a light can be refracted and diffracted in a large number of the different tangent directions, thereby reducing the glare.","Furthermore, in the first conductive film A, the opening portions  have approximately constant opening areas, whereby the glare or the like caused by interference of diffracted lights can be prevented on the whole surface, and the significant glare or the like is not caused locally.","The first conductive film A has a total light transmittance of 70% or more but less than 99%, which can be increased to 80% or more or 85% or more.","Thus, the conductive portions  in the first conductive film A hardly have a straight section, so that diffraction points are not arranged linearly on the intersections  of the conductive portions , and an interfering light from the intersections  has a low intensity. The same phenomenon is caused on the conductive portions , and also an interfering light from the conductive portions  has a low intensity. The glare or the like caused by the interference of the diffracted lights is thus prevented that would otherwise be caused by the mesh shapes. Therefore, the first conductive film A is suitable for the first transparent heating element A that can be incorporated in a window glass (such as a building window glass or a vehicle window glass), a vehicle light front cover, etc. The straight section may be appropriately formed in the wavy line shape if necessary depending on the product (such as the window glass or the vehicle light front cover), the period or amplitude of the wavy line shape, etc. The wavy line shape may be a sine wave curve shape.","A conductive film according to a second embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the second conductive film B) will be described below with reference to .","As shown in , the structure of the second conductive film B is approximately the same as that of the above first conductive film A, but different in the following respect.","In the second conductive film B, one arc  is formed between the intersections . The arcs  have a central angle of approximately 90\u00b0, respectively. The conductive portions  have a crossing angle of approximately 0\u00b0. Though the central angle and the crossing angle are represented by the term \u201capproximately 90\u00b0\u201d and \u201capproximately 0\u00b0\u201d in view of production tolerance, it is desired that the central angle and the crossing angle are ideally 90\u00b0 and 0\u00b0, respectively.","The wavy line shape of the conductive portions  has a constant period. In the example of , the intersections  are at a distance of 0.5 periods. In other words, the arrangement pitch of the intersections  along the conductive portions  corresponds to the 0.5 periods of the wavy line shape. The one period is preferably 100 to 4000 \u03bcm.","The adjacent parallel first thin metal wires are arranged such that a crest of one wavy line shape faces a trough of the other wavy line shape. Similarly, the adjacent parallel second thin metal wires are arranged such that a crest of one wavy line shape faces a trough of the other wavy line shape. Thus, as shown in , in the mesh pattern  of the second conductive film B, a large number of circles with the same size are arranged in a matrix.","As shown in , when the second conductive film B is used in a second transparent heating element B, a first electrode and a second electrode are disposed on the opposite ends of the second conductive film B (e.g., the right and left ends of ), and an electric current is flowed from the first electrode to the second electrode to allow the second transparent heating element B to generate a heat.","The wavy line shape of the conductive portions  has a constant amplitude h. The amplitude h is preferably 20 to 1000 \u03bcm.","Unlike the first conductive film A, the second conductive film B has first opening portions with a small opening area and second opening portions with a large opening area. Still, the first opening portions and the second opening portions are arranged in a regular manner alternately in each of the x and y directions, whereby the glare or the like caused by interference of diffracted lights can be prevented on the whole surface, and significant glare or the like is not caused locally.","Thus, also in the second conductive film B, the mesh shapes can prevent the glare or the like caused by the interference of the diffracted lights. Therefore, the second conductive film B is suitable for the second transparent heating element B that can be incorporated in a window glass (such as a building window glass or a vehicle window glass), a vehicle light front cover, etc.","A conductive film according to a third embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the third conductive film C) will be described below with reference to .","As schematically shown in , the structure of the third conductive film C is approximately the same as that of the above first conductive film A.","Thus, like the first conductive film A, the length La of the first line segment is equal to the length Lb of the second line segment in the third conductive film C. In addition, a pair of optional tangent lines, which are positioned on the circumference line of each mesh shape M symmetrically about the central point C of the mesh shape M, are parallel to each other.","However, unlike the first conductive film A, in a line connecting the central points C and C of two optional mesh shapes M and M adjacently disposed along the extending direction of the second thin metal wire , the length Lc of a third line segment connecting the central point C of one mesh shape M and the first thin metal wire is different from the length Ld of a fourth line segment connecting the central point C of the other mesh shape M and the first thin metal wire . In the example of , the length Lc is larger than the length Ld. It should be noted that the intersections  are at a distance of 0.5 periods in this example.","As in the first conductive film A, also in the third conductive film C, a light can be refracted and diffracted in a large number of the different tangent directions, thereby reducing the glare. Furthermore, the opening portions  have approximately constant opening areas, whereby the glare or the like caused by interference of diffracted lights can be prevented on the whole surface, and the significant glare or the like is not caused locally.","An example of a product (such as a conductive sheet ) using the third conductive film C will be described below with reference to also .  is a front view showing the conductive sheet ,  is a back view showing the conductive sheet ,  is a top view showing the conductive sheet ,  is a bottom view showing the conductive sheet ,  is a left side view showing the conductive sheet , and  is a right side view showing the conductive sheet . Further  is a perspective view showing the conductive sheet , and  is a front view showing the use thereof.","The conductive sheet  contains a transparent film substrate  and a wavy conductive pattern  (conductive portions) formed thereon. The design of the conductive sheet is continuously formed in the vertical and horizontal directions of the front view. In the conductive sheet , the transparent film substrate  is colorless and clear, and the conductive pattern  (the conductive portions) has a black color.","The conductive sheet  can be used as a part of a defroster (defrosting device) or a window glass for a vehicle, etc. The conductive sheet  can be used also as a heating sheet capable of heat generation by applying electric current. Furthermore, the conductive sheet  can be used as an electrode for a touch panel, an inorganic EL device, an organic EL device, or a solar cell. For example, electrodes are disposed on the opposite ends of the conductive sheet  (e.g., the right and left ends of ), and an electric current is flowed between the electrodes to heat the conductive pattern . Thus, a heating object that is brought into contact or equipped with the conductive sheet  (such as a vehicle headlight covered with snow) is heated (to remove melted snow from the headlight). The arc arrangement period of the conductive pattern  (the dimensions D, D of ) may be selected within a range of 0.1 to 6.0 mm (more preferably 0.3 to 6.0 mm). In this example, the dimensions D, D are the same value of about 5.8 mm. The line width of the conductive pattern  (the dimension d of ) is about 0.1 mm in this example though it may be selected within a range of 0.01 to 0.2 mm. The thickness of the transparent film substrate  (the dimension t of ) is about 0.6 mm in this example though it may be selected within a range of 0.01 to 2.0 mm. The thickness of the conductive pattern  (the dimension t of ) is about 0.1 mm in this example though it may be selected within a range of 0.001 to 0.2 mm.","A conductive film according to a fourth embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the fourth conductive film D) will be described below with reference to .","As schematically shown in , the structure of the fourth conductive film D is approximately the same as that of the above third conductive film C.","Thus, the length La is equal to the length Lb, the length Lc is different from the length Ld, and a pair of optional tangent lines, which are positioned on the circumference line of each mesh shape M symmetrically about the central point C of the mesh shape M, are parallel to each other.","The fourth conductive film D is different from the third conductive film C in that 1.5 periods of the arcs are arranged between the intersections .","Also, in the fourth conductive film D, a light can be refracted and diffracted in a large number of different directions, thereby reducing the significant glare. Furthermore, the opening portions  have approximately constant opening areas, whereby the glare or the like caused by interference of diffracted lights can be prevented on the whole surface, and the significant glare or the like is not caused locally.","A conductive film according to a fifth embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the fifth conductive film E) will be described below with reference to .","As schematically shown in , the structure of the fifth conductive film E is approximately the same as that of the above third conductive film C.","Thus, the length La is equal to the length Lb, the length Lc is different from the length Ld, and a pair of optional tangent lines, which are positioned on the circumference line of each mesh shape M symmetrically about the central point C of the mesh shape M, are parallel to each other.","The fifth conductive film E is different from the third conductive film C in that the arc arrangement period between one intersection  and a first intersection adjacently disposed at one side of the one intersection  along the extending direction of the first thin metal wire is different from the arc arrangement period between the one intersection  and a second intersection adjacently disposed at the other side of the one intersection . In the example of , in the arc arrangement, the one intersection  and the first intersection are at a distance of 0.5 periods, and the one intersection  and the second intersection are at a distance of 1.5 periods.","In addition, the arc arrangement period between the one intersection  and a third intersection adjacently disposed at one side of the one intersection  along the extending direction of the second thin metal wire is different from the arc arrangement period between the one intersection  and a fourth intersection adjacently disposed at the other side of the one intersection . In the example of , in the arc arrangement, the one intersection  and the third intersection are at a distance of 1.5 periods and the one intersection  and the fourth intersection are at a distance of 0.5 periods.","Also, in the fifth conductive film E, a light can be refracted and diffracted in a large number of different directions, thereby reducing the significant glare.","In the above described first to fifth conductive films A to E, the number of the arcs  on the circumference line of one mesh shape M is 4k (k=1, 2, 3, . . . ). Therefore, the conductive films are capable of exhibiting a low overall surface resistance, improving a heat generation efficiency in a transparent heating element, and improving a power generation efficiency in a solar cell.","A conductive film according to a sixth embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the sixth conductive film F) will be described below with reference to .","As schematically shown in , the structure of the sixth conductive film F is approximately the same as that of the above first conductive film A, but different in the following respect.","Thus, the adjacent parallel first thin metal wires (one first thin metal wire  and the other first thin metal wire ) have different arc arrangement periods.

Also, in terms of the second thin metal wires , one second thin metal wire  has 1 period of the arcs between the intersections , and the other second thin metal wire  has 2 periods of the arcs between the intersections .","It is to be understood that, when the one first thin metal wire  has i period of the arcs between the intersections , the other first thin metal wire  has j period of the arcs between the intersections , the one second thin metal wire  has p period of the arcs between the intersections , and the other second thin metal wire  has q period of the arcs between the intersections , the periods may satisfy one of the following relations.\n\ni\u2260j, i=p, j=q\u2003\u2003(1)\n\ni\u2260j, i\u2260p, j=q, p\u2260q\u2003\u2003(2)\n\ni\u2260j, i=p, j\u2260q, p\u2260q\u2003\u2003(3)\n\ni\u2260j, i\u2260p, j\u2260q, p\u2260q\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Also, in the sixth conductive film, the conductive portions  hardly have a straight section, so that diffraction points are not arranged linearly on the intersections  of the conductive portions . In addition, the adjacent parallel thin metal wires are formed in different wavy line shapes with different periods, whereby the diffraction points are discretely distributed to further reduce the glare or the like caused by interference of diffracted lights. Furthermore, the opening portions  have approximately constant opening areas, whereby the glare or the like caused by the interference of diffracted lights can be prevented on the whole surface, and the significant glare or the like is not caused locally. Also, in this case, the number of the arcs  on the circumference line of one mesh shape M is 4k (k=1, 2, 3, . . . ), whereby the overall surface resistance can be maintained at a lower level.","A conductive film according to a seventh embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the seventh conductive film G) will be described below with reference to .","As schematically shown in , the structure of the seventh conductive film G is approximately the same as that of the above sixth conductive film F, but different in the following respect.","Thus, for example, in the first thin metal wires , calling a first thin metal wire () having a smallest number of the arcs between the intersections  (a largest length of the arc arrangement period) the number-one first thin metal wire (), the number of the arcs between the intersections  is increased stepwise (the length of the arc arrangement period is reduced stepwise) from the number-one first thin metal wire () to another first thin metal wire arranged in one direction. In the example of , the number-one first thin metal wire () has 1 period of the arcs between the intersections , the number-two first thin metal wire () adjacent to the number-one first thin metal wire () in the one direction has 2 periods of the arcs between the intersections , and the number-three first thin metal wire () adjacent to the number-two first thin metal wire () in the one direction has 3 periods of the arcs between the intersections . The combination of the number-one to number-three first thin metal wires is arranged in the one direction. The first thin metal wire adjacent to the number-one first thin metal wire () in the opposite direction has 3 periods of the arcs between the intersections . Therefore, the first thin metal wire having the largest number of the arcs between the intersections  is adjacent to the first thin metal wire having the smallest number of the arcs between the intersections . The second thin metal wires are arranged in the same manner.","Also, in the seventh conductive film G, the conductive portions  hardly have a straight section, so that diffraction points are not arranged linearly on the intersections  of the conductive portions . In addition, the adjacent parallel thin metal wires  are formed in different wavy line shapes with different periods, whereby the diffraction points are discretely distributed to further reduce the glare or the like caused by interference of diffracted lights.","In this embodiment, the number of the arcs  on the circumference line of one mesh shape M is 2k (k=1, 2, 3, . . . ). Therefore, though the surface resistance lowering effect of the seventh conductive film G is lower than those of the first to sixth conductive films A to F having the number 4k, the seventh conductive film G is capable of improving a heat generation efficiency in a transparent heating element and improving a power generation efficiency in a solar cell.","A conductive film according to an eighth embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the eighth conductive film H) will be described below with reference to .","As schematically shown in , the structure of the eighth conductive film H is approximately the same as that of the above seventh conductive film G, but different in the following respect.","Thus, for example, in the first thin metal wires , a first thin metal wire has a smallest number of the arcs between the intersections  (a largest length of the arc arrangement period), and the adjacent two first thin metal wires has the same number of the arcs. Furthermore, another first thin metal wire has a largest number of the arcs between the intersections  (a smallest length of the arc arrangement period), and the adjacent two first thin metal wires has the same number of the arcs. The second thin metal wires are formed in the same manner.","Also, in the eighth conductive film H, the conductive portions  hardly have a straight section, so that diffraction points are not arranged linearly on the intersections  of the conductive portions . In addition, the adjacent parallel thin metal wires  are formed in different wavy line shapes with different periods, whereby the diffraction points are discretely distributed to further reduce the glare or the like caused by interference of diffracted lights.","In the eighth conductive film H, the number of the arcs  on the circumference line of one mesh shape M is 4k (k=1, 2, 3, . . . ). Therefore, the eighth conductive film H is capable of improving a heat generation efficiency in a transparent heating element and improving a power generation efficiency in a solar cell.","Then, several methods for producing the first to eighth conductive films A to H (hereinafter collectively referred to as the conductive film ) will be described below with reference to .","In the first production method, a photosensitive silver salt layer is formed, exposed, developed, and fixed on the transparent film substrate  to form metallic silver portions. The metallic silver portions and a conductive metal thereon are used for forming the mesh pattern .","Specifically, as shown in , the transparent film substrate  is coated with a photosensitive silver salt layer  containing a mixture of a gelatin  and a silver halide  (e.g., silver bromide particles, silver chlorobromide particles, or silver iodobromide particles). Though the silver halide  is exaggeratingly shown by points in  to facilitate understanding, the points do not represent the size, concentration, etc. of the silver halide .","Then, as shown in , the photosensitive silver salt layer  is subjected to an exposure treatment for forming the mesh pattern . When an optical energy is applied to the silver halide , minute silver nuclei are generated to form an invisible latent image.","As shown in , the photosensitive silver salt layer  is subjected to a development treatment for converting the latent image to an image visible to the naked eye. Specifically, the photosensitive silver salt layer  having the latent image is developed using a developer, which is an alkaline or acidic solution, generally an alkaline solution. In the development treatment, using the latent image silver nuclei as catalyst cores, silver ions from the silver halide particles or the developer are reduced to metallic silver by a reducing agent (a developing agent) in the developer. As a result, the latent image silver nuclei are grown to form a visible silver image (developed silvers ).","The photosensitive silver halide  remains in the photosensitive silver salt layer  after the development treatment. As shown in , the silver halide  is removed by a fixation treatment using a fixer, which is an acidic or alkaline solution, generally an acidic solution.","After the fixation treatment, metallic silver portions  are formed in exposed areas, and light-transmitting portions  containing only the gelatin  are formed in unexposed areas. Thus, the combination of the metallic silver portions  and the light-transmitting portions  is formed on the transparent film substrate .","In a case where silver bromide is used as the silver halide  and a thiosulfate salt is used in the fixation treatment, a reaction represented by the following formula proceeds in the treatment.\n\nAgBr (solid)+2SOions \u2192Ag(SO)(readily-water-soluble complex)\n","Two thiosulfate SOions and one silver ion in the gelatin  (from AgBr) are reacted to generate a silver thiosulfate complex. The silver thiosulfate complex has a high water solubility, and thereby is eluted from the gelatin . As a result, the developed silvers  are fixed and remain as the metallic silver portions .","Thus, the latent image is reacted with the reducing agent to deposit the developed silvers  in the development treatment, and the residual silver halide , not converted to the developed silver , is eluted into water in the fixation treatment. The treatments are described in detail in T. H. James, \u201c4.\u201d, Macmillian Publishing Co., Inc., NY, Chapter 15, pp. 438-442, 1977.","The development treatment is generally carried out using the alkaline solution. Therefore, the alkaline solution used in the development treatment may be mixed into the fixer (generally an acidic solution), whereby the activity of the fixer may be disadvantageously changed in the fixation treatment. Further, the developer may remain on the film after removing the film from the development bath, whereby an undesired development reaction may be accelerated by the developer. Thus, it is preferred that the photosensitive silver salt layer  is neutralized or acidified by a quencher such as an acetic acid solution after the development treatment before the fixation treatment.","As shown in , a conductive metal layer  may be disposed only on the metallic silver portion  by a plating treatment (such as an electroless plating treatment, an electroplating treatment, or a combination thereof), etc. In this case, the mesh pattern  is formed of the metallic silver portions  on the transparent film substrate  and the conductive metal layers  disposed on the metallic silver portions .","The difference between the above mentioned process using the photosensitive silver salt layer  (a silver salt photography technology) and a process using a photoresist (a resist technology) will be described below.","In the resist technology, a photopolymerization initiator absorbs a light in an exposure treatment to initiate a reaction, a photoresist film (a resin) per se undergoes a polymerization reaction to increase or decrease the solubility in a developer, and the resin in an exposed or unexposed area is removed in a development treatment. The developer used in the resist technology may be an alkaline solution free of reducing agents, in which an unreacted resin component can be dissolved. On the other hand, as described above, in the silver salt photography technology according to the present invention, the minute silver nucleus, the so-called latent image, is formed from the silver ion and a photoelectron generated in the silver halide  exposed in the exposure treatment. The latent image silver nucleus is grown to form the visible silver image in the development treatment using the developer, which must contain the reducing agent (the developing agent). Thus, the resist technology and the silver salt photography technology are greatly different in the reactions in the exposure and development treatments.","In the development treatment of the resist technology, the unpolymerized resin portion in the exposed or unexposed area is removed. On the other hand, in the development treatment of the silver salt photography technology, using the latent image as the catalyst core, the reduction reaction is conducted by the reducing agent (the developing agent) contained in the developer, and the developed silver  is grown into a visible size. The gelatin  in the unexposed area is not removed. Thus, the resist technology and the silver salt photography technology are greatly different also in the reactions in the development treatments.","The silver halide  contained in the gelatin  in the unexposed area is eluted in the following fixation treatment, and the gelatin  is not removed.","The main reaction component (the main photosensitive component) is the silver halide in the silver salt photography technology, while it is the photopolymerization initiator in the resist technology. Further, in the development treatment, the binder (the gelatin ) remains in the silver salt photography technology, while it is removed in the resist technology. The resist technology and the silver salt photography technology are greatly different in these points.","A mask, which has a mask pattern corresponding to the mesh pattern  of the conductive portions  with the wavy line shape containing at least one curve between the intersections , may be used in the exposure treatment of the photosensitive silver salt layer .","In another method (the second production method), for example, as shown in , a photoresist film  is formed on a copper foil  disposed on the transparent film substrate , and the photoresist film  is exposed and developed to form a resist pattern . As shown in , the copper foil  exposed from the resist pattern  is etched to form the mesh pattern . In this method, a mask having a mask pattern corresponding to the mesh pattern  may be used in the exposure treatment of the photoresist film .","In the third production method, as shown in , a paste  containing fine metal particles is printed on the transparent film substrate . As shown in , the printed paste  may be plated with a metal, so that a plated metal layer  may be deposited to form the mesh pattern . In the fourth production method, as shown in , the mesh pattern  may be printed on the transparent film substrate  by using a screen or gravure printing plate.","A particularly preferred method of forming a thin conductive metal film using a photographic photosensitive silver halide material for the conductive film  of this embodiment will be mainly described below.","As described above, the conductive film  of this embodiment may be produced as follows. A photosensitive material having the transparent film substrate  and thereon a photosensitive silver halide-containing emulsion layer is exposed and developed, whereby the metallic silver portions  and the light-transmitting portions  are formed in the exposed areas and the unexposed areas respectively. The metallic silver portions  may be subjected to a physical development treatment and\/or a plating treatment to form the conductive metal layer  thereon.","The method for forming the conductive film  of the embodiment includes the following three processes, depending on the photosensitive materials and development treatments.","(1) A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei to a chemical or thermal development, to form the metallic silver portions  on the photosensitive material.","(2) A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing physical development nuclei to a solution physical development, to form the metallic silver portions  on the photosensitive material.","(3) A process comprising subjecting a stack of a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei and an image-receiving sheet having a non-photosensitive layer containing physical development nuclei to a diffusion transfer development, to form the metallic silver portions  on the non-photosensitive image-receiving sheet.","In the process of (1), an integral black-and-white development procedure is used to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting electromagnetic-shielding film or a light-transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. The resulting silver is a chemically or thermally developed silver containing a high-specific surface area filament, and shows a high activity in the following plating or physical development treatment.","In the process of (2), the silver halide particles are melted around the physical development nuclei and deposited on the nuclei in the exposed areas, to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting electromagnetic-shielding film or a light-transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. Also, in this process, an integral black-and-white development procedure is used. Though high activity can be achieved since the silver halide is deposited on the physical development nuclei in the development, the developed silver has a spherical shape with small specific surface.","In the process of (3), the silver halide particles are melted in unexposed areas, and diffused and deposited on the development nuclei of the image-receiving sheet, to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting electromagnetic-shielding film or a light-transmitting conductive film on the sheet. In this process, a so-called separate-type procedure is used, and the image-receiving sheet is peeled off from the photosensitive material.","A negative or reversal development treatment can be used in the processes. In the diffusion transfer development, the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto-positive photosensitive material.","The chemical development, thermal development, solution physical development, and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art, and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin-ichi Kikuchi, \u201c()\u201d, Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., 1955 and C. E. K. Mees, \u201c4.\u201d, Mcmillan, 1977. A liquid treatment is generally used in the present invention, and also a thermal development treatment can be utilized. For example, techniques described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2004-184693, 2004-334077, and 2005-010752, and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004-244080 and 2004-085655 can be used in the present invention.","(Photosensitive Material)","[Transparent Support]","The transparent film substrate  of the photosensitive material used in the production method of the embodiment may be a plastic film, etc.","In this embodiment, it is preferred that the plastic film is a polyethylene terephthalate film or a triacetyl cellulose (TAC) film from the viewpoints of light transmittance, heat resistance, handling, and cost.","In the case of using the conductive film  in a transparent heating element for a window glass, the transparent film substrate  preferably has a high light transmittance. In this case, the total visible light transmittance of the plastic film is preferably 70% to 100%, more preferably 85% to 100%, particularly preferably 90% to 100%. The plastic film may be colored as long as it does not interfere with the advantageous effects of the present invention.","[Protective Layer]","In the photosensitive material, a protective layer may be formed on the emulsion layer to be hereinafter described. The protective layer used in this embodiment contains a binder such as a gelatin or a high-molecular polymer, and is formed on the photosensitive emulsion layer to improve the scratch prevention or mechanical property.","[Emulsion Layer]","The photosensitive material used in the production method of this embodiment preferably has the transparent film substrate  and thereon the emulsion layer containing the silver salt as a light sensor (the silver salt-containing layer). The emulsion layer according to the embodiment may contain a dye, a binder, a solvent, etc. in addition to the silver salt if necessary.","The mass ratio of the dye to the total solid contents in the emulsion layer is preferably 0.01% to 10% by mass, more preferably 0.1% to 5% by mass, in view of the effects such as the irradiation prevention effect and the sensitivity reduction due to the excess addition.","<Silver Salt>","The silver salt used in this embodiment is preferably an inorganic silver salt such as a silver halide. It is particularly preferred that the silver salt is used in the form of particles for the photographic photosensitive silver halide material. The silver halide has an excellent light sensing property.","The silver halide, preferably used in the photographic emulsion of the photographic photosensitive silver halide material, will be described below. In this embodiment, the silver halide is preferably used as a light sensor. Silver halide technologies for photographic silver salt films, photographic papers, print engraving films, emulsion masks for photomasking, and the like may be utilized in this embodiment.","The silver halide may contain a halogen element of chlorine, bromine, iodine, or fluorine, and may contain a combination of the elements. For example, the silver halide preferably contains AgCl, AgBr, or AgI, more preferably contains AgBr or AgCl, as a main component. Also, silver chlorobromide, silver iodochlorobromide, or silver iodobromide is preferably used as the silver halide. The silver halide is further preferably silver chlorobromide, silver bromide, silver iodochlorobromide, or silver iodobromide, most preferably silver chlorobromide or silver iodochlorobromide having a silver chloride content of 50 mol % or more.","The term \u201cthe silver halide contains AgBr (silver bromide) as a main component\u201d means that the mole ratio of bromide ion is 50% or more in the silver halide composition. The silver halide particle containing AgBr as a main component may contain iodide or chloride ion in addition to the bromide ion.","The silver halide emulsion, used as a coating liquid for the emulsion layer in the present invention, may be prepared by a method described in P. Glafkides, \u201c\u201d, Paul Montel, 1967, G. F. Dufin, \u201c\u201d, The Forcal Press, 1966, V. L. Zelikman, et al., \u201c\u201d, The Forcal Press, 1964, etc.","<Binder>","The binder may be used in the emulsion layer to uniformly disperse the silver salt particles and to help the emulsion layer adhere to a support. In the present invention, the binder may contain a water-insoluble or water-soluble polymer, and preferably contains a water-soluble polymer.","Examples of the binders include gelatins, polyvinyl alcohols (PVA), polyvinyl pyrolidones (PVP), polysaccharides such as starches, celluloses and derivatives thereof, polyethylene oxides, polysaccharides, polyvinylamines, chitosans, polylysines, polyacrylic acids, polyalginic acids, polyhyaluronic acids, and carboxycelluloses. The binders show a neutral, anionic, or cationic property depending on the ionicity of a functional group.","<Solvent>","The solvent used for forming the emulsion layer is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include water, organic solvents (e.g. alcohols such as methanol, ketones such as acetone, amides such as formamide, sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide, esters such as ethyl acetate, ethers), ionic liquids, and mixtures thereof. In the present invention, the mass ratio of the solvent to the total of the silver salt, the binder, and the like in the emulsion layer is 30% to 90% by mass, preferably 50% to 80% by mass.","The treatments for forming the conductive film will be described below.","[Exposure]","In this embodiment, though the mesh pattern  may be formed by a printing process, it is formed by the exposure and development treatments, etc. in the case of not using the printing process. A photosensitive material having the transparent film substrate  and the silver salt-containing layer formed thereon or a photosensitive material coated with a photopolymer for photolithography is subjected to the exposure treatment. The photosensitive material may be exposed using an electromagnetic wave. For example, the electromagnetic wave may be a light such as a visible light or an ultraviolet light, or a radiation ray such as an X-ray. The exposure may be carried out using a light source having a wavelength distribution or a specific wavelength.","[Development Treatment]","In this embodiment, the emulsion layer is subjected to a development treatment after the exposure. Common development treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films, photographic papers, print engraving films, emulsion masks for photomasking, and the like may be used in the present invention. A developer for the development treatment is not particularly limited, and may be a PQ developer, an MQ developer, an MAA developer, etc. Examples of commercially available developers usable in the present invention include CN-16, CR-56, CP45X, FD-3, and PAPITOL available from FUJIFILM Corporation, C-41, E-6, RA-4, D-19, and D-72 available from Eastman Kodak Company, and developers contained in kits thereof. The developer may be a lith developer.","In the present invention, the development process may include a fixation treatment for removing the silver salt in the unexposed area to stabilize the material. Common fixation treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films, photographic papers, print engraving films, emulsion masks for photomasking, and the like may be used in the present invention.","In the fixation treatment, the fixation temperature is preferably about 20\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C., more preferably 25\u00b0 C. to 45\u00b0 C.

The photosensitive material may be washed with storage water, thus the water amount may be 0.","The mass ratio of the metallic silver contained in the exposed area after the development to the silver contained in this area before the exposure is preferably 50% or more, more preferably 80% or more by mass. When the mass ratio is 50% or more by mass, a high conductivity can be achieved.","In this embodiment, the tone (gradation) obtained by the development is preferably more than 4.0, though not particularly restrictive. When the tone is more than 4.0 after the development, the conductivity of the conductive metal portion can be increased while maintaining high transmittance of the light-transmitting portion. For example, the tone of 4.0 or more can be achieved by doping with rhodium or iridium ion.","[Physical Development and Plating Treatment]","In this embodiment, to increase the conductivity of the metallic silver portion formed by the exposure and development, conductive metal particles may be deposited thereon by a physical development treatment and\/or a plating treatment. In the present invention, the conductive metal particles may be deposited on the metallic silver portion by only one of the physical development and plating treatments or by the combination of the treatments. The metallic silver portion, subjected to the physical development and\/or the plating treatment in this manner, is referred to as the conductive metal portion.","In this embodiment, the physical development is such a process that metal ions such as silver ions are reduced by a reducing agent, whereby metal particles are deposited on nuclei of a metal or metal compound. Such physical development has been used in the fields of instant B & W film, instant slide film, printing plate production, etc., and the technologies can be used in the present invention.","The physical development may be carried out at the same time as the above development treatment after the exposure, and may be carried out after the development treatment separately.","In this embodiment, the plating treatment may contain electroless plating (such as chemical reduction plating or displacement plating), electrolytic plating, or a combination thereof. Known electroless plating technologies for printed circuit boards, etc. may be used in this embodiment. The electroless plating is preferably electroless copper plating.","[Oxidation Treatment]","In this embodiment, the metallic silver portion formed by the development or the conductive metal portion formed by the physical development treatment and\/or the plating treatment is preferably subjected to an oxidation treatment. For example, by the oxidation treatment, a small amount of a metal deposited on the light-transmitting portion can be removed, so that the transmittance of the light-transmitting portion can be increased to approximately 100%.","[Conductive Metal Portion]","In this embodiment, the line width of the conductive metal portion may be selected within a range of 5 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm (0.2 mm). In the case of using the conductive metal portion for a transparent heating element, the line width is preferably 5 to 50 \u03bcm, more preferably 5 to 30 \u03bcm, most preferably 10 to 25 \u03bcm. The line distance is preferably 50 to 500 \u03bcm, more preferably 200 to 400 \u03bcm, most preferably 250 to 350 \u03bcm. The conductive metal portion may have a part with a line width of more than 20 \u03bcm for the purpose of ground connection, etc.","In this embodiment, the opening ratio of the conductive metal portion is preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or more, most preferably 95% or more, in view of the visible light transmittance. The opening ratio is the ratio of the light-transmitting portions other than the metal portions in the mesh pattern  to the whole. For example, a square lattice mesh having a line width of 15 \u03bcm and a pitch of 300 \u03bcm has an opening ratio of 90%.","[Light-Transmitting Portion]","In this embodiment, the light-transmitting portion is a portion having light transmittance, other than the conductive metal portions in the conductive film . The transmittance of the light-transmitting portion, which is herein a minimum transmittance value in a wavelength region of 380 to 780 nm, obtained neglecting the light absorption and reflection of the transparent film substrate , is 90% or more preferably 95% or more, more preferably 97% or more, further preferably 98% or more, most preferably 99% or more.","In this embodiment, it is preferred that the mesh pattern  has a continuous structure with a length of 3 m or more from the viewpoint of maintaining a high productivity of the conductive film . As the length of the continuous structure of the mesh pattern  is increased, the productivity can be further improved. Thus, in this case, the production loss of a transparent heating element can be reduced. The long roll of the mesh pattern , which contains the conductive portions  formed in the wavy line shape having at least one curve between the intersections , may be printing-exposed by a surface exposure method of irradiating the roll with a uniform light through a patterned mask or a scanning exposure method of irradiating the roll with a laser beam while transporting.","The length of the mesh pattern  is preferably 2000 m or less. When an excessively large number of the mesh shapes M are continuously printed to form the mesh pattern  with a length of more than 2000 m, the roll of the mesh pattern  is disadvantageous in large diameter, heavy weight, and that high pressure is applied to the roll center to cause adhesion or deformation, etc. The length is preferably 3 m or more, more preferably 100 to 1000 m, further preferably 200 to 800 m, most preferably 300 to 500 m.","The thickness of the transparent film substrate  may be selected within a range of 0.01 to 2.0 mm. In view of the above described weight increase, adhesion, deformation, etc. caused on the roll, the thickness of the transparent film substrate  is preferably 200 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 20 to 180 \u03bcm, most preferably 50 to 120 \u03bcm.","In this embodiment, for example, in the first conductive film A shown in , it is preferred that an imaginary line connecting the intersections  of the first thin metal wire is parallel to the adjacent imaginary line within an error of plus or minus 2\u00b0.","The scanning with the optical beam is preferably carried out using light sources arranged on a line in a direction substantially perpendicular to the transporting direction, or using a rotary polygon mirror. In this case, the optical beam has to undergo binary or more intensity modulation, and dots are continuously formed into a line pattern. Because each fine wire comprises continuous dots, a fine 1-dot wire has a steplike shape. The width of each fine wire is a length in the narrowest part.","In this embodiment, the mesh pattern  is tilted preferably at 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, more preferably at 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0, most preferably at 43\u00b0 to 47\u00b0, against the transporting direction. In general, it is difficult to prepare a mask for forming a mesh pattern tilted at about 45\u00b0 against the frame, and this is likely to result in uneven pattern or increased cost. In contrast, in the above method according to the present invention, the pattern unevenness is reduced at the tilt angle of around 45\u00b0. Thus, the method of the present invention is more effective as compared with patterning methods using masking exposure photolithography or screen printing.","[Conductive Film]","In the conductive film  of this embodiment, the thickness of the transparent film substrate  may be selected within a range of 0.01 to 2.0 mm as described above. The thickness is preferably 5 to 350 \u03bcm, more preferably 30 to 150 \u03bcm. When the thickness is 5 to 350 \u03bcm, a desired visible light transmittance can be obtained, and the film can be easily handled.","The thickness of the metallic silver portion  formed on the support before the physical development treatment and\/or the plating treatment may be appropriately selected by controlling the thickness of the coating liquid for the silver salt-containing layer applied to the transparent film substrate . The thickness of the metallic silver portion  may be selected within a range of 0.001 to 0.2 mm, and is preferably 30 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, further preferably 0.01 to 9 \u03bcm, most preferably 0.05 to 5 \u03bcm. The metallic silver portion  is preferably formed in a patterned shape. The metallic silver portion  may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers. In a case where the metallic silver portion  has a patterned multilayer structure containing two or more layers, the layers may have different wavelength color sensitivities. In this case, different patterns can be formed in the layers by using exposure lights with different wavelengths.","In the case of using the conductive film  in a transparent heating element, the conductive metal portion preferably has a smaller thickness. As the thickness is reduced, the viewing angle of a window glass using the element is increased, and the heating efficiency is improved. Thus, the thickness of the conductive metal layer  on the conductive metal portion is preferably less than 9 \u03bcm, more preferably 0.1 \u03bcm or more but less than 5 \u03bcm, further preferably 0.1 \u03bcm or more but less than 3 \u03bcm.","In this embodiment, the thickness of the metallic silver portion  can be controlled by changing the coating thickness of the silver salt-containing layer, and the thickness of the conductive metal particle layer can be controlled in the physical development and\/or the plating treatment, whereby the conductive film  having a thickness of less than 5 \u03bcm (preferably less than 3 \u03bcm) can be easily produced.","In conventional etching methods, most of a thin metal film must be removed and discarded by etching. In contrast, in this embodiment, the pattern containing only a minimum amount of the conductive metal can be formed on the transparent film substrate . Thus, only the minimal amount of the metal is required, so that production costs and metal waste amount can be reduced.","<Adhesive Layer>","The conductive film  of the embodiment may be bonded to a window glass, etc. by an adhesive layer. It is preferred that the refractive index difference between the transparent substrate such as the plastic film and an adhesive used in the adhesive layer is reduced to prevent lowering of the visible light transmittance. Thus, the adhesive preferably has a refractive index of 1.40 to 1.70 to prevent the lowering of the visible light transmittance.","The present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to Examples. Materials, amounts, ratios, treatment contents, treatment procedures, and the like, used in Examples, may be appropriately changed without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following specific examples are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.","(Photosensitive Silver Halide Material)","An emulsion containing an aqueous medium, a gelatin, and silver iodobromochloride particles was prepared. The silver iodobromochloride particles had an I content of 0.2 mol %, a Br content of 40 moil, and an average spherical equivalent diameter of 0.1 \u03bcm, and the amount of the gelatin was 10.0 g per 60 g of Ag.","KRhBrand KIrClwere added to the emulsion at a concentration of 10mol\/mol-silver to dope the silver bromide particles with Rh and Ir ions. NaPdClwas further added to the emulsion, and the resultant emulsion was subjected to gold-sulfur sensitization using chlorauric acid and sodium thiosulfate. The emulsion and a gelatin hardening agent were applied to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) such that the amount of the applied silver was 1 g\/m. The Ag\/gelatin volume ratio was 1\/2.","The PET support had a width of 30 cm, and the emulsion was applied thereto into a width of 25 cm and a length of 20 m. The both end portions having a width of 3 cm of the PET support were cut off to obtain a roll photosensitive silver halide material having a width of 24 cm.","(Exposure)","The photosensitive silver halide material was exposed by using a continuous exposure apparatus. In the apparatus, exposure heads using a DMD (a digital mirror device) described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-001244 were arranged into a width of 25 cm. The exposure heads and exposure stages were arranged on a curved line to concentrate laser lights onto the photosensitive layer of the photosensitive material. Further, in the apparatus, a feeding mechanism and a winding mechanism for the photosensitive material were disposed, and a buffering bend was formed such that the speed in the exposure part was not affected by change of the exposure surface tension, and feeding and winding speeds. The light for the exposure had a wavelength of 400 nm and a beam shape of approximately 12-\u03bcm square, and the output of the laser light source was 100 \u03bcJ.","The photosensitive material was exposed continuously in a pattern shown in Table 1 with a width of 24 cm and a length of 10 m. The exposure was carried out under the following conditions to print a mesh pattern .","The mesh pattern  was formed on the photosensitive layer by an exposure method using two exposure heads in combination.","By using the first exposure head, the photosensitive layer is irradiated with a constant laser beam while reciprocating the beam in the direction perpendicular to the direction of transporting the layer, to draw an exposure pattern (for forming first thin metal wires ) on the layer. Thus, the pattern is drawn by the beam at a tilt angle of 45\u00b0 in accordance with the ratio of the photosensitive layer transporting speed and the head reciprocating speed in the perpendicular direction. After the beam reaches an end of the photosensitive layer, the pattern is drawn at the reversed angle depending on the reciprocal motion of the head.","By using the second exposure head, in the same manner as in the first exposure head, the photosensitive layer is irradiated with a constant laser beam while reciprocating the beam in the direction perpendicular to the direction of transporting the layer, to draw an exposure pattern (for forming second thin metal wires ) on the layer. The motion start point of the second exposure head is different from that of the first exposure head by 180 degrees or a multiple of 180 degrees. Thus, when the first exposure head is moved obliquely from one end of the photosensitive layer, the second exposure head is moved obliquely from the other end in the opposite direction, so that the mesh pattern  is formed.","Specifically, in Examples 1 to 4, an exposure pattern for forming the first thin metal wires shown in  was drawn. In Examples 5 to 8, an exposure pattern for forming the first thin metal wires shown in  was drawn. The wavy line shapes of the wires had arcs  with a central angle of 90\u00b0.","For comparison, in Comparative Example 1, wavy line shapes having period and amplitude equal to those of Example 1 were formed using a Bezier curve (drawn by Adobe Illustrator). In Comparative Example 2, straight lines having line width and pitch equal to those of Example 1 were formed.","The length of 1 period of the wavy line shape in the mesh pattern , the first pitch L (the pitch of the first thin metal wire ), the second pitch L (the pitch of the second thin metal wire ), and the line width h of the conductive portion  of each of Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0218","num":"0220"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"(Development treatment)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Formulation of 1 L of developer"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Hydroquinone","20","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Sodium sulfite","50","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Potassium carbonate","40","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","2","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Potassium bromide","3","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Polyethylene glycol 2000","1","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Potassium hydroxide","4","g"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"pH","Controlled at 10.3"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Formulation of 1 L of fixer"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Ammonium thiosulfate solution (75%)","300","ml"]},{"entry":[{},"Ammonium sulfite monohydrate","25","g"]},{"entry":[{},"1,3-Diaminopropanetetraacetic acid","8","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Acetic acid","5","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Aqueous ammonia (27%)","1","g"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"pH","Controlled at 6.2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The exposed photosensitive material was treated with the above treatment agents under the following conditions using an automatic processor FG-710PTS manufactured by FUJIFILM Corporation.
