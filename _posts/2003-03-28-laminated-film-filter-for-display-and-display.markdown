The disclosure particularly relates to a highly transparent multilayer film with high scratch resistance and a display filter.","In screens of displays such as televisions and computer monitors, there is a problem in that displayed images are illegible because light emitted from external light sources such as the sun and fluorescent tubes is reflected on the screen surfaces. In order to solve this problem, the following techniques have been proposed as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 12-329905 and 13-264508: a technique for irregularly reflecting external light on an irregular surface and a technique for preventing light reflection using a structure including thin-films with low refractive index and thin-films with high refractive index, those thin-films being alternately stacked.","However, the technique for irregularly reflecting external light has another problem in that an image on a display appears blurred. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 4-355401, 11-92750, and 11-174971 disclose techniques for providing fluorine compounds having low refractive index on surface layers. Since the fluorine compounds have low surface hardness and therefore have no scratch resistance, those techniques have a problem in that the surface layers are damaged during the assembling of displays or during the cleaning of surfaces and images therefore appear blurred.","It could therefore be advantageous to provide a multilayer film that has high scratch resistance enhanced by increasing the surface hardness of a low-refractive index layer, low reflectance, and high transparency and is useful in preventing reflection. It could also be advantageous to provide a method for manufacturing the film.","Our multilayer film principally has the configuration below. The multilayer film includes a substrate film (a), a hard coat layer (b) containing a (meth)acrylate compound, an electrically conductive layer (c) containing electrically conductive particles, and a resin layer (d) containing a fluorine compound, those layers being disposed on at least one face of the substrate film (a). The resin layer (d) has fine irregularities on the surface and an arithmetic average surface roughness Ra ranging from 0.003 to 0.025 \u03bcm and the surface of the resin layer (d) of the multilayer film has a reflectance of less than 2%.","A display film principally has the configuration below. The display film includes the multilayer film, a sticky or adhesive layer placed on a face of the multilayer film that is opposite to the resin layer (d), and a protective film joined to the sticky or adhesive layer.","A display filter principally has the configuration below. The display filter includes the multilayer film joined to the front face of a display with the sticky or adhesive layer placed therebetween.","A front protector panel for plasma display panels principally has the configuration below. The plasma display panel front protector panel includes the multilayer film joined to the front face of a front panel for plasma display panels with the sticky or adhesive layer placed therebetween.","Reference numeral  represents the multilayer film, reference numeral  represents a substrate film, reference numeral  represents a hard coat layer, reference numeral  represents an electrically conductive layer, reference numeral  represents a resin layer, reference numeral  represents an electrically conductive particles, reference numeral  represents a fine silica particles, reference numeral  represents a front protector panel for plasma display panels, reference numeral  represents a glass sheet with an electromagnetic wave-shielding function, and reference numeral  represents a sticky layer.","A multilayer film includes a substrate film (a), a hard coat layer (b) containing a (meth)acrylate compound, an electrically conductive layer (c) containing electrically conductive particles, and a resin layer (d) containing a fluorine compound, those layers being disposed on at least one face of the substrate film (a).","In the multilayer film, the following conditions and configurations are preferable: (1) the resin layer (d) has irregularities on the surface and an arithmetic average surface roughness Ra ranging from 0.003 to 0.025 \u03bcm and the surface of the resin layer (d) of the multilayer film has a reflectance of less than 2%; (2) the multilayer film has a haze of less than 3%; (3) the substrate film (a) contains a polymer containing one selected from the group consisting of an ester, an olefin, an acetate, styrene, a carbonate, a sulfone, ether ethyl ketone, an imide, fluorine, a nylon, an acrylate, and an aliphatic olefin; (4) the substrate film (a) contains a polymer containing one selected from the group consisting of the ester, the acetate, and the acrylate; (5) the electrically conductive layer (c) has a thickness of 0.01 to 1.0 \u03bcm; (6) the electrically conductive layer (c) has a conductive particle content of 70% to 90% by weight; (7) the resin layer (d) contains a composition containing fine silica particles with a particle size of 0.001 to 0.2 \u03bcm; (8) the fine silica particles contain a composition having two or more particle size distributions; (9) the resin layer (d) contains a composition that contains a silane coupling agent represented by the formula R(1)R(2SiX, a hydrolysate of the agent, or a product obtained by subjecting the agent to reaction, wherein R(1) and R(2) independently represent a hydrocarbon group having an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an allyl group, a halogen group, an epoxy group, an amino group, a mercapto group, a methacryloxy group, or a cyano group, X represents a hydrolyzable substituent selected from the group consisting of an alkoxyl group, an alkoxyalkoxy group, a halogen group, and an acyloxy group, a and b are independently equal to zero, one, or two, and the sum of a and b is equal to one, two, or three; (10) the fluorine compound contained in the resin layer (d) contains a composition having an alkoxysilyl group; (11) a display film includes the multilayer film described above; (12) a display includes the display film; (13) a display filter includes the multilayer film; (14) a front protector panel for plasma display panels includes the multilayer film; and (15) a plasma display includes the front protector panel for plasma display panels. According to those conditions and conditions, advantages can be achieved.","We will now further describe selected aspects in detail.","When the substrate film (a) is used as a component (hereinafter referred to as a display component) of a display unit, the substrate film (a) preferably has high transmittance and low haze. For example, the transmittance is preferably 40% or more and more preferably 60% or more at a wavelength of 400 to 800 \u03bcm, and the haze is preferably 5% or less and more preferably 3% or less. If such a display component does not satisfy one or both of those conditions, a sharp image cannot be achieved. In order to achieve an advantage, the upper limit of the transmittance is about 99.5% and the lower limit of the haze is about 0.1%, in a feasible range.","A resin material for forming the substrate film (a) is not particularly limited and may be one selected from resin materials for manufacturing known plastic substrate films. Examples of the resin material for forming the substrate film (a) include a polymer and copolymer containing one selected from the group consisting of an ester, ethylene, propylene, a diacetate, a triacetate, styrene, a carbonate, methylpentene, a sulfone, ether ethyl ketone, an imide, fluorine, a nylon, an acrylate, and an aliphatic olefin.","The following polymer or copolymer is preferable among those resins: a polymer or copolymer containing one selected from the group consisting of a polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate, an acetate cellulose such as triacetyl cellulose, and an acrylate polymer such as polymethylmethacrylate. This is because the polymer or copolymer has high transparency and strength and a uniform thickness can be achieved. In particular, the substrate film (a) preferably contains a polymer containing such an ester in view of transparency, haze, and mechanical properties.","Examples of a polyester resin include polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, and polyethylene-\u03b1,\u03b2-bis(2-chlorophenoxy)ethane-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylate. Those polyesters may contain 20% or less of another dicarboxylic acid unit and\/or diol unit incorporated by copolymerization on a mole basis. Polyethylene terephthalate is particularly preferable in comprehensive consideration of quality and cost.","Those resin components may be used alone or in combination.","The thickness of the substrate film (a) is not particularly limited and the substrate film (a) usually has a thickness of five to 800 \u03bcm and preferably ten to 250 \u03bcm in view of transparency, haze, and mechanical properties. The substrate film (a) may include two or more films laminated to each other by a known method.","Before the hard coat layer (b) is provided on the substrate film (a), the substrate film (a) may be surface-treated by any one of various treating methods (for example, corona discharge treatment, glow discharge treatment, flame treatment, etching treatment, and surface roughening treatment). In order to enhance the adhesion, the following coating functioning as an undercoat may be provided on a surface of the substrate film (a): for example, a polyurethane coating, a polyester coating, a polyester acrylate coating, a polyurethane acrylate coating, a polyepoxy acrylate coating, or a coating containing a titanate compound. The hard coat layer (b) may be then provided on the coating. When the substrate film (a) is coated with a composition containing a cross-linking agent and a copolymer prepared by the graft-polymerization of an acrylic compound and a polyester resin having a hydrophilic group, the resulting substrate film (a) has high adhesion and endurance properties such as heat resistance and water resistance; hence, such a composition is particularly preferable for the substrate film (a).","It is essential that the hard coat layer (b) be placed on the substrate film (a) and contain a (meth)acrylate. The (meth)acrylate is radically polymerized by the application of activating light and a layer containing the (meth)acrylate has high solvent resistance and hardness. Examples of the (meth)acrylate include monofunctional acrylates such as methyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, polyester (meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, and hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate. Furthermore, examples of the (meth)acrylate include a multifunctional (meth)acrylate having two or more (meth)acryloyl groups, and such a (meth)acrylate is particularly preferable because high solvent resistance is achieved. Examples of the multifunctional (meth)acrylate include pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol penta(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate, and trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate. Those monomers may be used alone or in combination.","In order to enhance the hardness of the hard coat layer (b), the resin component for forming the hard coat layer (b) of the present invention may further contain inorganic particles containing alkyl silicate, a hydrolysate of alkyl silicate, colloidal silica, dry-process silica, wet-process silica, or titanium oxide; fine colloidal silica particles; or other particles.","The thickness of the hard coat layer (b) is appropriately determined depending on uses and the hard coat layer (b) usually has a thickness of one to 50 \u03bcm and preferably two to 30 \u03bcm. When the thickness of the hard coat layer (b) is less than two \u03bcm, the surface hardness is insufficient and the hard coat layer (b) is therefore readily damaged; hence, such a thickness is not preferable. In contrast, when the thickness of the hard coat layer (b) is more than 50 \u03bcm, the hard coat layer (b) has low transparency and high haze, is brittle after it is cured, and is apt to crack when the film is bent; hence, such a thickness is not preferable.","It is essential that the electrically conductive layer (c) be placed on the hard coat layer (b) and contain electrically conductive particles (B) and a binder component (A).","Examples of the electrically conductive particles used herein include fine metal particles and fine metal oxide particles. The fine metal oxide particles are particularly preferable because of the high transparency. Preferable examples of the fine metal oxide particles include antimony tin oxide (ATO) particles, antimony zinc oxide particles, indium tin oxide (ITO) particles, zinc oxide-aluminum oxide particles, and antimony oxide particles. The indium tin oxide (ITO) particles and the antimony tin oxide (ATO) particles are particularly preferable.","The particles having electrical conductivity preferably have an average primary particle size of 0.5 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 0.001 to 0.3 \u03bcm, and further more preferably 0.005 to 0.2 \u03bcm, the average primary particle size being defined as the spherical size determined by the BET method. When the average particle size is above the range described above, a coating (the electrically conductive layer (c)) has low transparency. When the average particle size is below the above range, the particles are apt to aggregate; hence, the formed coating (the electrically conductive layer (c)) has high haze. Therefore, when the average particle size is outside the above range, a desired haze cannot be substantially achieved.","The binder component (A) contained in the electrically conductive layer (c) contains a (meth)acrylate. The (meth)acrylate is preferable in that the (meth)acrylate is radically polymerized by the application of activating light and a layer containing the (meth)acrylate has high solvent resistance and hardness. Furthermore, a multifunctional (meth)acrylate having two or more (meth)acryloyl groups is particularly preferable in the present invention because the solvent resistance is high. Examples of the multifunctional (meth)acrylate include trifunctional (meth)acrylates such as pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, glycerol tri(meth)acrylate, ethylene-modified trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, and tris(2-hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate tri(meth)acrylate; tetrafunctional (meth)acrylates such as pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol penta(meth)acrylate, and dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate; and other (meth)acrylates.","In order to enhance particle dispersion, the binder component (A) contained in the electrically conductive layer (c) may contain a (meth)acrylate with an acidic functional group such as a carboxyl group, a phosphoric group, or a sulfonic group. Examples of a monomer with such an acidic functional group include unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl succinic acid, and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phthalic acid; (meth)acrylate phosphates such as mono(2-(meth)acryloyl oxyethyl) acid phosphate and diphenyl-2-(meth)acryloyl oxyethyl phosphate; and 2-sulfoester (meth)acrylate. Furthermore, other (meth)acrylates having a polar bond such as an amide bond, a urethane bond, or an ether bond may be used. A resin, such as a urethane (meth)acrylate oligomer, having a urethane bond is particularly preferable because such a resin has high polarity and is advantageous in enhancing particle dispersion.","To cure the binder component used to form the hard coat layer (b) and electrically conductive layer (c), an initiator may be used. The initiator is used to initiate or promote the radical, anionic, or cationic polymerization and\/or cross-linking reaction of the binder component and various well-known photopolymerization initiators can be used. Examples of the initiator include sulfides such as sodium methyldithiocarbamate sulfide, diphenyl monosulfide, dibenzothiazolyl monosulfide, and dibenzothiazolyl disulfide; thioxanthones such as thioxanthone, 2-ethylthioxanthone, 2-chlorothioxanthone, and 2,4-diethylthioxanthone; azo compounds such as hydrazone and azobisisobutyronitrile; diazo compounds such as benzene diazonium; aromatic carbonyl compounds such as benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzophenone, dimethylamino benzophenone, Michler's ketone, benzylanthraquinone, t-butylanthraquinone, 2-methylanthraquinone, 2-ethylanthraquinone, 2-aminoanthraquinone, and 2-chloroanthraquinone; dialkylaminobenzoates such as methyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate, ethyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate, butyl D-dimethylaminobenzoate, and isopropyl p-diethylaminobenzoate; peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide; acridines such as 9-phenylacridine, 9-p-methoxyphenyl acridine, 9-acetylaminoacridine, benzacridine; phenazines such as 9,10-dimethyl banzophenazine, 9-methyl banzophenazine, 10-methoxy banzophenazine; quinoxalines such as 6,4\u2032,4\u2033-trimethoxy-2,3-diphenyl quinoxaline; a 2,4,5-trihenylimidazolyl dimer; 2-nitrofluorene; 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate; 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,- 3,5 -triazine; 3,3\u2032-carbonylbiscoumarin; thio Michler's ketone; 2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl diphenyl phosphine oxide; oligo (2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-(4-(1-methylvinyl)phenyl) propanone); and 2-benzyl-2-dimethylamino-1-(4-morpholinophenyl) butanone.","To prevent the sensitivity of the initiator from being decreased due to oxygen inhibition, an amine compound may be used together with the photopolymerization initiator when the hard coat layer (b) and the electrically conductive layer (c) are formed. The amine compound is not particularly limited and any aliphatic compound and any aromatic amine compound that are non-volatile can be used. For example, triethanolamine and methyl diethanolamine are preferable.","For the composition of the electrically conductive layer (c), the ratio ((A)\/(B)) of the binder component (A) to the particles (B) ranges from 10:90 to 30:70 and preferably 15:85 to 25:75 on a weight basis. When the amount of the particles (B) is below the range, an obtained layer has low electrical conductivity although the layer has high transparency. In contrast, when the amount thereof is above the range, the layer has unsatisfactory physical and\/or chemical properties, which is not preferable. The amount of the photopolymerization initiator is usually 0.1 to 20 parts and preferably 1.0 to 15.0 parts with respect to 100 parts of the binder component (A) on a weight basis. When the amount of the initiator is less than 0.1 parts by weight, the rate of the photopolymerization is low; hence, light must be applied to the layer for a long time in order to achieve a satisfactory hardness and scratch resistance and the layer cannot be sufficiently cured in some cases. In contrast, when the amount thereof is more than 20 parts by weight, the layer has low electrical conductivity, abrasion resistance, weather resistance, and other properties.","Essential components of the electrically conductive layer (c) include the binder component (A), the particles (B), and the photopolymerization initiator as described above. The electrically conductive layer (c) may further contain various additives such as a polymerization inhibitor, a curing catalyst, an oxidation inhibitor, a dispersing agent, a leveling agent, and a silane coupling agent according to needs.","To enhance the electrical conductivity, the electrically . conductive layer (c) may further contain an electrically conductive polymer such as polypyrrol or polyaniline and\/or a metal organic compound such as metal alcoholate or a chelate compound. In order to enhance the surface hardness, the electrically conductive layer (c) may further contain inorganic particles containing alkyl silicate, a hydrolysate of alkyl silicate, colloidal silica, dry-process silica, wet-process silica, or titanium oxide; fine colloidal silica particles; or other particles.","In order to allow the electrically conductive layer (c) of the present invention to exert desired antistatic properties, the electrically conductive layer (c) preferably has a surface resistivity of 1\u00d710ohm per square or less and more preferably 1\u00d710ohm per square or less.","The electrically conductive layer (c) of the present invention preferably has a transmittance of 40% or more and more preferably 60% or more in view of sharpness and transparency.","It is essential that the resin layer (d) be placed on the electrically conductive layer (c) and contain a fluorine compound. The fluorine compound used in the present invention is preferably cross-linked with heat or ionizing radiation. Examples of the cross-linkable fluorine compound include a fluorine-containing monomer with an unsaturated group, a fluorine polymer with a cross-linkable group, and a fluorine-containing copolymer containing a fluorine-containing monomer and a monomer for forming such a cross-linkable group.","In particular, a fluorine-containing copolymer having a vinyl ether in principal chain is preferable. The fluorine-containing copolymer preferably has a fluorine-containing olefin chain that has a fluorine content of 30% by weight or more and a number-average molecular weight of 500 or more and more preferably 5,000 or more in terms of polystyrene.","The fluorine-containing copolymer is prepared by subjecting a curable composition containing a fluorine-containing compound and a vinyl ether-containing compound to polymerization. In particular, the fluorine-containing copolymer can be prepared by subjecting a fluorine-containing olefin compound or the following composition to polymerization: a curable composition containing the fluorine-containing olefin compound and a vinyl ether-containing compound and further containing a reactive emulsifier according to needs.","The curable composition for forming the fluorine-containing copolymer preferably contains such a reactive emulsifier. When the reactive emulsifier is used, a coating solution containing the fluorine-containing copolymer has good coating and leveling properties. Preferable examples of the reactive emulsifier include a nonionic reactive emulsifier in particular.","The fluorine-containing copolymer contained in the resin layer (d) contains 20% to 70% of a repeating unit derived from the fluorine-containing olefin compound, preferably 25% to 65%, and more preferably 30% to 60% on a mole basis. When the content of the repeating unit derived therefrom is less than 20%, the fluorine-containing copolymer has low fluorine content and the resin layer (d) cannot therefore have sufficiently low refractive index. In contrast, when the content of the repeating unit is more than 70%, the following problems arise: the coating solution is not uniform and a uniform coating cannot therefore be formed and furthermore, the coating solution has low transparency and adhesion to a substrate.","The fluorine-containing copolymer contains 10% to 70% of a repeating unit derived from the vinyl ether-containing compound, preferably 15% to 65%, and more preferably 30% to 60% on a mole basis. When the content of the repeating unit derived therefrom is less than 10%, the coating solution has low uniformity and a uniform coating cannot therefore be formed. In contrast, when the content of the repeating unit is more than 70%, the resin layer (d) has inferior optical properties, that is, low transparency and high reflectance, which is not preferable.","Preferable examples of the vinyl ether-containing compound include a monomer with a reactive functional group such as a hydroxyl group or an epoxy group. A coating solution containing a curable resin composition prepared using such a monomer is useful in forming a cured layer with high strength. The content of the monomer with such a hydroxyl or epoxy group in total monomers ranges from 0% to 20%, preferably 1% to 20%, more preferably 3% to 15% on a mole basis. When the content is more than 20% by mole, the resin layer (d) has inferior optical properties and a cured layer is brittle.","In the fluorine-containing copolymer containing the reactive emulsifier, the content of a repeating unit derived from the reactive emulsifier is usually 0% to 10% and preferably 0.1% to 5% on a mole basis. When'the content is more than 10% by mole, the resin layer (d) is sticky and therefore hard to handle and a coating agent has low moisture resistance, which is not preferable.","The resin layer (d) preferably further contains a cross-linkable compound in addition to the fluorine-containing copolymer. Such a cross-linkable compound is useful in achieving desired curing properties and\/or useful in enhancing curing properties.","Examples of the cross-linkable compound include various amino compounds; various hydroxyl group-containing compounds such as pentaerythritol, polyphenols, glycols, alkyl silicates, and hydrolysates of such alkyl silicates; and other compounds. An amino compound suitable for the cross-linkable compound has two or more amino groups, such as a hydroxyalkylamino group and\/or an alkoxyalkylamino group, reactable with a hydroxyl or epoxy group contained in the fluorine compound. Examples of the amino compound include a melamine compound, a urea compound, a benzoguanamine compound, and a glycol lauryl compound. The melamine compound is widely known as a compound having a triazine ring and a nitrogen atom bonded thereto. Examples of the melamine compound include melamine, alkylated melamine, methylol melamine, and alkoxylated methylmelamine. A melamine compound that has a methylol group and an alkoxymethyl group or has at least two methylol groups and\/or alkoxymethyl groups is preferable. In particular, methylol melamine prepared by allowing melamine to react with formic aldehyde under basic conditions, alkoxylated melamine, and derivatives thereof are preferable. Alkoxylated melamine is particularly preferable because a cured resin composition has good storage stability and high reactivity. Methylol melamine and alkoxylated melamine suitable for the cross-linkable compound are not particularly limited and any resin material prepared by a method disclosed in the following document can be used: \u201cPurasutikku Zairyou Kouza [8] Yuria-Meramin Jusi\u201d published by The Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Ltd. Examples of the urea compound include urea, polymethylol urea, alkoxylated methylurea that is a derivative of polymethylol urea, methylol uron having a uron ring, and alkoxylated methyluron. For those urea derivatives, resin materials disclosed in the above document can be used.","The amount of the cross-linkable compound is 70 parts or less, preferably three to 50 parts, and more preferably five to 30 parts with respect to 100 parts of the fluorine-containing copolymer on a weight basis. When the amount of the cross-linkable compound is less than three parts by weight, a thin-film formed by a coating process and then cured has low durability in some cases. In contrast, when the amount is more than 70 parts by weight, the fluorine-containing copolymer cannot be substantially prevented from forming a gel and a cured layer cannot have low refractive index and is brittle in some cases.","In order to enhance the scratch resistance, the resin layer (d) preferably contains fine silica particles, a silane coupling agent, and\/or a fluorine resin with an alkoxysilyl group.","The fine silica particles preferably contain dry-process silica, wet-process silica, or colloidal silica, which is particularly preferable.","The fine silica particles usually have an average primary particle size of 0.001 to 0.2 \u03bcm and preferably 0.005 to 0.15 \u03bcm, the average primary particle size being defined as the spherical size determined by the BET method. When the average particle size is within the preferable range, a formed coating (the resin layer (d)) does not have low transparency and surface hardness. The fine silica particles preferably have a spherical shape or a bead shape.","The fine silica particles may be a mixture of two or more species of particles having different average particle sizes.","The fine silica particles may be surface-treated. Examples of a surface-treating process include a physical surface-treating process such as plasma discharge treatment and corona discharge treatment and a chemical surface-treating process in which a coupling agent is used. The chemical surface-treating process is preferably used. A silane coupling agent is particularly suitable for the coupling agent used in the chemical surface-treating process.","The content of a component derived from the fine silica particles is preferably 5% to 50%, more preferably 5% to 40%, and further more preferably 5% to 30% in terms of solid content. When the content of the component derived therefrom is within the preferable range, the resin layer (d) has sufficient surface hardness and satisfactory optical properties, that is, high transparency and low reflectance.","The silane coupling agent contains a compound represented by the formula R(1)R(2)SiXor a hydrolysate of such a compound, wherein R(1)and R(2)independently represent a hydrocarbon group having an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an allyl group, a halogen group, an epoxy group, an amino group, a mercapto group, a methacryloxy group, or a cyano group; X represents a hydrolyzable substituent selected from the group consisting of an alkoxyl group, an alkoxyalkoxy group, a halogen group, and an acyloxy group; a and b are independently equal to zero, one, or two; and the sum of a and b is equal to one, two, or three.","The content of a component derived from the silane coupling agent is preferably 5% to 70%, more preferably 15% to 65%, and further more preferably 20% to 60% in terms of solid content. When the content of the component derived therefrom is within the preferable range, the resin layer (d) has sufficient surface hardness and satisfactory optical properties, that is, high transparency and low reflectance.","The fluorine resin with an alkoxysilyl group contains a compound represented by the formula R(3)R(4)SiXor a hydrolysate of such a compound, wherein R(3)and R(4)independently represent a hydrocarbon group having a fluorine-substituted alkyl group, alkenyl group, allyl group, methacryloxy group, or (meth)acryloyl group; X represents a hydrolyzable substituent selected from the group consisting of an alkoxyl group, an alkoxyalkoxy group, a halogen group, and an acyloxy group; c and d are independently equal to zero, one, two, or three; and the sum of a and b is equal to one, two, or three.","The content of a component derived from the fluorine resin with the alkoxysilyl group is preferably 20% to 90%, more preferably 25% to 80%, and further more preferably 30% to 70% in terms of solid content. When the content of the component derived therefrom is within the preferable range, the resin layer (d) has sufficient surface hardness and satisfactory optical properties, that is, high transparency and low reflectance.","A curing agent may be used to cure the coating solution for forming the resin layer (d). The curing agent preferably promotes the polycondensation of the silane coupling agent. Examples of the curing agent include acids. A Lewis acid is particularly preferable among the acids. Examples of the Lewis acid include metal chelates and metal alkoxides such as acetoacetoxy aluminum. The amount of the curing agent may be arbitrarily determined and usually 0.1 to 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of, for example, the silane coupling agent.","Various additives such as a polymerization inhibitor, an oxidation inhibitor, a dispersing agent, and a leveling agent may be used according to needs when the resin layer (d) is formed.","To allow the multilayer film to be highly transparent, the haze must be less than 3% and preferably less than 2.7%. When the haze is 3% or more, the transparency is unsatisfactory.","To allow the surface of the resin layer (d) to have high scratch resistance, the resin layer (d) must have fine irregularities on the surface. The relationship between the scratch resistance and the surface roughness due to the irregularities is presumed to be based on the mechanism below. When the irregular surface is scratched with steel wool or the like, portions of the steel wool are in contact only with the tips of protrusions of the irregular surface. Therefore, the total area of regions at which the steel wool portions are in contact with the irregular surface is extremely small; hence, the scratch resistance is high.","The arithmetic average surface roughness Ra of the resin layer (d) having the irregularities must be within a range of 0.003 to 0.025 \u03bcm. The arithmetic average surface roughness Ra preferably ranges from 0.004 to 0.022 \u03bcm and more preferably 0.004 to 0.020 \u03bcm. When the arithmetic average surface roughness Ra is above the range, the resin layer (d) has high haze, that is, the transparency thereof is low. In contrast, when the arithmetic average surface roughness Ra is below the range, the scratch resistance is low.","To form the irregularities on the surface of the resin layer (d), the following particles are preferably used: inorganic particles containing colloidal silica, dry-process silica, wet-process silica, titanium oxide, glass beads, aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, or the like; fine colloidal silica particles; or other particles.

That is, the value of the following ratio is preferably less than 1.0 and more preferably 0.6 to 0.95: the ratio of the refractive index of the resin layer (d) to that of the electrically conductive layer (c). The resin layer (d) preferably has a refractive index of 1.47 or less and more preferably 1.35 to 1.45. Resin with a refractive index of less than 1.35 cannot be substantially prepared by a current method. When the refractive index is more than 1.47, the reflectance is extremely high.","A method for manufacturing the multilayer film will now be described.","The multilayer film can be manufactured by providing the hard coat layer (b) containing the (meth)acrylate compound, the electrically conductive layer (c) containing the electrically conductive particles, and the resin layer (d) containing the fluorine compound on at least one face of the substrate film (a).","The electrically conductive layer (c) can be formed according to the following procedure: a coating solution containing components, which dispersed in solvent, for forming the electrically conductive layer (c) is prepared and then applied onto the substrate film (a), and the obtained coating is dried and then cured. The resin layer (d) can be formed according to the same procedure as the above.","The solvent used to form the electrically conductive layer (c) is necessary to facilitate the applying operation or printing operation of the composition and necessary to enhance the particle dispersion.

The content thereof is usually determined such that the content of solids in the composition is 60% or less and preferably 50% by on a weight basis. In usual, the binder component (A) is dissolved in the organic solvent; the particles (B) are added to the resulting solvent and then dispersed therein with a dispersing apparatus such as a paint shaker, a ball mill, a sand mill, a three roll mill, an attritor, or a homo-mixer; and a photopolymerization initiator (C) is added to the dispersion and then uniformly dissolved therein.","The resin layer (d) is preferably formed according to the following procedure: a solution is prepared by dispersing the curable composition principally containing the fluorine compound in a solvent and a coating is formed using the solution, dried, and then cured, wherein the solvent contains at least one selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol, tert-butanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, cyclohexanone, butyl acetate, isopropyl acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diacetylacetone, and acetylacetone.","In the above operation, the content of the solvent may be arbitrarily varied depending on the target viscosity of the composition, the target thickness of the cured coating, and drying conditions.","The multilayer film preferably has a multilayer structure in which the hard coat layer (b) containing the (meth)acrylate compound, the electrically conductive layer (c) containing the electrically conductive particles, and the resin layer (d) containing the fluorine compound are disposed on at least one face of the substrate film (a).
