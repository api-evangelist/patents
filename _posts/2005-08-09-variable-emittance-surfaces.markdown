title: Variable emittance surfaces
abstract: Designs for constructing a surface with variable emittance are described. This is achieved by making a surface where the emissivity varies on a scale smaller than the resolution of a thermal imager viewing the surface. One design utilizes many cylindrical surfaces with their axis parallel and their surfaces nearly in contact. Individual cylinders have the property that when rotated to zero degrees they show a surface with an emissivity of one and when rotated to 180 degrees display a surface with an emissivity of zero. At intermediate angles of rotation a sensor that could resolve individual cylinders would see alternate lines with high and low emittance but a sensor unable to resolve individual cylinders sees a surface with an emittance that depends on the angle the cylinders are rotated. Variable emittance surfaces are expected to be useful for controlling target signature and for making spectral reflectivity measurements using a hyper-spectral radiometer.

One typical infrared (IR) camouflage technique involves covering an object with a material cover, with or without environmentally controlled subsystems (having added extraordinary power requirements). Much effort has been expended in the determination of the materials to be used to comprise the typical IR camouflage covering. One example in the IR camouflage prior art may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,156,033 to Earl F. Bienz issued on 22 May 1979. In the Bienz patent there is disclosed applying appropriate foam layers to a tank, so as to mask its thermal signature. In the visible and also in the infrared, these approaches have had limited success.","In the infrared, some factors for the aforementioned limited success includes the following:\n\n","In the visible, limited success has also resulted from factors including the following:\n\n","Modeling camouflage effectiveness is an area undergoing rapid development, where current modeling methodologies consider both the infrared and visible spectrum. Finding targets in the infrared requires target size and apparent temperature difference between the target and the background, a summary measure that combines target background physical temperature difference and target-background emissivity difference. As current IR sensor technology (of which the sensors are commonly called forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensors) matures, sensors which respond to apparent temperature difference will be replaced by multi-band radiometers and hyper-spectral line scanners capable of generating contrasts which can separate these two effects; i.e. they can generate a contrast based on the physical temperature differences between the target and the background and a separate contrast based on emissivity differences between the target and the background. Making targets hard to find in the visible is primarily concerned with the development of ever more effective camouflage patterns and with techniques for characterizing the effectiveness of the camouflage for particular terrain.","While the prior art has reported using surface modification devices and techniques, none have established a basis for a specific apparatus and technique dedicated to the task of resolving the particular problem at hand. What is needed in this instance is a real-time control of: 1) the effective emissivity (band averaged or spectral) in the thermal wavelength region, 2) apparent color in the visible wavelength region, and 3) camouflage patterns for both thermal and visible wavelength regions.","The problem is that emissivity is a microscopic property of surfaces that can be controlled by painting but it is difficult to imagine an approach for controlling it in fractions of a second. Those skilled in the art know that a thermal imager responds to the area weighted average emissivity averaged over the detector footprint. For a target at tactical ranges, that footprint has spatial dimensions that are typically between 10 and 100 cm on a side depending on detector size, focal length and target range. The detector footprint is the area on the target seen by a single detector. (For a distant target at range R viewed with a sensor with focal length f the dimension of the footprint Dis related the detector dimension D, defined as the square root of its area by D=(R\/f)D)","Accordingly, there is a need in the art to have variable emittance surfaces. The present invention addresses this need.","One object of the present invention is to provide variable emittance surfaces.","The present invention achieves this and other objectives by making a surface where the effective emissivity varies on a scale smaller than the resolution of a thermal imager viewing the surface. One embodiment utilizes many cylindrical surfaces with their axis parallel and their surfaces nearly in contact. Individual cylinders have the property that when rotated to zero degrees they show a surface with an emissivity of one and when rotated to 180 degrees display a surface with an emissivity of zero. At intermediate angles of rotation a sensor that could resolve individual cylinders would see alternate lines with high and low emittance but a sensor unable to resolve individual cylinders sees a surface with an emittance that depends on the angle the cylinders are rotated. Variable emittance surfaces are expected to be useful for controlling target signature and for making spectral reflectivity measurements using a hyper-spectral radiometer.","From the point of view of a thermal sensor, the variable emittance surfaces of the invention, enable an operator to choose the surface of an object from a continuum of treated surfaces with different spectral emittance and reflectance properties in fractions of a second. The implication is that if the area weighted average emissivity over an area, small compared to the detector footprint, is appropriately varied, then a thermal imaging sensor would have trouble distinguishing this small area from the background.","From the point of view of a thermal sensor, the variable emittance surfaces of the invention, enables an operator to choose the surface of an object from a continuum of treated surfaces with different spectral emittance and reflectance properties in fractions of a second. However, prior to describing the invention in detail, the theory of the invention must be described.","Suppose a plane target surface is normal to a sensor line of sight and half the detector footprint on a target falls entirely on a surface with emissivity \u03b5and the other half falls on a surface with emissivity \u03b5. For this case the emittance seen by the detector is \u00bd(\u03b5+\u03b5). More generally if the detector footprint has area A and area Aof the footprint is on a surface with emissivity \u03b5, then the effective emittance \u03b5 seen by the detector is given by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u025b","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["A","i"]},{"mi":["\u025b","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["A","i"]}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"Here the sum in the denominator equals the area A of the detector footprint.

Had the areas depicted in black and white been characterized with directional spectral emissivities \u03b5and \u03b5, then by spreading out the fan blades, the effective directional spectral emissivity \u03b5 could be controlled between \u03b5and \u03b5.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":"\u03bb,\u03b8"},"One use of variable emittance surfaces is for measuring spectral emittance of tank surfaces. Since tank surfaces are approximately lambertian, a desired property of the variable emittance surface is that it be lambertian. Another desired attribute of the variable emittance surface is that a single layer completely cover the surface since this allows the greatest control of surface properties. A third attribute is the linearity of the relationship between emittance and element rotation angle. A linear relationship is desired for ease in calibrating the surface.","Lambertian Properties.","When the sensor moves in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis then the radiance seen by the sensor changes with viewing angle because of changes in the relative amount of surfaces Aand Athat are visible. However, the cylinders can be arranged so that increases in surface area Acaused by movement in this plane on one cylinder is counterbalanced with decreases in Ain an adjacent cylinder. Similar remarks apply to A. With a modification of the design shown in , this geometry allows for a nearly lambertian surface in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis. When the sensor moves in a plane that contains the cylinder axis, lambertian properties of the variable emittance surface depend mainly on cylinder surface treatment.","Surface Coverage.","This geometry completely covers the surface and allows maximum control of surface properties.","Linearity.","The relationship between apparent emittance and rotation angle is approximately linear.","Lambertian Properties.","Comments for lambertian properties made in reference to  apply here.","Surface Coverage.","This geometry completely covers the surface at multiples of 60 degrees. At other angles small gaps appears between the cylinders and allow the surface behind the cylinders to be seen. Linearity. The relationship between apparent emittance with rotation angle is non-linear.","Versatility.","Because this design utilizes three rather than two surfaces, it is more versatile then competing designs in controlling surface properties.","Lambertian Properties.","When the sensor moves in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the rotation, the system can be balanced so that additional white space seen in some spheres is balanced by additional black space seen in other spheres and in this plane the surface is approximately lambertian. If the spheres are rotated to ninety degrees as in , individual spheres will approximately make a lambertian surface.","Surface Coverage.","As indicated in , a single layer of spheres provides incomplete coverage. This can be compensated for by using two layers of spheres.","Linearity.","The relationship between apparent emissivity with rotation angle is approximately linear.","Lambertian Properties. The lambertian properties of the surface depend on the surface treatment. This geometry is the same as a flat tank surface and for this reason the properties of this surface may be particularly well matched to a flat tank surface.","Surface Coverage. The geometry shown in this figure has incomplete coverage. However by modifying this geometry to a rectangular or square shape, coverage can be increased.","Linearity. The relationship between apparent emissivity with rotation angle is approximately linear.","The problem addressed is to measure the spectral emittance of a tank sized object in the field. Spectral ranges of interest are 3-5 and 8-12\u03bc. Typically, target surfaces to be measured are diffuse, rather than spectral reflectors and for reflection angles not too far from the normal are well approximated by lambertian sources. The main interest is in area averaged spectral emissivity. Stated another way, there is little interest in how the spectral emittance varies from one small part of the target to another small part of the target. Two hyperspectral imaging devices are available: one operates in the 3-5\u03bc band and the other operates in the 8-12\u03bc band. Blackbody sources with an adjustable temperature are also available. Although more accurate measurements are welcome, errors of 10% are acceptable.","Overview of Measurement.","The idea of the measurement is to place a variable emittance source on the target area to be measured so that the sensor simultaneously sees the target surface and the variable emittance source. The variable emittance source is adjusted so that the signal seen by the sensor from the target surface matches the signal from the variable emittance source. (The sensor sees emitted and reflected radiation from the target and variable emissivity surfaces. It also sees radiation emitted from the atmosphere and for low transmission, atmospheric radiation is the dominant radiation seen by the sensor.) If the target surface and the variable emittance surface temperature are the same and if they both reflect incident radiation into the sensor the same way then when the signal strength seen by the sensor when it views the target surface matches the signal strength when the sensor views the variable emittance surface it can be concluded that the emittance of the target and the variable emittance surfaces are the same. The spectral emittance properties of the variable emittance surface are known either by modeling or by laboratory measurement. If the sensor is a broadband sensor, this procedure measures broadband emittance. If the sensor is a hyperspectral imaging device and the signal strength is matched for each sub-band then this procedure measures the directional spectral emittance.","Field-of-View, Range and Size of Variable Emittance Surface.","Interest is in the spectral emittance over a substantial part of the tank sized target and transmission considerations dictate that a wide field-of-view optic on each hyperspectral sensor be used. The range is adjusted so that individual elements of the variable emittance surface are not resolved. The size of the variable emittance surface should be large enough so that it occupies at least sixteen picture elements in the imager.","Spectral Transmission Measurement.","Having chosen the range, an accuracy analysis of the results requires spectral transmission measurements. For wavelengths where the transmission is low, atmospheric radiation dominates the signal seen by the sensor and then spectral emittance measurements will either be inaccurate or not possible depending on the wavelength and transmission value. Thus, it is important to measure atmospheric spectral transmission and this is done in the following way.\n\n","In making these measurements, the blackbody must be substantially larger than the detector footprint when the sensor is at range. To reduce the deleterious effects of low transmission it is desirable to make the measurements at the closest practical range and this was one consideration in using a wild field-of-view optic.","Reflected Radiation and the Choice of Variable Emittance Surface.","Reflected radiation will be important whenever it is non-negligible compared to the emitted radiation. For the purpose of making spectral emittance measurements use a two pronged approach:\n\n","One can either measure the target at ambient temperature or at an elevated temperature. For both approaches the variable emittance surface is in intimate thermal contact with the surface to be measured.","Ambient Temperature Approach.","Do not exercise the tank and have several large fans blowing on the tank and variable emittance surface. The measurements are made when thermocouples attached to both surfaces indicate that both surfaces are at the same temperature to within 0.1 C. The measurements are done at several values of the variable emittance surface to match the reference and target signals at the wavelengths of interest.","Elevated Temperature Approach.","Although the tank has been recently exercised, thermocouples on the tank area to be measured indicate that the surface temperature over the region of interest is constant to within 0.1 C. When necessary, several fans blow on the tank to reduce the time for this to happen. Electric heating elements are installed in the variable emittance surface and adjusted so that the temperature of the variable emittance surface matches that of the tank surface to within 0.1 C. When this condition is satisfied, measurements are done at several values of the variable emittance surface to match reference and target signals at the wavelengths of interest.","Several embodiments for making variable emissivity surfaces have been presented and the attributes of the different designs discussed. The proposed embodiments are capable of varying emittance in fractions of a second. The embodiments can also continuously control reflectance properties of a surface to being near perfectly diffuse to being near perfectly specular in fractions of a second. They can be used to locally control the color of a tank. In the proposed embodiments, only a small amount of energy is needed to move elements. For example, as shown in  a motor, or motors, coupled to gears and a shaft through the various 3 dimensional surfaces could be used to move the various surfaces as desired. Of course, those skilled in the art could engineer any number of ways to move the surfaces in accordance with the teachings of the invention. Of course, once moved, maintaining a particular color, reflective property or emittance requires no additional energy. While various embodiments have been described, those skilled in the art also could devise any number of various designs for the variable emittance surfaces of the present invention.","In conclusion, the variable emittance surfaces can be used to control vehicle surface characteristics in the visible and infrared. For example, in , different patterns can be painted on surfaces AB, BC and AC. By utilizing a surface made of many triangular prisms, a tank operator could chose from three patterns to have a more optimum match to a changing background."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects of the invention will become readily apparent in light of the Detailed Description Of The Invention and the attached drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
