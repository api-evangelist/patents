title: Communication network and method for improved resilience of a mobile-terminated connection
abstract: A communication network is established by a connection to a user terminal that is capable of roaming amongst a plurality of serving areas. The network includes a controller for each serving area capable of routing a connection to a location covered by that serving area. If a controller serving the user terminal is faulty, a home database, which stores a plurality of identities of other controllers, is able to route the connection to the user terminal by selecting one of the other controllers that is valid.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a communication network for establishing a connection to a user terminal and in particular, but not exclusively, to a user terminal that is capable of roaming amongst a plurality of serving areas in a wireless communication network.","2. Description of the Related Art","It is likely that at some point in the operational life of a communication network, that at least one of the elements is likely to fail resulting in unwanted downtime of the network. Therefore, network designers and telecommunication engineers are constantly striving to find mechanisms that will make a network more resilient to arbitrary failures. Broadly speaking, the elements of a wireless communication network are roughly grouped into being either radio access nodes (RAN) or core nodes (CN) as shown for example in . In practice, the core nodes could for example be MSC's (Mobile Switching Centres).","In practice, the RAN nodes can either take the form of a RNC (Radio Network Controller) in the case of UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) network, or a BSC (Base Station Controller) also for GSM, etc.","The known network configuration shown in  has been described in the third generation standard having a specification number 3GPP TS 23.236 and which is entitled \u201cIntra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","6","8","11","12","22","1","4"]},"Although the 3GPP TS 23.236 standard offers improved redundancy in that a single RAN node can be connected to a secondary CN, this recovers only mobile originated (MO) operations. A mobile originated connection is one in which a call is set up after it has been initiated by a Mobile Station (MS) of the communication network. In contrast, a co-called mobile terminated (MT) call is a connection which has been set up to a MS (Mobile station) or user terminal of a communication network, but which was initiated by the communication network.","In the case of a MO connection using the configuration shown in , a RAN node can connect to a secondary MSC in the case that the primary MSC is not available. However, for a MT connection the situation is wholly different. In this case, the MS is not reachable if it is attached to a faulty MSC. In such a situation the call to the MS will fail. Moreover as the address of the faulty MSC remains in the home location register (HLR) of the network, subsequent MT calls will also fail. There is currently no solution to this problem. All the MT calls will fail until the subscriber makes a MO operation or a location update.","It is an aim of the embodiment of the present invention to improve the resilience of the communication network for a mobile terminated connection.","According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a communication network for establishing a connection to a user terminal that is capable of roaming amongst a plurality of serving areas, the communication network comprising: a controller for each serving area capable of routing a connection to a location covered by that serving area; a home database for storing the identity of the controller normally selected to route the connection to the user terminal and for storing identities of other controllers whose service areas also cover the location of the user terminal; and means for selecting, in the case that the normally selected controller is determined to be invalid, from the other controllers whose identities are stored in the home database, at least one new controller which is valid, and establishing the connection to the user terminal via that new controller.","According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for establishing a connection to a user terminal that is capable of roaming amongst a plurality of serving areas of a communication network, wherein each of the service areas has a controller which is capable of routing a connection to a location covered by that serving area, the method comprising: storing in a home database the identity of the existing controller that routes the connection to the user terminals, and identities of other controllers whose service areas also cover the location of the user terminal; determining that the existing controller is invalid; selecting from the other controllers whose identities are stored in the home database, at least one other controller which is valid; and establishing the connection to the user terminal via the selected controller.","Various different pool areas are shown in , for example  shows four different pool areas , , , , wherein each pool area comprises a collection of one or more RAN node service areas -. Furthermore, each pool area is served by multiple CN nodes in parallel which allow traffic to be shared in the pool area between each other. In , the CN nodes are MSC-MSC.","In other words pool areas may overlap which is not possible for MSC (CN) service areas.  shows a first circuit-switched (CS) pool area  which comprises the RAN node service areas , ,  and  which are served by MSCs ,  and . A second CS pool area  is shown as comprising RAN nodes , ,  and  to be served by MSCs ,  and . A first packet-switched (PS) pool area  is shown as comprising the RAN nodes  and  which are served by SGSNs , . Also, a second PS pool area  is shown which comprises RAN nodes , ,  and  served by SGSNs ,  and . It should be appreciated that this is merely an example of the configuration of the pool areas, and different combinations can be expected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["44","44","36","38","36","40","40","34"]},"The HLR  then identifies MSC  which is presently serving MS-B and the HLR requests from MSC  a temporary routing number (MSRN) of MS-B. Having received this information, the GMSC is able to establish this leg of the call to the terminating MS and a call can be established between the calling party MS-A and the called party MS-B.  shows two alternative embodiments. That is, in the first embodiment, the RAN nodes consist of a Node B element and a RNC which are controlled by MSC . In the second embodiment, the RAN nodes consist of a BTS and BSC which are controlled by MSC .","At this point it is useful to refer to , which shows known interfaces between elements of a wireless communication network.  shows that the GMSC  is able to communicate with the HLR  over a C-interface. The HLR is a database which stores permanent information about the subscribers of a wireless communication network.","In contrast, the VLR (Visitor Location Register) , which is shown as being located within an MSC is a database which stores temporary information and is used by the serving MSC to service visiting subscribers. That is, when a subscriber enters a serving area controlled by a new MSC, a copy of all the necessary information is downloaded from the HLR to the relevant VLR. In this way, the serving MSC does not need to access the HLR directly for this information, which might in fact be present in a different communication network resulting in additional delay. Temporary information in the VLR is cleared whenever the MS roams out of an MSC's service area.","The GMSC  is the switching element that is responsible for routing a MT call to a called party and is able to communicate with the serving MSC  over the E interface and communicate with a SGSN  over a Ginterface if required. The MSC  typically contains a VLR for storing temporary information associated with that serving area. The MSC\/VLR  is able to communicate with a BSS (Base Station Subsystem) over an A-interface, with a UTRAN (UMTS Terrestial Radio Access Network) over an I-interface, and with the SGSN over a G-interface. The UTRAN  is able to communicate with the SGSN  also over an I-interface. The MS is able to communicate with either the UTRAN  or the BSS  with Uand Uinterfaces respectively.","Broadly speaking, in order to establish a MT connection, the GMSC  receives from MS-A the phone number of MS-B to which the call is to be established, the GMSC then contacts the HLR  over the C interface. The HLR  knows the identity of the MSC which is presently serving the MS, since this identity is updated during a registration process which occurs either during power-up or on movement to a service area covered by another MSC. The HLR  in turn asks the relevant serving MSC, by sending a PRN (Provide Roaming Number) request message (), for a temporary routing number known as the MSRN (Mobile Station Routing Number) of the MS. That is, each MSC is able to assign an MSRN to a mobile terminal and stores a mapping from the MSRN to a unique identifier of the MS known as the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity). This mapping is temporarily stored in the VLR of the serving MSC.","The requested temporary number MSRN is then returned from the HLR back to the GMSC for setting up a call to the respective serving MSC. The serving MSC refers to the mapping table in its VLR to establish a connection to the MS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["50","52","70","70","70","70"]},"At step S it is detected that the serving MSS  has failed. It should be appreciated that there could be a variety of different ways of detecting a faulty serving MSC. For example, in one embodiment of the invention the faulty MSS  is detected by a timer in the HLR  such that if no response is received from the serving MSC within a certain time period such as 20 seconds, then the timer times out and it is assumed that the serving MSC has a fault. In an alternative embodiment, if the MSC is equipped with self-diagnostic software for example, then once a fault is detected, it can be reported to the HLR  via the SS7 network  for example. In this way, the HLR  could then be immediately updated to reflect that the serving MSC is faulty, which would result in a much faster recovery being performed since the HLR does not need to wait for a timeout to occur. In addition to storing the location of each serving MSC, it is a feature of the described embodiment of the invention that the HLR  also stores a pool area of other core nodes such as MSC's which have service areas that cover the location of the MS. Thus, at step S when it is detected by the HLR  that the serving MSS  has failed, it is able to look up its database for another MSS \u2032 which has a serving area that covers the location of the MS, and at step S the request for the roaming number is instead sent to this new MSS \u2032 which becomes the serving MSS. Step S shows that the new MSS \u2032 is valid (i.e. there is no failure) and returns a successful response to the HLR along with the temporary roaming number. At step S the HLR  is updated to reflect that the serving MSC is the new MSS \u2032, and not the old MSS  (which is invalidated in the HLR). At step S, an SRI acknowledgement message is returned to the GMSC.","Upon receipt of the SRI acknowledgement message, the GMSC  is able to establish a call to the MS-B via the new MSS \u2032, wherein at step S the so-called RESTORE DATA service is invoked by the VLR-2 in MSS \u2032 after providing the roaming number to the HLR , either if the MS is unidentified in the VLR-2 or for a known MS whose IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) record is marked as \u201cNot confirmed\u201d. The VLR-2 is therefore able to get the confirmed subscriber data from the HLR  using the RESTORE DATA which comprises MAP (Mobile Application Part) messages sent between the HLR  and the new MSS \u2032. At step S a call is established between the GMSC  and the new MSS \u2032. Thus, so long as the VLR supports the RESTORE DATA service, a further advantage of this embodiment of the invention is that no modifications are needed to the VLR.","Step S indicates that the called party MS-B is searched for by scanning all LAs (Location Areas) served by the new MSS \u2032. A location area is the various RAN serving areas controlled by the new MSC \u2032.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["4","2","5","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["40","40","76","71","70","72"]},"Typically, the number of core nodes in the pool is under ten and usually only two or three as shown in . According to one embodiment of the present invention, the HLR is able to enable the next MSC in the MT pool area , to execute the PRN request message in the situation when the serving MSC identified in the address portion  of the HLR does not respond. It should be appreciated that the HLR can be provided with selection means for selecting which of the other MSCs in the pool area  should be selected as the new serving MSC. For example a prioritisation procedure could be implemented whereby one of the MSCs in the pool is selected over the others meeting a particular criteria or alternatively the HLR can merely sequentially poll each of the MSCs to execute the PRN request, and the first MSC in the pool area  which is able to do so shall be selected as the new serving MSC. In any event, once the HLR has found a valid MSC (i.e. one which has not failed) in the pool, then the HLR updates the identity of the serving MSC in area  of the HLR .","One of the advantages of the embodiments of the present invention is that the HLR is able to detect the failure of a serving MSC before a call is established, i.e. during the signalling phase when the GMSC is in communication with the HLR using SRI messages. This procedure is not evident to a calling part MS-A of the network. A call will be placed to a called party MS-B and will be routed via a valid MSC, invisibly to the calling party MS-A even where the serving MSC (as originally stored in the HLR database for that subscriber) has failed for whatever reason.","An MSC may fail as a result of a number of different reasons including natural disasters such as flood, fire, earthquake etc. Embodiments of the present invention improve call network resilience in cases where the serving MSC is lost and enables MT calls to be successfully routed to MS's even in the case when such an MSC is lost.","Another advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that the calling subscriber does not notice that something is wrong with the called subscriber.","A further advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that the recovery actions will concentrate only on those subscribers which are actually called. Thus, since the embodiments of the present invention enable a dynamic selection of a valid MSC during the call set up phase, it is not necessary to update any further information which reduces the burdensome load which can be expected of other solutions that might concentrate on updating all the subscribers attached to the failed MSC.","A further advantage of the present invention is that the solution requires no physical modifications to the MSC node itself, instead this is achieved within the HLR.","A further advantage of embodiments of the present invention arises from the fact that the identity of the failed MSC is replaced within the HLR by the new MSC. In contrast, in the past the address of the failed MSC remains in the HLR, which also causes subsequent MT calls to fail. It should be understood that the identities of each of the MSCs can be stored as addresses, for example using standard UMTS addressing which is well known and beyond the scope of the present invention.","It should be appreciated that although the term MS has been used to refer to the mobile station, any form of suitable user terminal may be used. For example, the user terminal can take the form of a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), or other suitable hand-held device that is capable of receiving telecommunication services offered by the wireless network.","It should also be appreciated that although  shows for example SS7 networks , , any other suitable signalling system or communication format may be used."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a better understanding of the present invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made by way of example to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
