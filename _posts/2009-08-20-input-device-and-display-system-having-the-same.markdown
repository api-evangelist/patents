{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to an input device, and more particularly, to an input device capable of optically communicating with an electronic apparatus.","The touch panels have been utilized as inputs means for various electronic apparatuses. The touch panels can be classified into resistance type touch panel, capacitance type touch panel, ultrasonic type touch panel, and infrared type touch panel, etc., according to work principles.  shows a conventional infrared type touch panel for detecting a position of an object present in a particular region. The electronic apparatus  includes a display panel , multiple infrared receiving devices  and , and an infrared emitting device . The infrared receiving devices  and  and the infrared emitting device  are disposed on the perimeter of panel . When a finger or other object  is set in a certain position on the display panel , light emitted by the infrared emitting device  will be reflected by the object . Therefore, the infrared receiving devices  and  can sense light reflected by the object  from multiple angles. The infrared receiving devices  and  can translate the received light into electrical signals which are then transmitted to a processor . These electrical signals are correlated by the processor  to generate X and Y coordinates of the object . In short, the coordinates of the object  can be obtained by analyzing the light received by the infrared receiving devices  and . The processor  then sends these coordinates to an operating system to, for example, position a curser in the corresponding X and Y locations on the display panel .","However, although drawing directly on the display panel  with fingers or other objects  is possible, the finger or object  cannot communicate any other information to the operating system except for the X and Y coordinates. Therefore, many drawing attributes, such as line width, color, and rotation angle must be set though control buttons or other user interface, which requires users to interface with the electronic apparatus in an unnatural way. This limits the user's ability to interact with drawing programs in an artistic way and impedes the creative process.","Consequently, it is necessary to provide an input device capable of giving user the best control for communicating with the touch panel.","For obviating the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related arts, the present invention provides an optical input device that enables the user to control many attributes of the drawing expression during the painting process, such as line width, color intensity, color selection, brush type, rotation angle, and the like.","According to an aspect of the present invention, an input device is provided. The input device includes a light source, a force sensor, and a controller. The force sensor is configured to sense a force applied to a tip of the input device and generate a first sensing signal corresponding to the sensed force. The controller is electrically connected to the light source and the force sensor, and configured to receive the first sensing signal and control the light source to generate light pulses in response to the first sensing signal according to a predefined protocol.","According to another aspect of the present invention, an input device for optically communicating with an electronic apparatus according to a predefined protocol is provided. The electronic apparatus has a drawing application installed therein. The input device includes a light source, a force sensor, and a controller. The force sensor is configured to sense a force applied to a tip of the input device and generate a first sensing signal corresponding to the sensed force. The controller is electrically connected to the light source and the force sensor, and configured to receive the first sensing signal and control the light source to generate light pulses in response to the first sensing signal according to the predefined protocol. The light pulses are received by the electronic apparatus and translated into a command sequence for setting drawing attributes of the drawing application.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, a display system is provided. The display system includes an input device and an electronic apparatus. The input device includes a light source, a force sensor, and a controller. The force sensor is configured to sense a force applied to a tip of the input device and generate a first sensing signal corresponding to the sensed force. The controller is electrically connected to the light source and the force sensor, and configured to receive the first sensing signal and control the light source to generate light pulses in response to the first sensing signal according to a predefined protocol. The electronic apparatus has a drawing application installed therein, and includes a display unit, a photo sensor for receiving the light pulses, and a processor. The processor is electrically connected to the display unit and the photo sensor, and configured to generate coordinates of the input device and a command sequence associated with the drawing application in response to the light pulses.","The other aspects of the present invention, part of which will be described in the following description, part of which will be apparent from description, or can be known from the execution of the present invention are presented below. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","The present invention relates to an optical input device to enable users to naturally interface with an optical touch panel, without the need to separately interface with a drawing application to communicate drawing attributes in addition to coordinate information. To make the disclosure of the present invention more detailed and complete, references are made to the following description in conjunction with . However, the devices, elements, and operations in the following embodiments are provided for exemplary purposes only.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","200","100","105","100","110","120","130","180","200","210","220","222","230","210","220","222","200","240","210"]},"The light source  of the input device  is preferably, but not limited to, a light-emitting diode. The light generated by the light source  is emitted through the opening . The force sensor  is configured to sense force applied to tip of the input device  when the input device  is in contact with the display unit . The force sensor  is disposed preferably, but not necessarily, as close as possible to the opening , and can be implemented as, for example, a strain gauge or a force-sensing resistor which are well-known by a person skilled in the art and so the details thereof are omitted hereinafter. The force sensor  can operate to communicate a first sensing signal to the controller  in response to the degree of sensed force, and then the controller  can control the pattern of light outputted from the light source  according to the first sensing signal from the force sensor . As a result, the force applied to the tip of the input device  can be translated into the variation of characteristics of the light outputted from the light source . For example, after receiving the first sensing signal, the controller  controls the light source  to generate light pulses in response to the first sensing signal. The pulse width, frequency, or amplitude of the light pulses may vary with the first sensing signal according to a predefined protocol which will be described in further detail hereinbelow.","Also referring to , the electronic apparatus  can be implemented as a conventional personal computer, a work station, a notebook, a palm top PC, a network computer, or a combination thereof. The display unit  is configured to display an image, and can be a plasma display panel (PDF), a liquid crystal display (LCD), or any device which can display information. The photo sensors  and  are configured to receive the light signals outputted from the light source  of the input device  and convert the received light signals into electrical signals, which can be located at any suitable place, such as at corners or along the periphery of display unit . The electrical signals outputted from the photo sensors  and  are then received by the processor .","Generally, the light signals received by the photo sensors  and  are modulated light pulses carrying both coordinate information and drawing attribute information. The coordinate information may include, for example, light incident angles \u03b1, \u03b8 of the photo sensors  and  respectively and a distance D between the two photo sensors  and . The processor  can determine two-dimensional coordinates of the input device  based on the coordinate information, and this coordinate determining process is well-known by a person skilled in the art and therefore the detailed description thereof will be omitted. Furthermore, the drawing attribute information indicated by the predefined protocol can be converted into a command sequence by the processor . The command sequence and the two-dimensional coordinates are then communicated to the drawing application  through a defined programming interface . Then, an image corresponding to the command sequence is displayed at a position corresponding to the two-dimensional coordinates on the display unit  through the drawing application .","In sum, the controller  of the input device  senses changes in the force sensor  and communicates drawing attributes information to the electronic apparatus  by controlling and modulating physical characteristics of light outputted from the light source . In other words, the light from the light source  is continuously variable based on the pressure the user applies to the input device  while drawing. Variations in the light are sensed by the photo sensors  and  located around the display unit . The processor  of the electronic apparatus  will sense the characteristics of light and translate these into a pressure level for use in varying the width of the lines (or point size, color intensity or other attributes) generated on the display unit .","Each of the photo sensors  and  of the present invention can be, but not limited to, a CCD camera or a CMOS camera, and the present invention does not intend to limit the number of the photo sensors adopted in the electronic apparatus . For example, to help in processing the digital modulation and communication protocol, the photo sensors  and  can be used specifically for two-dimensional coordinates, and an additional photo sensor  can be added as a dedicated photo sensor for attribute communication, whereby the optical communication can be speeded up.","Referring to  again, for communication more drawing attributes, such as color selection, brush type, etc., between the input device  and the electronic apparatus , the input device  can further include an accelerometer , a gyroscope , and a plurality of touch buttons , which supply additional parameters for the input device  to communicate to the electronic apparatus . The information from accelerometer , the gyroscope , and the touch buttons  are all collected by the controller , and then light outputted from the light source  can be correspondingly digitally modulated under the control of the controller . The input device  further includes a power source  mounted on the printed circuit board  for providing electrical power to various above-mentioned components which can be electrically coupled as necessary using, for example, a bus (not shown).","The accelerometer  and the gyroscope  can be any motion sensors known or used in the art capable of detecting the radial and angular motion of the input device . The accelerometer  can detect various motions of the input device , and generate a second sensing signal corresponding to the sensed motion to the controller . For example, if the accelerometer  detects that the input device  has stayed motionless for more than a threshold period of time, it can instruct the controller  to transit from a full power mode to a power saving mode. Once the accelerometer  detects the movement of the input device , the controller  is switched from the power saving mode to the full power mode. The toggle between the full power mode and the power saving mode can be realized by a timing control circuitry (not shown) as known by those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the user can also quickly reset all the drawing attributes (such as color, brush type, etc.) of the input device  to a user defined default state with multiple snap actions.","The gyroscope  can be used to detect inclined angle and rotation of the input device  and generate a third sensing signal corresponding to the sensed result to the controller . In one embodiment, the detected inclined angle can be used in conjunction with a flat brush selection of the drawing application , which may, for example, create flat brush strokes or simulate calligraphic writing on the display unit . Furthermore, the information representing the detected rotation can be passed on to the drawing application  to spin the brush around to make wide strokes. It should be noted that the communication of the above commands to control the drawing attributes can be delayed until the input device  is in contact with the electronic apparatus  and able to send an optical signal to the photo sensors  and .","The touch buttons  can enable the user to control various drawing attributes while the user is drawing. The touch buttons , typically three, are located on one side of the input device , which are preferably disposed just under the user's fingers, to enable the user to communicate requested changes of the drawing attributes to the electronic device . The user can input a plurality of fourth sensing signals to the controller  through the touch buttons . The touch buttons  can be assigned to any desired drawing attributes, such as a brush selection or a color mixture of red, green or blue, or perhaps yellow, magenta and cyan. In one embodiment, the user can select which button will control which attribute. For example, a driver or a software application for the input device , installed on the electronic device , can be used to assist the user in setting up the button assignment. This driver or software application can translate the predefined protocol to the assigned attributes and then call the appropriate command in the drawing application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["110","120","110","110","302","304","306","308","1","4","1","4","1","4","1","2"]},"As described above, a predefined protocol can be established to define the transmission of information from the input device  to the electronic apparatus .  illustrates an example protocol  defining the relationship between the light signals and the drawings attributes, which can be used to send drawing commands from the input device  to the electronic apparatus  through this optical communicating manner. In this embodiment, the protocol  contains a synchronization header , a command portion , a value portion , and a checksum . The use of fixed length protocol is an example of a way to simplify the digital modulation used for communicating a drawing command, but the protocol with dynamic length can also be used. The synchronization header  typically has sufficient length to enable the electronic apparatus  to discover a drawing command will be sent and establish a timing clock to sample the digital light modulation. Next, the command portion  of the protocol  is sent following the synchronization header . The length of the command portion  is predetermined based on the number of possible drawing attributes that will be sent. Next, the value portion  is sent, which is associated with the command portion . The length of the value  is predetermined based on the maximum number of possibilities for all drawing attributes. Finally, a checksum  is sent to ensure data integrity of the communication.","The protocol can be decoded by the processor , such that the digital modulation of light can be translated in to a command sequence for setting drawing attributes of the drawing application . The command sequence along with the two-dimensional coordinates of the input device  are then communicated to the drawing application  through a defined application programming interface .","The components and the arrangement thereof discussed above for the input device  and the electronic device  are by way of example only, and other components can be incorporated into the input device  and\/or the electronic device , such as any memory devices for storing data and\/or software for controlling the device or processing data. In another embodiment, the input device  can have two light sources at two opposite ends thereof, one emitting light having a first wavelength for drawing function and the other emitting light having a second wavelength for erasing function.","By introducing an input device with a light source, the electronic apparatus can differentiate this input device from a finger or passive pointing device. Existing optical touch panel devices have difficulties in operation while the user places his palm on the display panel. The optical input device of the present invention solves this problem. Since the optical input device emits light, the photo sensor can only look for light emitting from the input device, ignoring any other touch detections (such as palm pressing against the display panel). Furthermore, the optical input device of the present invention can communicate with the electronic apparatus only by way of light, i.e. the light generated by the optical input device is used to communicate with the electronic apparatus without the need of any additional components or connections for communication. This can significantly reduce the cost of the optical input device.","While this invention has been described with reference to the illustrative embodiments, these descriptions should not be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the illustrative embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent upon reference to these descriptions. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments as falling within the true scope of the invention and its legal equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
