{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/821,469, filed Jun. 23, 2010, now abandoned which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/354,609, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,904,360, filed Jan. 30, 2003, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional No. 60\/354,275 filed Feb. 4, 2002, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to fraud prevention and fraud \u201cearly warning\u201d notifications for transactions, in particular remote and\/or electronic transactions such as \u201ce-commerce\u201d and \u201cm-commerce\u201d transactions wherein it is desirable to authenticate and verify one or more parties' identities and intentions before the transaction is concluded and\/or to notify one or more parties of the occurrence of the transaction.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a transaction in which security is a concern, such as an electronically conducted transaction involving a funds transfer or a purchase or payment, there are three basic questions which must be satisfied:\n\n","Regarding question 1, the payments industry has devoted considerable attention to methods and systems designed to a) verify the identity of a purchaser, b) assess the risk of any given transaction, and c) take follow-on action in high-risk cases, either by subsequently inquiring of the payer whether the transaction was proper, or by denying funds or credit at the time of the transaction subject to later manual contact with the payer.","For more complex or higher-value transactions, per question 2 a buyer may be subject to a set of audit and control procedures designed to limit his\/her purchasing authority. In most consumer purchasing cases, the buyer and authority-holder are usually the same person. In many organizational purchasing situations, the buyer(s) and authority-holder(s) are not the same. The payments industry has one primary tool for limiting purchasing authority, which is the spending limit or credit limit associated with the buyer's account. Attempted solutions to question 1 also help address question 2, since verifying identity helps address cases wherein a buyer is suborning the purchasing authority of another party by use of a stolen credit card number or other private information.","As regards question 3, the most relatively secure environment for purchase transactions remains a merchant's store, in which a buyer and seller can interact face to face, multiple forms of identification can be reviewed, and the opportunities for theft of private information are generally limited. At the other extreme are telephone, mail, and electronic commerce, in which the buyer is represented merely by his\/her account information as supplied by phone, on a mailed form, or by data entry via a computer or other electronic device. Here, the opportunities for fraud and the theft of private information are relatively high. Further, there is a prevailing public perception that electronic purchasing environments (for example, virtual storefronts or Internet auctions) are inherently insecure in regard to the transmission and\/or storage of private information.","The above factors are reflected in the relative \u201cdiscount rate\u201d (price) charged to merchants by credit card processors for in-store transactions vs. \u201ccard not present\u201d transactions, for example. Typically, merchants pay 60% more per sales dollar in a \u201ccard not present\u201d transaction than when a credit card is physically presented for swiping.","These differences in risk also apply when accounts themselves are opened, closed, and modified remotely, as via mail, telephone, wire, or other electronic means.","Current transaction-verification systems and methods, such as for credit, debit, and purchase-card purchases and payments, Automated Teller Machine (ATM) interactions, e-ticket redemption, and the like, may be grouped into four broad categories: 1) physical identification of the purchasing party or of a difficult to-mimic characteristic of the purchasing party, such as by signature comparison or biometric scanning, 2) data entry of passwords or other identification codes, such as the Personal Identification Number (PIN) codes used with ATMs and calling cards, 3) validation of embedded digital authenticating information, such as is found in \u201csmart cards\u201d, and 4) verifying private knowledge presumed known only to the account holder, such as the account holder's billing address or Social Security Number (SSN), prior to approving a transaction, including opening, closing, and modifying an account. A fifth category, devoted to limiting the exposure of sensitive private information such as credit card numbers to insecure or weakly secure environments subject to high levels of electronic theft or hacking, such as the Internet, is the substitution of dummy information for the actual private information, which dummy information is reconciled with the actual private information after its receipt by the payment processing organization.","Additional systems and methods have been employed by credit reporting agencies, which agencies already monitor the status of individuals' credit accounts. Such organizations may offer their customers regular monthly communications by mail or electronic mail identifying new accounts established in the customer's name or with the customer's federal tax identification number since the last such communication.","Especially in categories (2) (3) and (4) above, transaction approval by a bank or other merchant processing or payment processing organization or network is often coupled with an automated risk detection processes and human follow-up, as when a credit card issuer's risk assessment system determines that an unexpectedly large, out-of-state purchase is \u201chigh risk\u201d for a given account holder, and then provides that information to a customer service representative who may call the account holder's telephone to attempt to confirm the transaction's validity, typically after the fact, or to leave a message for the account holder that the card account is suspended pending the account holder's reply. It is often the case that the account holder's ability to judge what constitutes a fraudulent transaction conducted in his\/her name considerably exceeds that of said risk assessment system and customer service representative. Despite this judgment-gap, today's account holders have, at best, only after-the-fact means available to them from their financial institutions, or from merchants, to audit transactions occurring in their name, including the opening, closing, and modification of accounts, or at-the-time means which involve significant new technologies and new processes to implement, learn, and use. In some cases the burden of implementing, learning and using falls on the merchant or other provider of goods, services, or funds, as well as the account holder.","Merchants subjected to fraudulent transactions are informed after the fact as well, when the true account holder disputes a transaction with his\/her payments organization. In the case of credit card transactions, the merchant is then charged back for the value of the disputed transaction and may also be charged a dispute investigation fee, resulting in a loss of profits and goods.","Additional research and development in the payments industry has focused on adding encrypted identifying codes or digital certificates to credit cards via an embedded microprocessor (as in \u201csmart cards\u201d) or via software on a personal computer (\u201ce-wallets\u201d); and on physically printing unique numeric identification numbers or numeric passwords (such as CVV2\/CVC2\/CID codes) on credit cards. Said codes are a relatively recent security feature for use in \u201ccard-not-present\u201d transactions and now appear on, for example, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover cards. As of this writing, these codes are comprised of a three- or four-digit number which provides a cryptographic check of the information embossed on the card, called CVV2 (Visa, 3-digit), CVC2 (MasterCard, 3-digit), and CID (American Express, 4-digit, and Discover, 3-digit). These code values help validate two things: a) the customer has the physical credit card in his\/her possession, and b) the card account is legitimate. CVV2\/CVC2\/CID data are printed only on the card; they are not contained in the magnetic stripe information per se, nor do they appear on sales receipts or statements. The use of these codes attempts to make it more difficult for a person who has stolen a credit card number, but not the actual card, to enter into fraudulent transactions, provided the other parry or parties to such transactions have also invested in the requisite changes to their systems and processes to support the use of these codes.","The prior art attempts, with mixed results, to solve the common problem of how to authenticate and verify a transaction, such as purchase, funds transfer, account opening or closing or modification, etc, particularly when conducted remotely or electronically, how to authenticate and verify the relevant party or parties, and how to provide the earliest possible warning of fraud, with a high degree of accuracy and completeness and near-zero delay.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,894 to Hackett describes systems and methods to use CVV2\/CVC2\/CID values, in lieu of PIN codes, to verify that a consumer engaged in a point-of-sale (POS) transaction possesses the transaction card at the time of purchase and\/or is the true card owner. The CVV2\/CVC2\/CID information is provided to the POS system as an additional authenticating datum, and if said datum matches what is stored in the relevant authorization system for the applicable card account number, and authorizing parameters are satisfied, authorization proceeds. If not, authorization is denied. Such systems and methods do not protect against card theft or hacking (should such CVV2\/CVC2\/CID data flow from the consumer to the merchant or card processor electronically, or are stored on an intermediate system), because they authenticate only that certain data from the physical card match data stored in the authorization system, without authenticating the identity of the card holder\/user, and without verifying the intentions of the true card owner or other co-authorizing party (if different). Further, they do not provide the advantage of notification of the true card owner or other co-authorizing or auditing parties of the occurrence of a transaction, and in particular a high-risk transaction. Finally, such systems and methods also fail to provide for any additional automated data gathering, authentication, and verification for and by the party regarding the opening, closing, or modification of an account remotely.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,163 to Flews describes a system and method for concluding a transaction by telephone that was initiated over the Internet. The purchaser dials a special telephone number associated with the transaction and provides his\/her credit card number in full by dialing it on his\/her touch-tone keypad (that is, using DTMT tones). Such a system and method have the advantage of partially isolating private payment information across two different communication links, but do not address the problem of notification or authentication of the legitimate account holders or other parties having a potential interest in the transaction, nor verification of the intent and approval of said legitimate account holders or other parties having approval authority for the transaction. Instead, they provide assurance solely to the purchaser that his\/her private financial information need not be communicated in full through a network perceived to be insecure (that is, through the Internet). Such a system and method, which require purchasers to take additional proactive steps to complete remote transactions, have had limited adoption by consumers and merchants due to the complexity they add to all affected transactions. This system and method are further limited to collecting payment data, such as a credit card number, for processing by the merchant's point-of-sale or ordering system, under the purchasing party's control. They do not provide for any additional data gathering, authentication, and verification for and by the party attempting to collect payment or open, close, or modify an account remotely, nor for and by any third party whose approval is normally required to conclude the transaction.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,324,526 to D'Agostino describes a system and method for providing a transaction code, supplied case by case by the purchaser's financial institution, in lieu of a credit card number for a purchase transaction. As has been noted, systems and methods based on dummy transaction or account number codes have had limited consumer acceptance because of the complexity to set up and use them. Such systems and methods attempt to address only the security of the purchaser's account information, by eliminating exposure thereof to a third party over a network perceived to be insecure (that is, over the Internet). Nor do such systems and methods provide for any additional data gathering, authentication, and verification for and by the party attempting to collect payment or open, close, or modify an account remotely, nor for and by any third party whose approval is normally required to conclude the transaction.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,011 to Gottfried describes a system and method for coupling a fingerprint recognition device to a credit card scanner. As has been noted, systems and methods of this type have extremely narrow application because of the need for the affected parties' physical presence, the associated cost of implementation and on-going support, and general public concerns over personal privacy when biometric devices are employed. Systems and methods of this type attempt to address only authentication of a purchaser's identity, and ignore notification of a party or parties who may be subject to identity fraud or fraudulent transactions.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,341,724 to Campisano describes a system and method for using the telephone number of a credit card owner, plus a PIN code, as an alias for the actual card number in a credit card transaction. This system and method replace the account number with another sequence of digits which is not printed or encoded on the credit card itself. Systems and methods of this type are a variation on the concept of a dummy account number, per U.S. Pat. No. 6,324,526 to D'Agostino, and provide the benefit of allowing a purchaser to make a credit card purchase without having to remember his\/her card number. However, such systems and methods do not provide protection against the use of stolen account information, nor against the use of stolen dummy account information such as said telephone number and PIN. They further require credit card users to learn a new process for making credit card purchases, and require system and rule changes by merchants to allow the purchaser's telephone number and PIN to be used in lieu of a card account number. For debit card transactions, the purchasers would further have to supply two PIN values, one for the debit card account, the other for encryption purposes. Nor do such systems and methods provide for any additional data gathering, authentication, and verification for and by the party attempting to collect payment or open, close, or modify an account remotely; nor for and by any third party whose approval is normally required to conclude the transaction.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,023,682 to Checchio describes a system and method for communicating a credit card number to a payment-authorizing computer system from a point-of-sale credit card terminal, using encryption where the key is a personal identification code (\u201cPIC\u201d) belonging to the card owner, and then verifying that the personal identification code matches that stored in the payment-authorizing computer system's memory. This system and method introduce the advantage of using personal information (such as a PIN code) to verify a card-user's identity, but also require changes to payment authorization systems and merchant's order-taking or payment-processing systems to implement, further require the purchaser to supply his\/her personal identification code to the merchant, and have utility only at a physical point-of-sale, that is, in a non-remote transaction. Because the PIC is communicated through the same process and media as the transaction itself, said personal identification code, particularly for e-commerce transactions, is vulnerable to theft via hacking of the merchant's systems or interception of the merchant's communications to the payment-processing bank or applicable credit card processing network. Such systems and methods also fail to provide for any additional data gathering, authentication, and verification for and by any third party whose approval is normally required to conclude the transaction.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,088,683 to Jalili describes a method for customers to order goods from merchants on one network, such as the Internet, and then complete the purchase via a second network, such as the telephone network, using \u201cCaller ID\u201d service or a call-back to check the customer's telephone number as a form of proof of the customer's identity, and involving an independent processing center that receives the customer's financial information over the second network in advance and stores it for future reference, The merchant uses the second network to deliver transaction details and the customer's ID to the processing center, which then uses the second network to receive or initiate contact from\/to to the customer to check his\/her identity and his\/her purchase intentions. Said method revises the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,163 to Bezos, by moving responsibility for the exchange of the customer's financial information from between the customer and merchant over a second network at the time of the transaction, as per Bezos, to between the customer and processing center over a second network in advance of the transaction. In Jalili, the processing center also performs the step of debiting and crediting the accounts of the customer and merchant, respectively. Therefore, the utility of this method is limited to cases wherein both a purchaser and a merchant are independently willing and able to establish an advance relationship with, exchange private information (such as account information for the purchaser and merchant processing information for the merchant) with, and allow debiting\/crediting of their accounts by, such a processing center prior to entering into a purchase transaction between themselves. The method is also limited to purchases, and particularly to purchases involving a single customer and a single merchant. The need for a preparatory process occurring over the second network, the need to use the second network to perform all steps to prepare and conclude a transaction other than the step of the customer's placing of his\/her order, and the need to establish a processing center, also limit the utility of this method. Because the purchaser does not actually supply his\/her payment information to the merchant, the method further creates an opportunity for fraud perpetrated within processing center, stemming from its unique position of trust between the two other parties. If, however, the processing center is not independent of the merchant, then any utility derived from the separation of the processing center from the merchant, such as the assurance to the customer that his\/her private account information need never be transmitted directly to the merchant, is lost. The method also adds the complication of the merchant having to provide a new and additional or alternative form of customer identification information to the processing center in order to receive a customer's payment. The method also fails to provide for any additional automated data gathering, authentication, and verification for and by a party regarding non-purchase transactions, such as the opening, closing, or modification of an account remotely; nor for and by any third party whose approval is normally required to conclude a purchase transaction. The method also fails to address purchases or non-purchase transactions initiated other than via a network. Lastly, the method requires a new sort of account to be established, namely, the customer's registration with the processing center.","Additional weaknesses and limitations of the prior art in general include:","Systems and methods of physical recognition: Such systems and methods require deployment, training, and support of a new purchaser and\/or merchant transaction-processing infrastructure on a wide scale (such as deployment of biometric scanners and related interfaces to payment systems) and require the physical presence of purchaser to interact with that infrastructure to complete a transaction. This solution is therefore highly limited in the scope of its application.","Systems and methods using passwords and ID codes: Generally effective for ATM and debit card transactions, such systems and methods are not used widely for credit card transactions. Passwords and codes (such as PIN codes) remain subject to theft (as by Internet hacking, card \u201cskimming\u201d, identity theft, etc.). Once a password or ID code is compromised, no further safeguards are possible, and entirely new customer accounts must be created. Passwords and ID codes are not commonly used, supported and enforced by merchants for credit card purchases.","Systems and methods using CVV2\/CVC2\/CID codes: Systems and methods utilizing such codes are presently limited to credit card accounts only, do not protect against the loss or theft, such as by hacking, of credit or debit-and-credit cards or card account numbers along with such codes, and do not prevent the fraudulent creation or subsequent modification of an account.","Systems and methods using verification of private knowledge: Such systems and methods are vulnerable to theft of private information via hacking, and identity theft. This is particularly troublesome internationally, where the most common type of private knowledge checking in the U.S. for credit card transactions, namely, an account's billing addresses, is rarely possible today abroad.","Systems and methods using smart cards: While smart cards add password (PIN) features and can also create dummy credit card numbers usable for one transaction only, systems and methods utilizing smart cards require the installation and use of a smart card reader by the user, and have thus had limited adoption by consumers. These special features are further available only when purchases are made via the computing device where the smart card reader is installed.","Systems and methods using digital signature information (\u201cE-Wallets\u201d): As with smart cards, systems and methods for e-wallets require specialized software to be installed on the computing device of the e-wallet's owner, and therefore have not been widely adopted by consumers. Their features are likewise only available for purchases made via the computing device where such software is installed.","Other limitations and weaknesses in the prior art: Notification of a transaction, and any interaction with the actual party or parties who are truly authorized to conclude and approve it, as opposed to interaction with parties who are perpetrating fraud by representing themselves as said actual, authorized parties, is generally left unaddressed by the prior art. Notification or interaction which does occur in the prior art is typically after the fact, either by the actual, authorized party's reviewing his\/her billing or account statements, by consulting his\/her credit report via a credit reporting agency, or, if the payment processor (for example, the relevant credit card processor or bank) so determines, through a follow-up telephone call from a customer service representative of such credit card processor or bank, or through other messages delivered after the fact through a variety of basic communications media. These inherently after-the-fact processes do not interrupt or halt a fraudulent remote transaction before it is completed, nor can they halt additional fraudulent transactions (which may fit within a purchaser's normal risk profile) made quickly thereafter using the same account number or other identifying information. Prior art which attempts to address the objective of verification of a transaction before it is concluded adds prohibitive requirements for the establishment, registration with, and use of intermediaries such as processing centers between customers and merchants, fails to address the objectives of notification and approval of or by third-parties, and fails to address the class of transactions comprising the opening, closing, and modification of accounts.","It is desirable to verify and authenticate a transaction, and in particular a potentially risky transaction, without relying on the installation and use of new equipment by one or more of the parties having an interest in, involved in, or represented to be involved in, said transaction, nor requiring substantial alterations to existing processes or additional education and training for conducting such transactions, nor requiring new intermediary entities to be established. It is further desirable to do so in a manner that thwarts any potential party to such a transaction who attempts to authorize or enter into it fraudulently. It is further desirable for such verification and authentication to work even when the mechanisms, systems and methods described in the prior art may already be in use but still fail to protect fully against fraud, especially when fraud is perpetrated as a result of the theft of private information. This is especially important in the area of transactions conducted remotely, and in particular electronically. It is also desirable to notify automatically the actual party or parties having legitimate authority to approve or audit a transaction, whether directly engaged in such transaction or not, of the occurrence and\/or details of said transaction. It is also desirable to be determine the behavior of any embodiment of a system and method for such notification, verification and authentication, through the use of stored profiles of parties and transaction types and other parameters, and also through profile information and other parameters which may be provided with and as part of an individual transaction.","The invention described herein provides a method and system for verifying, authenticating, and providing notification-of a transaction such as a commercial or financial transaction, with and\/or to at least one party represented or identified as engaging in said transaction or having a potential interest in said transaction or type of transaction, in particular a remote or electronic transaction, while it occurs and\/or after it occurs, via one or more of a plurality of communication links and communication addresses associated with said at least one party, so as to create a higher degree of certainty that the transaction is non-fraudulent than is possible using any of the prior art, without introducing significant delay in the completion of legitimate transactions, and without requiring implementation of new equipment or software, or learning of unfamiliar processes or technologies, or establishment and use of separate processing centers or other intermediaries.","It is an object of the invention to provide a means of verifying and authenticating the identities and intentions of one, some or all parties represented or identified as engaging in a transaction or having a potential interest in said transaction or type of transaction while it is in progress, and\/or soon thereafter;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means of accepting or obtaining information and parameters about said transaction, including information about one or more parties represented or identified as engaging in or having a potential interest in said transaction, from a transaction-processing system or device, such as a banking transaction system or credit card authorization or risk assessment system, as it is processing the transaction;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means of communications with and\/or to one or more parties having a potential interest in the transaction, some of whom may be represented as engaged in the transaction through the use of identity-related data, such as an account number or numbers;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means of defining, at the time of the transaction or in advance of the transaction, or both, which specific parties have a potential interest in a given transaction, and the nature of such interest;","It is also an object of the invention to allow said communications to occur over a plurality of communications media and\/or communications links, to increase the likelihood of successful and secure communication with and\/or to said one or more parties;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means of defining, initiating and controlling said interactions and their content;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means of obtaining and\/or storing information about the nature, communication addresses, and other parameters of said one or more parties' communications devices used for said communications, to enable additional verification and authentication of the identity or identities of said one or more parties;","It is also an object of the invention, in its preferred embodiment, to allow the behavior of said preferred embodiment to be controlled and managed under varying conditions and circumstances in accordance with stored profiles and, additionally or alternatively, in accordance with information provided along with the transaction information;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means, in its preferred embodiment, for the adapting the inventive systems' behavior based on prevailing conditions and circumstances regarding said transaction, which conditions and circumstances may change during or because of the utilization of the invention;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means of recording and remembering the details of said transaction and the result or results of any subsequent communications for later review and use by the user of the invention;","It is also an object of the invention to provide a means of reporting and\/or transmitting and\/or forwarding a result or results regarding said transaction and said result or results of said subsequent communications.","Accordingly, the invention, to address the above and other objects, provides a system and method for verifying, authenticating, and providing notification of a transaction, such as a commercial or financial transaction, with and\/or to at least one party represented or identified as engaging in said transaction or having a potential interest in said transaction or type of transaction, in particular a remote or electronic transaction, while it occurs and\/or after it occurs, and in accordance with any parameters which may be supplied in or with information about the transaction, additionally or alternatively with any profile or profiles which may be associated with the transaction.","In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the occurrence of communications with said at least one party and at least one of a plurality of communications devices and associated predetermined communications addresses known to belong to said at least one party, using at least one communications link other than the communications link used to initiate the transaction itself, isolates the transaction medium or environment from the notification and\/or verification medium or environment, such that a very high degree of accuracy and completeness of authentication and verification can be achieved with a minimum of delay, and without requiring any new authentication\/verification technologies to be implemented or learned by the transacting party or parties.","The invention goes beyond current practices by providing a highly automated means and a method for, individually and in combination:\n\n","The preferred embodiment of the invention associates one or more predetermined communications devices and addresses, such as telephone numbers or wireless SIP addresses, with a plurality of parties who may have an interest in, be involved in, or be identified as involved in, a transaction, and related identifying information, which may include an account number or credit card number. Such identity, device and address information are preferably defined and stored in advance in a non-volatile storage or database in the form of a profile associated with each such party, or are additionally or alternatively provided to the inventive system within or along with information about a specific transaction.","When a transaction is initiated with reference to such party or parties, such as via identifiers such as credit card account number(s), bank account numbers, or Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or tax identification numbers, a central system then attempts to communicate via a plurality of communications links with and\/or to one or more of said plurality of parties via at least one of each such party's known, predetermined communications device(s), to notify the party or parties of the transaction and, additionally or alternatively, to interact with the party or parties to authenticate and verify their identities, intentions and\/or approvals in regard to the transaction. The invention further provides several alternative means and methods for establishing such communications with and\/or to each such party, either in parallel or serially, in the event that the primary means and\/or method associated with each such party is not successful. Each communication or set of communications is preferably governed by logic rules, which may be predefined or dynamically determined, and which may be encoded as a script to be executed in or by the central system, said rules being determined in part based upon a categorization of the transaction, the identities or a categorization of one or more of said plurality of parties, and\/or other parameters obtained along with the information describing the transaction.","Because each such interaction occurs with the actual owner\/user of the communication device at a known and predefined communications address (such as his\/her pre-verified wireless SIP address), if any party engaged in the transaction is not the owner\/user of said predefined communications address, then 1) the interaction by definition alerts the actual owner\/user to a fraudulent transaction in progress, and 2) the fraudulent owner\/user is thwarted, because he\/she will be physically unable to authenticate him\/herself using the communications device found at said communications address. Further, even if the fraudulent party is able to obtain such a communications device belonging to the true owning\/using party, the fraudulent party must still supply further authenticating information presumed to be known only to the actual owning using party. Preferably, the communications linkage employed for such interaction is different from the communications linkage used to initiate the transaction, thereby further limiting the potential for fraud and for the theft of private information.","Additional utility may be derived when the user of the invention is in the role of a financial services organization, such as a credit card issuer, payments-processing network, merchant processor or acquirer, employing the invention alongside or within its transaction-authorization and\/or account-management processes and systems to reduce transactional risk for its merchant and\/or consumer customers. Such financial services organizations already have, in the normal course of their business, advance knowledge of potential parties to transactions, including identifying information and other parameters about such parties which may include their account numbers and their contact information, such as home telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and wireless device addresses; knowledge of transactions relating to their customers as they occur; and a presumed relationship of trust with said potential parties to transactions. Their advance knowledge and existing trust relationships minimize their effort to implement and widely deploy the invention for maximum utility. In addition to the fraud-reducing and fraud \u201cearly warning\u201d benefit of the invention, financial services organizations may also benefit from improved customer relationships through increased value-adding contacts occurring as a result of the use of the invention, and from the resulting higher level of service provided, Financial service organizations that employ the invention may also benefit from the utility of a reduced perception by their consumer and merchant customers of the risks of conducting transactions electronically or remotely. Note that the additional utility to entities in the role of financial services organizations is not inherently limited to such entities, nor is it the only additional utility they may obtain. This and other additional utility may be also be obtained by other users, whether utilizing a similar or alternative embodiment of the invention.","In the preferred embodiment of the invention, when a transaction message is received by the central system from a second system or device, the central system parses the received message, authenticates said second system or device, and then may use the parsed data values to determine or derive a set of corresponding rules that inform or define the central system's subsequent actions and subsequent communications with or to a relevant party or parties over a plurality of communication links. Such rules may be predefined, and if predefined are stored in advance in the central system's volatile and\/or nonvolatile storage memory or database(s). The central system takes a plurality of actions according to said rules.","In the preferred embodiment, the central system may establish a plurality of communications links, which may include but are not limited to wireless and landline telephony, SMS and wireless text messaging, instant messaging, and electronic mail and other Internet Protocol (IP) transmissions, in a sequence defined by said rules, to reach a plurality of parties having a potential interest in, involved in, or represented to be involved in, said transaction.

Such Groups are preferably user-definable in advance, via the mechanism of the Profile databases [Table 3] and the User Web Client [, ]. This feature of the invention creates significant advantages over the prior art, by allowing automatic inclusion of a variety of additional parties in approval, notification and auditing roles.","Each party is given a Role in accordance with its Profile [Table 3, ], if any; its inclusion via the Party Group mechanism [Table 4, ]; or, as superseded by data in the Transaction Message, per Table 1[23]. Another important advantage of the invention is the automatic assignment of Roles to the party or parties of the transaction, such that different actions may be taken in regard to each party based upon not only the party's identity but also the Role of the party in the transaction. One embodiment of the invention uses roles such as \u201cConfirm\u201d for a party that is to provide input to the inventive system, once contact has been established therewith, for example to further authenticate his\/her identity and re-approve the transaction; \u201cNotify\u201d for a party that is only to be made aware of the transaction by the inventive system, and \u201cPresent\u201d for a party with whom contact is not to be established, but whose related data and parameters are to be consulted and validated by the inventive system as part of the computation and delivery of a result message to the RTE [].","Once the incoming Transaction Message's contents are validated, the full list of target parties and their roles is defined, and all relevant name-value pairs that enable subsequent processing are established, then a software-based object or other data structure (the \u201cTransaction Object\u201d) containing these data is created in the CS's [] volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory or storage. The Transaction Object is then queued for subsequent processing by the Rules and Script Processing Layer [] (\u201cRSP\u201d) of the CS ().","The RSP [], in addition to sharing the basic elements of the CS [] as described above, is comprised of programming and database logic for the execution of both stored and dynamically-defined Action Scripts, where such Action Scripts define generalized, parameterized processes for communicating with and\/or to one or more parties. The basic functions and components of such Scripts are shown and described in detail in Table 6. The concept of fully user-programmable, adaptive, dynamic logic to control both the processing of individual transactions and the execution of the related communications with one or more of its parties is an important innovation introduced in and enhancing the value of the invention, by allowing the inventive system to perform a variety of distinct actions and sequences of actions based on each transaction's type, parties and roles, and prevailing conditions and parameters, and on the real-time progress of the transaction through the inventive system.","The RSP [] draws on the queue of work created in the CS's [] memory or other storage by the Data Messaging Layer [], each work item being one Transaction Object comprised of 1) name-value pairs describing the transaction, as manipulated by the Data Messaging Layer [] and available to scripts as Environment Variables (see Table 6), 2) an associated Script, designated as described below, and 3) an evolving set of pending and actual communications link sessions and the results thereof, further described below.","Transaction Objects may be drawn from this queue in sequential order, unless there is an overlap among the identified parties of two or more such Transaction Objects. In such a case, the following logic is preferably applied: 1) If the parties' roles are all, for example, \u201cNotify\u201d [per Table 3], the Transaction Objects may be merged, such that multiple notifications of multiple transactions may be sent to the same parties using the same communications sessions. 2) If any of the parties' roles are, for example, \u201cConfirm\u201d, then the second Transaction Object is not drawn from the queue by the RSP [] until the RSP [] has completely finished working on any prior overlapping Transaction Object(s). This gatekeeping logic creates a unique advantage by prohibiting conflicting (and potentially confusing, or inherently failure-prone) communications link attempts to the same party or parties at the same time.","The Script associated with a given Transaction Object may preferably be determined as follows. First, the Rule Set [Table 1, ] for the transaction, if identified in the incoming Transaction Message, is found in the Rules database view [Table 2] using, for example, an SQL query or stored (database) procedure. If it was not so identified, a corresponding default Rule Set matching the transaction type and party is found in the CS's [] Profiles database view [Table 3, ] using, for example, an SQL query or stored (database) procedure. If the corresponding Rule Set returned by the query is null, a System Default Rule Set may be used in its place.","Once the Rule Set is known and associated with the Transaction Object, its record in the Rule Set database view may be used to provide the following information, which may be used to control the further processing the transaction, per Table 2:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0173"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Message Templates Database View"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Stored"]},{"entry":[{},"Message",{},"Message"]},{"entry":[{},"Template","Language*","Template"]},{"entry":[{},"ID* 10a","10b","10c"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"***","***","***"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Index Key"}]}}]}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0015","list-style":"none"},"li":["Message templates consist of free-form text with embedded field substitution codes and file insertion codes, which may be of a form such as \u201c$xxx$\u201d, where \u2018xxx\u2019 is the name of an Environment Variable (see Table 6), $file:\/\/yyyyy$ where \u2018yyyyy\u2019 is a filepath on the Central System [], and $=zzzz(xxx1, xxx2, . . . )$, where \u2018zzzz\u2019 is a script function name and \u2018xxx1\u2019, \u2018xxx2\u2019, etc. are Environment Variables passed to the function identified by \u2018zzzz\u2019.

The CCL [] coordinates these patterns of communication attempts through to their logical conclusion.","The inventive system also provides, through a corresponding Communications Sequence Pattern definition, a mechanism to allow a party to initiate contact with the system within an allowed time interval, using the Environment Variable \u201cInbound\/Outbound\u201d [Table 5, ] in conjunction with \u201cAttempt Timeout Value\u201d [] and \u201cSequence Timeout Value\u201d []. For this to occur, the communication address (such as a telephone number or Instant Messaging ID) of the device used by the party must be universally and securely detectable by the appropriate Communication Subsystem interface, such as with Automatic Number Identification (ANI) service for devices using the Public Switched Telephone Network [, ] by the Telephony Interface [].","When attempting to establish contact with a party's device, the appropriate Communications Subsystem executes a cycle of attempts, the timing of which is defined by the values for the corresponding Communications Sequence Pattern's fields, shown in Table 5, specifically the values for First Attempt Delay [], Smart Retry Flag [], Maximum Number of Attempts [], and Attempts Spacing []. The use of these party- and device-specific, user-predefined parameters to guide the inventive system in its interaction attempts with a party provides the invention with the advantage of a high degree of flexibility and effectiveness in getting through to a party with a minimum of difficulty.\n\n","As shown in , in the \u201cCommunication Session\u201d process block, an active communication session with a party's device is comprised of the following generic cycle of functional execution of elements of the preferred embodiment of the inventive system and corresponding process steps:","For the first successful \u201cConfirm\u201d Role session and for all \u201cNotify\u201d sessions, as such Roles [Table 3, ; Table 4, ] and associated Scripts [, Table 6] may be defined in a given embodiment of the invention, an associated message template, per Table 7, is defined in the Environment Variables [Table 6: \u201cMessageTemplate[n]\u201d] accessible to said Script. In a typical embodiment of such a Script, as soon as a communication link session is reported as open and active by the corresponding Communications Subsystem, the Script execution process\/thread begins composing and transmitting the various segments of said message template to the communication device [, G], formatted according to the capabilities and limitations of the communication device. For example, in a telephony communication link session, the message may be reformulated by the use of a text-to-speech processor [, ], and prerecorded audio may be interpolated by the Telephony Interface [] or related IVR processor [], whereas for an Internet HTFP session using XML, the message may be reformatted using a referenced XMI, stylesheet (XLS), and text- or image-based components may be substituted for audio components of the message.","Particularly in the case of communications sessions requiring input from the reached party, the message may consist of multiple segments that are composed and delivered to the party's communication device serially by the appropriate Communications Subsystem.","If an input is indeed required [, H], and the device supports it (per the Communication Sequence Pattern [Table 5, : \u201cInteractivity Flag\u201d]), the executing Script process will preferably prompt for and wait to receive input from the party. The form of the input depends on the nature of the communication device and medium; for telephony-class devices, it is typically and preferably in the form of DTMF tones produced by touch-tone dialing or, additionally or alternatively, via voice, requiring the use of a voice recognition processor [, ]; while for Internet- and data-type devices, it is typically and preferably through a return message (such as HTML <FORM METHOD=\u201cPOST\u201d>, e-mail SMTP reply, Instant Messaging text reply); and, for a specialty device or terminal, such as an SNA\/RJE device, it is typically and preferably through a specifically formatted data exchange particular to the protocol being employed.","The Script may define whether the input must be validated before proceeding, and if so, may give the party multiple attempts to enter correct information before abandoning the attempt. Such attempts at receiving input may further be governed by Timeout parameters (see Table 6, \u201cTransaction\/Communication Session Object Properties\u201d), such that, when the indicated time has elapsed, the attempt is abandoned [, J]. In an out-of-time case, or in such case as a predefined number of input attempts is initiated over the communication link session without successful validation, the Script delivers a timeout message segment if so defined in the message template [K].","If input was prompted for, a corresponding Environment Variable flag is set (see Table 6: \u201cPartyConfirmContact[n]\u201d) to identify that a \u201cConfirm\u201d Role session has attempted to gain input required from the party.","At the conclusion of any and all input-gathering and delivery pf message segments, the communication link session is terminated (by the Communications Subsystem, and optionally by the party as well if the party reacts more quickly than the Communications Subsystem). The results may be stored [L] for use by the system later on.","If the session was successfully initiated (whether or not correct input was actually received), and was, for example, a \u201cConfirm\u201d Role session, as may have been indicated through the use of the aforesaid PartyConfirmContact[n] Environment Variable, further attempts to contact the party in a \u201cConfirm\u201d Role (or equivalent, based on the embodiment of the inventive system) are preferably disabled for the current transaction.","For all non-\u201cConfirm\u201d devices, and if a \u201cConfirm\u201d Role contact has not yet been made successfully on any \u201cConfirm\u201d Role device, for example, the processes\/threads executing the Communication Sequence Patterns in regard to the corresponding devices continue.","After the failure of an attempt, the attempt parameters and corresponding failure data provided by the appropriate Communication Subsystem are preferably logged in the system's databases or other volatile or nonvolatile memory or storage and, if there are further attempts allowed, per the effective Maximum Number of Attempts setting [Table 5, ], the thread of execution for the applicable Communication Sequence Pattern waits until the next attempt should be made, per 1) the Attempts Spacing value [] corresponding to the next attempt in the Sequence, and\/or 2) the Smart Retry setting [], as described above. This is shown in FIG. 's \u201cWait per device's attempt schedule\u201d process box [O].","If the attempt schedule is exhausted, the executing process may initiate a new process with a new Communication Sequence Pattern, if such additional Sequence is defined for use upon the unsuccessful exhaustion of the current one [Table 5, : \u201cAction on Final Failure].","This mechanism, an innovative advantage of the inventive system, allows the chaining of Communication Sequence Patterns to arbitrary lengths, executing until success occurs or the final Sequence in the chain of Sequences fails. It is also possible thereby (if only sometimes desirable) to set up an endless cycle of communication attempts through self-referencing chains of Sequences, such that the inventive system will attempt to establish contact with a party indefinitely, until successful. This is particularly useful in the case of a transaction which, by its nature and that of its parties, indicates an emergency situation, such as an authorization transaction (non-commercial in nature) regarding the entry by some party to a restricted or secured area or system, or an extremely urgent and critical commercial transaction requiring immediate confirmation by a party not otherwise directly engaged therein at the time.","It is further possible and desirable, under certain conditions, to establish an inbound Communication Sequence Pattern [Table 5, ], to be initiated by the party, as a follow-on Sequence to an outbound Sequence. For example, a wireless text message may be sent to the party's cellular telephone, which text message includes a callback hyperlink to an embodiment of the inventive system's Telephony Communications Subsystem Interface [, ]. Simultaneously, an inbound Communication Sequence Pattern is established which waits for contact from the party, similar to the underlying contact mechanism described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,163 to Bezos. The party, by responding to the callback hyperlink in the wireless text message, then interacts with the Telephony Interface and is joined to the executing process which has been waiting for his\/her inbound contact.","The following Table 11 presents component technologies which may be used by one skilled in the art to construct the communications interfaces and links shown in . .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0245"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Possible Components of Communication Subsystems Embodiments"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Additional",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"system",{}]},{"entry":["FIG.","Interface","Example","resources","Example"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["11","Telephony [211]","Intel\u2009\u00ae Dialogic\u2009\u00ae","Text to speech","Nuance"]},{"entry":[{},{},"DM\/V1200-4E1","processor","Communications,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"and D\/320-PCI","[711a]","Inc.'s Vocalizer"]},{"entry":[{},{},"voice cards, Intel\u2009\u00ae","IVR [711b]","Intel\u2009\u00ae CT Media"]},{"entry":[{},{},"CT Media software","Voice","Persay Inc.'s"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"recognition","Orpheus Speaker"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"processor","Verification"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"[711c]","Platform"]},{"entry":["12","E-mail [212]","Sendmail",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Consortium's",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Sendmail e-mailing",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"software",{},{}]},{"entry":["13","Instant Messaging","Jabber, Inc.'s",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"(PC-based and","Jabber",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"wirelsss) [213]","Communications",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Platform",{},{}]},{"entry":["14","Fax [214]","Intel\u2009\u00ae Dialogic\u2009\u00ae","Text to fax","Inso's Outside In"]},{"entry":[{},{},"DM\/F300-E1 fax","processor","Server"]},{"entry":[{},{},"cards, Intel\u2009\u00ae CT","[714a]",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Media software",{},{}]},{"entry":["15","Paging [215]","Sendmail",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Consortium's",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Sendmail (for",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"initiating SMTP-",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"based alphanumeric",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"pages)",{},{}]},{"entry":["16","Wireless Text\/SMS","Simplewire, Inc.'s",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"[216]","Java SMS",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"middleware, or",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Nokia Corp.'s",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Multimedia Email",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Gateway (and",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"SMTP-to-SMS",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"server)",{},{}]},{"entry":["17","Wireless Telephony","As Telephony","Text to speech","Nuance"]},{"entry":[{},"[217]","above","processor","Communications,"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"[711a]","Inc.'s Vocalizer"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"IVR [711b]","Intel\u2009\u00ae CT Media"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Voice","Persay Inc.'s"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"recognition","Orpheus Speaker"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"processor","Verification"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"[711c]","Platform"]},{"entry":["18","IP Telephony [218]","Intel\u2009\u00ae Dialogic\u2009\u00ae","Text to speech","Nuance"]},{"entry":[{},{},"DM\/IP301-1E1 IP","processor","Communications,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Link boards for","[711a]","Inc.'s Vocalizer"]},{"entry":[{},{},"H.323 and CT","IVR [711b]","Intel\u2009\u00ae CT Media"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Media software","Voice","Persay Inc.'s"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"recognition","Orpheus Speaker"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"processor","Verification"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"[711c]","Platform"]},{"entry":["19","Web-based (HTTP,","IBM Websphere",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"HTTPS, etc. using","Application Server",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"HTML, XML, etc.)","and HTTP Server;",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"[219]","optionally, IBM",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"MQSeries",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Everyplace",{},{}]},{"entry":["20","WAP [220]","Nokia Corp.'s",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Activ Server",{},{}]},{"entry":["21","Telex [221]",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["22","FTP [222]","IBM MQSeries",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"FTP SupportPac",{},{}]},{"entry":["23","SNA\/RJE [223]","IBM 377x","In a non-IBM","Sun Microsystems,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Emulator;

The inventive system, per its potential embodiment(s) described herein, does not purport to specifically require any particular interface type for the stated communication links or communication media, nor to require that message conversion occur within the inventive system, rather than in and by an external service provider's system(s). The full scope and capability of the inventive system and method are enumerated in the invention's claims.","Message Templates","As shown in Table 7, message templates are preferably comprised of free-form text with embedded field substitution codes and file insertion codes, which may be of a form such as \u201c$xxx$\u201d, where \u2018xxx\u2019 is the name of an Environment Variable (see Table 6), $file:(\/yyyyy$ where \u2018yyyyy\u2019 is a filepath on the Central System [], or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) accessible to the Central System [], and $=zzzz(xxx1, xxx2, . . . )$, where \u2018zzzz\u2019 is a script function name and \u2018xxx1\u2019, \u2018xxx2\u2019, etc. are Environment Variables passed to the function identified by \u2018zzzz\u2019. In the \u201cfile\u201d case, the contents of said file are inserted in the message template in place of the \u201c$file:\/\/ . . . $\u201d marker. In the other two cases, the variable or function is evaluated and the results thereof are inserted in place of the substitution marker.","The use of a URL to supply some or all message contents is a powerful innovation, because it allows remote content and even remote templates to be included dynamically and programmatically on a transaction-by-transaction basis (that is, without requiring any user-initiated changes or updates to the inventive system or its databases' contents whatsoever).","A message template is defined by an ID and by a language [], such as \u201cEnglish\u201d. Therefore, a single message template may have multiple instances across multiple languages, distinguished by the values in the \u201cLanguage\u201d field from record to record. A corresponding currency name may also be associated for use with financial content in the message template, as per Table 2 [","In some circumstances, a stylesheet retrieved and referenced by a Universal Resource Locator (URL) or Universal Resource Identifier (UDI) may be substituted for a stored message template or a message template passed to the central system [] in the incoming Transaction Message. This powerful innovation allows mark-up methods of message content definition and formatting definition to be applied remotely to the inventive system, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, dynamically and programmatically (that is, without requiring any user-initiated changes or updates to the inventive system or its databases' contents whatsoever).","Rule, Profile, Script, Communication Sequence Pattern, and Message Template Management","Prior to first use of the preferred embodiment of the inventive system, at least one entry is required in each of its various database views [Table 2-Table 5] (excluding the Group view), representing a default Rule Set, Party Profile, Communication Sequence Pattern, Action Script, and Message Template for at least one type of transaction and at least one party from one RTE []. Such data entry may be performed by an operator of the CS [] through a means such as a web-browser-based interface, as shown in  []: \u201cUser Web Client\u201d), or by remotely loading values into the database tables through a database loader utility, or by using a programmatic interface for performing remote database updates. Subsequent modifications may be performed in a like manner.","An authorized user may log into the inventive system and, upon being granted access thereby, may view data and log records related to his account and edit his\/her Profile and select from among predefined Communication.
