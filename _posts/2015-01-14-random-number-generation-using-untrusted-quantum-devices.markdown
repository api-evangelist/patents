abstract: A method of generating a sequence of random bits includes receiving a binary input signal from an input signal source and coupling the binary input signal into a plurality of components of the quantum device to initiate a random bit generation cycle. Each of the plurality of components of the quantum device produces a binary output during the random bit generation cycle, and the quantum device is configured to operate according to a non-local game during the random bit generation cycle. The method further includes maintaining isolation of the plurality of components of the quantum device during the random bit generation cycle, obtaining a plurality of binary outputs from the plurality of components of the quantum device, and producing a random bit based on the plurality of binary outputs and the binary input signal. After the random bit generation cycle, communication among the plurality of components of the quantum device is allowed.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure relates to generating random numbers and, more particularly, to methods for generating and expanding random numbers using untrusted quantum devices, the method being translatable to quantum key distribution protocols.","2. Brief Description of Related Technology","The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.","Randomness is an indispensable resource for modern day information processing. Without randomness, randomized algorithms, statistical scientific simulations, and secure cryptography would not exist. However, generating randomness is a fundamental problem that is far from fully solved. In fact, many secret keys currently in use can be broken by exploiting the insufficient randomness used in generating the keys.","Quantum mechanics is inherently random, therefore offers promising approaches to this problem. Indeed, commercial products and randomness generation, amplification, and expansion protocols to this end have started to emerge (see, e.g., \u201cRobust randomness amplifiers: Upper and lower bounds,\u201d M. Coudron, T. Vidick, and H. Yuen, volume 8096 of , pages 468-483, Springer, 2013). However, numerous challenges remain. Implementations of quantum operations are, at least in the foreseeable future, far from ideal (e.g., the implementations include unpredictable deviations or errors). These imperfections call for secure protocols that tolerate deviations of quantum devices from ideal specifications. Furthermore, users requiring high levels of security often have to purchase devices from a vendor who is not necessarily trusted. Further still, while some proposed techniques are suggested to have higher levels of security, such techniques require quantum conditions that are not attainable in the real world settings.","In accordance with one example, a method of generating a sequence of random bits comprises receiving, at a quantum device, a binary input signal from an input signal source and coupling the binary input signal into a plurality of components of the quantum device to initiate a random bit generation cycle. Each of the plurality of components of the quantum device produces a binary output during the random bit generation cycle, and the quantum device is configured to operate according to a game during the random bit generation cycle. The method further includes maintaining isolation of the plurality of components of the quantum device during the random bit generation cycle, so that each of the plurality of components of the quantum device maintains at least one of superposition or entanglement during the random bit generation cycle, obtaining a plurality of binary outputs from the plurality of components of the quantum device, and producing, at a classical controller coupled to the quantum device, a random bit based on the plurality of binary outputs and the binary input signal. Still further the method includes causing communication among the plurality of components of the quantum device after the random bit generation cycle.","In accordance with another example, a method of generating a large number of random bits from a small number of input random bits comprises determining parameters including an output length, and retrieving, from a source of random values, a plurality of binary input values. The method further includes, for each of the plurality of binary input values one of: (i) coupling a plurality of random input values from the source of random values into a plurality of components of a quantum device if the binary input value includes a first value, or (ii) coupling a string of null values into the plurality of components of the quantum device if the binary input value includes a second value different from the first value. The coupling of the plurality of random input values and the coupling of the string of null values is independent of values previously coupled into the plurality of components of the quantum devices. The method further includes, for each of the plurality of binary input values, obtaining a plurality of binary outputs from the plurality of components of the quantum device, and generating a random value based on the plurality of binary outputs and the binary input value.","In accordance with another example, a system for generating a sequence of random bits comprises a quantum device including a plurality of components. The quantum device is configured to: operate according to a game during a random bit generation cycle, produce a binary output during the random bit generation cycle, maintain isolation of the plurality of components during the random bit generation cycle, so that each of the plurality of components maintains at least one of superposition or entanglement during the random bit generation cycle, and cause communication among the plurality of components after the random bit generation cycle. The system also includes a classical controller coupled to the quantum device and configured to: receive a binary input signal from an input signal source, couple the binary input signal into the plurality of components of the quantum device to initiate the random bit generation cycle, obtain a plurality of binary outputs from the plurality of components of the quantum device, and produce a random bit based on the plurality of binary outputs and the binary input signal.","The techniques of the present disclosure provide random number generation that is quantum-secure (i.e., secure against quantum adversaries) and randomness that expands at an exponential or unbounded rate. Protocols of the present disclosure tolerate a constant, or uniform, level of imprecision in implementing each quantum operation. This constant may be close to the gap between an near optimal quantum performance and a highest level of quantum performance when devices cease to output randomness.","Further, the protocols do not require large long term quantum memory, because quantum communication between different components may be allowed, at least in-between consecutive \u201cgames\u201d of the protocols (i.e., the components may be \u201cresettable\u201d). Devices implementing the techniques may establish entanglement on-the-fly and may only need to maintain entanglement (e.g., with only a constant level of fidelity) for the duration of a single game. The game may be a non-local game in some implementations. That is, the game may be a cooperative game involving two or more players (e.g., quantum systems), where the players cannot communicate but may share common random bits or a common quantum state. However, generally, protocols of the present disclosure need not include a non-local game. In particular, the game may be a \u201ccontextuality\u201d game, in some implementations. A contextuality game is a game played by a single quantum player (e.g., quantum system), where a compatibility requirement specifies a collection of subsets of the player's quantum measurements, as discussed further below.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","104","102","104","102","104","102","104"]},"In some implementations, the quantum device  may include a plurality of components -(also labeled as D, D, . . . , D, in ), where each of the plurality of components includes a corresponding input interface -, output interface -, and quantum system -. Generally, the quantum systems -may include any suitable systems governed by quantum-mechanical principles and capable of performing operations on data or input based on those quantum-mechanical principles. The quantum systems -may represent data or input via quantum-mechanical properties, such as spin, charge, polarization, optical properties, thermal properties, magnetic properties, etc., and, in some cases, each of the quantum systems -may include one or more \u201cqubits,\u201d such as two-state quantum-mechanical systems.","By way of example and without limitation, the quantum systems -may include: (i) an lsing spin glass in which data is represented by lsing spins; (ii) non-Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter in which data is represented by braiding of anyonic quasiparticles; (iii) three dimensional (3D) lattice cluster states in which data is represented by topologically protected quantum gates; (iv) superconducting systems in which data is represented by small superconducting circuits (e.g., Josephson junctions); (v) trapped atoms, ions, or molecules (e.g., trapped by electromagnetic fields or optical lattices) in which data is represented by two or more energy levels, such as hyperfine levels; (vi) one or more quantum dots (or quantum wells) in which data is represented by confined excitations; (vii) linear optical elements in which data in represented by optical modes of photons; or (viii) Bose-Einstein condensates in which data is represented by one or more energetically protected two-level states. It is understood, that any suitable quantum system may represent data or input via quantum-mechanical properties and perform operations on that data based on the quantum-mechanical properties.","Preparation or manipulation of the quantum systems -and extraction of results from the quantum systems -may include measurements performed by the corresponding input interfaces -and the corresponding output interface -, in some implementations. For example, in a case in which the quantum systems -include topologically ordered phases of matter (e.g., as in a topological quantum computer), the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include one or more interferometers to perform quasiparticle braiding, topological charge measurement, and\/or other topologically transformative manipulations. Alternatively, in the case in which the quantum systems -include superconducting systems, the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include various superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to measure magnetic properties with high sensitivity. It is understood, however, that the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include any appropriate combination of hardware, classical computer processing, and\/or software components configured to measure, manipulate, and\/or otherwise interact with the quantum systems -","Further, some or all of the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may be controlled by or communicate with the classical controller  in order to measure, manipulate, and\/or otherwise interact with the quantum systems -, in an implementation. For example, the input interfaces -may receive input data values (e.g., input bits) from the classical controller  that are subsequently encoded in the quantum systems -via operations (e.g., measurements) performed by the input interfaces -. Likewise, the output interfaces -may communicate results, obtained via measurements performed on the quantum systems -, to the classical controller  for further processing or utilization. In some cases, the classical controller  may implement software applications, via computer-readable instructions, that control all or some of the functionality of the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -. For example, the classical controller  may control when (e.g., periodically or at pre-defined times) and how (e.g., with what parameters, such as intensity, voltage, etc.) the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -perform measurements on the quantum systems -","In some implementations, the plurality of components -are configured such that information cannot be exchanged among the plurality of components -during certain quantum operations, such as random number generation, randomness expansion, or quantum key distribution. For example, the plurality of components -may be disposed in locations far apart from one another so as to ensure that during the period of generating a bit of a random number, the plurality of components -cannot exchange information due to a limit imposed by special relativity (i.e., information cannot travel faster than the speed of light). Such a separation of the plurality of components -may be referred to as \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cin isolation\u201d herein. In general, quantum communication or a quantum exchange of information may include any intentional or accidental coupling with an environment (e.g., a coupling that includes a decoherence of quantum states).","In other implementations, the plurality of components -are configured such that information cannot be exchanged among the plurality of components -during certain stages or phases of a quantum operation, while information can be exchanged during other stages or phases of the quantum operation. For example, the plurality of components -may be disposed in locations such that during one iteration of a protocol, such as the protocols discussed with reference to , information cannot be exchanged between the plurality of components -, while information can be exchanged in between iterations. Such a configuration of the plurality of components -may be referred to as \u201cresettable\u201d or \u201cbeing reset\u201d herein. In this manner, protocols may be implemented with reduced complexity, in some cases. For example, the quantum device  may establish entanglement \u201con-the-fly\u201d and needs only to maintain the entanglement (e.g., with a constant level of fidelity) for the duration of a single protocol iteration.","Communications between the classical controller  and the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include classical communications, in an implementation, facilitated by a control and measurement link . The control and measurement link  may carry communications from the classical controller to the interfaces -and -via electromagnetic signals (e.g., current signals) on a current-carrying conductor, such as a ribbon, coaxial, twisted pair, universal serial bus (USB), or other cable. The control and measurement link  may, in some implementations, carry encoded digital signals between the classical controller  and the interfaces -and -, such as signals encoded according to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) standard, Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCR), High-Speed LAN Instrument Protocol (HiSLIP), LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI), PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), etc. In general, the control and measurement link  may include any suitable wired and\/or wireless components, links, modems, routers, cables, buses, etc. allowing the classical controller  to communicate with and\/or control the quantum device .","The classical controller  may include various interfaces, implemented in any suitable combination of hardware and software, allowing the classical controller  to communicate with the quantum device  and various other devices or components. In particular, the classical controller  may include an instrument control interface  configured to send\/receive control signals (voltages, currents, digitally encoded messages, etc.) to and from the quantum device , respectively. The classical controller  may also include a data acquisition (DAQ) interface , such as a DAQ PCI card, to receive measurement values from the quantum device  (e.g., from the output interfaces -) and a network interface  allowing the classical controller  to communicate with various other network-enabled devices .","Users of the network-enabled devices  may interact with the classical controller  via a network  and network interface . The network-enabled devices  may include, by way of example, a network-enabled cellular wireless terminal, a phone, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, a server computer, a cluster of server computers, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smartphone, a laptop computer, a wearable wireless communication device such as a wearable computer, a portable media player, an e-reader, or other similar devices (not shown). Of course, any network-enabled device appropriately configured may interact with the classical controller  to, for example, generate a random number, expand a random number, and\/or generate or retrieve a quantum key. In some examples, the network-enabled devices  represent a network-enabled enterprise in communication with the classical controller  of another network-enabled enterprise. Example enterprises, including any two enterprises desiring to establish shared secured communications, such as a design enterprise creating intellectual property (e.g., an integrated circuit designer) and a manufacturing enterprise (fabrication enterprise or foundry).","The network  may be a proprietary network, a secure public Internet, a virtual private network or some other type of network, such as dedicated access lines, plain ordinary telephone lines, satellite links, combinations of these, etc. Where the network  comprises the Internet, data communication may take place over the network  via an Internet communication protocol. The network  may communicate with the network-enabled devices  through wireless or wired connections. Further, in some examples, the network  is a mobile (or cellular) communication network.","The network-enabled devices  need not necessarily communicate with the network  via a wired connection. In some instances, the network-enabled devices  may communicate with the network  via wireless signals; and, in some instances, the network-enabled devices  may communicate with the network  via an intervening wireless or wired device, which may be a wireless router, a wireless repeater, a base transceiver station of a mobile telephony provider, etc., or other access point.","The classical controller  also includes a program memory  and one or more processors  (e.g., microcontrollers or microprocessors). The program memory  may include an assortment of computer-readable media implemented as semiconductor memories, magnetically readable memories, and\/or optically readable memories, for example. Computer-readable media may be any media that may be accessed by the classical controller . By way of example, and not limitation, the media may include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. Media may also include computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media that stores information such as computer-readable instructions, program modules, data structures, or other data. Computer-storage media may include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, or other memory technology, optical storage disks, magnetic storage devices, and any other medium which may be used to store computer-accessible information. Communication media may be computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal or other transport mechanism. Communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as RF, infrared, and other wireless media.","The program memory  may store a basic input\/output system (BIOS), containing algorithms to transfer information between components within the classical controller . Also, data or program modules that are immediately accessible or are presently in use by the one or more processors  may be stored in the program memory . Data normally stored in the program memory  while the classical controller  is in operation may include an operating system, application programs, program modules, and program data. In particular, the program memory  may store a random number generation program , a randomness expansion program , and a quantum key distribution program , as discussed further with reference to . Programs, such as the programs , , and , may, in some implementations, provide input to or process output from the quantum device . That is, some functionality related to random number generation, randomness expansion, and quantum key distribution may be implemented by the classically executed programs , , and , whereas other functionality related to random number generation, randomness expansion, and quantum key distribution may be implemented according to quantum-mechanical principles by the quantum device .","The classical controller  may also be communicatively coupled to a database . The database  may include storage media such as a hard disk drive that may read from or write to non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive that reads from or writes to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk, and an optical disk drive that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk. Other storage media that may be used includes magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, and solid state ROM. The database  may store results from computations performed by the quantum device , such as random numbers, quantum keys, etc. In addition, the database  may store instructions, rules, or other information allowing the classical controller  to execute corresponding functionality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2A-2D","FIGS. 2A-2D","FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"In particular  is a block diagram of an example system  in which a network-enabled device (labeled \u201cA\u201d in ) and a network-enabled device (labeled \u201cB\u201d in ) may interact with a classical controller , where the classical controller  is communicatively and\/or operatively connected to a quantum device .

In general, the number j may be any suitable number, such as one, two, three, etc. up to n\u22121.

Generally, non-local games may differ in scenarios in which the games are \u201cplayed\u201d by, or implemented in, systems operating according to classical mechanics as compared to scenarios in which the games are \u201cplayed\u201d by, or implemented in, systems operating according to quantum mechanics. An example non-local game is a cooperative game involving two or more players (e.g., quantum systems). The players cannot communicate but may share common random bits or a common quantum state. A controller, or other suitable device, may send an input to one of the players who then responds with an answer. Winning, in the non-local game, may include satisfying a condition dependent on the inputs from the controller (e.g., inputs from a known probability distribution).","During each iteration of the protocol , which iteration produces a random value or bit, the quantum device plays the game G. That is, the quantum device receives an input, g, for a single round of the game and operates such that a result is produced. G may include any binary Exclusive Or (XOR) game (e.g., a game where inputs and outputs are binary), such as a game with a scoring function depending on the inputs and the XOR of the outputs, where the binary XOR game is strongly self-testing, in an implementation. The game G may be strongly self-testing, or non-local, in that any strategy that is close (within an value \u03b5, or \u03b5-close) to optimal in its winning probability must be O(\u221a\u03b5)-close to a unique optimal strategy in both its state and its measurements, in an implementation. In this case, the term \u201cstrongly\u201d refers to the O(\u221a\u03b5) term, which is the best possible asymptotic bound for a non-local game. By way of example, strong self-testing games may include the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) game, but it is understood that the protocol  may utilize any such binary XOR game. Although, strong self-testing, or non-local games are discussed above and below by way of example and for clarity, some implementations of protocols for generating random numbers may utilize other contextuality games along with or as an alternative to non-local games, as further discussed with reference to .","The protocol  may include the following parameters, in an implementation: (i) N, a positive integer representing the output length; (ii) \u03b7, a real \u03b5 (0, 1] representing the abort threshold; (iii) q, a real \u03b5 (0, \u00bd] representing the test frequency; (iv) G, an n-player non-local game that is a strong self-test; and (v) D, an untrusted quantum device (e.g., a device provided by or operated by an untrusted party) that can play G repeatedly and cannot receive any additional information. In a single iteration (i.e., use of the protocol) the components  and  may not communicate, but, in between iterations, the components  may communicate. For any real \u03c9 \u03b5 (0, 1), the protocol , with appropriate parameters, converts any k uniform bits to exp(\u03a9(k)) extractible bits with exp(\u2212\u03a9(k)) error under a constant level of noise, in an implementation.","In some implementations, quantum-proof randomness extractors are applied to the outputs of the protocol  to produce near perfect random output from the protocol . The quantum-proof randomness extractors may be deterministic functions Ext(X, S) on two arguments: (i) X being the source, which in this case may be the output of the protocol ; and (ii) S being a perfectly random seed. The extractors Ext(X, S) may, in an implementation convert any N bits X that have min-entropy \u03a9(N) to a near perfect output randomness of length \u03b8(N).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","300","400","102"]},"To begin, a bit g \u03b5 {0, 1} is determined (block ). In an implementation, the bit input bit g may be determined according to a biased (1-q, q) distribution. It is understood, however, that the input bit g may be received from a random, or quasi-random (e.g., based at least partially on a deterministic function), source or determined according to any suitable distribution, as further discussed with reference to .","Next, it is determined if g=1 (block ). If g=1, the iteration of the method  is determined to be a \u201cgame round,\u201d and an input string is determined at random (block ). In some cases, the input string may be determined from {0, 1}, according a probability distribution specified by the game G, and given to a quantum device executing the method . On the other hand, if g=0, an input string {00 . . . 0} is input (e.g., form the classical controller ) to components of the quantum device implementing the method  (block ).","Note, a choice of {00 . . . 0} for cases in which g=0 may assume that {00 . . . 0} is among those inputs on which the optimal quantum strategy wins with the largest probability, in an implementation. In general, {00 . . . 0} may be replaced by any string on which the optimal quantum strategy wins the game G with the largest probability.","After inputting or coupling the binary input g into the components of the quantum device, the outputs of the quantum device components are measured (block ). Depending on (i.e., based on) the measured output of the quantum device components and the rules of game G, a result value is determined and recorded (block ). For example, in the case of a \u201cgame round,\u201d a \u201cP\u201d (pass) or an \u201cF\u201d (fail) may be recorded according to the rules of the game G. In the case of g=0, a \u201cH\u201d (heads) may be recorded when the output from the first component is zero; otherwise, a \u201cT\u201d (tails) may be recorded. In general, any type of binary, numeric, alphabetic, or symbolic result values may be determined based on the output of the quantum device components.","It is then determined if N result values have been calculated based on the procedure of blocks - (block ). If the number of result values that have been generated is less than N, the flow continues to block  where the quantum components may be reset (e.g., causing quantum communication between quantum device components), in an implementation, and subsequently reverts back to block  where the process of generating another result value is initiated. If the number of result values equals N, the resulting sequence of values (e.g., N-length sequence from the alphabet {P, F, H, T}) is output for subsequent storage or utilization. For example, the resulting sequence may be stored by a classical controller, such as the classical controller , for use as a random number or key.

This generalization may be crucial for the carrying over of results into a fully device-independent setting.","Simulation Results for Partially Trusted Devices:","A second insight enabling, at least in some cases, properties of the protocols discussed herein is that nonlocal games simulate partially trusted devices. When certain nonlocal games are played\u2014even with a device that is completely untrusted\u2014their outcomes may match the behavior of a device that is partially trusted.","To illustrate this, a class of devices is formalized as follows. Definition: Let n be a positive integer. A \u201cbinary quantum device\u201d with n components D=(D, . . . , D) include the following:\n\n","The behavior of the device D is as follows: at round i, the devices first collectively perform the unitary operation U, and then, according to their inputs b, each performs binary measurements specified by the operators M. (This device model allows communication in between rounds, in an implementation)","Now a somewhat more specific type of device is defined. Suppose that E is a single-part binary quantum device. Say that E is a partially trusted device with parameters (u, v) if the measurement operators Nthat E uses on input 1 decompose as:\n\n=()+(),\n\nwhere Pis perfectly anti-commutative with the other measurement N, and Qsatisfies \u2225Q\u2225\u22661 (and is otherwise unspecified). Essentially, the device behaves as follows. On input 0, it performs a perfect measurement. On input 1, it does one of the following at random: it performs a perfectly anti-commuting measurement (probability=v), or it performs an unknown measurement (probability=u\u2212v), or it ignores its quantum system and merely outputs a perfect coin flip (probability=1\u2212u). (The second possibility is referred to herein as a \u201cdishonest mistake,\u201d and the third is referred to herein as an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d)\n","Proving that untrusted devices can be simulated by partially trusted devices is an example of a task that is fairly easy in the classical security context but difficult in the quantum context. For example, if one knows that a quantum device performs at a superclassical level at a particular nonlocal game, then one knows that its outcomes are at least partly random, and thus can be \u201csimulated\u201d by a biased coin flip (or a \u201cpartially trusted\u201d coin flip). But to prove quantum security one needs a stronger notion of simulationone that allows for the possibility quantum side information.","The basis for a simulation result may be certain known properties of quantum self-testing. Games from the class of strong self-tests are considered (although, as discussed further above, contextuality games may also be implemented in one or more protocols discussed herein):","Theorem.

Then, there exist constants q, \u03b7, b, c>0 such that the following holds. If Protocol R is executed with arguments (N, q, \u03b7, G, D), where q<q, \u03b7<\u03b7, and if the success probability is at least 2, then\n\n(,succ)\u2267(1\u2212\u03b4)\n\nwhere \u03b5=\u221a{square root over (2)}\u00b72.\n\nUntrusted-Device Quantum Key Distribution\n","To adapt the randomness expansion protocols of the current disclosure to achieve simultaneously randomness expansion and key distribution, the Information Reconciliation (IR) stage is considered below. An implementation may require that the amount of leaked information does not reduce the asymptotic quantity of the smooth min-entropy. Furthermore, an implementation may not include too much randomness. As such, Alice and Bob may be assumed to have access to a linear (in the output length) amount of shared randomness (which does not need to be secure against the adversary).","Further, to require that the amount of leaked information does not reduce the asymptotic quantity of the smooth min-entropy, an Azuma-Hoeffding Inequality may be applied to show that, other than a chance of the same order as the expansion soundness error, Alice and Bob's strings differ by at most a \u00bd\u2212\u03bb fraction, for some constant \u03bb. A randomized protocol may then be constructed through which Bob recovers Alice's string without consuming too much randomness and in an efficient manner in terms of time complexity.","Central results relevant to QKD is included below. The notion of soundness and completeness errors are similarly defined: the soundness error may be the distance of the output distribution to a mixture of aborting and an output randomness of a desired smooth min-entropy, and the completeness error may be the probability of aborting for an honest (possibly noisy) implementation.","Corollary: For any strong self-test G, there exists a constant s such that for any \u03b4>0, there exist positive constants q, \u03b7, N, b, c such that the following holds when Protocol R(see ) is executed with q\u2266q, \u03b7\u2266\u03b7, and N\u2267N.\n\n","The proof for the above Corollary may include two steps. The first may show that when Protocol R is run, other than an exp(\u2212\u03a9(qN)) probability, A and B differ in at most a (\u00bd\u2212\u03bb) fraction. The second step may include constructing the efficient IR Protocol for Bob to correct the differences with some small failure probability. Note, the protocol Rmay apply to a broader class of games than the strong self-tests.","Additional Considerations","Throughout this specification, plural instances may implement components, operations, or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.","Additionally, certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of routines, subroutines, applications, or instructions. These may constitute either software (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware. In hardware, the routines, etc., are tangible units capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connects the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of the example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but also deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but also deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.","Unless specifically stated otherwise, discussions herein using words such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d \u201cpresenting,\u201d \u201cdisplaying,\u201d or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine (e.g., a computer) that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic, magnetic, or optical) quantities within one or more memories (e.g., volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or a combination thereof), registers, or other machine components that receive, store, transmit, or display information.","As used herein any reference to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Some embodiments may be described using the expression \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected\u201d along with their derivatives. For example, some embodiments may be described using the term \u201ccoupled\u201d to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term \u201ccoupled,\u201d however, may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d \u201chaving\u201d or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, \u201cor\u201d refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).","In addition, use of the \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the description. This description, and the claims that follow, should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise.","This detailed description is to be construed as an example only and does not describe every possible embodiment, as describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible.
