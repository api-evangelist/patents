{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/996,074, filed Oct. 26, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with U.S. government support under grant number DE-FG02-99ER45775 from the Basic Energy Sciences, Department of Energy. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a novel molecular alloy of Oand Hand a method of producing such a molecular alloy.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","HO forms at least 15 stable (1) and metastable crystalline (2-5) and amorphous ices (6-9). Its rich phase diagram displays a range of exotic behavior such as symmetric hydrogen bonds (10-12), superionic ice (13, 14), and multiple critical points (15, 16).","Applicants excited HO with high-energy x-radiation in order to access a larger portion of the energy landscape at high pressure. Although at ambient pressure x-rays are known to produce metastable free radicals in molecular systems or to induce stable reactions by overcoming kinetic energy barriers, documented examples of x-ray induced transitions at high pressure have been extremely rare.","Broadly stated, the present invention is directed to a novel molecular alloy of Oand Hand a method of producing such a molecular alloy. The compound of the present invention has never been produced before.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and will be apparent from the description, or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims.","To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described, applicants disclose that when subjected to high pressure and extensive x-radiation, HO molecules cleaved, forming O\u2014O and H\u2014H bonds. In the method of the present invention, the O and H framework in ice VII was converted into a molecular alloy of Oand H. X-ray diffraction, x-ray Raman scattering, and optical Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that this crystalline solid differs from previously known phases. It remained stable with respect to variations in pressure, temperature, and further x-ray and laser exposure, thus opening new possibilities for studying molecular interactions in the fundamental O\u2014Hsystem.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.","Reference will now be made in detail to the present invention and preferred embodiments.","Applicants observed the x-ray and pressure-induced cleaving of HO in an oxygen K-edge study with a high-pressure x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) technique (5, 17-19) that requires long exposure of moderately high energy (\u02dc10 keV) x-radiation. For oxygen bonded with hydrogen in HO, the K-edge XRS spectra are dominated by a cluster of peaks around 540 eV as shown in dense water below 0.9 GPa, ice VI between 1 and 2 GPa, and ice VII just above 2 GPa (). At pressures above 2.5 GPa, however, x-radiation induced dramatic, irreversible changes in the XRS spectra. A distinctive, sharp peak appeared at 530 eV characteristic of O\u2014O bonding in Oand grew with time, reaching a plateau after 6 hours of exposure to the incident x-ray beam (). The plateau intensity increased with increasing pressure, and at 15.3 GPa, the height of the 530 eV peak matched that of the main 540 eV multiplet. Applicants observed the reaction independently at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and SPring-8 during high-pressure XRS measurements of HO (). Visually, the sample changed from colorless to light brown after the conversion (). Optical Raman scattering (ORS) measurements showed intense, characteristic Hand Ovibrons and a diminished HO signal (), clearly demonstrating the dissociation of HO molecules and the recombination into Oand Hmolecules.","The resultant Oand Hmolecules did not exist in the known high pressure phases of hcp-Hand \u03b5-O, but formed an alloy consisting of both molecular Oand H. To better understand this material, applicants varied x-ray energy and exposure time, interval between exposure and measurement, pressure, and temperature, and studied the samples with ORS and x-ray diffraction (XRD). At 17.6 GPa after x-radiation, the OH vibrational modes around 3000 cmbecame diminishingly weak and exhibited a different shape in comparison to ice VII (), indicating that the HO molecules had mostly cleaved, leaving only a minor component in the new O\u2014Halloy. One can rule out the hcp-H, and \u03b5-Ophases based on their characteristic ORS spectra. The intense Q(1) Hmolecular vibron at 4304 cm() is 59 cmabove the Q(1) of pure hcp-H(4245 cm) (20). The weak side peak at 4236 cmindicates a small amount (<5%) of Hin a different site or possibly in a new secondary phase. The Hmolecular rotons: S(0), S(1), and S(2) at 360, 610, and 847 cm, respectively, are characteristic of freely rotating Hmolecules. The OORS vibron frequency (1577 cm) is similar to that of \u03b5-O(21, 22), but the intense, low-frequency, librational peaks at 123 and 272 cm) are substantially lower in frequency than the characteristic, \u03bdand \u03bdmodes of \u03b5-Oat 155 and 360 cm, respectively, indicating that this is not \u03b5-O. The observation of a single Ovibron and a predominant Hvibron is consistent with a new alloy conserving the O:Hratio of approximately 1:2, i.e. (O)(H), although we cannot rule out the possibility of a minor secondary phase with a different O:Hratio, corresponding to the weak Hside peak at 4236 cm.","The Hvibron stiffening in mixed crystals have been used extensively to reveal information on matrix isolation and intermolecular interactions of H(23, 24). The vibron turnover of pure hcp-H(20) shifts to higher pressure in the mixed crystals, and the effect increases with increasing molecular fraction of other molecules such as Ne, HD, and D(23, 24). In the present sample, the main Hvibron shows substantial stiffening, which suggests that a large amount of Omolecules are present (). The pressure shifts of the ORS Olibrational peaks and Hvibrons are shown in  and compared with corresponding peaks of hcp-Hand \u03b5-O. Similar pressure dependence and constant offset of ORS peaks of the present alloy with respect to the pure endmembers indicates these peaks have similar origins but different matrices effects,","Applicants conducted XRD studies of the H\u2014Oalloy at beamline 16-IDB of HPCAT, APS, ANL. Sharp powder diffraction rings indicate that the alloy is a well-crystallized solid. Its diffraction pattern () shows some similarity to, but does not exactly fit, \u03b5-O(25-27). For instance, they both have a multiplet group between 2-2.4 \u212b, and the alloy has a doublet near 3.4 \u212b where \u03b5-Ohas a singularly strong peak (25). At this point, it is premature to present a definitive crystal structure or unit cell based on only 10 powder XRD lines. The d-spacings of the alloy, \u03b5-O, and ice VII vary similarly with pressure implying that all have similar compressibilities ().","Once synthesized and kept at high pressure, the new phase was stable with respect to laser exposure, further x-radiation, and being stored for time intervals of over 120 days. Bubbles of O-Hgaseous mixture (identified by ORS) were released from the solid when the pressure was reduced below 1 GPa (). When these bubbles were compressed to high pressures and irradiated with x-rays again they reformed the new alloy (). Formation of this material has thus been approached from both directions: starting with HO and with an O\u2014Hmixture. Heated in a diamond-anvil cell, the alloy is stable up to 700 K at 15 GPa. At higher temperature, this material reverts to ice VII near melting.","Partial dissociation of ice VII was previously observed by Lin et al. (28) in high pressure-temperature experiments of HO, but the reaction conditions and products were different. At high temperature and without x-radiation Lin et al. detected a minor amount of \u03b5-O(but no H) as a result of hydrogen loss to the metal gasket. The present observation differs from the reported high-pressure study of hydrogen peroxide, HO, which transformed to a high-pressure phase HO-II, or decomposed to HO +O, but did not produce any Hmolecules (29). The present observation also differs from the previously reported (O)(H)phase at 7.5-10 GPa (30) which was unstable and combusted during x-radiation. Moreover, the Oand HORS vibrons of the (O)(H)phase agree with those of \u03b5-Oand hcp-Hrespectively and thus differ from our alloy.","The kinetic stability of the new material implies that there is an energy minimum separated from ice VII by a large energy barrier. The barrier may be too high to cross by thermal excitation alone, as it has not been observed in high P-T experiments up to 1000 K (14, 28) which is equivalent to 0.08 eV. The 10 keV x-rays we used provide access to a large range of local energy minimum states including both ground and trapped excited electronic states of Oand H. It may be puzzling why this new phase was not discovered earlier in hundreds of previous XRD studies of high-pressure ices. Applicants conducted a reconnaissance study using several different monochromatic x-ray energies of 9.687, 9.886, 14.414 and 33.678 keV. The x-ray-induced reaction in ice VII was most effective with the 9.687 and 9.886 keV x-radiation, which are absorbed readily by HO, was less effective with 14.414 keV x-radiation, and was not observed with 33.678 keV high-energy x-radiations which passed through HO without adequate absorption. High-pressure synchrotron XRD studies typically use high-energy x-radiation above 20 keV with short exposure times of seconds to minutes; this would be insufficient to induce the reaction. On the other hand, low-energy x-radiation below 12 keV would be largely absorbed by the diamond anvils, and are seldom used for XRD studies. In our experiments the \u02dc10 keV x-rays pass through the low-absorbance Be gasket and provide optimal conditions for inducing the reaction.","As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
