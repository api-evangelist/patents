{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0116819, filed on Nov. 23, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to semiconductor memory devices, and more particularly, to a device and method for storing error information in a memory device, which is applicable to any semiconductor memory chip.","In the early stage of the memory semiconductor industry, a larger number of original good dies, which had no defective cell in a memory chip that passed through a semiconductor fabrication process, were distributed on a wafer. However, as the memory capacity has increased, it has become difficult to fabricate a memory chip without a defective cell. At the present time, there is a small chance that a memory chip will be fabricated without a defective cell.","In order to overcome this limitation, a method for replacing a defective memory cell with a spare memory cell (i.e., a redundancy memory cell) has been proposed. In order to replace a defective memory cell with a redundancy memory cell, a solution thereof must be calculated by using external equipment. Research is being conducted to install such a repair circuit (i.e., a memory self-repair circuit) in a memory chip.","Three main parameters to be considered for a memory self-repair circuit may be an area, a repair rate, and an analysis speed of a repair circuit. The area is a parameter connected directly with the semiconductor chip fabrication cost. The repair rate is an important parameter connected with the yield of a semiconductor device. The analysis speed of a repair circuit may also be regarded as a parameter connected directly with the semiconductor chip fabrication cost, because it is proportional to a test time.","A repair most method is disclosed in the prior art (e.g., M. Tarr, D. Boudreau, and R. Murphy, \u201cDefect analysis system speeds test and repair of redundant memories\u201d, Electronics, vol. 57, pp. 175-179, Jan. 12, 1984). A repair most method stores the number of defective cells of each row\/column address detected during a test process, compares the number of defective cells of each row\/column address after completion of the test process, and replaces a defective memory cell with a redundancy memory cell in descending order of the number of defects at an address. However, the repair most method of the prior art utilizes a large area because it requires a large-capacity buffer for storing a defective bit map. Also, the repair most method of the prior art may have a long defect analysis\/repair time because it can perform a defect repair operation only after completion of a test process.","A local repair most method is also disclosed in the prior art (e.g., C.-T. Huang, C.-F. Wu, J.-F. Li, and C.-W. Wu, \u201cBuilt-in Redundancy Analysis for Memory Yield Improvement\u201d, IEEE Trans. Reliability, vol. 52, pp. 386-399, December 2003). The local repair most method of the prior art uses a small-sized defect bit map to reduce the area while applying a method similar to the repair most method. However, the local repair most method of the prior art cannot store all information for efficient repairs due to a small-sized bit map, and cannot repair more than a predetermined number of defects due to insufficient information stored (i.e., cannot repair defects due to insufficient information even in the case of sufficient redundancy memory), thus reducing the repair rate.","Also, an essential spare pivot method has been disclosed. The essential spare pivot method stores only core defect addresses instead of a defect bit map in order to reduce the area. Therefore, a defect address collecting process is performed during a test process, thus improving the analysis speed of a self-test circuit. However, a register capacity for storing defect addresses is insufficient, thus reducing the repair rate.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a defect address storing device that can store all information regarding defective cells in a reduced area.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are also directed to a device and method for storing error information of a memory device, which can improve the analysis speed of a self-repair circuit including a defect address storing device by storing defective cell addresses in the defect address storing device in real time during a test process.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a device for storing error information of a memory device includes a plurality of parent memories each storing a row address and a column address of one defective cell and a plurality of child memories each storing a column address of a defective cell, having a row address identical to a row address stored in the corresponding parent memory, or storing a row address of a defective cell, having a column address identical to a column address stored in the corresponding parent memory, wherein each of the parent memories stores first information about whether a row repair must be performed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory and second information about whether a column repair must be performed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory.","The first information stored in each of the parent memories may indicate a row repair must be performed when the number of defective cells with the same row address exceeds the number of redundancy columns. The second information stored in each of the parent memories may indicate a column repair must be performed when the number of defective cells the same column address exceeds the number of redundancy rows.","In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a device for storing error information of a memory device includes a plurality of parent memories each storing a column address, a row address, a column must-repair flag for the column address and a row must-repair flag for the row address and a plurality of child memories each storing an address, address information indicating whether the address is a row address or a column address and pointer information indicating which one of the parent memories correspond to the child memory.","The column must-repair flag may be activated if the number of defective cells with the same column address exceeds the number of redundancy rows. The row must-repair flag may be activated if the number of defective cells the same row address exceeds the number of redundancy columns.","In accordance with still another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a method for storing error information of a memory device in a fault information storing device including a plurality of parent memories and a plurality of child memories, includes ignoring a defective cell if the defective cell belongs to a row or a column classified as a must repair, indicating that the row or column has been classified as a must repair in the parent memory storing the row or column, if the row or column of the defective cell is to be classified as a new must repair, and storing information about the defective cell in one of the parent memories or one of the child memories if the ignoring and the indicating operations are not performed.","The indicating operation may include activating a row must-repair flag of the parent memory storing the row of the defective cell if the number of defective cells belonging to the row exceeds the number of redundancy columns, and activating a column must-repair flag of the parent memory storing the column of the defective cell if the number of defective cells belonging to the column exceeds the number of redundancy rows.","In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a memory device includes a memory cell array, comprising a plurality of memory cells arranged in rows and columns, and a fault information storing device configured to store row addresses and column addresses of defective memory cells and to store a row must-repair flag and a column must-repair flag.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Throughout the disclosure, like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures and embodiments of the present invention.","First, a repair rate and a defect classification method will be described for a better understanding of the present invention.","A. Repair Rate","A repair rate is defined as Equation 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["Repair","Rate"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Number","of","Repaired","Chips"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},{"mi":["Number","of","Repairable","Chips"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}]}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"The optimal repair rate is 100%. The repair rate becomes 100% if one or more solutions can be found whenever a defect is repairable. In Equation 1, the denominator is the number of repairable chips. Therefore, the impossibility of finding a solution for an unrepairable case (i.e., the case where the number of defects exceeds the number of defects that can be covered by redundancy memory cells) does not affect the repair rate. In order to increase the repair rate, a fault information storing device preferably stores all information for a repair operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Reference character \u2018Rs\u2019 denotes the number of redundancy rows, and reference character \u2018Cs\u2019 denotes the number of redundancy columns. Hereinafter, it is assumed that Rs=2 and Cs=2.","B. Classification of Defects","(1) Single Fault","A single fault refers to the case when there is no other defective cell at a column address and a row address where a defective cell is located. Referring to , a defective cell A located at row  and column  is classified as a single fault because there are no other defective cells in row  and no other defective cells in column .","A single fault may be repaired by replacing it with one redundancy row or one redundancy column. For example, the defective cell A of  may be repaired by replacing row  with a redundancy row or replacing column  with a redundancy column.","(2) Sparse Faulty Line","When there are k (where 1<k\u2266Cs) defective cells at a row address, the k defective cells are collectively referred to as a row line fault. Also, when there are j (where 1<j\u2266Rs) defective cells at a column address, the j defective cells are collectively referred to as a column line fault. Thus, the defective cells B of  are classified as a row line fault.","A row line fault may be repaired by replacing the k defective cells with one redundancy row or k redundancy columns. Also, a column line fault may be repaired by replacing the j defective cells with one redundancy column or j redundancy rows. For example, the defective cells B of  may be repaired by replacing row  with a redundancy row or replacing columns , , and  with redundancy columns.","(3) Must-Repair Faulty Line","When there are k (where k>Cs) defective cells at a row address, the k defective cells are collectively referred to as a row must-repair fault line (or a must-repair faulty row line). Also, when there are j (where j>Rs) defective cells at a column address, the j defective cells are collectively referred to as a column must-repair fault line (or a must-repair faulty column line). Thus, the defective cells C of  are classified as a row must-repair fault line because the number of defective cells with the same row address (e.g., row ) is , which is greater than the number of redundancy columns Cs, which is 2.","A row must-repair fault line must be repaired by replacing it with a redundancy row. Likewise, a column must-repair fault line must be repaired by replacing it with a redundancy column. For example, the defective cells C of  must be repaired by replacing row  with a redundancy row.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring to , a fault information storing device in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of parent memories PM_-PM_X and a plurality of child memories CM_-CM_Y. Each of the parent memories PM_-PM_X stores a column address and a row address of one defective cell, and also stores information about whether a row repair is needed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory (i.e., whether a row must-repair fault line exists) and information about whether a column repair must be needed to repair a defective cell stored in the parent memory (i.e., whether a column must-repair fault line exists). Each of the child memories CM_-CM_Y stores a column address of a defective cell having a row address identical to the row address stored in the corresponding parent memory, or stores a row address of a defective cell having a column address identical to the column address stored in the corresponding parent memory.","Each of the parent memories PM_-PM_X stores information about a defective cell having no overlapping address among the row addresses and the column addresses of the defective cells stored in another parent memory, among the defective cells detected as a result of a test process. For example, if an address of row  and column  is not stored in another parent memory at the time of detection of a defective cell at row  and column , the address of the defective cell at row  and column  is stored in a parent memory. Further, if the detected defective cell belongs to a must-repair faulty line, the parent memory also stores information thereof.","Information stored in the parent memory is described below with reference to .","Parent Enable Flag:","A parent enable flag indicates whether the address stored in the corresponding parent memory is valid or not. If the parent enable flag is \u20181\u2019, the address stored in the corresponding parent memory is valid; and if the parent enable flag is \u20180\u2019, the address stored in the corresponding parent memory is invalid. Here, the parent enable flag occupies a 1-bit storage space.","Row Address:","A row address of a defective cell is stored in a corresponding parent memory. A storage space necessary to store the row address varies according to the number of bits of the row address. For example, if the row address is comprised of 10 bits, a 10-bit storage space is necessary to store the same. In , M denotes the number of all rows. If M is 1024, the row address may be comprised of 10 bits (log1024).","Column Address:","A column address of a defective cell stored in a corresponding parent memory. A storage space necessary to store the column address varies according to the number of bits of the column address. For example, if the column address is comprised of 10 bits, a 10-bit storage space is necessary to store the same. In , N denotes the number of all columns. If N is 512, the column address may be comprised of 9 bits (log2512).","Row Must Flag:","A row must flag indicates whether a row, having the row address stored in the corresponding parent memory, contains defective cells that are classified as a row must-repair fault line. If the row must flag is \u20181\u2019, it indicates that a row must-repair fault line exists at a particular row address; and if the row must flag is \u20180\u2019, it indicates that a row must-repair fault line does not exist at a particular row address. Here, the row must flag occupies a 1-bit storage space.","Column Must Flag:","A column must flag indicates whether a column, having the column address stored in the corresponding parent memory, contains defective cells that are classified as a column must-repair fault line. If the column must flag is \u20181\u2019, it indicates that a column must-repair fault line exists at a particular column address; and if the column must flag is \u20180\u2019, it indicates that a column must-repair fault line does not exist at a particular column address. Here, the column must flag occupies a 1-bit storage space.","The parent memories PM_-PM_X are as many as the total redundancy number, i.e., Rs+Cs. The number of defective cells that all the parent memories PM_-PM_X can record is equal to the total redundancy number. If the number of defective cells to be recorded in the parent memories PM_-PM_X is greater than Rs+Cs, the memory is classified as unrepairable memory.","The child memories CM_-CM_Y correspond to one of the parent memories PM_-PM_X, respectively. Each of the child memories CM_-CM_Y shares a column address or a row address with its corresponding parent memory PM_-PM_X. Further, each of the child memories CM_-CM_Y may store information about a defective cell, which belongs to a faulty line (e.g., sparse faulty line or must-repair faulty line) with the column address or the row address stored in the parent memory PM_-PM_X. If the row address of the detected defective cell is stored in any one of the parent memories PM_-PM_X, information about the defective cell is stored in the child memory corresponding to the parent memory. Also, if the column address of the detected defective cell is stored in any one of the parent memories PM_-PM_X, information about the corresponding defective cell is stored in the child memory corresponding to the parent memory. For example, if row  and column  is already stored in the parent memory PM_, when a defective cell at row  and column  is detected, the column address of the defective cell (i.e., the column address corresponding to column ) is stored in the child memory corresponding to the parent memory PM_.","Information stored in the child memory is described below with reference to .","Child Enable Flag:","A child enable flag indicates whether the address stored in the corresponding child memory is valid or not. If the child enable flag is \u20181\u2019, the address stored in the corresponding child memory is valid; and if the child enable flag is \u20180\u2019, the address stored in the corresponding child memory is invalid. Here, the child enable flag occupies a 1-bit storage space.","Row or Column Address:","A row or column address of a defective cell is stored in a corresponding child memory. A storage space necessary to store the address is determined by the larger one of the number of bits of a row address and the number of bits of a column address. For example, if the row address is 9 bits and the column address is 10 bits, the storage space for storing the address occupies 10 bits in the child memory.","Address Information (Child Address Descriptor):","Address information indicates whether the address stored in the corresponding child memory is a row address or a column address. If the address information is \u20180\u2019, the address stored in the corresponding child memory is a row address; and if the address information is \u20181\u2019, the address stored in the corresponding child memory is a column address. Accordingly, the address information occupies a 1-bit storage space.","Pointer Information (Parent CAM Pointer):","Pointer information indicates the parent memory corresponding to the child memory storing the pointer information. For example, if the pointer information of a child memory is \u20184\u2019, it may indicate that the child memory corresponds to the parent memory PM_. The number of bits of the pointer information is determined according to the number of parent memories PM_-PM_X (number of parent memories=Rs+Cs). Specifically, the number of bits of the pointer information is equal to log(Rs+Cs).","The number of child memories CM_-CM_X is equal to Rs(Cs\u22121)+Cs(Rs\u22121). Therefore, the sum of the number of parent memories PM_-PM_X and the number of child memories CM_-CM_X is 2\u00d7Rs\u00d7Cs. This sum represents the maximum number of defective cell addresses that can be stored to repair the memory with a given redundancy memory. Accordingly, the total number of bits of data to be stored by the parent memory and the child memory in accordance with the present invention is relatively small. Therefore, the area of the fault information storing device of the present invention is reduced as compared to that of the prior art.","The fault information storing device in accordance with the present invention classifies information about defective cells according to the row and column addresses of the defective cells. A defective cell stored in the parent memory with the assistance of a corresponding child memory belongs to a faulty line (i.e., sparse faulty line or must-repair faulty line). A defective cell stored in the parent memory without the assistance of a child memory corresponds to a single fault. Further, a defective cell stored in the parent memory storing an activated must-repair flag belongs to a must-repair faulty line.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},"Referring to , when a defective cell is detected, it is determined whether the detected defective cell belongs to a row address classified as a must repair or a column address classified as a must repair (S). If it is determined that the detected defective cell belongs to a must repair, information about the detected defective cell is ignored because it is no more necessary. That is, information about the defective cell detected at a column address or a row address classified as a must repair is not stored.","Thereafter, it is determined whether the address identical to the column address or the row address of the detected defective cell is already stored in the parent memory (S). If the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell are not already stored in the parent memory, the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell are written in the parent memory (S).","If one of the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell is already stored in the parent memory, it is determined whether the defective cell is to be classified as belonging to a new must-repair faulty line (S). If the defective cell is to be classified as a new column must-repair faulty line or a new row must-repair faulty line, a must-repair flag of the parent memory corresponding to the detected defective cell (i.e., the parent memory storing the column address or the row address identical to that of the detected defective cell) is activated (S). Herein, if the defective cell is classified as belonging to a column must-repair faulty line, a column must-repair flag is activated; and if the defective cell is classified as belonging to a row must-repair faulty line, a row must-repair flag is activated.","If the defective cell is not to be classified as belonging to a must-repair faulty line, then the column address or the row address of the detected defective cell is stored in the child memory (S).","That is, in accordance with the present invention, if a defective is cell is detected, the detected defective cell is not ignored (i.e., path NO in S is taken), then one of three steps are performed: (1) the column address and the row address of the detected defective cell are stored in the parent memory (S), (2) the must-repair flag of the parent memory is activated by the detected defective cell (S), or (3) the column address or the row address of the detected defective cell are stored in the child memory (S).","The process of  is repeated whenever a defective cell is detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIGS. 4 and 5"]},"In , a repeat count value indicates the number of defective cells that have been previously detected at the same row address as the row address of the most recently detected defective cell and the number of defective cells detected that have been previously detected at the same column address as the column address of the most recently detected defective cell.
