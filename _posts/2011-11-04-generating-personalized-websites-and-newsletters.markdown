{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example","Formation of Questions and Polls"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/410,313, entitled \u201cMembership Profiles for Personalized Websites,\u201d filed Nov. 4, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The specification relates to generating a personalized newsletter. In particular, the specification relates to generating questions and polls and using answers to the questions and polls to generate a membership profile and personalized newsletters.","As technology improves, the ability to disseminate information has increased drastically. This surplus of information allows people to have interests in more specialized areas. For example, a few years ago people were generally interested in photography. Now, people can specialize in digital cameras, digital single lens reflex (dSLR) cameras or even Nikon d300s dSLRs with Sigma lenses. Similarly, people are no longer simply Democrats, Republicans or Independents. They are Blue-Dog Democrats, Log-Cabin Republicans, Green-Party Members, Tea Partiers, Libertarians, Neocons, etc.","The specialized nature of information makes it more difficult to find the appropriate website for discussing a hobby with other people. Viewing a website on digital photography can be a waste of time if everyone wants to discuss using old Polaroid instant cameras or Canon point-and-shoots. Similarly, viewing a website for Republicans can result in a poor experience if the Neocons and the Tea Partiers get into a conversation with a Goldwater Republican.","This is particularly problematic from a website developer's perspective because if the website developer caters to a narrow subset of the population, then it results in a decreased stream of traffic. But if the website developer tries to appeal to everyone broadly, the website developer fails to make anyone happy. As a result, what is needed is a method for personalizing a website.","In addition to the problem of finding the proper website, people frequently visit these websites in order to have satisfying interactions with other people that are interested in the same hobby. It can be difficult to identify whether a user in the online community shares your interests because user profiles are typically devoid of specific information. User profiles are created to represent a user to the whole world. As a result, the user may not want to include her love of Nikon d300 dSLRs on a user profile because it is not a defining characteristic. In addition the user may not want to include his political affiliation for fear of alienating potential employers and friends. Furthermore, even if the user is willing to disclose highly specific information on his user profile, the profile will contain information that is unrelated to the purpose of a particular website. Thus, what is also needed is a way of personalizing a user profile according to the particular online community that the user is visiting.","Lastly, websites frequently send out newsletters to keep their members engaged in the website. When the newsletters are of a general nature, however, they provide little benefit because members are not interested in wading through the material to find information on their specialized interests. As a result, what is needed is a way to provide personalized newsletters.","The specification overcomes the deficiencies and limitations of the prior art at least in part by providing a system and method for generating a membership profile for an online community. An online services provider uses the interests engine to generate questions and polls for the users. The interests engine provides the user with the ability to specify the format of the question (yes\/no, multiple choice, free form) and whether the user is presented with a bundled set of questions or smaller sections of questions. In one embodiment, an application programming interface (API) module retrieves questions from similar websites and the interests engine provides the questions to the online services provider as suggestions.","For new users, a profile engine imports a generic profile. The questions and polls are presented to a user. The user answers questions that are received by the profile engine and combined with the generic profile information to generate a membership profile. The questions, polls and answers are saved with their unique identification to a data store. A profile engine retrieves the responses and uses them to generate the membership profile. A personalizing engine retrieves the responses and uses them to customize different types of particular content presented on the website as gadgets. The advertising engine retrieves the responses and uses them to generate personalized advertisements.","A newsletter engine generates newsletters for members of the website. The newsletters are personalized according to members' answers to questions and polls. In one embodiment the newsletter engine retrieves members' comments and analyzes them to generate additional interests for dividing the newsletter audience. When an online services provider is determining which topics to include in a particular newsletter, the newsletter engine displays a list of all recipients in each category. This provides the online services provider with a feel for the audience without compromising the members' privacy by including their email addresses.","In one embodiment, the newsletter is generated by displaying a plurality of questions for a plurality of users to answer, receiving a request for generating a newsletter, retrieving the plurality of questions, answers and a number of people that selected each answer, receiving a selection of a plurality of subscribers based on the answers and transmitting the newsletter to the selected subscribers.","Overview","A system and method for generating a newsletter is described below. In one embodiment, the profile engine generates questions and polls that are displayed on a website. Users answer the questions and polls and the profile engine generates a membership profile for each user.","A newsletter engine generates newsletters for members of the website. The term newsletter as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning including, but not limited to, a publication about the subject matter of the website. In one embodiment the newsletter also includes a summary of recent activity of members of the website.","The newsletters are personalized according to members' answers to questions and polls. The user interface engine generates a user interface for the online services provider that includes the plurality of questions, answers and a number of people that selected each answer. The user interface engine transmits the user interface to the online services provider. The newsletter engine receives a selection of at least a subset of the plurality of users that are designated to receive the newsletter based at least in part on the answers and transmits the newsletter to the selection of at least the subset of users.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","115","115","115","125","125","125","101","107","115","115","105","105","115","115","101","107","105"],"i":["a","b","n ","a","b","n","a","a","b"]},"The personalizing module  generates questions and polls that are presented to new users on a website.

In this embodiment, the interests engine  includes a questions editor  and a polling editor . These components are coupled for communication with each other by the bus . The questions editor  generates questions to ask the user responsive to the online services provider's input. The polling editor , responsive to the online services provider's selection, converts questions into a poll that is asked of all members. The results of the poll are displayed on the website for all members to view.","Questions are formatted as a single form or multiple forms. The individual questions are presented in a variety of formats including long text boxes for free form text, short text boxes for free form text, check boxes for multiple choice and radio buttons for multiple choice. In one embodiment, the multiple choice answers are displayed by the wizard as images that the user selects. The names for the images are then used to generate the membership profile. In one embodiment, the text surrounding the questionnaire includes an explanation that the responses will be available as part of the user's profile so that the user has the opportunity to not respond to certain questions that are made public. Users can opt-in or opt-out of having any information used to generate a member profile, having user preferences tracked (e.g. answers to new questions) and receiving newsletters.","Once a question has been created by the interests engine , the online services provider decides whether to display the question in a questionnaire or as part of a poll. Polls are used to generate community answers. When the online services provider selects the poll format, the polling editor  displays a user interface for specifying details about the presentation of the poll, such as size of the box, color, font, etc. Once the details are settled, the user selects a generate code button and the polling editor displays code that can be embedded into the webpage.","In response to users voting on a poll, the polling editor  the user interface module  to display a notice to inform the user that the answer is being added to the user's member profile unless the user prefers to rescind the response or respond anonymously. If the user has not provided the answer to the poll in the past, that poll is recycled again for display to the user. The user can also access the list of answered polls and register a new response to any of the already answered polls. Thus, the member profiles are dynamically updated in response to users answering more questions and polls, old and new.","Referring back to , the API engine  allows online services providers to contract deeper integrations into their website design than are possible with the interests engine . In one embodiment, the API engine  is used to retrieve via the communication unit  detailed information for generating questions and polls. Specifically, the API engine  retrieves a list of questions and the structured answers and aggregates data about how community members have answered the questions and specific data about how the viewer has responded to the questions.","In another embodiment, the API engine  gathers additional information that is not in a poll or question format, such as a list of favorite articles. The API engine  generates a favorite button that is overlaid on webpages and articles. When a user selects the favorite button, the webpage and article names are automatically added to the member's profile. In one embodiment, restrictions are placed on the list of favorites so that it is not cumbersome. The restrictions include only displaying a set number of most recent articles. The other articles can be displayed upon request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","221","202","103","400","402","406","409","411","412","414","417","419","422","425","435"]},"Selecting the overview  link causes the user interface to display a summary of the different actions that can be performed on Friend Connect. For example, the user can add a gadget, find more gadgets, activate the interests engine , send a newsletter, modify the advertisements, review community data, etc.","Selecting the gadgets link  causes the user interface to display options for generating a social gadget. The gadgets will be discussed in more detail below with reference to the member profiles. Selecting the interests link  causes the user interface to display a wizard for generating questions and polls. Selecting the advertisements link  causes the user interface to display options for configuring advertisements that are configured to reflect user interests. Selecting the moderate link  causes the user interface to display options for managing the members, such as blocking problematic members. Selecting the community data link  causes the user interface to display various statistics about members, such as when they first joined the website. Selecting the plug-ins & APIs link  causes the user interface to display options for generating third-party plug-ins and APIs. Lastly, selecting the settings link  causes the user interface  to display various settings for topics not included in the other links.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","400","411","221","437","452","437","207"]},"The presentation option  includes a drop-down box for specifying when to present the question. Specifically, the questionnaire will be presented after a new member joins, in a poll, both after a new member joins and in a poll, as an API or the questions are hidden. Lastly, the questions can be used for personalization by selecting the enabled icon .","In one embodiment, the questions editor  generates basic questions that a user automatically adds to a questionnaire. In this example, the user interface  adds location, gender and age in response to selecting the location icon , the gender icon  and the age icon  respectively. Once the questionnaire is complete, the user can preview  the questionnaire and select the embed icon  to switch to the poll gadget  screen, which contains code for embedding in a website.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["455","460","462","464","455"]},"The interests engine  assigns all questions a unique identifier and saves them in memory . The memory  is also used as storage for member profiles, answers to questions and polls, etc. For performance reasons an aggregate is written as the total number of responses to a question and also aggregate counts for each answer. This allows both raw and proportional views of the poll data to be generated quickly. It also allows responses to be rescinded later simply by decrementing the aggregate count when the response is deleted.","In one embodiment, the information is also denormalized into separate stores that are used to generate views of site profiles and member profiles. The site description normally contains a list of question IDs. In one embodiment, the data storage also contains cached copies of the question text and individual responses. This allows for fast generation of user profiles by avoiding the need to reference several different data stores when generating a profile view. Similarly, a user profile normally contains the identification of all website identifications that are used to look up responses by the user. Thus, to improve read operations of user profiles, copies of the responses with all their text representations are also stored in memory .","Generating a Newsletter","Once the questions and polls are completed, the newsletter engine  retrieves membership profiles generates a newsletter for the online services provider.  is a graphic representation of a user interface  for creating newsletters. The newsletters user interface  is divided into three categories: composing the newsletter, the history of all newsletters and settings related to the newsletter. The process for sending a newsletter is divided into three steps: (1) composing a newsletter; (2) choosing recipients; and (3) previewing and sending the newsletter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"502"},"The text of the newsletter is included in the newsletter box . The format includes plain text, links, appending of images (not shown), etc. To include recent members and activities in the newsletter, the online services provider selects the checkbox  beneath the newsletter box . In one embodiment, the newsletter engine  displays a list of the last five (or 10, 15, etc.) members to join. The recent members are displayed as a list that includes, for example, the member names, an icon associated with each member, a link to the members' profiles, and a time of how long ago the members joined. The recent activity includes, for example, activities within the gadgets and other parts of the website. This can be a short description, such as \u201cFour new comments were left in the guestbook\u201d or something more detailed, such as \u201cSarah801 started a topic titled \u2018Who wants to carpool to the Rock Band concert?\u2019\u201d","In one embodiment, the newsletter engine  suggests items for the newsletter based on website activity. For example, the online services provider specifies that he wants to see all forum discussions involving the search terms \u201cRock Band.\u201d The newsletter engine  retrieves the discussions from memory  and generates links that the online services provider includes in the email. In another embodiment, the newsletter engine  suggests discussions that have the most number of comments or are the most viewed discussions. In yet another embodiment, the newsletter engine  suggests discussions based on the users' membership profiles or activities on the social network gadgets.","Turning now to the second step of choosing recipients, the newsletter engine  allows the online services provider to categorize recipients according to how they answered questions and polls.  illustrates one example where the online services provider chooses between sending the newsletter to all subscribers or only subscribers who match a certain criteria. For example, the newsletter is only being sent to members that indicated that the next guitar of their dreams is a Guitar A or a Guitar B.","The newsletter engine  retrieves from memory  a list of the number of members that provided a particular answer. For example, if the online services provider sends the newsletter to the 50 people that marked Guitar A as the next guitar of their dreams, 107 people that marked Guitar B as the next guitar of their dreams and four people that marked Guitar C as the next guitar of their dreams, the newsletter engine  displays the total recipients  as . In one embodiment, the newsletter engine  retrieves the number of members from memory  each time the online services provider reloads the page or clicks on the checkbox to select the subscribers associated with a particular answer. That way the list is up-to-date.","In another embodiment, the newsletter engine  retrieves a list of interests from memory  and displays a number of people that are associated with each interest. The interest can be something that was explicitly stated by the member or it can be inferred from social activities. For example, the newsletter engine  searches for discussions or comments where the member is making a positive or negative statement. An example of a positive statement is: \u201cI have a Guitar D.\u201d An example of a negative statement is \u201cI don't like Rock Band.\u201d From these statements, the newsletter engine  determines that the member should receive newsletters about Guitar D and not about Rock Band. In one embodiment, the profile engine  modifies the member's profile to add Guitar D as an interest and Rock Band as something that the member dislikes.","The user interface module  maintains privacy of the members by not revealing the email addresses of the members. By displaying the number of members associated with a particular response but not the identifying information for those members, the newsletter engine  strikes a balance between maintaining privacy and giving the online services provider sufficient information to make important choices. The online services provider could discern the identity of members based on their answer, but the membership profile does not display the member's email address. In another embodiment, the member may select to display an e-mail address through an opt-in policy.","Once the recipients are selected, the newsletter engine  allows the online services provider to preview the newsletter and send it to the recipients. In one embodiment, the newsletter engine  transmits the newsletter to a third-party server  or an online services server  via the communication unit  where the email addresses of the members is available. In one embodiment, the newsletter engine  restricts the publication of newsletters to a certain number of newsletters per week and recommends that the online services provider only send out newsletters once every other week so that subscribers are not overwhelmed by the newsletters and, as a result, lose interest in the website.","Establishing a Member Profile","Once the online services provider has finished configuring the website and embedding the appropriate gadgets, the website is ready to receive members.  is a graphic representation  of an anonymous view of the website. When the user is anonymous, the website displays introductory information and requests for user information. The questions and polls are arbitrary. The featured content and advertisements are generic. For example, the personalizing engine  generates a members gadget  that displays the complete list of members of the website.","The website already displays a poll  for picking the guitar of your dreams. In this case, the multiple choice options are visual representations of guitars. The poll  is displayed even though the identity of the user has not been established because the poll  includes the option for anonymous input. In one embodiment, the poll prevents people from voting multiple times by restricting the votes according to a client's IP address.","A user becomes a member of the website by joining or signing in using an email address or other identifying information. To join, the user selects the join icon  on the upper right-hand side of the user interface or the user signs into one of the other gadgets, such as the guestbook gadget . Joining prompts the profile engine  to display a popup (not shown) with different ways for joining In one embodiment, the user joins using Google Friend Connect.","Joining as a new member causes the profile engine  to extract the user's generic profile (if available).

These questions are used to personalize the website. Once the user completes the questions and polls, the profile engine  assigns unique identifiers to the answers that are stored in memory , generates a member profile for the user that contains the user's answers and updates any polls with the user's answers. In one embodiment, when information received through the site specific website conflicts with the generic profile, the profile engine  asks the user to resolve the conflict, for example, by confirming that the recently input data is correct. If the user provides information through the website that is not contained in the user profile, the profile engine  asks the user whether she would like the information to be added to the generic profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","703","705"]},"A member makes friends on the website using the members gadget .

The suggestions take a variety of forms including: (1) the spellcheck method; (2) the synonym method, where the interests engine  determines the subject matter of a question and suggests other topics within the same category; and (3) the interests engine  determines the subject matter of the website and provides previously used questions from websites with similar subject matter.","The spellcheck method includes the following example. The online services provider inputs the question: \u201cWhat is your favorite Brrand A guitar?\u201d The interests engine  responds with the message, \u201cDid you mean to state, \u2018What is your favorite Brand A guitar?\u2019\u201d The user corrects the question with the properly spelled guitar brand.","The synonym method includes the following example. The user creates the following question for a poll: \u201cWhat is the next concert that you are attending?\u201d The options are: \u201cBand A, Band B and Band C.\u201d The interests engine  submits Band A, Band B and Band C to a classification engine, which classifies these bands as ones where guitar is heavily featured in the music. The classification engine returns the names of other bands that also heavily feature guitar, such as Band D.

The member profile  is generated by the profile engine . The member profile  includes a unique user identification and a list of the questions and answers for questions, polls, a list of interests, etc. The profile information is then transmitted to various engines, such as the personalizing engine  and the advertising engine  to generate personalized advertisements , APIs  and related content .","The personalizing engine  retrieves membership information from memory  or from a remote storage location and generates various social network gadgets that incorporate the membership information, such as a list of all the members of a particular website. In one embodiment, the personalizing engine  generates a gadget that displays a website ring, i.e. a list of websites that share common features. The gadget can also share content between the different websites.","The advertising engine  retrieves the membership profile from memory  and generates personalized advertisements  by displaying advertisements that match the user's responses. In addition, the advertising engine  works in conjunction with the gadgets to display the same topics at the same time. For example, if the featured content gadget displays articles on banjos, the advertising engine  displays advertisements for purchasing banjos because banjos are fresh in the user's mind and reading about them can inspire the user to make a purchase. In one embodiment, the advertising engine  displays advertisements for purchasing banjos based on the user's age retrieved from the membership profile, with younger users in their teens being shown cheaper banjos and older users being shown expensive banjos to purchase. Alternatively, the user is allowed to configure the advertisements shown to reflect his or her interests.","In one embodiment, the profile engine  transmits the member profile information to a matching engine that finds similar like minded strangers . The profile engine  transmits a suggestion to the member that the like minded strangers  have similar profiles.

Information from the generic profile is only used if it pertains to the topic of the website. Thus, in one embodiment, the profile engine  identifies the subject matter of the website and selects information from the generic profile that matches that subject matter. The more general information, such as where the user has lived, is not used unless that is somehow relevant to the website (such as a travel website) because the purpose of the membership profile is to show a focused subset of information. The profile engine  instructs the user interface module  to generate  personalized content, such as particular content that includes personalized content for users that answered a question in the same way. The personalized content is transmitted to the user device  via the communication unit  if the personalizing module  is stored on the online services server  or the third-party server .

It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the specification can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the description. For example, the specification is described in one embodiment below with reference to user interfaces and particular hardware. However, the specification applies to any type of computing device that can receive data and commands, and any peripheral devices providing services.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the specification. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.
