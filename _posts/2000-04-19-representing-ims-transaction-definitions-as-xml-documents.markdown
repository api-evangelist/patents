More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for representing IMS transaction definitions as XML documents.","Identification of Copyright","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Relevant Technology","With the explosive growth of the Internet, most of the world's computer systems are now interconnected or capable of being interconnected. However, in order to share data, the systems need to understand each other's data formats. In recent years, the computer industry has evolved at such a rapid pace that systems developed only a few years apart use vastly different and incompatible formats. Such incompatibility problems tend to increase with the \u201cage\u201d differences of the systems.","The Information Management System (IMS) is one of the oldest and perhaps the most popular transaction processing (TP) systems. A TP system supervises the sharing of resources for concurrently processing multiple transactions, such as queries to a database. Anyone who has ever used an ATM, rented a car, or booked a flight, has probably used IMS.","IMS was developed by IBM the 1960's as a inventory tracking system for the U.S. moon landing effort. Today, interfacing IMS with newer systems, particularly with systems of different manufactures over the Internet, is problematic.","As illustrated in , an IMS  typically includes two major components: an IMS Transaction Monitor (IMS\/TM) , which is responsible for scheduling, authorization, presentation services and operational functions, and a hierarchical database , DL\/I. Both components are independently configurable. For example the IMS\/TM  can use a relational database, such as DB\/2, rather than DL\/I. The various components of an IMS  communicate via the MVS operating system .","As illustrated , the architecture of IMS is divided into four regions. For example, a Message Processing Region (MPR)  is used to execute message-driven applications . Execution of applications  in this region  is triggered by incoming messages, such as those received from a terminal.","By contrast, applications  in a Batch Message Processing (BMP)  region are not message driven. They are usually scheduled to run at times of low system activity, such as nights and weekends. Typically, such applications  perform a number of predefined operations, after which they immediately terminate.","An Interactive Fast Path (IFP)  region allows fast and simple requests to the database . Applications  operating in the IFP  bypass the normal scheduling mechanism, providing relatively fast response times. In general, IFP applications  stay resident even if they are not needed.","An IMS Control Region (IMSCTL)  is responsible for all TP tasks, as well as for controlling all dependent regions (MPR , BMP , and IFP ). Essentially, the IMS Control Region  has three main responsibilities: telecommunications, message scheduling, and logging\/restart.","For example, IMSCTL  controls the connected terminals  (illustrated in FIG. ), receiving\/sending messages from\/to the terminals . Moreover, IMSCTL  logs all transactions in order to provide the capability of undoing non-committed transactions in the event of a system failure.","In addition, every time IMSCTL  receives a message from a terminal , it schedules an application  to process the message. IMSCTL  identifies the desired application  and puts the message in the application's message queue . The application  processes the requests in its message queue  and responds to the originating terminal  by placing the response in the terminal's message queue .","As illustrated in , an IMS  obtains all of its information about the structure and behavior of its components (applications, databases, transactions, etc.) from macro statements  (hereinafter \u201cmacros\u201d). Certain macros  are referred to as \u201ctransaction definitions\u201d  because they define how transactions are processed.","For example, as shown in , an application (APPLCTN) macro  defines the behavior of a particular IMS application . An APPLCTN macro  exists for each application  in the IMS , and defines, for example, the application's name, resource requirements, and appearance.","An APPLCTN macro  is followed by a zero or more (TRANSACT) macros , which define the various transactions applicable to the application . A TRANSACT macro  specifies the appearance of a transaction to be performed by an application , identifying whether the transaction is IMS exclusive, IMS Fast Path potential or IMS Fast Path exclusive. Furthermore, a TRANSACT macro  specifies the transaction code that causes the application  named in the APPLCTN macro  to be scheduled for execution in an IMS processing region.","Currently, IMS is only capable of processing transactions previously defined by the APPLCNT and TRANSACT macros , . A user may not initiate arbitrary transactions, such queries of the database , that have not been previously defined. Moreover, in order to change the above-described macros, one must initiate a process called \u201csystem generation,\u201d which necessitates shutting down the IMS  for a period of time.","In addition, the above-described IMS macros ,  have a proprietary format, which is a detriment in interfacing with remotely located systems from different vendors. Currently, the dominant Internet format is the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), a variant of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Providing a technique for delivering IMS transactions definitions to an IMS  using interchangeable documents, such as XML documents, would be a first step in being able to initiate arbitrary IMS transactions over the Internet.","Accordingly, what is needed is a system and method for representing IMS transaction definitions in an interchangeable format, such as XML. What is also needed is a system and method for communicating with an IMS  using XML documents. In addition, what is needed is a system and method for creating a Document Type Definition (DTD) for use by a parser in converting between IMS transaction definitions and XML documents.","The present invention solves many or all of the foregoing problems by providing a system and method for communicating with an Information Management System (IMS) using extensible Markup Language (XML) documents.","In one aspect of the invention, a method includes the steps of receiving a document comprising an IMS transaction definition encoded in XML; obtaining a Document Type Definition (DTD) specifying rules for decoding the IMS transaction definition; parsing the XML document using the DTD to decode the IMS transaction definition; and providing the decoded IMS transaction definition to the IMS.","In another aspect of the invention, a method includes the steps of modeling an IMS transaction definition in a Universal Modeling Language (UML) to produce a UML object model; and processing the UML object model using an XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) utility to create the DTD.","In yet another aspect of the invention, a method includes the steps of obtaining an IMS transaction definition; obtaining a Document Type Definition (DTD) specifying rules for encoding the IMS transaction definition; and parsing the IMS transaction definition with the DTD to encode the IMS transaction definition in an XML document.","In still another aspect, a system includes a document reception module configured to receive a document comprising an IMS transaction definition encoded in XML; a parser configured to obtain a Document Type Definition (DTD) specifying rules for decoding the IMS transaction definition and further configured to parse the XML document using the DTD to decode the IMS transaction definition; and an IMS interface module configured to provide the decoded IMS transaction definition to the IMS.","In another aspect of the invention, a system includes a modeling tool configured to model an IMS transaction definition in a Universal Modeling Language (UML) to produce a UML object model; and an XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) utility configured to process the UML object model to generate the DTD and a number of access classes.","These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.","Certain presently preferred embodiments of the invention are now described with reference to the Figures, where like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. The components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the Figures, may be implemented in a variety of configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and method of the present invention, as represented in the Figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of presently preferred embodiments of the invention.","Throughout the following description, various system components are referred to as \u201cmodules,\u201d \u201cunits,\u201d \u201cutilities,\u201d \u201ctools,\u201d or the like. In certain embodiments, these components may be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For example, as used herein, a module may include any type of computer instruction or computer executable code located within a memory device and\/or transmitted as electronic signals over a system bus or network. An identified module may include, for instance, one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which may be embodied within one or more objects, procedures, functions, or the like.","The identified modules need not be located physically together, but may include disparate instructions stored at different memory locations, which together implement the described logical functionality of the module. Indeed, a module may include a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed among several discrete code segments, within different programs, and across several memory devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["40","10","40","46","42","48"]},"Various Web servers  may be used, such as the Windows NT Server\u2122, available from Microsoft Corporation. Likewise, the Web browser  may be implemented using a conventional navigation tool for accessing the World Wide Web (WWW), such as Microsoft Internet Explorers or Netscape Navigator\u2122.","The document  may be encoded to represent one or more IMS transaction definitions , such as APPLCTN or TRANSACT macros , , using an open document format, such as the extensible Markup Language (XML). Techniques for encoding IMS transaction definitions  in XML are described more fully hereafter. XML is similar to the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), but provides the ability to define custom tags by means of Document Type Definitions (DTDs).","In various embodiments, the system  also includes an IMS gateway , which may provide an interface between the Web server  and the IMS . The IMS gateway  may include an XML to Macro parser , which may parse the XML document  using a specialized DTD  to decode the IMS transaction definition . A system and method for generating the DTD  and the parser  is described more fully hereafter. After the transaction definition  is decoded, the IMS gateway  may provide the same to the IMS .","In alternative embodiments, the system  may be used in reverse to generate an XML document  from an IMS transaction definition , as illustrated FIG. . For example, a transaction definition  may be obtained from the IMS  or another source. Thereafter, a Macro to XML parser  within the IMS gateway  may use the DTD  to encode the transaction definition  as an XML document . In certain embodiments, two different parsers ,  are used, one for encoding and one for decoding a transaction definition , although the invention is not limited in this respect. After the XML document  is generated, the Web server  may transmit the same to a Web browser  or the like via the Internet .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["60","54","76","52","53","54","76","60","62","62","64","35","62"]},"UML is a language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting software systems, as well as business models and the like.

In one embodiment, a TransactionControlMacro object  represents the TRANSACT macro , each attribute  of the object  corresponding to a parameter of the macro . In addition, the UML object model  may include a number of enumeration stereotypes , which are type definitions of attributes ,  having a fixed set of values. For example, an attribute  of the type, TscheduleType, may only have a value of \u201cSerial\u201d or \u201cParallel\u201d in certain embodiments. Likewise, the UML object model  may include a number of primitive stereotypes , which represent the basic variable types of the model , such as strings, unsigned integers, and the like.","Referring again to , the system  may also include an XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) utility , such as XMI Toolkit\u2122, available from IBM. XMI is an open standard released by the Object Management Group (OMG) for simplifying the exchange of data and metadata between different products from different vendors. IBM's XMI Toolkit is written entirely in Java and offers interfaces to facilitate incorporation into other projects or products.","In various embodiments, the XMI utility  automatically generates the DTD  from the UML object model . An example of a DTD  generated by the XMI utility  according to an embodiment of the invention is provided in Appendix B. In addition, the XMI utility  may create a plurality of Java XMI document access classes , which are used by the parsers , to parse and transform the document  based on the generated DTD . The access classes  provide an application programming interface (API) to allow the parsers ,  to export a transaction definition  to an XML document  and to import an XML document  to a transaction definition .","The system  may also include a parser generator , such as the Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC) 1.1, available from Sun Microsystems, although a variety of parser generators  may be used. JavaCC converts a grammar specification into a Java program that can recognize matches to the grammar. In certain embodiments, the parser generator  is only used in the creation of the parser  (Macro to XML), since the XMI access classes  generated by the XMI utility  may be used to directly import the entire content of the document  by invoking a single method. However, other techniques for parser generation may be used in alternative embodiments.","Referring now to , a schematic flowchart illustrates a method  for communicating with an IMS  using XML documents . The method may begin by receiving  a document  at an IMS gateway . The document  may be received, for example, from a Web server  attached to the Internet .","After the document  is received , the method  may continue by obtaining  a DTD  for IMS transaction definitions , such as the DTD  illustrated in Appendix B. Thereafter, the method may continue by parsing  the document  using the DTD  to decode the IMS transaction definition , and providing  the same to the IMS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"b":["44","36","52","54","44","36","90","44","35","90","92","35","10"]},"After the transaction definition  is obtained , the method  may continue by obtaining  a DTD  for IMS transaction definitions , as illustrated in Appendix B.

Finally, the XML document  may be sent  to an XMI-enabled device, such as a Web browser  or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["36","53","54","36","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["100","54","53","100","102","35","64"]},"After the transaction definition  is modeled , the method  may continue by processing  the UML object model  using an XMI utility , such as IBM's XMI Toolkit, to generate the DTD  and various document access classes .","In certain presently preferred embodiments, the method  may continue by processing the DTD  using a parser generator , such as the Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC), in order to generate the parser .","Based on the foregoing, the present invention offers a number of advantages over conventional IMS interface systems. For example, the present invention communicates with an IMS  using openly interchangeable documents, such as XML documents . The documents  may comply with the latest XMI standard, which enables an IMS  to exchange data with a variety of XMI-enabled devices, such as Web browsers  and the like. Accordingly, the present invention overcomes a first hurdle in the goal of facilitating arbitrary IMS transactions via the Internet.","Importantly, XML documents  may be easily converted for display on a variety of computing platform using the emerging XML Style Language (XSL) standard. As such, the XMI to IMS interface is capable of replacing all other interfaces between IMS and products from other vendors.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its scope or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description.
