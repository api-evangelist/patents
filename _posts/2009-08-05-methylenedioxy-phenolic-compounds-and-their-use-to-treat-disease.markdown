The sequence listing contained in this ASCII formatted document is part of the specification and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Novel methylenedioxy phenolic-based compounds and their derivatives are presented together with methods of making them and methods of using them to treat or prevent vascular disease, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease, diabetic vascular disease and related conditions.","Cardiovascular disease or heart disease is the number one killer around the world and the associated risk factors are on the increase globally. For example, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as diabetes, where there is an anticipated increase of over 40% in the incidence rate around the world by the year 2025, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and dyslipidemia are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. In addition, recent studies indicate that even hitherto protected subsets such as younger women are becoming increasingly vulnerable to heart disease. The global need for new cardiovascular drugs is therefore, steadily increasing.","Cardiovascular disease secondary to atherosclerosis is not a single disease. There are multiple risk factors associated with the disease. These include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, thrombophilia (increased clotting tendency or thrombosis) and positive family history. Often, patients have multiple risk factors and are treated with multiple drugs. While combination therapy has been proven effective, often drug-to-drug interactions, the inconvenience of multiple daily dosing, etc. as well as undiagnosed risk factors, make it necessary to take a multipronged approach.","To date, many of these risk factors have been treated as separate diseases although there are numerous commonalities among them. For example, the drugs against hypertension have little no effect on diabetes and vice versa. Recent studies have suggested that many of these diseases (risk factors) have common features such as an elevated inflammatory and oxidative stress. In addition, altered endothelial function is a common clinically significant observation associated with almost all these risk factors.","The present invention provides for the use of these novel methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives in the preparation of a medicament useful to treat, prevent or delay the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease, vascular disease and\/or inflammatory disease, as well as Type I and Type II Diabetes and Dyslipidemia patients at risk for hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular and renal disease.","It would be desirable to have one or more drugs that could treat or prevent one or more facets or symptoms of a cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease, diabetic vascular disease or a related disorder.","The present invention substantially mitigates these problems by providing novel methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives, methods of making them and methods of using them to treat, prevent or delay the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease, vascular disease and\/or inflammatory disease, as well as Type I and Type II Diabetes and Dyslipidemia patients at risk for hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular and renal disease.","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives possess the ability to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, these compounds are useful in preventing accumulation of plaque and delaying or preventing atherosclerosis in individuals such as those at risk for atherosclerosis. Since these compounds are useful in preventing accumulation of plaque and delaying or preventing atherosclerosis, they may be administered to prevent or reduce the occurrence of heart attacks, strokes, death, peripheral arterial disease and revascularization events (coronary artery bypass graft surgery or lower extremity bypass surgery).","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives possess anti-inflammatory properties, as evidenced at least by the effects on prevention of activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB). Accordingly, these compounds are useful in various inflammatory disorders including but not limited to atherosclerosis, diabetes, inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), hypertension and aging. For example, these compounds can be combined with an acceptable carrier and administered to patient who has recently sustained a heart attack or stroke or has undergone a recent percutaneous intervention to the coronary or peripheral arterial vessels. These compositions are also useful for administration to patients receiving stents in coronary arteries and peripheral arteries.","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives will have protective effects in diabetes and in preventing diabetic vascular disease including diabetic heart disease, diabetic kidney disease and diabetic cerebrovascular disease, in view of their effects in improving vascular insulin sensitivity.","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives also affect the transcription factor sterol regulator and binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). These compounds act as post-transcriptional activators of SREBP-2 and represent a novel class of selective activators of SREBP-2. The increase in SREBP-2 increases low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and lowers LDL cholesterol levels. Accordingly, these compounds may be used to treat hyperlipidemia associated with elevated LDL levels such as heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, combined hyperlipidemia, elevations in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and in diabetic dyslipidemia.","In light of the substantial benefit provided by these methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives in atherosclerosis and inflammation, they may also be administered in combination with other therapies known to one of ordinary skill in the art to be effective in atherosclerosis and inflammation including but not limited to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), fat uptake inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, peroxisome proliferation activator receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) and PPAR-gamma agonists, acetylsalicylic acid, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors and beta-blockers.","The methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives of the present invention are combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form compositions for administration to an animal or a human. These compositions are used to treat or prevent vascular disease, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease, diabetic vascular disease or a related disorder and many of their underlying risk factors. These compositions may be administered alone or together with another therapeutic compound. Such administration of the compositions of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic compound may occur separately. Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic compound may be combined in one administration or delivery method, for example in one capsule, one caplet or one intravenous administration.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and claims.","The present invention substantially mitigates these problems by providing novel methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives, methods of making them and methods of using them to treat, prevent or delay the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease, vascular disease and\/or inflammatory disease, as well as Type I and Type II Diabetes and Dyslipidemia patients at risk for hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular and renal disease. The term patient refers to animals and humans herein.","The present invention also provides for the use of these novel methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives in the preparation of a medicament useful to treat, prevent or delay the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease, vascular disease and\/or inflammatory disease, as well as Type I and Type II Diabetes and Dyslipidemia

combined with an acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition and are administered to the animal or the human. The therapeutic compounds of the present invention may be reconstituted in any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier before use or administration.","Pharmaceutically Acceptable Carriers","Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (vehicles) useful in this disclosure are conventional. , by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of one or more therapeutic compounds or molecules described herein.","In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (e.g., powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.","Representative Methods of Administration, Formulations and Dosage","The provided therapeutic compounds can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle for administration to human or animal subjects. In some embodiments, more than therapeutic compound can be combined to form a single preparation. The therapeutic compounds can be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared using conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient and the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets commonly used by one of ordinary skill in the art.","In certain embodiments, unit dosage formulations are those containing a dose or unit, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the administered ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, formulations encompassed herein may include other agents commonly used by one of ordinary skill in the art.","The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein, including those for use in treating disorders, for example cardiovascular disorders, may be administered through, different routes, such as oral, including buccal and sublingual, rectal, parenteral, aerosol, nasal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravascular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraarticular, subcutaneous, intradermal, and topical. They may be administered in different forms, including but not limited to solutions, emulsions and suspensions, microspheres, particles, microparticles, nanoparticles, and liposomes. In one embodiment, therapeutic compounds are combined with an acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration in a pill, capsule or with food.","In another embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions locally to the area in need of treatment. This maybe achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local or regional infusion or perfusion during surgery, direct perfusion into a vessel, such as an atherosclerotic vessel, topical application (e.g., wound dressing, drug coated stent), injection, catheter, suppository, or implant (e.g., implants formed from porous, non-porous, or gelatinous materials, including membranes, such as silastic membranes or fibers), and the like. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of a tissue that is to be treated, such as the heart or the peripheral vasculature. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are delivered in a vesicle, in particular liposomes (see, e.g., Langer, 249:1527-1533, 1990; Treat et al., in , Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, N.Y., pp. 353-365, 1989). Combinations of administration methods may also be employed such as a systemic or local infusion of a therapeutic compound of the present invention, before, after or during placement of a stent coated with a therapeutic compound of the present invention.","In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (see, e.g., 249:1527-1533, 1990; Sefton 14:201-240, 1987; Buchwald et al., 88:507-516, 1980; Saudek et al., 321:574-579, 1989). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see, e.g., Ranger et al., 23:61-64, 1983; Levy et al., 228:190-192, 1985; During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351-356, 1989; and Howard et al., 71:105-112, 1989). Other controlled release systems, such as those discussed in the review by Langer (249:1527-1533, 1990), can also be used.","The amount of the pharmaceutical compositions that will be effective depends on the nature of the disorder or condition to be treated, as well as the stage of the disorder or condition. Effective amounts can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and should be decided according to the judgment of the health care practitioner and each subject's circumstances. An example of such a dosage range is 0.1 to 200 mg\/kg body weight in single or divided doses. Other dosage ranges include 1.0 to 150 mg\/kg, 1.0 to 100 mg\/kg, 5.0 to 100 mg\/kg, 10 to 75 mg\/kg body weight in single or divided doses. It is to be understood that any dosage within these ranges may be employed.","The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the condition of the subject undergoing therapy.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure can be administered at about the same dose throughout a treatment period, in an escalating dose regimen, or in a loading-dose regime (e.g., in which the loading dose is about two to five times the maintenance dose). In some embodiments, the dose is varied during the course of a treatment based on the condition of the subject being treated, the severity of the disease or condition, the apparent response to the therapy, and\/or other factors as judged by one of ordinary skill in the art. The volume of administration will vary depending on the route of administration. By way of example, intramuscular injections may range from about 0.1 ml to about 1.0 ml. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know appropriate volumes for different routes of administration.","Diseases or Conditions to be Treated","The present invention provides novel methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives, methods of making them and methods of using them to treat or prevent vascular disease (including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic vascular disease), inflammatory disease, or a related disorder and many of their underlying risk factors.","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives possess the ability to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, these compounds are useful in preventing accumulation of plaque and delaying or preventing atherosclerosis in individuals such as those at risk for atherosclerosis. Since these compounds are useful in preventing accumulation of plaque and delaying or preventing atherosclerosis, they may be administered to prevent or reduce the occurrence of heart attacks, strokes, peripheral arterial disease and revascularization events (coronary artery bypass graft surgery or lower extremity bypass surgery).","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives possess anti-inflammatory properties, as evidenced at least by the effects on activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB). Accordingly, these compounds are useful in various inflammatory disorders including but not limited to atherosclerosis, diabetes, inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), hypertension and aging. For example, these compounds can be combined with an acceptable carrier and administered to patient who has recently sustained a heart attack or stroke or has undergone a recent percutaneous intervention to the coronary or peripheral arterial vessels. These compositions are also useful for administration to patients receiving stents in coronary arteries and peripheral arteries.","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives will have protective effects in diabetes and in preventing diabetic vascular disease including diabetic heart disease, diabetic kidney disease and diabetic cerebrovascular disease, in view of their effects in improving vascular insulin sensitivity.","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives also affect the transcription factor sterol regulator and binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). These compounds act as post-transcriptional activators of SREBP-2 and represent a novel class of selective activators of SREBP-2. The increase in SREBP-2 increases LDLR and lowers LDL cholesterol levels. Accordingly, these compounds may be used to treat hyperlipidemia associated with elevated LDL levels such as heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, combined hyperlipidemia, elevations in VLDL cholesterol and in diabetic dyslipidemia.","Combination Therapy","In light of the substantial benefit provided by these methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives in atherosclerosis and inflammation, they may also be administered in combination with other therapies known to one of ordinary skill in the art to be effective in atherosclerosis and inflammation including but not limited to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), fat uptake inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, PPAR-alpha (e.g., Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone) and PPAR-gamma agonists (Gemfibrozil, Fenofibrate, Bezafibrate), acetylsalicylic acid, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors (Anacetrapib), lipoic acid, and beta-blockers and combinations thereof.","These methylenedioxy phenolic compounds and their derivatives of the present invention may be administered alone or together with another therapeutic compound. Such administration of the compositions of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic compound may occur separately. Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic compound may be combined in one administration or delivery method, for example in one capsule, one caplet or one intravenous administration.","ACE Inhibitors","ACE inhibitors are compounds that inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II by the enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II prevents blood vessels from relaxing and expanding thereby raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure, belong to the antihypertensive class of medicines and may reduce risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 20% to 40%. Inhibiting ACE allows blood vessels to relax and lowers blood pressure. ACE inhibitors lower arteriolar resistance and increase venous capacitance, increase cardiac output and cardiac index, stroke work and volume, lower renovascular resistance, and lead to increased natriuresis (excretion of sodium in the urine). Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that ACE inhibitors reduce the progress of diabetic nephropathy independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect. This action of ACE inhibitors is utilized in the prevention of diabetic renal failure.","ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective for indications other than hypertension even in-patients with normal blood pressure. The use of a maximum dose of ACE inhibitors in such patients (including for prevention of diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, prophylaxis of cardiovascular events) is justified because it improves clinical outcomes, independent of the blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitors.","Generally, ACE inhibitors are not prescribed for patients with kidney problems or with low blood pressure, although people with low blood pressure, surprisingly enough, often tolerate ACE inhibitors quite well. ACE inhibitors should not be used in pregnant women. Some ACE inhibitors are used to treat congestive heart failure or may be used for other conditions as determined by a physician.","ACE inhibitors may be classified based on the presence of functional groups on the compounds. For example, sulfhydryl containing compounds include captopril (CAPOTEN\u00ae, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Dicarboxylate containing compounds include enalapril (VASOTEC\u00ae by Merck), quinapril (ACCUPRIL\u00ae by Pfizer), lisinopril (PRINIVIL\u00ae by Merck or Zestril by Astra-Zeneca), perindopril (ACEON\u00ae by Rhone-Polenc Rorer), and ramipril (ALTACE\u00ae by Hoechst Marion Roussel, King Pharmaceuticals). Phosphate containing compounds include perindopril (ACEON\u00ae by Rhone-Polenc Rorer).","Other ACE inhibitors include benazepril (LOTENSIN\u00ae by Novartis), fosinopril (MONOPRIL\u00ae by Bristol-Myers Squibb), moexipril (UNIVASC\u00ae by Schwarz Pharma), trandolapril (MAVIK\u00ae by Knoll Pharmaceutical (BASF)) and the like. The ACE inhibitors can be classified into sulfhydryl, phosphate, and dicarboxylate compounds.","Of these compounds, several ACE inhibitors are commonly used as antihypertensive agents. These include benazepril, captopril, cilazapril, enalapril, enalaprilat, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril.","Several ACE inhibitors are commonly used as vasodilators, or for the treatment of congestive heart failure. These include benazepril, captopril, cilazapril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, quinapril, ramipril, and randolapril.","Lisinopril, captopril, ramipril, and trandolapril are used in some patients after a heart attack. After a heart attack, some of the heart muscle is damaged and weakened. The heart muscle may continue to weaken as time goes by. This makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood. Lisinopril use may be started within 24 hours after a heart attack to increase survival rate. Captopril, ramipril, and trandolapril help slow down the further weakening of the heart.","Captopril is also used to treat kidney problems in some diabetic patients who use insulin to control their diabetes. Over time, these kidney problems may get worse. Captopril may help slow down the further worsening of kidney problems.","Ramipril is used together with an ACE inhibitor to treat vascular disease and related disorders, including but not limited to patients with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension and also diabetics with hypertension.","Other compounds not listed herein, but that have actions on reducing or inhibiting catalysis of angiotensin I to angiotensin II are also contemplated for use in the present invention.","In one embodiment, the amount of ACE inhibitor is between about 0.1 mg\/day and about 100 mg\/day. In other embodiments, ACE inhibitor is administered at a dose between about 1 mg\/day and about 80 mg\/day. In still other embodiments, ACE inhibitor is administered at a dose between about 5 mg\/day and about 50 mg\/day. A dose of ACE inhibitor may be administered at a starting dose of 5, 10, or 20 mg daily.","Alpha Lipoic Acid","Alpha-lipoic acid, also known as thioctic acid, is a disulfide compound that is a cofactor in vital energy-producing reactions in the body. It is also a potent biological antioxidant. Alpha-lipoic acid was once thought to be a vitamin for animals and humans. There are, however, certain situations, for example, diabetic polyneuropathy, where alpha-lipoic acid might be conditionally essential. Alpha-lipoic acid is found widely in plant and animal sources.","Most of the metabolic reactions in which alpha-lipoic acid participates occur in mitochondria. These include the oxidation of pyruvic acid (as pyruvate) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex and the oxidation of alpha-ketoglutarate by the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme complex. It is also a cofactor for the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) via the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme complex.","Alpha-lipoic acid is approved in Germany as a drug for the treatment of polyneuropathies, such as diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies, and liver disease. Alpha-lipoic acid contains a chiral center and consists of two enantiomers, the natural R- or D-enantiomer and the S- or L-enantiomer. Commercial preparations of alpha-lipoic acid consist of the racemic mixture, i.e. a 50\/50 mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers.","Alpha-lipoic acid and its reduced metabolite, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), form a redox couple and may scavenge a wide range of reactive oxygen species. Both alpha-lipoic acid and DHLA can scavenge hydroxyl radicals, the nitric oxide radical, peroxynitrite, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite. Alpha-lipoic acid, but not DHLA, may scavenge singlet oxygen, and DHLA, but not alpha-lipoic acid, may scavenge superoxide and peroxyl reactive oxygen species.","Exogenous alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to increase ATP production and aortic blood flow during reoxygenation after hypoxia in a working heart model. It is thought that this is due to its role in the oxidation of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria, ultimately enhancing energy production. This activity, and possibly its antioxidant activity, may account for its possible benefit in diabetic polyneuropathy.","Most pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in animals. Alpha-lipoic acid is absorbed from the small intestine and distributed to the liver via the portal circulation and to various tissues in the body via the systemic circulation. The natural R-enantiomer is more readily absorbed than the S-enantiomer and is the more active form. Alpha-lipoic acid readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is found, after its distribution to the various body tissues, intracellularly, intramitochondrialy and extracellularly.","Dihydrolipoic Acid","Alpha-lipoic acid is metabolized to its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), by mitochondrial lipoamide dehydrogenase. DHLA, together with lipoic acid, form a redox couple. It is also metabolized to lipoamide, which functions as the lipoic acid cofactor in the multienzyme complexes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylations of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate. Alpha-lipoic acid may be metabolized to dithiol octanoic acid, which can undergo catabolism.","To date, alpha-lipoic acid in doses up to 600 milligrams daily has been well tolerated. In some conditions such as diabetic neuropathy 300 milligrams of alpha-lipoic acid is administered daily, taken in divided doses.","Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) may also be used with the ACE inhibitor as described above for alpha lipoic acid.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the amount of lipoic acid or lipoic acid derivative administered is between about 1 mg\/day and about 1000 mg\/day. In other embodiments, lipoic acid or lipoic acid derivative is administered at a dose between about 10 mg\/day and about 600 mg\/day. In still other embodiments, lipoic acid or lipoic acid derivative is administered at a dose between about 100 mg\/day and about 400 mg\/day. A dose of lipoic acid or lipoic acid derivative is administered at a starting daily dose of 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg or 600 mg.","Statins","Another therapy which may be combined with the compositions of the present invention or a combination thereof, includes statins.","The statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) form a class of hypolipidemic agents, used as pharmaceuticals to lower cholesterol levels in people with or at risk for cardiovascular disease. They cause cholesterol lowering by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in the rate of cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme in the liver stimulates LDL-receptors, which results in an increased clearance of LDL from the bloodstream and a decrease in blood cholesterol levels. The first results can be seen after one week of use and the effect is maximal after four to six weeks.","Statins include Atorvastatin (LIPITOR\u00ae, TORVAST\u00ae); Fluvastatin (LESCOL\u00ae), Lovastatin (MEVACOR\u00ae, ALTOCOR\u00ae), Mevastatin, Pitavastatin (LIVALO\u00ae, PITAVA\u00ae), Pravastatin (PRAVACHOL\u00ae, SELEKTINE\u00ae, LIPOSTAT\u00ae), Rosuvastatin (CRESTOR\u00ae), and Simvastatin (ZOCOR\u00ae, LIPEX\u00ae).","In one embodiment, the amount of statin is between about 1 mg\/day and about 100 mg\/day. In other embodiments statin is administered at a dose between about 10 mg\/day and about 80 mg\/day. In still other embodiments, statin is administered at about 20 mg\/day and about 60 mg\/day.","Other Useful Therapeutic Agents","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be administered together with one or more of the therapeutic substances disclosed in this paragraph. Anti-inflammatory drugs, for example aspirin, may be administered. The fatty acid reuptake inhibitor ezetimibe (Zetia\u00ae MSP Singapore Company, LLC, Whitehouse Station, N.J.) is also useful in the present compositions. Ezetimibe may also be combined with statins to produce combination drugs such as Vytorin\u00ae (MSP Singapore Company, LLC, Whitehouse Station, N.J.). Drugs to reduce the tendency of platelet aggregation, such as clopidogrel bisulfate, or clotting, such as heparin, may also be administered. Agents that have actions directly or indirectly on the cardiovascular system are included in this category, including but not limited to niacin, fibrates such as fenofibrate and gemfibrozil, and thiazolidinediones.","The following examples will serve to further illustrate the present invention without, at the same time, however, constituting any limitation thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various embodiments, modifications and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.","In step I, an intermediate compound (3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl acetate also called O-Acetylmethylenedioxyphenol and INV-73 herein) is made by the acetylation of 3,4 methylenedioxyphenol [#1].","In this example, acetylation was achieved using acetic anhydride. The acetylated product serves as the starting point of many other derivatives compositions, such as the nitro, amino, and carboxyl derivatives. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that the acetyl function may serve in an analogous capacity as the acetyl group in aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) and may act to inhibit the aggregation of platelets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00014","num":"00014"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00014","he":"47.75mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08198317-20120612-C00014.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Step II, the synthesis of 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenyl acetate (also called O-acetyl nitromethylenedioxyphenol or INV-75 herein) from 3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl Acetate#2, INV-73] is achieved as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0149"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00015","num":"00015"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00015","he":"42.50mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08198317-20120612-C00015.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Step III, the synthesis of 3,4-Methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenol (also called nitromethylenedioxyphenol and INV-74 herein) [#4] from 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenyl acetate [#3, INV-75], is achieved as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0151"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00016","num":"00016"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00016","he":"42.33mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08198317-20120612-C00016.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Cell Culture: All experiments were performed with cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs\u2014Gibco, Invitrogen) and grown to confluence at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% COhumidified incubator, on tissue culture flasks previously coated with 1% gelatin in supplemented culture medium (M199 with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U\/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, heparin 12 I.U.\/ml, 1% retinal derived growth factor, Sigma). Following trypsin treatment, the cells were detached from the flasks and final mono-layers were prepared by seeding HUVECs on gelatin-precoated culture plates and then incubated for 24-48 h to ensure confluence. Cells up to the fourth passage were used for all experiments. Recombinant human TNF-\u03b1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.).","Cell Toxicity Assays: Cellular toxicity was assessed by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay, a commercially available assay for assessment of cellular viability. INV-75 was added to HUVECs for 24 hours, and toxicity assays were performed at the end of this period. The MTT assay relies on the cellular reduction of positively charged tetrazolium salts to their intensely colored formazan product by mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Formazan production is decreased in the presence of impaired mitochondrial redox function and enhanced free radical production and may, therefore, be used as an index of cell viability responses to experimental interventions.","In short, after removing microtiter plates from the incubator, fresh medium containing a fixed volume of reconstituted MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazlium bromide; final concentration: 0.5 mg\/ml] was added to the wells; the plates were kept at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% COenvironment for 2 h, and then the MTT solubilization solution provided by the manufacturer was added. The formazan product formed by the conversion of positively charged tetrazolium salts to the reduced state has low aqueous solubility and is present as purple crystals. Dissolving the formazan with a solubilization buffer (provided in kit) permits the convenient quantification of its formation. Optical density at OD 570 nm is then measured for each well on an absorbance plate reader. The within- and between-assay variability was 3 and 5%, respectively. Various concentrations of INV-75 was tested in cell based assays using the MTT assay, as described above. The concentrations tested ranged from 1 mM to 10 nM and the cells were exposed for over 24 hours in duration ().","These results demonstrated that concentrations up to 100 mM resulted in 2%, 4%, 8%, and 7% cells displaying toxicity at 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM compared to 74% at 1 mM (p=0.001 for 1 mM compared to all other doses). These results were identical to that obtained for the other compounds INV-73, INV-74 and INV-7065. These results confirm the safety of INV-73, INV-74, INV-7065 across the dose range of 10 nM to 100 \u03bcM.","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA): To measure the expression of cell surface adhesion molecules, ELISA technique was utilized (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). Confluent human umbilical HUVEC in 96-well plates were pretreated with INV-75 at various concentrations (1 mM, 10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 100 nM and 1 nM for 24 hours before being stimulated with 2 ng\/mL TNF-\u03b1 for 6 hours.","The results of ELISA analysis of culture media after one experiment with INV-75 pre-treatment are shown in  showed marked reduction in release of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (no statistics are shown). In subsequent experiments we also tested the effects of INV-75 on VCAM-1 expression by western blot. These results showed a reduction in VCAM-1 protein levels by pre-treatment of INV-75 but not with control (vehicle) alone treatment (see section and ).","NF-\u03baB Translocation Assays: Cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-1 (IL-1) activate a pro-inflammatory response in endothelial cells. An early event in this response is nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor. This translocation causes the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes such as adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-Selectin to be induced.","NF-\u03baB is a heterodimer, composed of p65 and p50 subunits. Nuclear translocation is monitored by immunolocalization of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB in fixed cells and is quantified by measuring the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB signal. The nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in stimulated cells such as primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) therefore provides a readout that can be used to study the effects of bioactive compounds on the responsiveness of endothelium to pro-inflammatory stimuli. HUVECs were pre-treated with INV-75 at various concentrations (10 nM to 1 \u03bcM) or control (without [INV-75) for 24 hours. The media was then changed to one containing 10 ng\/ml TNF\u03b1, or 1 \u03bcg\/ml bovine serum albumin (vehicle) for 6 hours. p65 distribution was calculated as intensity in the cytoplasm and nucleus in regions of interest. At least 5 cells per high power field were used and at least 5 high power fields per concentration of the drug were used. The intensities were then expressed as the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic staining at least 5 cells per high power field. The data was then expressed as a ratio of the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio without TNF-\u03b1.","In alternate experiments to assess NF-\u03baB Activation extraction reagents were used to extract nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction from HUVEC cells previously treated with INV-75 at various concentrations for 6-24 hours before being stimulated with 2 ng\/mL TNF-\u03b1 for 6 hours. The expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were evaluated after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation for 6 hours stimulation by western blot analysis. The p65 level in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were then analyzed by western blotting as described above. The effects of INV-75 on NF-\u03baB translocation assays showed that INV-75 inhibits the translocation of p65 to the nucleus starting at 10 nM concentrations.","The aggregate of multiple experiments with INV-75 is shown in . The nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio was compared between control cells treated with vehicle alone, in response to TNF-\u03b1 and in response to TNF-\u03b1 but after 24 hours of incubation with the drug. Pre-treatment with INV-75 resulted in a marked inhibition of nuclear p65 expression (n=3, p<0.01 by one-way ANOVA).","Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP-2) Studies and Results:","A family of transcription factors designated SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding proteins) regulate synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Of these, SREBP-2 mainly regulates cholesterol biosynthesis by alteration of cholesterol synthesis enzymes and LDL receptor expression (SREBP-1c mainly regulates fatty acid synthesis). SREBP-2 is predominantly regulated through post-transcriptional mechanisms and is processed in the Golgi apparatus to a mature form after trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum. To study the effect of INV-75 on SREBP, the following in vitro experiments were performed: HepG2 (Human liver carcinoma cell line) cells were stimulated with INV-75 (0.1 mM) for four hours and corresponding SREBP2 nuclear binding by electrophoretic migration shift assay (EMSA) was assayed. The time course with this dose and dose dependence was analyzed. Next we assessed the expression of both precursor and mature form of SREBP-2 in the cytoplasm by western analysis. Both time course and dose dependence of mature form of SREBP-2 was analyzed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5D"]},"Next we investigated the effect of INV-75 in regulating LDL receptor expression in the same cells using a similar protocol to assess dose and temporal dependence.  depict the time course of LDL receptor expression and dose dependence in response to INV-75. These results clearly show that INV-75 increases LDL receptor expression in a time dependent and dose dependent fashion. Taken together these results suggest that INV-75 may increase LDL receptor expression through an SREBP-2 dependent pathway. INV-75 had no effects on SREBP-1 regulation (data not shown). Simultaneously multiple genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and regulation, apolipoprotein gene expression and expression of PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9) was tested. The latter gene is known to regulate LDL receptor expression by binding to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), inducing LDLR degradation. Inhibition of PSCK9 function is currently being explored as a means of lowering cholesterol levels. The results revealed no effects of INV-75 on PCSK9 expression.","PPAR Activation Assays and Results","We used a reporter gene assay in HepG2 cells to screen for agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family are important drug targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases. PPARs play crucial roles in lipid and glucose metabolism, respectively. Therefore, screening methods that help to rapidly identify activators of these receptors should be of considerable value. INV-75 activated a classic PPAR\u03b1 gene, Acetyl-CoA Oxidase (ACO) in a dose dependent and time dependent fashion (). The time course experiment was performed in presence of INV-75 up to 15 hours. Next we transfected cells with a human full length PPAR\u03b1 promoter-reporter construct and demonstrated that INV-75 increased luciferase activation (). In the next experiment we addressed the time course of PPAR\u03b1 activation and demonstrated activation at times <1 hour and persistent effects on PPAR\u03b1 activation up to 15 hours (). We next tested the specificity of INV-75 for PPAR\u03b1 by performing experiments in HepG2 cells transfected with yeast GAL4-PPAR\u03b1-LBD plasmid+UAS-Luciferase; GAL4-PPAR\u03b4-LBD plasmid+UAS-Luciferase and GAL4-PPAR\u03b1-LBD plasmid+UAS-Luciferase. The PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4 and PPAR\u03b3 binding assays were performed using multiple concentrations of INV-75 (1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM and 1000 \u03bcM). The level of luciferase activity corresponded to the degree of PPAR activation. The results were compared with classic PPAR agonists such as WY-14643 (PPAR\u03b1 agonist), Bezafibrate (PPAR\u03b4 agonist) and Rosiglitazone (PPAR\u03b1 agonist). These results showed that INV-75 increased PPAR\u03b1 ligand binding activity in a selective fashion without effects on PPAR\u03b1 or PPAR\u03b3. Thus INV-75 has selective but partial agonist properties on PPAR\u03b1 activation.","In vivo experiments on hypercholesterolemic rabbits (Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic Rabbits, WHHL) were performed in 6 rabbits treated with INV-75. Four rabbits served as controls.","Animal Model: WHHL rabbits weighing approximately 2 kg at 2 months were purchased from Brown Family in Alabama and housed in the institutional Laboratory Animal Center. Rabbits at the age of 6 months were used for all experiments. Rabbits were allowed free access to water and were fed a high cholesterol chow (2% cholesterol) from Harlan Tekad TD 7251. The animal care and experimental protocols were in accordance with nationally approved guidelines. The protocol that the rabbits were subjected to is outlined in . INV-75 was dissolved in 90% ethanol and sprayed on the high fat chow. The diet-drug mixture was then vacuum dried overnight to remove ethanol and then used to feed rabbits.","In Vivo Protocol (Rabbits):","Each animal underwent three MRI studies: the first one prior to high fat feeding (baseline prior to drug administration); the second at the mid-point of drug therapy; and the final study after 12 weeks of drug therapy (). The WHHL rabbits were allowed to adjust to their new environment after arrival following which baseline MRI measurements and blood work was obtained prior to high cholesterol chow feeding. Drug therapy with INV-75 was begun 4-6 weeks after high fat diet feeding. Mid point measurements were obtained during drug therapy. At the end of the study, all animals underwent an MRI study for plaque volume quantification. Immediately after the last MRI, the rabbits were euthanized and the aorta was harvested and processed for further analysis (histopathology, gene and protein expression. The study protocol was approved by an institutional animal research committee. Anesthesia for the interventions (MRI studies) was induced by intramuscular injection of ketamine (30 mg\/kg) and xylazine (2.2 mg\/kg). Approximately 5 cm of abdominal aorta above the celiac trunk was excised with sterile tools, washed in autoclaved phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until processed for gene and protein expression. All animals received humane care in compliance with the \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\u201d","Noninvasive MRI Protocol and Results","High-resolution non-invasive MRI served to assess the degree of atherosclerosis before and after the corresponding treatments. Atherosclerotic plaque in the abdominal aorta of WHHL rabbits was analyzed by in vivo MRI scans at the indicated time points (). This experimental design allows for each animal to serve as its own control, allowing for true serial data on plaque progression\/regression as well as allowing comparison between treatment-groups. MRI studies were performed by using a 1.5-T magnet (Magnetom Sonata, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a phased array cardiac coil that was wrapped around the animal. Gradient-echo coronal and sagittal images were used to localize the abdominal aorta, and sequential transverse images (3-mm thickness segments with no gap) of the abdominal aorta were obtained from above the celiac trunk to the iliac bifurcation using a TURBO Flash sequence. Forty-eight 4 mm-thick axial slices spanning approximately from the iliac bifurcation to the superior pole of the topmost kidney were obtained using a T1-weighted gradient echo turbo FLASH protocol (TR\/TE 230\/5.0, 3 averages, slice thickness of 4.0 mm with a 5.2 mm gap between slices and a time of acquisition of about 11 minutes). No respiratory or cardiac gating was necessary as the abdominal aorta is relatively free from motion artifact. Plaque burden was determined by manually tracing the external elastic lamina (EEM) and the luminal border (L) and determining the area within each boundary using Siemens Viewer software. Slice volume (V) was calculated as V=(EEM-L)*4.0 and total wall volume per animal was calculated using the formula TWV=\u03a3[(EEM-L)*4] and expressed in mm. TWVs for each animal at each time point were normalized for varying numbers of readable slices with the formula NWV=(TWV\/n)*m; n=number of slices readable in the individual animal and m=mean number of slices readable in all animals over all time points. All normalized wall volumes were reported in mm. The wall volume in the rabbit abdominal aorta, an indication of atherosclerotic plaque, was analyzed by serial in vivo MRI scanning. After 4-6 weeks of feeding with high cholesterol chow, WHHL rabbits had larger abdominal aorta wall volume than age-matched normal chow-fed New Zealand rabbits did, supporting that atherosclerosis was established.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0175"},"figref":"FIG. 8A","sup":["3 ","3","3 ","3"]},"After 6 weeks of dietary supplementation with INV-75, wall volume in the abdominal aorta was significantly reduced compared to the control arm.

These were significantly different (p=10.0004 by one-way ANOVA). At the end of 12 weeks, there was a more pronounced slowing of the rate of progression of plaque in the group that received treatment with INV-75 with wall volumes (SEM) in the control and INV-75 groups being 0.66 cm(0.029 cm) and 0.37 cm(0.025 cm), respectively at 12 weeks. These were significantly different (p=0.0001 by one-way ANOVA). The earlier time point of 6 weeks was also statistically significant compared to control treatment.  depicts representative MRI images of abdominal aortic plaque in animal subjected to control or INV-75 at various time points.","Morphometric Analysis to Assess anti-atherosclerotic effects of INV-75","Segments of descending thoracic aorta were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek USA Inc, Torrance, Calif.) and frozen on dry ice. En face sections were then prepared. To analyze atherosclerotic burden, 8 sections (4 \u03bcm thick) were collected at intervals of 20 \u03bcm. After H&E staining, each section was digitized with a digital camera and analyzed using a microscope (Zeiss Axioskop with Spot I digital camera, Jena, Germany) with National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image software version 1.61. Results were expressed as mm. Morphometric assessment of plaque burden in the thoracic aorta at the end of 12 weeks corroborated the anti-atherosclerotic effects of INV-75 by MRI on the abdominal aorta.

Antibodies against CD68 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Incorporated (Santa Cruz, Calif.). A polyclonal anti-\u03b1-Actin antibody was obtained from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, N.Y.). T cell receptor \u03b2 antibody was obtained from Biolegend (San Diego, Calif.). To quantify the staining, the mean density of 4 negative control (no primary antibody) sections was set as the threshold, and positive area was acquired by software. Results were finally normalized by the area subtended by the external elastic lamina to the luminal interface or the intimal-medial volume. The effects of INV-75 on macrophages and smooth muscle cells in comparison to control group were evaluated by CD68 and \u03b1-actin immunohistochemistry, respectively.

Lipids (cholesterol and LDL) in the blood were evaluated by analyzing the blood samples both at the baseline and the end point measurements. 1 ml of blood from an ear lobe vein was placed into K EDTA tubes at a start of high cholesterol diet and again at the time of sacrifice. All values were expressed as mean\u00b1SD. The bar graph of each group for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol at baseline prior to the initiation of high fat chow, following high fat chow but before intervention and at the end of intervention with INV-75 and control are presented. ( A and ). There were no differences at the end of treatment with INV-75 in total cholesterol or in LDL cholesterol. The lack of effect may relate to the genetic model (WHHL) which has extremely high lipid values and a mutation in the LDL receptor. Since INV 75 is believed to function by increasing LDL clearance through an increase in LDL receptor expression, the lack of effect on LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol (major lipoprotein fraction in this model at baseline and in response to high fat chow feeding) is understandable.","Endothelial function: Organ Chamber Experiments to Study Vascular Physiological Effects","Rabbits were euthanized by injection of lethal doses of pentobarbital. The ascending aortas was removed and 2 mm thoracic aortic rings were suspended in individual organ chambers filled with physiological salt solution buffer (sodium chloride, 130 mEq\/L; potassium chloride, 4.7 mEq\/L; calcium dichloride, 1.6 mEq\/L; magnesium sulfate, 1.17 mEq\/L; potassium diphosphate, 1.18 mEq\/L; sodium bicarbonate, 14.9 mEq\/L; EDTA, 0.026 mEq\/L; and glucose, 99.1 mg\/dL [5.5 mmol\/L]; pH, 7.4), aerated continuously with 5% carbon dioxide in oxygen at 37\u00b0 C. Vessels were allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 hour at a resting tension of 30 mN before being subjected to graded doses of agonists as described previously. The vasoconstrictor agonists included phenylephrine (PE), endothelin-1 (ET-1), or angiotensin II. Responses were expressed as a percentage of the peak response to 120 mEq\/L of potassium chloride. The vessels subjected to PE were washed thoroughly and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour before beginning experiments with acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or insulin. After a stable contraction plateau was reached with PE (0.1 \u03bcM), the rings were exposed to graded doses of the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine, insulin or the endothelium-independent agonist SNP. Results were expressed as a percentage of pre-contraction by PE (0.1 \u03bcM). The rings exposed to acetylcholine were thoroughly washed and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour. After a stable contraction plateau was reached with PE (0.1 \u03bcM), insulin was then added in a cumulative manner followed by a wash and dose response to SNP. Results were expressed as a percentage of pre-contraction by PE (0.1 \u03bcM). INV-75 decreased aortic contraction by angiotensin II but had no effect on phenylephrine ( and ).","In contrast to significant effects on responses to angiotensin II, INV-75 had no effects on response to PE, endothelin-1.

The following compounds are administered to these individuals: 3,4-methylenedioxy phenyl acetate (INV 73); 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenol (INV 74); 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenyl acetate (INV 75); 3,4-Methylenedioxy 6-nitro phenyl lipoate (INV-7465) or 3,4-Methylenedioxy phenyl lipoate (INV-7065). The other individuals receive the carrier alone. A new ultrasound analysis at the end of the treatment period indicates higher levels of plaque in the vessels of individuals receiving the carrier. This example indicates that the individual compounds of the present invention are effective in preventing or reducing atherosclerosis in individuals at risk for developing atherosclerosis and in reducing plaque accumulation in coronary, carotid or popliteal arteries.","Individuals with Type I and Type II diabetes are at risk for future cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease. These individuals are on prevention treatments such as hypolipidemic drug therapy such as statins and anti-hypertensive agents such as ACE inhibitors. They are already receiving glycemia lowering strategies such as Insulin, PPAR\u03b3 agents, Metformin or sulfonylurea therapy. They also will receive an acceptable dose of a composition comprising a compound of the present invention in an acceptable carrier orally chronically for durations in excess of 12 months. In one study, 3,4-Methylenedioxy 6-nitro phenyl lipoate (INV-7465) or 3,4-Methylenedioxy phenyl lipoate (INV-7065) are administered to these individuals. The patients undergo the following measurements: HbA1C to assess glycemic control, urinary microalbuminura, blood pressure and lipid measurements. At the end of 12 months of treatment, there is lowering of HbA1C and urinary microalbuminuria. There is an improvement in VLDL cholesterol and a decrease in triglycerides with any of these treatments [(3,4-methylenedioxy phenyl acetate (INV 73); 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenol (INV 74); 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenyl acetate (INV 75); 3,4-Methylenedioxy 6-nitro phenyl lipoate (INV-7465) or 3,4-Methylenedioxy phenyl lipoate (INV-7065)].","Individuals with Type I and Type II diabetes are at risk for future cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease. These individuals often have abnormalities in lipids such as elevations in triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. They are on treatments such as hypolipidemic drug therapy such as statins and fibrates (Gemfibrozil or Fenofibrate) to lover cholesterol levels in conjunction with glycemia lowering strategies such as Insulin, PPAR \u03b3 agents, Metformin or sulfonylurea therapy. In addition to these treatments they will also receive an acceptable dose of a composition comprising a compound of the present invention in an acceptable carrier orally chronically for durations in excess of 12 months. In one study, (3,4-methylenedioxy phenyl acetate (INV 73); 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenol (INV 74); 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenyl acetate (INV 75); are administered to these individuals. The patients undergo lipid measurements at baseline and at the end of treatment for a 12 month duration. At the end of 12 months of treatment, there is lowering of VLDL cholesterol and a decrease in triglycerides.","Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis suffer from recurrent bouts of inflammatory arthritis. They are usually on treatments such as non-steroidal agents such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, anti-TNF\u03b1 treatments and other types of immunotherapy. In addition to these treatments they will also receive an acceptable dose of a composition comprising a compound of the present invention in an acceptable carrier orally chronically for durations in excess of 6 months. In one study, 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenyl acetate (INV 75) is administered to these individuals. The patients undergo an assessment of joint pains and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. At the end of 6 months of treatment, there is marked improvement in joint pains and markers of inflammation.","All patents, publications and abstracts cited above are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
