No. 6,710,087, which is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/480,899, filed Jan. 11, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,344, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/372,158, filed Aug. 11, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,331,571, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60\/097,665, filed Aug. 24, 1998 and 60\/099,306, filed Sep. 2, 1998, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates to compositions comprising dopamine reuptake inhibitors, including racemic and optically pure metabolites of sibutramine, and to methods of making and using the same.","Sibutramine, chemically named [N-1-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]-3-methylbutyl]-N,N-dimethylamine, is a neuronal monoamine reuptake inhibitor which was originally disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,746,680 and 4,806,570. Sibutramine inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and, to a lesser extent, serotonin and dopamine. See, e.g., Buckett et al., -& ., 12:575-584, 1988; King et al., ., 26:607-611 (1989).","Racemic sibutramine is sold as a hydrochloride monohydrate under the tradename MERIDIA\u00ae, and is indicated for the treatment of obesity. \u00ae 1494-1498 (53ed., 1999). The treatment of obesity using racemic sibutramine is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,272.","Sibutramine appears to have been extensively studied, and reportedly could be used in the treatment of a variety of disorders. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,552,828, 4,746,680, 4,806,570, and 4,929,629 disclose methods of treating depression using racemic sibutramine, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,871,774 and 4,939,175 disclose methods of treating Parkinson's disease and senile dementia, respectively, using racemic sibutramine. Other uses of sibutramine are disclosed by PCT publications WO 95\/20949, WO 95\/21615, WO 98\/11884, and WO 98\/13033. Further, the optically pure entantiomers of sibutramine have been considered for development For example, PCT publications WO 94\/00047 and 94\/00114 disclose methods of treating depression and related disorders using the (+)- and (\u2212)-enantiomners of sibutramine, respectively.","Sibutramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and undergoes an extensive first-pass metabolism that yields the primary metabolites, desmethylsibutramine and didesmethylsibutramine, shown below. \n\n","It has been reported that desmethylsibutramine and didesmethylsibutramine are more potent in vitro noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT; serotonin) reuptake inhibitors than sibutramine. Stock, M. J., , 21(Supp. 1):S25-S29 (1997). It has further been reported, however, that sibutramine and its metabolites have negligible affinities for a wide range of neurotransmitter receptors, including serotonergic (5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT), adrenergic, dopaminergic, muscarinic, histaminergic, glutamate, and benzodiazepine receptors. Id.","Sibutramine has a variety of adverse effects. See, e.g., \u00ae 1494-1498 (53ed., 1999).

For example, the (D)-tartrate salt of racemic didesmethylsibutramine ((R\/S)-DDMS\u00b7(D)-TA) can be prepared as shown below in Scheme 8. It should be noted that the (L)-tartrate salt of racemic didesmethylsibutramine ((R\/S)-DDMS\u00b7(L)-TA) can be prepared in an analogous manner. \n\n","Although any suitable solvent known to those skilled in the art can be used in this method, a preferred solvent is toluene.","The enantiomers of didesmethylsibutramine can be resolved by the formation of chiral salts, as described above. Preferred chiral acids used to form the chiral salts include, but are not limited to, tartaric acid. Preferred solvent systems include, but are not limited to, acetonitrile\/water\/methanol and acetonitrile\/methanol.","The (D)-tartrate salt of optically pure (R)-didesmethylsibutramine ((R)-DDMS\u00b7(D)-TA) can be obtained from racemic didesmethylsibutramine free base as shown in Scheme 9: \n\n","According to this method, racemic DDMS is contacted with (D)-tartaric acid in a suitable solvent. A preferred solvent is a mixture of acetone, water and methanol. The resulting tartarate salt is then isolated from the mother liquor and recrystalized preferably from a mixture of acetone and water to provide (R)-DDMS\u00b7(D)-tartarate in high enantiomeric purity.","Alternatively, optically pure ((R)-DDMS\u00b7(D)-TA) can be isolated from the tartarate salt of racemic didesmethylsibutramine as shown in Scheme 10. \n\n","A method of isolating the (L)-tartrate salt of (S)-didesmethylsibutramine ((S)-DDMS.(L)-TA) from racemic didesmethylsibutramine free base is shown in Scheme 11: \n\n","According to this method, racemic DDMS is contacted with (L)-tartaric acid in a suitable solvent. A preferred solvent is a mixture of acetone, water and methanol. The resulting tartarate salt is then isolated from the mother liquor and recrystalized preferably from a mixture of acetone and water to provide (S)-DDMS.(L)-tartarate in high enantiomeric purity.","With regard to the resolution of didesmethylsibutramine, it has been found that if tartaric acid is used as a resolving agent, a preferred solvent used during the resolution step is a mixture of acetonitrile, water and methanol ethanol. If mandelic acid is used as a resolving agent, a preferred solvent is a mixture of acetonitrile and methanol.","The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of an active ingredient in the acute or chronic management of a disorder or condition will vary with the severity of the disorder or condition to be treated and the route of administration. The dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to age, body weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable dosing regimens can be readily selected by those skilled in the art with due consideration of such factors.","Suitable daily doses for the treatment or prevention of a disorder described herein can be readily determined by those skilled in the art. A recommended dose of racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolite is from about 0.1 mg to about 60 mg per day, given as a single once-a-day dose in the morning or as divided doses throughout the day. Preferably, a daily dose is from about 2 mg to about 30 mg per day, more preferably from about 5 mg to about 15 mg per day.","Suitable daily dosage ranges of additional pharmacologically active compounds that can be adjunctively administered with a racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolite can be readily determined by those skilled in the art following dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the \u00ae (53ed., 1999).","For example, suitable daily dosage ranges of 5-HTantagonists can be readily determined by those skilled in the art and will vary depending on factors such as those described above and the particular 5-HTantagonists used. In general, the total daily dose of a 5-HTantagonist for the treatment or prevention of a disorder described herein is from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 350 mg, and more preferably from about 2 mg to about 250 mg per day.","The therapeutic or prophylactic administration of an active ingredient of the invention is preferably initiated at a lower dose, e.g., from about 2 mg to about 8 mg of sibutramine metabolite and optionally from about 15 mg to about 60 mg of 5-HTantagonist, and increased, if necessary, up to the recommended daily dose as either a single dose or as divided doses, depending on the global response of the patient. It is further recommended that patients aged over 65 years should receive doses of sibutramine metabolite in the range of from about 5 mg to about 30 mg per day depending on global response. It may be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges, which will be readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical art.","The dosage amounts and frequencies provided above are encompassed by the terms \u201ctherapeutically effective,\u201d \u201cprophylactically effective,\u201d and \u201ctherapeutically or prophylactically effective\u201d as used herein. When used in connection with an amount of a racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolite, these terms further encompass an amount of racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolite that induces fewer or less sever adverse effects than are associated with the administration of racemic sibutramine. Adverse effects associated with racemic sibutramine include, but are not limited to, significant increases in supine and standing heart rate, including tachycardia, increased blood pressure (hypertension), increased psychomotor activity, dry mouth, dental caries, constipation, hypohidrosis, blurred or blurry vision, tension, mydriasis, seizures, formation of gallstones, renal\/hepatic dysfunction, fevers, arthritis, agitation, leg cramps, hypertonia, abnormal thinking, bronchitis, dyspnea, pruritus, amblyopia, menstrual disorder, ecchymosis\/bleeding disorders, interstitial nephritis, and nervousness. See, e.g., \u00ae 1494-1498 (53ed., 1999).","Adjunctively administering of two or more active ingredients in accordance with the methods of the invention can be concurrent, sequential, or both. For example, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and a 5-HTantagonist can be administered as a combination, concurrently but separately, or by sequential administration.","Any suitable route of administration can be employed for providing the patient with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective dose of an active ingredient. For example, oral, mucosal (e.g., nasal, sublingual, buccal, rectal, vaginal), parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular), transdermal, and subcutaneous routes can be employed. Preferred routes of administration include oral, transdermal, and mucosal. As mentioned above, administration of an active ingredient for the treatment or prevention of erectile dysfunction is preferably mucosal or transdermal. Suitable dosage forms for such routes include, but are not limited to, transdermal patches, ophthalmic solutions, sprays, and aerosols. Transdermal compositions can also take the form of creams, lotions, and\/or emulsions, which can be included in an appropriate adhesive for application to the skin or can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.","A preferred transdermal dosage form is a \u201creservoir type\u201d or \u201cmatrix type\u201d patch, which is applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredient. For example, if an active ingredient is a sibutramine metabolite, a preferred patch is worn for 24 hours and provides a total daily dose of from about 0.1 mg to about 60 mg per day. Preferably, a daily dose is from about 2 mg to about 30 mg per day, more preferably, from about 5 mg to about 15 mg per day. The patch can be replaced with a fresh patch when necessary to provide constant administration of the active ingredient to the patient.","Other dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, tablets, caplets, troches, lozenges, dispersions, suspensions, suppositories, ointments, cataplasms (poultices), pastes, powders, dressings, creams, plasters, solutions, capsules, soft elastic gelatin capsules, and patches.","In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention comprise a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, such as a racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolite or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or clathrate thereof, and optionally an additional pharmacologically active compound, such as a 5-HTantagonist. Preferred racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolites are (+)-desmethylsibutramine, (\u2212)-desmethylsibutramine, (\u00b1)-desmethylsibutramine, (+)-didesmethylsibutramine, (\u2212)-didesmethylsibutramine, and (\u00b1)-didesmethylsibutramine. The pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients known to those skilled in the art.","In practical use, an active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, preferably without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.","Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.","In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, an active ingredient can also be administered by controlled release means or delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595, 5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476, 5,354,556, and 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, or microspheres or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release.","All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include: 1) extended activity of the drug; 2) reduced dosage frequency; and 3) increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and thus can affect the occurrence of side effects.","Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various inducers, including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.","For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and\/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","This invention further encompasses lactose-free pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms. Lactose is used as an excipient in sibutramine formulations. See, e.g., \u00ae 1494 (53ed., 1999). Unlike the parent drug, however, desmethylsibutramine and didesmethylsibutramine are secondary and primary amines, respectively, and so can potentially decompose over time when exposed to lactose. Thus, compositions of the invention that comprise sibutramine metabolites preferably contain little, if any, lactose other mono- or di-saccharides. As used herein, the term \u201clactose-free\u201d means that the amount of lactose present, if any, is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient.","Lactose-free compositions of the invention can comprise excipients which are well known in the art and are listed in the USP (XXI)\/NF (XVI), which is incorporated herein by reference. In general, lactose-free compositions comprise an active ingredient, a binder\/filler, and a lubricant in pharmaceutically compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable amounts. Preferred lactose-free dosage forms comprise an active ingredient, microcrystalline cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate.","This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen, & , 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, N.Y., 1995, pp. 379-80. In effect, water and heat accelerate decomposition. Thus the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and\/or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment, and use of formulations.","Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolite which contain lactose are preferably anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected.","An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.","In this regard, the invention encompasses a method of preparing a solid pharmaceutical formulation comprising an active ingredient which method comprises admixing under anhydrous or low moisture\/humidity conditions the active ingredient and an excipient (e.g., lactose), wherein the ingredients are substantially free of water. The method can further comprise packaging the anhydrous or non-hygroscopic solid formulation under low moisture conditions. By using such conditions, the risk of contact with water is reduced and the degradation of the active ingredient can be prevented or substantially reduced.","Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 2208, 2906, 2910), microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, for example, the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AVICEL RC-581, and AVICEL-PH-105 (available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division, Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, Pa., U.S.A.). An exemplary suitable binder is a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL RC-581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include AVICEL-PH-103\u2122 and Starch 1500 LM.","Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. The binder\/filler in pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is typically present in about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.","Disintegrants are used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant will produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) should be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typically, about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, preferably about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, can be used in the pharmaceutical composition.","Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.","Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel (AEROSIL 200, manufactured by W. R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, Md.), a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Plano, Tex.), CAB-O-SIL (a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, Mass.), or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, typically in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.","Dosage forms of the invention that comprise a sibutramine metabolite preferably contain from about 0.1 mg to about 60 mg of the metabolite or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or clathrate thereof. For example, each tablet, cachet, or capsule contains from about 0.1 mg to about 60 mg of the active ingredient. Most preferably, the tablet, cachet, or capsule contains either one of three dosages, e.g., about 10 mg, about 20 mg, or about 30 mg of racemic or optically pure sibutramine metabolites (as scored lactose-free tablets, the preferable dose form).","The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials and methods, can be practiced without departing from the scope of this invention.","Example 1 describes the preparation of racemic and optically pure sibutramine.","Examples 2-6 describe the preparation of racemic and optically pure forms of desmethylsibutramine (DMS). In each of these examples, the enantiomeric purity of DMS was determined using a Chiorobiotic V analytical column (10 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm\u00d725 mm) with 20 mM ammonium acetate\/IPA (65:35) as the mobile phase. The UV detector was set to a wavelength of 222 nm.","Examples 7-10 describe the preparation of racemic and optically pure forms of didesmethylsibutramine (DDMS). In each of these examples, the enantiomeric purity of DDMS was determined using an ULTRON ES-OVM analytical column (150 mm\u00d74.6 mm) with 0.01 M KHPO\/MeOH (70:30) as the mobile phase. The UV detector was set to a wavelength of 200 nm.","Examples 11-12 describe methods of determining binding affinities of the compounds of the invention and binding affinities measured using those methods.","Finally, Example 13 describes oral formulations comprising compounds of the invention.","Synthesis of 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)cyclobutanecarbonitrile","To a suspension of NaH (17.6 g 60%, washed with hexane) in dimethylsulfoxide (150 mL) at room temperature with mechanical stirring was added over a one hour period a mixture of chlorbenzylnitrile (30.3 g) and 1,3-dibromopropane (22.3 mL, 44.5 g).
