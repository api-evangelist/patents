title: Methods and systems for increased communication throughput
abstract: Systems and methods for increasing communication throughput by superimposing multiple signal components in the same bandwidth are disclosed. Cochannel interference is reduced by using signal separation algorithms. The signal separation algorithms may use both a priori information about the superimposed signals and measured channel parameters. In addition, error correction encoding and interleaving may be used to reduce signal power and obviate the need for ideal signal separation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/635,670 filed on Dec. 10, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802-09-C-0001 awarded by the Department of the Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Various technical and economic factors have led to a desire to increase communication throughput within a given frequency bandwidth. Several techniques have been developed. One approach, for example, utilizes higher order signal modulation formats such as 8 Phase Shift Keying (8PSK) and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) to obtain greater bandwidth efficiency. Such modulation formats maximize the data transmitted in a given bandwidth, resulting in increased bandwidth efficiency. These modulation formats are often characterized by the number of bits per Hertz, e.g., Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) has \u00bd bit\/Hz. Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) has 1 bit\/Hz, and 8PSK has 1.5 bits\/Hz, and 16 QAM has 2 bits\/Hz. For example, for a given bandwidth 16 QAM can communicate 4 times more bits than BPSK. One limitation of higher order modulation is increased stringency on transmitter linearity resulting in transmitter power backoff requirements that reduce signal power for receiver detection and prompt the development of linearizers to allow operation closer to transmitter saturated output levels.","Other techniques for maximizing bandwidth efficiency and increasing communication throughput focus on maintaining isolation of independent data, for example, by polarization, geographic location, or frequency sub-band. Polarization techniques utilize orthogonally polarized antennas. Each orthogonal polarization communicates independent data streams to double the throughput. Sufficient isolation afforded by orthogonal polarization allows communication without cochannel interference but imposes stringent antenna design requirements to achieve and maintain orthogonal polarizations. According to geographic or spatial techniques, coverage areas served by antennas are broken into spatially isolated regions. Different spatially isolated antenna regions may re-use the same bandwidth to communicate independent data streams, thus, increasing communication throughput. In this case, stringent requirements on antenna sidelobe levels are necessary to avoid mutual interference. One frequency-based technique is frequency division multiple access, or FDMA. Each individual user in a FDMA scheme is assigned one or more subbands, but sufficient frequency separation between adjacent subbands is required to avoid mutual interference. All of these isolation-based techniques increase data throughput, but impose stringent isolation requirements that are achieved by passive design techniques so that communication to individual users is not degraded, for example, due to co-channel interference (CCI) or other interference.","Other techniques for maximizing bandwidth efficiency and increasing communication throughput use adaptive subtraction to allow two users to superimpose data streams onto the same bandwidth resulting in a composite signal. Upon reception of the composite signal containing both data streams, each user adaptively subtracts a time delayed adjusted replica of their respectively transmitted signal to receive the other user's data stream. In this way, the communication throughput is doubled. Commercial embodiments of this technique exist including, for example, AST's DOUBLETALK and ViaSat's PCMA (Paired Carrier Multiple Access). Such techniques allow reuse of the same frequency bandwidth, but are limited in that they require that uplink signals originate and terminate at the same users' locations so that an adaptively subtracted time delay of one user's signal can be used to obtain the other user's signal. Further, the composite signal cannot be broadcast to multiple receiving sites because signal replicas must be available at all users' sites to perform the required adaptive subtraction. (See ).","Yet other techniques for maximizing bandwidth efficiency and increasing communication throughput utilize signal separation to separate data streams whose spectral content (or bandwidth) partially or completely overlap (e.g., blind signal separation). These blind signal separation techniques separate superimposed signals based on, for example, spectral differences or statistical independence between data streams. Blind signal separation techniques have been applied to a variety of problems, including communications, geophysical exploration, image processing and biological applications. Examples of signal separation techniques include maximum likelihood techniques, maximum a priori techniques, and higher order statistical approaches. Such signal separation techniques can be very useful, but are most effective only when the signals or streams to be separated exhibit the statistical independence and\/or spectral differences that a selected signal separation technique is configured to detect.","Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods that use signal processing techniques to allow the frequency bandwidth to be shared among two or more independent data streams as a means to increase communication throughput. These embodiments allow the separation of the independent data streams from a composite signal comprised of the multiple independent data streams negating what would normally be unacceptable levels of CCI or other interference for conventional receiving systems. In this way, multiple signal components may partially or completely share the same frequency bandwidth by applying signal separation techniques to obtain acceptable communication performance for each of the multiple signals. Such embodiments may provide an increase in communication throughput that is achieved by applying signal processing techniques to a composite signal to communicate multiple independent data streams without the constraint imposed by passive design techniques to isolate the individual signal components.","Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for increasing the data throughput of a communications system by creating a composite signal in the spectral, spatial, or polarization domains comprised of multiple independent data streams having bandwidths that at least partially overlap. These signal processing embodiments include a signal separation algorithm to separate the multiple data streams, a channel estimator that utilizes a priori information and measurements of the channel parameters of the data streams, and a performance monitor that provides real time measures of signal separation performance.","In various embodiments, multiple digitally modulated signals may be simultaneously transmitted in overlapping frequency bands by a common transmission medium. The transmitted signals may differ in at least one of carrier frequency, carrier phase, delay and impulse response, and are received as a composite signal. A channel estimator is configured to determine the channel parameters of the individual signals. The receiver has knowledge of the characteristics of the individual signal components that may include modulation format, signal block characteristics such as preambles, error correction and interleaving descriptions, bit pulse shapes, nominal code and bit rates, and other descriptors of the signal components. The channel estimator uses this information to perform measurements of the composite signals to ascertain channel parameters and may include fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques to determine carrier frequency differences of the multiple signal components and phase and delay lock loop techniques to determine bit timing and code phase differences of the multiple signal components. These measurements define the channel parameters of the individual signals allowing construction of matched filter responses of the components, for example, and the measurements may be continuously performed to dynamically address any drift in the channel parameters. The information furnished by the channel estimator is incorporated into a signal separation algorithm. A performance monitor assesses the signal separation performance to provide a real time indication to system operators. The performance monitor may assess the stability of the channel parameters, compare the sum of the individual separated signal powers with the composite signal power to determine if matched filter responses have been achieved by the signal separation, or in the case of recursive signal separation algorithms, examine the consistency of results of sequential iterations.","Various embodiments may be used for the signal separation algorithm. Several formulations are conventionally used and are described, for example, as blind signal separation algorithms that are based on maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori, maximum entropy, and statistical independence of component signals formulations. These signal separation techniques are referred to as \u201cblind\u201d because these algorithms do not exploit detailed characteristics of the channel parameters. The signal separation algorithms used in the various embodiments differ from the conventional blind signal separation algorithms because a priori signal descriptions and measurements of channel parameters are used in the separation process. Consequently, the various embodiments described herein use what will be referred to as \u201csignal separation algorithms.\u201d","These embodiments also may use error correction coding and interleaving modulation techniques to reduce the signal power needed for reliable detection and to correct errors incurred in time periods where channel parameter alignments challenge separation so that ideal signal separation is not required for reliable signal reception.","Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.","Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for separating multiple (e.g., two or more) independent data streams having overlapping frequency bandwidths. These systems and methods may be used to increase data throughput by allowing a single bandwidth to be utilized by multiple data streams. For example, when first and second data streams fully or partially occupy the same frequency bandwidth, they may be received as a composite input signal. The signal levels of the first and second data streams may have comparable or disparate values. Various embodiments may be directed to separating a composite input signal to reconstruct the first and second data streams. Although many of the examples herein describe separating first and second data streams from a composite input signal, it will be appreciated that the techniques described herein may be used to separate an arbitrary number of data streams having partially or completely overlapping frequency bandwidths.","According to various embodiments, a channel estimator may utilize a priori information about the first and second data streams and, in some embodiments, measurements of the composite signal to determine the channel parameters of the first and second data streams. Results of the channel estimator may be utilized by a signal separation algorithm that may utilize statistical measures, as described herein, to provide multiple signal outputs (e.g., the first and second data streams). Any suitable signal separation algorithm may be used including, for example, algorithms based on joint maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori, erasure, independent component analysis, etc. In various embodiments, these signal separation algorithms differ from blind signal separation techniques in that they may incorporate a priori information or measurement of signal channel parameters in their operation.","In some embodiments, the first and second data streams may utilize error correction techniques, such as error correction encoding and\/or interleaving, to reduce the signal levels needed for acceptable communication performance, to compensate for randomly located signal separation errors, and to maintain communication performance during time periods of unfavorable channel parameter alignments. The signal processing utilized in the signal separation algorithm may also incorporate signal decoding and\/or deinterleaving in order to produce the first and second data streams.","According to various embodiments, the first and second data streams may originate and\/or terminate at different locations. In this way, parties at different geographic locations may transmit communications on the same bandwidth. Further, the composite signal may be communicated to multiple users and since signal replicas required for known adaptive subtraction techniques are not needed, the signal separation techniques may advantageously allow users to receive one or more signal components in the composite signal increasing communication flexibility. Also, various embodiments may be utilized in conjunction with other bandwidth-sharing techniques to improve efficiency. This may allow some mutual interference control constraints of the other bandwidth-sharing techniques which may be relaxed or eliminated. For example, the strict orthogonality requirements of polarization reuse techniques may be relaxed, adjacent frequency slots used in FDMA techniques may be allowed to overlap, and\/or some spatial overlap of spatially separated signals may be allowed. The resulting mutual interference between data streams may be removed utilizing various embodiments of the signal separation techniques used herein.","Various embodiments may include a channel estimator and a detector for separating multiple signals from a single received signal. The channel estimator and detector may be useful for, inter alia, separating uncoordinated co-channel signals of comparable power from a single received signal impaired by one or more of intersymbol interference, mutual interference, and additive noise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","400","200","300","600","500"]},"Signals or information derived from the signal source  may be passed to the initialization block from a signal source output  and one or more outputs  of the initialization block  may be coupled for signal communication to the symbol detector .

In various embodiments, the signal capture device may include one or more of an antenna, a down converter, an anti-aliasing filter, and an Analog-to-Digital (A\/D) Converter. For example, a device for capturing a satellite signal can include all of these components. In embodiments without matched filtering, oversampling may be employed to compensate for the lack of a matched filter at the signal capture device . Oversampling may make the algorithm of second channel estimator  more robust to symbol-timing misalignments. Among other things, oversampling may allow the capture of \u201csufficient statistics\u201d from the received signal and enables channel estimation without knowledge of the channel impulse response. In some embodiments, A\/D converter sample rates may be greater than two times the data rate. For example, embodiments sampling intermediate frequencies (IF) may utilize sample rates in the range of two to ten times the data rate.","From the signal capture device, digital data (r, r, . . . , r, . . . ) may be passed to the initializer block  where an initial channel estimate is made and data is suitably formatted for the detector . Channel estimation by an initial channel estimator  may provide initial guesses for channel parameters  that will be used by the detector . For example, for the case of two channels with two taps each, a first estimate may be h=[1, 0] and h=[1, 0], a second estimate may be h=[1, 0] and h=[0,1], a third estimate may be h=[0, 1] and h=[1, 0], and a fourth estimate may be h=[0, 1] and h=[0, 1]. In some embodiments, the initial condition may be given by two channel impulse responses with a single non-zero tap each. This will take care of h and \u03c4 (the delay being the position of the non-zero tap). As for \u03c6 and f, they may be estimated by the second channel estimator , unless prior information can be used; for instance, if this is not the first data block, a good initial estimate for \u03c6 and f are the values estimated in the previous block.","Data formatting may provides a digital representation of the received signal r(t) suited for use by the detector. In various embodiments, data provided to the detector  may be formatted by a decimator  that decimates the data (R, R, . . . , R, . . . ). And, in some embodiments, the data is formatted into data blocks  for block detection, each data block corresponding to N symbols in the original signals , . As shown in , the decimated data is formatted into blocks suited for block detection algorithms. In other embodiments the data is formatted for symbol by symbol detection.","From the initialization block , the initial channel estimates and the data from data block  may be passed to a detector  for symbol detection. Detected symbols may be passed to the second channel estimator  from an output  of the detector . Various symbol detection and channel estimation algorithms may be used. These include 1) joint maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation and block sequence detection procedure, 2) joint maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) symbol-by-symbol detection with least mean square LMS or recursive least square (RLS) channel estimation and tracking, or 3) Viterbi sequence detection with per-survivor LMS or RLS channel estimation and tracking. In some embodiments, LMS and RLS techniques may be used in conjunction with the second channel estimator . Here, the channel estimation operation cannot be neatly separated from the trellis . Each trellis state may have its own LMS\/RLS channel estimator, and the trellis  and second channel estimator  may work in synergy. In some embodiments, the second channel estimator  may be eliminated.","In various embodiments, an iterative joint maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation and block sequence detection procedure may be used. Here, the states of the detector  states may be augmented to include the memory of the two signals' channels (impulse responses) and the memory provided by the channel codes, if present. The second channel estimator  may be used to provide the sequence detector with information about the symbol timing, phase offset, and generally the channel impulse responses experienced by the two incoming signals. In particular, this embodiment may include a blind Viterbi detector  implementing a block maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm in the assumption that the received signal is buried in Gaussian noise. A trellis structure  in the Viterbi detector  may combine the memory of the two signals, e.g., the two impulse responses as seen by the two signals and the redundancy due to the channel code, if present.

In some embodiments, trellis path probabilities are identified where each possible path has a path metric equal to the sum of the metrics for each branch in the path. And, in various embodiments branch metrics are based on a negative log-likelihood function (assuming, for example, AWGN), such that smaller values of the metric indicate higher probabilities. Here, it follows that the path through the trellis with the smallest path metric identifies the most probable path and thus the symbols most likely received at the signal capture device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"60","sup":["2 ","2","2 ","\u2212"],"sub":["k","k-1"]},"As shown in the figure, each departing state  has four departing branches  extending to four different arriving states .

As persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, this follows from the Viterbi algorithm: because positive metrics add as one proceeds in the trellis, any path that goes through state +1\/+1 (See  in ) would have an accumulated metric no smaller than the one that at time k=1 has metric 0.032, therefore the three paths that have higher metrics at time k=1 can be safely dropped as they have no chance of surviving.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 6","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"sup":"\u2212"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7C","b":["70","1","2"],"sup":["\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212"]},"Symbols detected by the detector are passed to the second channel estimator  where a channel estimate (\u03c6, \u03c4, h, f) for each channel is produced .

Sequence detection and channel estimation may be iterated and tested as described below.","Referring again to , a channel convergence tester  of the test block  monitors channel estimates  for convergence of the estimates made for each channel. If one or both channels fail the convergence test, another iteration is performed where the last channel estimates  are passed to the detector and the same block of data is processed again, along with the updated channel estimates. For example, this test can be given by the comparison of the estimated channel impulse response (inclusive of delay, phase, and frequency) at the current time and the one at the previous time. If there has been no appreciable change (e.g., norm of the difference is less than a user-defined threshold), then convergence has been reached.","Suitable channel convergence tests include those known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and in particular include convergence tests based on differences between successive estimates of (a) one or more channel parameters or (b) combinations of two or more channel parameters. For example, in various embodiments, the norm or two-norm of the difference of successive channel impulse responses indicates convergence when it falls below a threshold value. And, in some embodiments the threshold is based on an estimated (or expected) value of the signals' amplitudes so exact knowledge of the signals ,  is not required.","If the estimates for each channel have converged, a symbol sequence tester  of the test block  may operate to test the goodness of the symbol detection. The goodness of the symbol detection may be assessed using any means known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. For example, in various embodiments trellis metrics may be passed  to the symbol sequence tester  from a detector trellis output . And, in some embodiments the symbol sequence tester may evaluate the goodness of the symbol detection by comparing the trellis end survivors' metrics. In various embodiments, the symbol sequence detector looks at the survivors' metrics to determine if there is a clear winner.","In various embodiments, the symbol detection is accepted if the smallest trellis end survivor, the one representing the winning path, differs from other trellis end survivors by a factor greater than \u201cr\u201d.

For example, in the above exemplary trellis the winning path metric is 0.0018; as compared with the next closest trellis end survivor, 0.14, these values differ by a factor greater than 70. In this case, the goodness of the symbol detection is proved and the symbols would be accepted.","Where the goodness of the symbol detection is shown by trellis metrics  or otherwise, the detected symbols are accepted and control returns to the initialization block . In the initialization block, another block of data  is formatted and passed to symbol detector  where the iterative process starts again using the most recent channel estimates from the second channel estimator . In some embodiments accepted symbols are passed to a symbol memory device  via an output  of the symbol detector .","As persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, some or all of the functions of the initializer block , symbol detector , second channel estimator , and test block  can be implemented in one or more software controlled devices.

In general, signal separation algorithms would be selected based on requirements for specific applications. In some applications, e.g., orthogonal polarizations, the independent signals may utilize a common frequency reference and the differences in the channel parameters may be selected and established by design to ease signal separation. In such applications, algorithms with modest computational complexity, such as the maximum likelihood algorithm, may provide acceptable performance. In other applications where channel parameters may not be easily controlled, more robust algorithms, such as the maximum a posteriori, that use recursive iterative decision processes to increase confidence in separation results may be appropriate even if at the expense of increased computation complexity.","As illustrated in the Figures, the methods and systems disclosed herein implement signal separation techniques and increase communication throughput. Earlier methods, such as adaptive cancellation, are restrictive because a replica of one signal is required to obtain the other signal. (See, e.g., ). If, for example, a composite signal is broadcast to multiple users, a signal replica must be available to each user to separate the other signal in the composite received signal. Alternatively, signal separation techniques such as the examples disclosed herein may increase the flexibility of using signal superposition techniques to increase the communication throughput because, for example, multiple users may receive the composite signal and obtain one or more signal components in the composite signal as desired. If, for example, the individual signals have different preambles known to the users, signal acquisition and separation may be performed more easily.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15A"]},"Another example of the signal separation approach of the application includes situations where the same frequency bandwidth is shared by independent data streams that are isolated by polarization or spatial separation. Two signals are commonly transmitted on the same frequency bandwidth by using orthogonal polarizations that allow the communication throughput to be doubled, a technique commonly referred to as polarization reuse. Similarly, the same frequency bandwidth may be reused when the signals are spatially isolated\u2014referred to as frequency reuse\u2014as may occur with satellite uplink antennas that communicate to different coverage areas that are spatially separated. Alternatively, frequency reuse may apply in terrestrial communication systems where signals are using the same frequency bandwidth coming from different directions and are received in a common location. These independent signals must be isolated from one another. Conventionally, passive design techniques accomplished the required signal isolation. When orthogonal polarization is used, stringent requirements are applied to the polarization purity to obtain the required isolation. These requirements exist for both the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna systems. Likewise, when independent signals are used in spatially isolated areas, requirements are placed on the sidelobe levels of receiving antennas so that signals from other spatial locations do not interfere with the signal aligned with the antenna's main beam. These requirements on the system antennas may increase the cost of their implementation. Moreover, shortfalls in the passive design approaches to obtain the required signal isolation degrade communication performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 17"],"b":["1702","1704","908","1702","1704"]},"Frequency reuse systems may also benefit from operations using signal separation techniques. The isolation from signals arriving from different angular directions is typically limited by the antenna sidelobes that couple unwanted signal components from other directions of arrival. The signal separation techniques of this disclosure may also address shortfalls in the isolation provided by passive sidelobe control. Signal separation techniques may also provide additional isolation that cannot be achieved through passive antenna design techniques that allow reduced angular separation between regions sharing the same frequency bandwidth.","Satellite communication systems typically divide the earth's field of view into different coverage areas. When these coverage areas are sufficiently separated, the same frequency bandwidth may be shared by users located within each of these coverage areas increasing the communication throughput of the satellite. Generally, the total available frequency allocation is divided into different subbands and a frequency reuse plan that assigns subbands to the various coverage areas is developed. A contiguous set of beams in an equilateral triangular arrangement produced by multiple beam satellite antennas is commonly used. A frequency reuse technique that divides the total allocated bandwidth into three subbands is the minimum number that avoids adjacent beams assigned to use the same frequency subband in such beam arrangements. If more isolation between coverage areas that share the same frequency subband is required, the total allocated bandwidth may be divided into seven subbands so that beams using the same frequency subband have greater spatial separation. When the frequency reuse plan has a smaller number of subbands, each subband has a greater bandwidth than when a frequency reuse plan has a larger number of subbands which increases the communication throughput. For example, suppose 21 beams are used and the total allocated bandwidth is 210 MHz. If the 7 beam frequency reuse plan is used, each subband would have a 30 MHz bandwidth. If the 3 beam frequency reuse plan is used instead, each subband would have a 70 MHz bandwidth. Since 21 beams are used in this example, the 7 beam frequency reuse plan provides 21\u00d730 MHz or 630 MHz of bandwidth available for communication, whereas the 3 beam frequency reuse plan provides 21\u00d770 MHz or 1470 MHz of bandwidth available for communication that provides much greater communication throughput than the 7 beam frequency reuse plan.","Similarly, terrestrial communication systems benefit when signal separation techniques are used. Like the polarization reuse application, signal separation techniques may address shortfalls in the isolation provided by passive antenna sidelobe control. Moreover, when signal separation augments the isolation provided by passive antenna sidelobe control, the minimum angular separation between terrestrial users may be reduced allowing more terrestrial users to converge on a given location increasing communication throughput. In operation, such systems typically use discrete antennas where each of the main antenna beams is aligned with a system user. The isolation between the angularly separated system users depends on the antenna's main beam gain level and the antenna sidelobe gain level in the direction of another system user. The isolation can generally be increased by increasing the antenna's size which increases the main beam gain level; however, this approach is costly and larger antennas are more sensitive to positioning variations from wind loading that degrade communication performance and sometimes have appearance issues.","In practical applications, the cost of achieving the required isolation by using passive design techniques may be weighed against the cost of the signal processing in the signal separation technique. Further, both the cross polarized components in the polarization reuse technique and the sidelobe levels in the frequency reuse technique have a frequency dependence. The signal separation algorithms may provide the necessary equalization to obtain the required isolation over the frequency bandwidth containing the composite signals.","In some applications, the separation algorithms may result in both desired and undesired signal components. Rather than simply discarding the undesired signal components, the respective undesired signal components may be combined with their desired signal components to increase the signal levels of the desired components. For example, the undesired horizontally polarized antenna component in  may be combined with the desired horizontal component and similarly the undesired vertically polarized component received by the horizontally polarized antenna component. In this way, the signal power for the desired signal component may be increased improving signal detection performance. Maximal ratio coherent combining may be used and the increased signal to noise (S\/N) ratio depends on the level of the lower level undesired signal component illustrated in . The benefits of such combining depend on the signal level of the undesired component. In addition, the implementation cost of such maximal ratio combining may be weighed against the signal increase benefits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIGS. 19A and 19B","FIG. 19B","FIG. 19A","FIG. 19B"],"b":["1902","1904","1906","1908"]},"The signal separation for FDMA shown in  generalizes the signal separation for two signals described in . In , three components exist in a given subband: the desired signal component and undesired signal components from the two adjacent subbands. Again, maximal ratio coherent combining may be used to increase the desired signal power by separating the signal components in each of the two adjacent subbands and combining the signal components from the adjacent subbands with the desired signal in a given subband. The application of this signal combining depends on the level of signal powers in the adjacent subbands.","These example applications provide a description of the flexibility of the signal separation techniques in increasing the communication throughput.
