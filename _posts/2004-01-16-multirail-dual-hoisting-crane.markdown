title: Multi-rail dual hoisting crane
abstract: Containers are respectively loaded onto and delivered from two trolleys of a single crane at pick-up and delivery locations by guided travel along a fixed travel path on a boom between the delivery location at one end of the boom and a central structure of the crane with a platform positioned thereon having a pair of parallel spaced track paths. Lateral movement of the platform alternatively aligns one of the parallel track paths with the fixed travel path to accommodate transfer of the trolleys along such fixed travel path and either one of the track paths on the platform between the pick-up and delivery locations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/506,463 filed Sep. 26, 2003, entitled \u201cMulti-Rail Dual Hoisting Crane\u201d, incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to the transport of containers on a crane between land-based delivery and dockside sea vessel pick-up locations.","Current facilities for transport of containers between land and ships involve large marine terminal cranes, which typically embody one trolley traveling along the length of a boom for pick-up and delivery of the containers. While such cranes may be adequate for low demand at small scale sea ports, at larger ports such cranes are a disrupting bottleneck to terminal activities, which call for additional equipment and cranes to avoid delays in port traffic and container transfer. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for a more efficient less costly and less time-consuming transfer of containers from land-based trucks to dock-side ships through the aforementioned type of marine terminal crane.","The present invention is related to the invention covered in a related copending application Ser. No. 10\/758,560, filed Jan. 16, 2004. The inventions disclosed in both applications involve use of a single crane through which repeated cycles of two simultaneously functioning trolleys may be moved along fixed paths on a boom. Pursuant to the present invention each of the trolleys is also moved along one of two parallel spaced straight rail paths on a platform that is laterally displaced in a direction perpendicular to a fixed path on the boom for either straight-through transit of the trolley or lateral transfer thereof between fixed boom rail paths so as to accommodate transfer of each trolley between the boom paths and either one of two loading and unloading positions under a central crane structure. One of the trolleys may thereby be cyclically emptied or loaded from one end of the boom, while the other trolley is either loaded with a container or emptied at one of the two positions underlying the platform.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrate a multi-rail crane  adapted to be moved to a position for transfer of standard containers, such as a container  between pick-up and delivery locations respectively disposed on a land-based pier  and dockside sea vessels . The crane  has a support frame  embodying four vertical gantry legs  interconnected in spaced relation to each other so as to support on their upper ends a rectangular central structure  in a horizontal position. An elongated boom  extends horizontally from the central structure  over the sea vessel . Opposite ends  and  of the boom  are spaced from the central structure  by different amounts. The boom end  is spaced a sufficient distance from the central structure  so as to accommodate container delivery thereat onto the sea vessel  when the crane  is appropriately positioned on the pier  by motorized wheel assemblies  at the lower ends of the crane gantry legs . Support cables  attached to the top of an anchor  fixed to the central structure  maintains the boom  in its horizontal position by connection of the lower ends of the cables  to the boom  adjacent to its opposite ends  and .","The container  is suspended below the boom  by a spreader bar  from one trolley  as shown in  so as to undergo travel along a fixed rail path on the underside of the boom  between its end  and the central structure  as shown by dotted line in . A second container  is suspended by a spreader bar  below the central structure  from a second trolley  mounted below a platform  as shown in  performing a lateral switching function as hereinafter explained.","The platform  as shown in  is mounted below the central structure  on a trolley  supported on a pair of tracks , fixed to the underside of the structure  to expose the platform  below the structure . The platform  is moved laterally relative to the boom  on the underside of the central structure  by the trolley  attached to the platform . Such lateral movement of the platform  by its trolley  is guided along the tracks  mounted on the central structure . Two pairs of tracks  and  are formed on the underside of the platform  as shown in  to establish a pair of parallel spaced straight trolley travel paths which are alternatively aligned, by lateral movement of the platform  along the tracks , with a fixed travel path established along the underside of the boom  by aligned boom tracks  fixed thereto and the tracks  fixed to the central structure . The trolleys  and  are respectively guided for movement along the tracks  on the boom , the tracks  or  on the platform  and the fixed tracks  on the central structure  as shown in ,  and . The spreader bars  respectively suspend the containers  and  from the trolleys  and . When either one of the platform tracks  and  is aligned with the fixed boom tracks  as shown in , the trolley  or  with its spreader bar  may be switched between the boom tracks  and the platform tracks  or  so as to thereby transfer the container  or  between the underside fixed travel paths on the boom  and tracks positioned on the central structure  as hereinafter explained.","The multi-rail crane  as hereinbefore described utilizes the two trolleys  and  in alternating fashion on a single set of the tracks  on the boom  which is of standard size and weight. The platform trolley  provides motorized switching of the platform  to provide selective use of the two sets of tracks  and  thereon laterally spaced from each other in a side by side fashion. The two trolleys  and  may thereby be operated in unison to provide for more efficient crane delivery. While one of the trolleys  or  is at a land-side location under the central structure  for pick-up of the container  or , the other of the trolleys  or  may be at the boom end  for dropping off the container  or  onto the cargo hold of the ship . The emptied trolley  or  then rotates the spreader bar  suspended therefrom by 90\u00b0 in a counter-clockwise direction and moves back to the switching platform  onto the platform tracks . Once the emptied trolley  or  is on the platform , platform switching is effected by lateral movement of the platform trolley  on the platform  as shown in  along tracks  on the underside of the central structure , to the position shown in , with the other pair of the platform tracks  aligned with the tracks  on the central structure . The other fully loaded trolley  or  then has a cleared main trail path toward the boom end  along the tracks ,  and  for delivery of the container  or  to the ship . After the loaded trolley  or  passes the platform , the emptied trolley  or  laterally spaced from such main rail path rotates the spreader bar  or  suspended therefrom clockwise by 90\u00b0 and proceeds to pick up a container . Trolleys and containers would then be positioned as shown in ,  and . The trolley  by delivery of the container  at the boom end  is emptied and begins its movement back toward the platform , while the spreader bar  suspended therefrom is again rotated 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise, so that the trolley  may easily pass by the loaded trolley  along the platform tracks , without stopping on the platform  to await switching, and continue to move inland onto the fixed pair of tracks  to thereby facilitate movement of trucks  along two traffic lanes as shown in  below the crane . Since there are two distinct locations for container transfer below the central structure  of the crane , utilizing the two lanes of traffic for the trucks  decreases truck waiting time and increases truck transfer efficiency. Once the trolley  has been moved onto the fixed tracks , it rotates the spreader bar  suspended therefrom by 90\u00b0 clockwise before the platform  is laterally switched back to its position aligning the platform tracks  with the boom tracks  so as to allow the loaded trolley  to deliver the container  to the ship . The trolleys  and  are then back in their original position from which a complete transfer process may be repeated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A","FIG. 7A","FIG. 1","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7C","FIG. 7D","FIG. 1","FIG. 7E","FIG. 7F","FIG. 7G"],"b":["7","7","7","7","7","7","10","46","52","42","44","12","34","46","26","16","37","36","50","34","46","42","52","37","36","50","34","52","44","37","46","34","56","37","26","36","37","46","44","40","34","50","56","37","44","44","37","42","42","46","52","34","52","42","46","26","16"]},"Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings.
