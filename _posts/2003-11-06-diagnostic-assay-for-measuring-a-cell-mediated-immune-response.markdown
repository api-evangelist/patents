Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a diagnostic assay and, more particularly, an assay for measuring cell-mediated immune reactivity. Even more particularly, the present invention provides an assay and a kit for measuring a cell-mediated response to an antigen using whole blood or other suitable biological sample. The assay may be conducted using ligands to immune effector molecules or at the nucleic acid level, screening for expression of genes encoding the immune effector molecules. The assay is useful in therapeutic and diagnostic protocols for human, livestock and veterinary and wild life applications.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Bibliographic details of references provided in the subject specification are listed at the end of the specification.","Reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any country.","Measurement of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses is important for immune diagnosis of many infectious and autoimmune diseases, as a marker for immunocompetence, and for detection of T-cell responses to endogenous and exogenous antigens (i.e. vaccines).","Current methods for detecting CMI responses include skin tests measuring both immediate and delayed type hypersensitivity, lymphocyte proliferation assays and measurement of cytokines produced by purified mononuclear cells cultured with antigen.","Most in vitro methods for detecting CMI responses involve the purification of lymphocytes from whole blood, culturing these lymphocytes with an antigen for periods from 12 hours to 6 days and then detecting T-cell reactivity to the antigen. Older, established methods, such as the proliferation assay, use the uptake of radioactive isotopes by dividing T-cells as a marker for CMI reactivity. More recently, techniques such as a single cell assay (ELISpot) have been used to detect the number of T-cells producing certain cytokines in response to the antigenic stimulation.","Despite the existence of the previously used assays for measuring CMI responsiveness, the practical limitations of easily and accurately measuring CMI responses have hitherto precluded large scale adoption of these assays in standard and routine medical practice in the diagnosis of infectious disease, autoimmune disease and oncology.","Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d, or variations such as \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccomprising\u201d, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers.","The present invention provides a method for measuring CMI in a subject by incubating a sample from the subject which comprises T-cells or other cells of the immune system with an antigen. Production of IFN-\u03b3 or other cytokine or immune effector molecule(s) is then detected. The presence or level of immune effector is then indicative of the level of cell mediated responsiveness of the subject.","Preferably, the sample is whole blood which is collected in a suitable container comprising the antigen. Optionally, a simple sugar such as dextrose is added to the incubation mixture.","Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention contemplates a method for measuring a CMI response in a subject, said method comprising collecting a sample from said subject wherein said sample comprises cells of the immune system which are capable of producing immune effector molecules following stimulation by an antigen, incubating said sample with an antigen and then measuring the presence of or elevation in the level of an immune effector molecule wherein the presence or level of said immune effector molecule is indicative of the capacity of said subject to mount a cell-mediated immune response.","Preferably, the subject is a human. The present invention contemplates, however, primates, livestock animals, laboratory test animals, companion animals and avian species as well as non-mammalian animals such as reptiles and amphibians. The assay has applications, therefore, in human, livestock, veterinary and wild life therapy and diagnosis.","In a preferred embodiment, the sample is whole blood which is collected in collection tubes containing the antigen or to which the antigen is added. Generally, blood is maintained in the presence of heparin. Heparin may be in the tube when blood is added or is added subsequently. The use of blood collection tubes is compatible with standard automated laboratory systems and these are amenable to analysis in large-scale and random access sampling. Blood collection tubes also minimize handling costs and reduces laboratory exposure to whole blood and plasma and, hence, reduces the risk of laboratory personnel from contracting a pathogenic agent such as human immunodeficiency virus HIV or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Furthermore, use of the collection tubes to conduct the incubation renders the assay far more sensitive than the previously used 24 well culture well plates.","The present invention provides an enhanced CMI assay, therefore, comprising use of a collection tube, optionally a simple sugar such as dextrose and the incubation step. The incubation step is preferably from 5 to 50 hours.","The immune effector molecule is preferably a cytokine such as but not limited to IFN-\u03b3. The presence or level of immune effector may be determined at the level of the molecule itself or to the extent to which a gene is expressed.","The present invention further provides kits comprising reagents and compartments required to perform the assay. Generally, the kit further comprises a set of instructions.","The assay may also be automated or semi-automated and the automated aspects may be controlled by computer software.","The present invention still further contemplates a method of treatment of a pathological condition such as infection by a microorganism, parasite or virus, an autoimmune condition or cancer. The method comprises assessing the capacity of a subject to mount a cell-mediated immune response and then selecting a therapeutic protocol such as inducing CMI against a target antigen alone or in combination with other therapy.","A list of abbreviations used herein is provided in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Abbreviations"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"ABBREVIATION","DESCRIPTION"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"CMI","cell-mediated immunity"]},{"entry":[{},"CSF","colony stimulating factor"]},{"entry":[{},"ELISA","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay"]},{"entry":[{},"ELISpot","single cell ELISA"]},{"entry":[{},"G-CSF","granulocyte-CSF"]},{"entry":[{},"GM-CSF","granulocyte, macrophage-CSF"]},{"entry":[{},"HBV","hepatitis B virus"]},{"entry":[{},"HIV","human immunodeficiency virus"]},{"entry":[{},"IFN-\u03b3","interferon-gamma"]},{"entry":[{},"PPD","Mycobacterium-tuberculosis purified"]},{"entry":[{},{},"protein derivative"]},{"entry":[{},"TNF-\u03b1","tumor necrosis factor"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The present invention provides an assay of the potential or capacity of a subject to mount a CMI response. The assay is based on measuring immune effector molecule production by cells of the immune system in response to antigenic stimulation. The immune effectors may be detected using ligands such as antibodies specific for the effectors or by measuring the level of expression of genes encoding the effectors. The present invention provides, therefore, a means to determine the responsiveness of CMI in a subject and, in turn, provides a means for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, pathological conditions, level of immunocompetence and a marker of T-cell responsiveness to endogenous or exogenous antigens.","Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention contemplates a method for measuring a CMI response in a subject, said method comprising collecting a sample from said subject wherein said sample comprises cells of the immune system which are capable of producing immune effector molecules following stimulation by an antigen, incubating said sample with an antigen and then measuring the presence of or elevation in the level of an immune effector molecule wherein the presence or level of said immune effector molecule is indicative of the capacity of said subject to mount a cell-mediated immune response.","Reference to a \u201csubject\u201d includes a human or non-human species including primates, livestock animals (e.g. sheep, cows, pigs, horses, donkey, goats), laboratory test animals (e.g. mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters), companion animals (e.g. dogs, cats), avian species (e.g. poultry birds, aviary birds), reptiles and amphibians. The present invention has applicability, therefore, in human medicine as well as having livestock and veterinary and wild life applications. Most preferably, however, the subject is a human and the CMI response assay has applications in screening for responsiveness to pathogenic microorganisms, viruses and parasites, potential for development or monitoring autoimmune conditions and for monitoring a subject's response to oncological challenge.","According to this preferred embodiment, therefore, the present invention provides a method for measuring a CMI response in a human subject, said method comprising collecting a sample from said human subject wherein said sample comprises cells of the immune system which are capable of producing immune effector molecules following stimulation by an antigen, incubating said sample with an antigen and then measuring the presence of or elevation in the level of an immune effector molecule wherein the presence or level of said immune effector molecule is indicative of the capacity of said human subject to mount a cell-mediated immune response.","Reference to \u201cimmune cells\u201d includes cells such as lymphocytes including natural killer (NK) cells, T-cells, (CD4 and\/or CD8 cells), B-cells, macrophages and monocytes, dendritic cells or any other cell which is capable of producing an effector molecule in response to direct or indirect antigen stimulation. Conveniently, the immune cells are lymphocytes and more particularly T-lymphocytes.","The immune effector molecules may be any of a range of molecules which are produced in response to cell activation or stimulation by an antigen. Although an interferon (IFN) such as IFN-\u03b3 is a particularly useful immune effector molecule, others include a range of cytokines such as interleukins (IL), e.g. IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 or IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), a colony stimulating factor (CSF) such as granulocyte (G)-CSF or granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF amongst many others such as complement or components in the complement pathway.","Accordingly, in another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for measuring a CMI response in a subject, said method comprising collecting a sample from said subject wherein said sample comprises cells of the immune system which are capable of producing IFN-\u03b3 molecules following stimulation by an antigen, incubating said sample with an antigen and then measuring the presence of or elevation in the level of an IFN-\u03b3 molecule wherein the presence or level of said IFN-\u03b3 molecule is indicative of the capacity of said subject to mount a cell-mediated immune response.","As far as the preferred embodiment extends to humans is concerned, the present invention further provides a method for measuring a CMI response in a human subject, said method comprising collecting a sample from said subject wherein said sample comprises cells of the immune system which are capable of producing IFN-\u03b3 molecules following stimulation by an antigen, incubating said sample with an antigen and then measuring the presence or elevation in level of an IFN-\u03b3 molecule wherein the presence or level of said IFN-\u03b3 molecule is indicative of the capacity of said human subject to mount a cell-mediated immune response.","The sample collected from the subject is generally deposited into a blood collection tube. A blood collection tube includes a blood draw tube or other similar vessel. Conveniently, when the sample is whole blood, the blood collection tube is heparinized. Alternatively, heparin is added to the tube after the blood is collected. Notwithstanding that whole blood is the preferred and most convenient sample, the present invention extends to other samples containing immune cells such as lymph fluid, cerebral fluid, tissue fluid and respiratory fluid including nasal and pulmonary fluid.","The use of blood collection tubes is compatible with standard automated laboratory systems and these are amenable to analysis in large-scale and random access sampling. Blood collection tubes also minimize handling costs and reduce laboratory exposure to whole blood and plasma and, hence, reduce the risk of laboratory personnel from contracting a pathogenic agent such as HIV or hepatitis B virus (HBV).","Combining the incubation step with the collection tube is particularly efficacious and enhances the sensitivity of the assay as does the optional feature of incubating the cells in the presence of a sample sugar such as dextrose.","The cells of the CMI system lose the capacity to mount a CMI response in whole blood after extended periods following blood draw from the subject, and responses without intervention are often severely reduced or absent 24 hours following blood draw. The reduction of labor and need for specialized plasticware allows CMI stimulation with antigens to be performed at the point of care locations such as physicians' offices, clinics, outpatient facilities and veterinary clinics or on farms. Once antigen stimulation is complete, the requirement for fresh and active cells no longer exists. IFN-\u03b3 and other cytokines or immune effector molecules are stable in plasma and, thus, the sample can be stored, or shipped without special conditions or rapid time requirements in a similar fashion to standard serum samples used for other infectious disease or other disease diagnosis.","The incubation step may be from 5 to 50 hours, more preferably 5 to 40 hours and even more preferably 8 to 24 hours or a time period in between.","Accordingly, another preferred embodiment of the present invention contemplates a method for measuring a CMI response in a subject including a human subject, said method comprising collecting a sample of whole blood from said subject, incubating said whole blood sample with an antigen and then measuring the presence or elevation in level of an immune effector molecule such as IFN-\u03b3 wherein the presence or level of said immune effector molecule is indicative of the capacity of said subject to mount a cell-mediated immune response.","In one preferred embodiment, the incubation step is conducted in the presence of a simple sugar such as dextrose.","The ability to measure CMI is important for assessing a subject's ability to respond to an infection by an pathogenic agent such as a microorganism or virus or parasite, to mount an autoimmune response such as in diabetes or to protect against cancers or other oncological conditions. Consequently, reference to \u201cmeasuring a CMI response in a subject\u201d includes an encompasses immune diagnosis of infectious and autoimmune diseases, a marker for immunocompetence and the detection of T-cell responses to endogenous and\/or exogenous antigens (including a measure of the efficacy of a vaccine) as well as a marker for inflammatory diseases and cancer.","Autoimmune diseases contemplated herein include inter alia Alopecia Areata, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Antiphospholipid Syndrome, Autoimmune Addison's Disease Multiple Sclerosis, Autoimmune disease of the adrenal gland, Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, Autoimmune Hepatitis, Autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis, Behcet's Disease, Bullous Pemphigoid, Cardiomyopathy, Celiac Sprue-Dermatitis, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFIDS), Chronic Inflam.

In general, however, any peptide, polypeptide or protein, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, phospholipid, phosphoprotein or phospholipoprotein or non-protein chemical agent may be used in the assay system.","As stated above, detection of the immune effector molecules may be made at the protein or nucleic acid levels. Consequently, reference to \u201cpresence or level of said immune effector molecule\u201d includes direct and indirect data. For example, high levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA is indirect data showing increased levels of IFN-\u03b3.","Ligands to the immune effectors are particularly useful in detecting and\/or quantitating these molecules. Antibodies to the immune effectors are particularly useful. Techniques for the assays contemplated herein are known in the art and include, for example, sandwich assays, ELISA and ELISpot. Reference to \u201cantibodies\u201d includes parts of antibodies, mammalianized (e.g. humanized) antibodies, recombinant or synthetic antibodies and hybrid and single chain antibodies.","Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are obtainable by immunization with the immune effectors or antigenic fragments thereof and either type is utilizable for immunoassays. The methods of obtaining both types of sera are well known in the art. Polyclonal sera are less preferred but are relatively easily prepared by injection of a suitable laboratory animal with an effective amount of the immune effector, or antigenic part thereof, collecting serum from the animal and isolating specific sera by any of the known immunoadsorbent techniques. Although antibodies produced by this method are utilizable in virtually any type of immunoassay, they are generally less favoured because of the potential heterogeneity of the product.","The use of monoclonal antibodies in an immunoassay is particularly preferred because of the ability to produce them in large quantities and the homogeneity of the product. The preparation of hybridoma cell lines for monoclonal antibody production derived by fusing an immortal cell line and lymphocytes sensitized against the immunogenic preparation can be done by techniques which are well known to those who are skilled in the art.","Another aspect of the present invention contemplates, therefore, a method for detecting an immune effector in a sample comprising immune cells from a subject, said method comprising contacting said sample or an aliquot of said sample with an antibody specific for said immune effector or antigenic fragment thereof for a time and under conditions sufficient for an antibody-effector complex to form, and then detecting said complex.","A sample includes whole blood. This method includes micro-arrays and macro-arrays on planar or spherical solid supports. A micro- or macro-array is useful.","A wide range of immunoassay techniques are available as can be seen by reference to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,016,043, 4,424,279 and 4,018,653.","The following is a description of one type of assay. An unlabeled antibody is immobilized on a solid substrate and the sample to be tested for the immune effectors (e.g. antigens) brought into contact with the bound molecule. After a suitable period of incubation, for a period of time sufficient to allow formation of an antibody-antigen complex, a second antibody specific to the antigen, labeled with a reporter molecule capable of producing a detectable signal, is then added and incubated, allowing time sufficient for the formation of another complex of antibody-antigen-labeled antibody. Any unreacted material is washed away, and the presence of the antigen is determined by observation of a signal produced by the reporter molecule. The results may either be qualitative, by simple observation of the visible signal, or may be quantitated by comparing with a control sample containing known amounts of antigen. This generalized technique is well known to those skilled in the art as would be any of a number of variations.","In these assays, a first antibody having specificity for the instant immune effectors is either covalently or passively bound to a solid surface. The solid surface is typically glass or a polymer, the most commonly used polymers being cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. The solid supports may be in the form of tubes, beads, spheres, discs of microplates, or any other surface suitable for conducting an immunoassay. The binding processes are well known in the art and generally consist of cross-linking covalently binding or physically adsorbing, the polymer-antibody complex is washed in preparation for the test sample. An aliquot of the sample to be tested is then added to the solid phase complex and incubated for a period of time sufficient (e.g. 2-120 minutes or where more convenient, overnight) and under suitable conditions (e.g. for about 20\u00b0 C. to about 40\u00b0 C.) to allow binding of any subunit present in the antibody. Following the incubation period, the antibody subunit solid phase is washed and dried and incubated with a second antibody specific for a portion of the antigen. The second antibody is linked to a reporter molecule which is used to indicate the binding of the second antibody to the hapten.","There are many variations to this assay. One particularly useful variation is a simultaneous assay where all or many of the components are admixed substantially simultaneously.","By \u201creporter molecule\u201d as used in the present specification, is meant a molecule which, by its chemical nature, provides an analytically identifiable signal which allows the detection of antigen-bound antibody. Detection may be either qualitative or quantitative. The most commonly used reporter molecules in this type of assay are either enzymes, fluorophores or radionuclide containing molecules (i.e. radioisotopes) and chemiluminescent molecules. Examples of suitable fluorophores are provided in Table 2. In the case of an enzyme immunoassay, an enzyme is conjugated to the second antibody, generally by means of glutaraldehyde or periodate. As will be readily recognized, however, a wide variety of different conjugation techniques exist, which are readily available to the skilled artisan. Commonly used enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, amongst others. The substrates to be used with the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production, upon hydrolysis by the corresponding enzyme, of a detectable colour change. Examples of suitable enzymes include alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic substrates, which yield a fluorescent product rather than the chromogenic substrates noted above. In all cases, the enzyme-labeled antibody is added to the first antibody-antigen complex, allowed to bind, and then the excess reagent is washed away. A solution containing the appropriate substrate is then added to the complex of antibody-antigen-antibody. The substrate will react with the enzyme linked to the second antibody, giving a qualitative visual signal, which may be further quantitated, usually spectrophotometrically, to give an indication of the amount of antigen which was present in the sample. Again, the present invention extends to a substantially simultaneous assay.","Alternately, fluorescent compounds, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, may be chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated by illumination with light of a particular wavelength, the fluorochrome-labeled antibody adsorbs the light energy, inducing a state to excitability in the molecule, followed by emission of the light at a characteristic colour visually detectable with a light microscope. The fluorescent labeled antibody is allowed to bind to the first antibody-antigen complex. After washing off the unbound reagent, the remaining tertiary complex is then exposed to the light of the appropriate wavelength the fluorescence observed indicates the presence of the antigen of interest. Immunofluorescene and EIA techniques are both very well established in the art and are particularly preferred for the present method. However, other reporter molecules, such as radioisotope, chemiluminescent or bioluminescent molecules, may also be employed.","There are a range of other detection systems which may be employed including colloidal gold and all such detection systems are encompassed by the present invention.","The present invention also contemplates genetic assays such as involving PCR analysis to detect RNA expression products of a genetic sequence encoding an immune effector.","In one embodiment, PCR is conducted using pairs of primers, one or both of which are generally labeled with the same or a different reporter molecule capable of giving a distinguishable signal. The use of fluorophores is particularly useful in the practice of the present invention. Examples of suitable fluorophores may be selected from the list given in Table 2. Other labels include luminescence and phosphorescence as well as infrared dyes.

Such scattering can be used to quantitate the level of mRNA or level of protein.","Flow cytometry is particularly useful in analyzing fluorophore emission.","As is known in the art, flow cytometry is a high throughput technique which involves rapidly analyzing the physical and chemical characteristics of particles (e.g. labeled mRNA, DNA or proteins) as they pass through the path of one or more laser beams while suspended in a fluid stream. As each particle intercepts the laser beam, the scattered light and fluorescent light emitted by each cell or particle is detected and recorded using any suitable tracking algorithm as, for example, described hereunder.","A modern flow cytometer is able to perform these tasks up to 100,000 cells\/particles s. Through the use of an optical array of filters and dichroic mirrors, different wavelengths of fluorescent light can be separated and simultaneously detected. In addition, a number of lasers with different excitation wavelengths may be used. Hence, a variety of fluorophores can be used to target and examine, for example, different immune effectors within a sample or immune effectors from multiple subjects.","Suitable flow cytometers which may be used in the methods of the present invention include those which measure five to nine optical parameters (see Table 3) using a single excitation laser, commonly an argon ion air-cooled laser operating at 15 mW on its 488 nm spectral line. More advanced flow cytometers are capable of using multiple excitation lasers such as a HeNe laser (633 nm) or a HeCd laser (325 nm) in addition to the argon ion laser (488 or 514 nm).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Exemplary optical parameters which may be measured"},{"entry":"by a flow cytometer."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Detection angle",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"form incident","Wavelength"]},{"entry":["Parameter","Acronym","laser beam","(nm)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Forward scattered light","FS","2-5\u00b0","\u2009\u2009488*"]},{"entry":["Side scattered light","SS","\u200290\u00b0","\u2009\u2009488*"]},{"entry":["\u201cGreen\u201d fluorescence","FL1","\u200290\u00b0","510-540"]},{"entry":["\u201cYellow\u201d fluorescence","FL2","\u200290\u00b0","560-580"]},{"entry":["\u201cRed\u201d fluorescence","FL3","\u200290\u00b0",">650"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*using a 488 nm excitation laser"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"\u2020"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00005"},"sup":"#"}}]}}]}}},"For example, Biggs et al., 36: 36-45, 1999 have constructed an 11-parameter flow cytometer using three excitation lasers and have demonstrated the use of nine distinguishable fluorophores in addition to forward and side scatter measurements for purposes of immunophenotyping (i.e. classifying) particles. The maximum number of parameters commercially available currently is 17: forward scatter, side scatter and three excitation lasers each with five fluorescence detectors. Whether all of the parameters can be adequately used depends heavily on the extinction coefficients, quantum yields and amount of spectral overlap between all fluorophores (Malemed et al., \u201c2Ed., New York, Wiley-Liss, 1990). However, it will be understood that the present invention is not restricted to any particular flow cytometer or any particular set of parameters.
