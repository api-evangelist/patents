P30 DK72517, R01 HL73856, R37 DK35124, and DK086125 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field","Therapeutics are needed for treating diseases and disorders related to aberrant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR)-mediated ion transport, such as polycystic kidney disease, increased intestinal fluid secretion, and secretory diarrhea. Small molecule compounds are described herein that are potent inhibitors of CFTR activity and that may be used for treating such diseases and disorders.","2. Description of the Related Art","The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated chloride (Cl) channel expressed in epithelial cells in mammalian airways, intestine, pancreas, and testis (see, e.g., Sheppard et al., 79:S23-45 (1999); Gadsby et al., 40:477-83 (2006)). Hormones, such as a \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, or a toxin, such as cholera toxin, lead to an increase in cAMP, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and phosphorylation of the CFTR Cl channel, which causes the channel to open. An increase in cell Ca can also activate different apical membrane channels. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C can either open or shut Cl channels in the apical membrane. CFTR is predominantly located in epithelia where it provides a pathway for the movement of Cl ions across the apical membrane and a key point at which to regulate the rate of transepithelial salt and water transport.","CFTR chloride channel function is associated with a wide spectrum of disease, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and with some forms of male infertility, polycystic kidney disease, and secretory diarrhea. Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary lethal disease caused by mutations in CFTR (see, e.g., Quinton, 79:S3-S22 (1999); Boucher, 23:146-58 (2004)). Observations in human patients with CF and mouse models of CF indicate the functional importance of CFTR in intestinal and pancreatic fluid transport, as well as in male fertility (Grubb et al., 79:S193-S214 (1999); Wong, P. Y., 4:107-110 (1997)). CFTR is also expressed in enterocytes in the intestine and in cyst epithelium in polycystic kidney disease (see, e.g., O'Sullivan et al., 32:976-983 (1998); Sullivan et al., 78:1165-91 (1998); Strong et al., 93:347-54 (1994); Mall et al., 126:32-41 (2004); Hanaoka et al., 270:C389-C399 (1996); Kunzelmann et al., 82:245-289 (2002); Davidow et al., 50:208-18 (1996); Li et al., 66:1926-38 (2004); Al-Awqati, 110:1599-1601 (2002); Thiagarajah et al., 3:594-99 (2003)).","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by massive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts of renal tubular origin that compromise normal renal parenchyma and cause renal failure (Arnaout, 52: 93-123, 2001; Gabow 329: 332-342, 1993; Harris et al., 81: 75-85, 2004; Wilson 350: 151-164, 2004; Sweeney et al., 326: 671-685, 2006; Chapman 18: 1399-1407, 2007). Human autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in one of two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding the interacting proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively (Wilson, supra; Qian et al., 87: 979-987, 1996; Wu et al., 93: 177-188, 1998; Watnick et al., Torres et al., 10: 363-364, 2004 25: 143-144, 2000). Cyst growth in PKD involves fluid secretion into the cyst lumen coupled with epithelial cell hyperplasia.","Several CFTR inhibitors have been discovered, although many exhibit weak potency and lack CFTR specificity. The oral hypoglycemic agent glibenclamide inhibits CFTR Cl conductance from the intracellular side by an open channel blocking mechanism (Sheppard et al., 503:333-346 (1997); Zhou et al., 120:647-62 (2002)) at high micromolar concentrations where it affects other Cl and cation channels (Edwards & Weston, 1993; Rabe et al., 110:1280-81 (1995); Schultz et al., 79:S109-S144 (1999)). Other non-selective anion transport inhibitors, including diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropyl-amino)benzoate (NPPB), and flufenamic acid, also inhibit CFTR by occluding the pore at an intracellular site (Dawson et al., 79:S47-S75 (1999); McCarty, 203:1947-62 (2000)).","High-affinity CFTR inhibitors also have clinical application in the therapy of secretory diarrheas. Cell culture and animal models indicated that intestinal chloride secretion in enterotoxin-mediated secretory diarrheas occurs mainly through CFTR (see, e.g., Clarke et al., 257:1125-28 (1992); Gabriel et al., 266:107-109 (1994); Kunzelmann and Mall, 82:245-89 (2002); Field, M. 111:931-43 (2003); and Thiagarajah et al., 126:511-519 (2003)).","Diarrheal disease in children is a global health concern: Approximately four billion cases among children occur annually, resulting in at least two million deaths. Travelers' diarrhea affects approximately 6 million people per year. Antibiotics are routinely used to treat diarrhea; however, the antibiotics are ineffective for treating many pathogens, and the use of these drugs contributes to development of antibiotic resistance in other pathogens. Oral replacement of fluid loss is also routinely used to treat diarrhea, but is primarily palliative. Therapy directed at reducing intestinal fluid secretion (anti-secretory therapy') has the potential to overcome limitations of existing therapies.","A need exists for CFTR inhibitors, particularly those that are safe, non-absorbable, highly potent, inexpensive, and chemically stable.","Briefly, provided herein are pyrimido-pyrrolo-quinoxalinedione (PPQ) compounds, and compositions comprising such compounds, that inhibit cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mediated ion transport and that are useful for treating diseases and disorders associated with aberrantly increased CFTR chloride channel activity.

Methods are provided for inhibiting enlargement of kidney cysts or preventing or inhibiting the formation of cysts and thereby treating polycystic kidney disease. Methods of treating diseases and disorders associated with aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, such as secretory diarrhea and Traveler's diarrhea, are also provided.","Thus, provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a physiologically acceptable excipient and a compound having the following structure (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"46.82mm","wi":"59.61mm","file":"US08609661-20131217-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["1 ","2 "],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein the compound is capable of inhibiting cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated ion transport."}},"Further provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a physiologically acceptable excipient and a compound having the following substructure (IA):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"50.04mm","wi":"69.51mm","file":"US08609661-20131217-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["R, R, and Rare each the same or different and independently hydrogen, alkyl, halo, or alkoxy;","Rand Rare each the same or different and independently hydrogen, alkyl, halo, or alkoxy;","Ris hydrogen or alkyl, and","X is \u2014O\u2014, or \u2014S\u2014,","wherein the compound is capable of inhibiting cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated ion transport."]}},"Also provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a physiologically acceptable excipient and a compound having the following substructure (IB):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0025"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"50.04mm","wi":"70.02mm","file":"US08609661-20131217-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["R, R, and Rare each the same or different and independently hydrogen, alkyl, halo, or alkoxy;","Rand Rare each the same or different and independently hydrogen, alkyl, halo, or alkoxy; and","R, R, R, and Rare each the same or different and independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, halo, alkoxy, nitro, or hydroxy,","wherein the compound is capable of inhibiting cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated ion transport."]}},"Further provided herein is a method for inhibiting cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated ion transport, said method comprising contacting (a) a cell that comprises CFTR and (b) the composition comprising a physiologically acceptable excipient and a compound of any one of structure (I), substructures (IA) and (IB), and specific structures described above and herein, under conditions and for a time sufficient that permit the CFTR and the compound to interact, thereby inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport.","Further provided herein is a method for inhibiting cyst formation or inhibiting cyst enlargement, said method comprising contacting (a) a cell that comprises CFTR and (b) the composition comprising a physiologically acceptable excipient and a compound of any one of structure (I), substructures (IA) and (IB), and specific structures described above and herein, under conditions and for a time sufficient that permit CFTR and the compound to interact, wherein the compound inhibits CFTR-mediated ion transport.","Further provided herein is a method for treating polycystic kidney disease comprising administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a physiologically acceptable excipient and a compound of any one of structure (I), substructures (IA) and (IB), and specific structures described above and herein.

Thus, for example, reference to \u201can agent\u201d includes a plurality of such agents, and reference to \u201ca cell\u201d or \u201cthe cell\u201d includes reference to one or more cells and equivalents thereof (e.g., plurality of cells) known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. Similarly, reference to \u201ca compound\u201d or \u201ca composition\u201d includes a plurality of such compounds or compositions, and refers to one or more compounds or compositions, respectively, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term \u201cabout\u201d when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or numerical range may vary between 1% and 15% of the stated number or numerical range.

The PPQ compounds described herein are capable of inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport (e.g., CFTR-mediated Cl transport) (i.e., inhibiting CFTR conductance). The compounds and compositions comprising the PPQ compounds are therefore useful for administering to a subject who has or who is at risk of developing a disease, disorder, or condition that is treatable (i.e., administration of the compounds and compositions will provide a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit) by inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport.","The PPQ compounds described herein are highly potent CFTR inhibitors that are uncharged and thereby membrane-potential insensitive. CFTR inhibitors are predicted to slow renal cyst expansion in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), where fluid accumulation in renal cysts is CFTR-dependent (see, e.g., Hanaoka et al., 2000, 11:1179-1187; Brill et al., 1996, 93:10206-10211; Torres et al., 2006, 2:40-55; O'Sullivan et al., 1998, 32:976-983; Xu et al., 2006, 19:529-534; Cotton et al., 1998, 32:1081-1083; Davidow et al., 1996, 50:208-218; Li et al., 2004, 66:1926-1938) and to reduce intestinal fluid loss in secretory diarrheas (see, e.g., Thiagarajah et al., 2004, 126:511-519; Sonawane et al., 2007, 132:1234-1244; Kunzelmann et al., 2002, 82:245-289).","Previously identified CFTR inhibitors include glibenclamide, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropyl-amino)benzoate (NPPB) (see ); however, these inhibitors are non-selective in their action and have low potency. One study reported strong CFTR inhibition by \u03b1-aminoazaheterocyclic-methylglyoxal adducts (see, e.g., Routaboul et al., 2007, 322:1023-1035), though CFTR inhibition was not subsequently confirmed (see, e.g., Sonawane et al., 2008, 325:529-535). Two classes of improved CFTR inhibitors have been previously identified by high-throughput screening (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,235,573; 7,414,037; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0064666; Namkung et al., 2009, 284:15916-926; Sonawane et al., 2006, 20:130-132; Sonawane et al., 2008, 16:8187-95; Verkman et al., 2009, 8:153-171). The thiazolidinone CFTR-172 compound (see ) acts from the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane to block CFTR chloride conductance with IC\u02dc0.3-3 \u03bcM depending on cell type and membrane potential (see, e.g., Ma et al., 2002, 110:1651-1658). Patch-clamp analysis indicated a voltage-independent channel block mechanism in which CFTR-172 stabilizes the channel closed state (see, e.g., Taddei et al., 2004, 558:52-56); CFTR mutagenesis suggested CFTR-172 interaction at arginine-347 located near the cytoplasmic entrance of the CFTR pore (see, e.g., Caci et al., 2008, 413:135-142). CFTR-172 has low toxicity, undergoes renal excretion with minimal metabolism, and accumulates in the intestine by enterohepatic recirculation (Sonawane et al., 2005, 94:134-143). A second compound class, the glycine hydrazides (e.g., GlyH-101, see ), inhibit CFTR with IC\u02dc5 \u03bcM (see, e.g., Muanprasat et al., 2004, 124:125-137; U.S. Pat. No. 7,414,037). Patch-clamp analysis showed inward rectifying chloride current following GlyH-101 application with rapid channel flicking, indicating an external pore occlusion mechanism.","The PPQ compounds described herein provide certain advantages compared to thiazolidinone compounds and glycine hydrazide compounds. Inhibition of CFTR activity by the PPQ compounds described herein is voltage-independent and thus advantageous to maintain CFTR inhibition potency in interior membrane negative potential cells. Accordingly, the PPQ CFTR inhibitors may not be subject to membrane potential-dependent cellular partitioning or a decrease in potency (such as indicated by an increase in IC). The most potent PPQ compounds inhibited CFTR chloride conductance with IC\u02dc90 nM. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the PPQ compounds described herein stabilize the CFTR channel closed state, which in combination with the neutral charge of the compounds and relatively slow time course of inhibition, suggests that the compounds act at a site on the cytoplasmic-facing surface of CFTR distinct from its pore. An exemplary PPQ compound prevented cyst expansion and reduced the size of pre-formed cysts in a neonatal kidney organ culture model of polycystic kidney disease. The PPQ compounds are therefore useful for administering to patients who have polycystic kidney disease.","Pyrimido-Pyrrolo-Quinoxalinedione (PPQ) Compounds","The PPQ compounds described herein share a fused tetracyclic core structure, more specifically, a pyrimido[4\u2032,5\u2032-3,4]pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline ring system.

In one embodiment, a use is provided for the preparation of a medicament for treating any one of the diseases, conditions or disorders described herein (e.g., polycystic kidney disease, aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, secretory diarrhea) that is treatable by inhibiting ion transport (e.g., chloride ion transport) by CFTR.","In other embodiments, methods are provided for treating a disease, disorder, or condition described herein (including but not limited to PCKD, secretory diarrhea or other condition associated with aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion). Such methods comprise administering a pharmaceutical composition that comprises at least one PPQ compound and a pharmaceutically suitable (i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable, or physiologically suitable or acceptable) excipient in combination, either in the same composition or in a separate (or second) composition, at least one thiazolidinone compound and\/or at least one glycine hydrazide compound that inhibit CFTR-mediated ion transport (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,235,573; 7,414,037; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0064666; International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2008\/079897; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,147; International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2009\/038292, which are hereby incorporated by references in their entireties) for treating any one of the diseases or disorders described herein that is treatable by inhibiting ion transport (e.g., chloride ion transport) by CFTR. When a first composition comprising at least one PPQ compound and a second composition comprising at least one thiazolidinone compound and\/or at least one glycine hydrazide compound is administered to a subject in need thereof, the first composition may be administered prior to, concurrently with, or subsequent to administration of the second composition.","In particular embodiments of the methods described herein, the subject is a human or non-human animal. A subject in need of the treatments described herein may exhibit symptoms or sequelae of a disease, disorder, or condition described herein or may be at risk of developing the disease, disorder, or condition. Non-human animals that may be treated include mammals, for example, non-human primates (e.g., monkey, chimpanzee, gorilla, and the like), rodents (e.g., rats, mice, gerbils, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits), lagomorphs, swine (e.g., pig, miniature pig), equine, canine, feline, bovine, and other domestic, farm, and zoo animals.","In another embodiment, a method is provided for inhibiting ion transport by a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) comprising contacting (a) a cell that comprises CFTR and (b) at least one of the compounds of structure I, substructures (IA), (IB) and specific structures described herein, under conditions and for a time sufficient that permit CFTR and the compound to interact, thereby inhibiting ion transport (e.g., chloride ion transport) by CFTR, that is, inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport.","In another embodiment, a method is provided for treating secretory diarrhea comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and at least one of the compounds of structure I, substructures (IA), (IB), and specific structures described herein (i.e., a pharmaceutical composition as described herein). In a particular embodiment, the subject is a human or non-human animal.","The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using the PPQ compounds and compositions comprising these compounds are described in greater detail herein.","Methods for Characterizing and Using the PPQ Compounds","Also provided herein are methods that are useful, for example, for characterizing the potency of PPQ compounds (and derivatives and analogs thereof) to inhibit CFTR-mediated ion transport (particularly CFTR-mediated chloride ion transport); for monitoring the level (i.e., for example, concentration level, mass level, or IClevel) of a PPQ compound that has been administered to a subject; and examining disease pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis by blocking or inhibiting CFTR function as models for cystic fibrosis disease, such as in ex vivo tissues (e.g., human tissues) and in animals.","In certain embodiments, these methods may be performed in vitro, such as with using a biological sample as described herein that comprises, for example, cells obtained from a tissue, body fluid, or culture-adapted cell line, or other biological source as described in detail herein below. The step of contacting refers to combining, mixing, or in some manner familiar to persons skilled in the art, which permits the compound and the cell to interact such that any effect of the compound on CFTR activity (e.g., the capability of a PPQ compound to inhibit CFTR ion transport or the level to which the compound inhibits CFTR ion transport) can be measured according to methods described herein and routinely practiced in the art. Methods described herein for inhibiting ion transport by CFTR are understood to be performed under conditions and for a time sufficient that permit the CFTR and the compound to interact. Additional PPQ compounds may be identified and\/or characterized by such a method of inhibiting ion transport by CFTR, performed with isolated cells in vitro. Conditions for a particular assay include temperature, buffers (including salts, cations, media), and other components that maintain the integrity of the cell and the compound, which a person skilled in the art will be familiar and\/or which can be readily determined. A person skilled in the art also readily appreciates that appropriate controls can be designed and included when performing the in vitro methods and in vivo methods described herein.","In secretory epithelia, fluid secretion occurs by primary chloride exit across the cell apical membrane, which secondarily drives transepithelial sodium and water secretion (see, e.g., Barrett et al., 62:535-72 (2000)). In renal cells, lumenal fluid accumulation causes progressive cyst expansion directly by net water influx into the cyst lumen, and indirectly by stretching cyst wall epithelial cells to promote their division and thinning (Ye et al., 329:310-13 (1993); Sullivan et al., 78:1165-91 (1998); Tanner et al., 6:1230-41 (1995)). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, CFTR inhibition interferes with fluid secretion at the apical chloride exit step.","Methods for characterizing a PPQ compound, for determining an effective concentration to achieve a therapeutic benefit, for monitoring the level of a PPQ compound in a biological sample, and for other purposes as described herein and apparent to a person skilled in the art, may be performed using techniques and procedures described herein and routinely practiced by a person skilled in the art. Exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, fluorescence cell-based assays of CFTR inhibition (see, e.g., Galietta et al., 281:C1734-C1742 (2001)), short circuit apical chloride ion current measurements and patch-clamp analysis (see, e.g., Muanprasat et al., 124:125-37 (2004); Ma et al., 110:1651-58 (2002); see also, e.g., Carmeliet, 55:5-26 (1993); Hamill et al., 391:85-100 (1981)).","Methods that may be used to characterize a PPQ compound, including those described herein, and to determine effectiveness of the compound for reducing, inhibiting, or preventing cyst enlargement and\/or preventing or inhibiting cyst formation, and which compound is therefore useful for treating a subject who has or who is at risk of developing PKD, include methods described in the art and herein. The PPQ compounds may be analyzed in models using embryonic or neonatal kidney organ cultures, for example (see, e.g., Yang et al., 19:1300-1310 (2008); Magenheimer et al., 17:3424-37 (2006)). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, certain scientific observations support use of CFTR inhibitors to slow cyst growth in autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD): (a) CFTR is expressed strongly in epithelial cells lining cysts in ADPKD; (b) cystic fibrosis (CFTR-deficient) mice are resistant to cyst formation; (c) CFTR inhibitors block cyst formation in cell\/organ culture and in vivo models; and (d) in some families affected with ADPKD and cystic fibrosis, individuals with both ADPKD and CF have less severe renal disease than those with ADPKD only (see, e.g., O'Sullivan et al., 1998, 32:976-983; Cotton et al., 1998, 32:1081-1083). Intact kidney models to study cystogenesis are useful for recapitulating native kidney anatomy and cellular phenotype (see, e.g., Magenheimer et al., 2006, 17:3424-3437).","An additional example of a cell culture model for determining whether a compound inhibits cyst formation or enlargement includes an MDCK cell (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cell) model of PKD (Li et al., 66:1926-1938 (2004); see also, e.g., Neufeld et al., 41:1222-36 (1992); Mangoo-Karim et al., 86:6007-6011 (1989); Mangoo-Karim et al., 3:2629-32 (1989); Grantham et al., 102:158-62 (1989); Mohamed et al., 322: 259-265 (1997)). See also, e.g., Murcia et al., 55:1187-97 (1999); Igarishi et al., 13:2384-88 (2002)). Accordingly, provided herein are methods for identifying and\/or characterizing PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) by determining the capability of the compound to inhibit cyst enlargement or prevent or inhibit cyst formation in an in vitro cell culture model.","The MDCK cell line may also be used in methods and techniques for determining that a compound lacks cytotoxicity, for example, by evaluating cell viability (e.g., by any one of numerous cell staining methods and microscopy methods routinely practiced in the art), cell proliferation (e.g., by determining the level of incorporation of nucleotide analogs and other methods for measuring division of cells), and\/or apoptosis by using any one of a number of techniques and methods known in the art and described herein. Other methods for determining or quantifying the capability of a compound described herein to inhibit or reverse cyst enlargement or expansion and\/or to inhibit or prevent cyst formation and\/or to reduce the number of cysts formed include an embryonic kidney organ culture model, which is practiced in the art and described herein (see, e.g., Magenheimer et al., 17: 3424-37 (2006); Steenhard et al., 16:1623-1631 (2005); Yang et al., 19:1300-1310 (2008)). In such an embryonic kidney culture model, organotypic growth and differentiation of renal tissue can be monitored in defined media in the absence of any effect or influence by circulating hormones and glomerular filtration (Magenheimer et al., supra; Gupta et al., 63:365-376 (2003)). In metanephric organ culture, the early mouse kidney tubule has an intrinsic capacity to secrete fluid by a CFTR-dependent mechanism in response to cAMP (Magenheimer et al., supra).","Persons skilled in the art may also use animal models to characterize a PPQ compound, including those described herein, and to determine effectiveness of the compound for reducing, inhibiting, reversing, or preventing cyst enlargement and\/or preventing or inhibiting cyst formation thereby reducing the number of cysts formed, and to determine the usefulness of such compounds for treating a subject who has or who is at risk of developing PKD. By way of example, Pkd1mice and Ksp-Cre transgenic mice in a C57BL\/6 background may be generated as described and practiced in the art (see, e.g., Shibazaki et al., 13:10-11 (2004) (abstract); Shao et al., 13:1837-46 (2002)). Ksp-Cre mice express Cre recombinase under the control of the Ksp-cadherin promoter (see, e.g., Shao et al., supra). Pkd1; Ksp-Cre mice may be generated by cross-breeding Pkd1mice with Pkd1:Ksp-Cre mice. The effect of a test compound may be determined by quantifying cyst size and growth in metanephroi and kidney sections, histological analyses of tissues and cells, and delay or prevention of renal failure and death (see, e.g., Shibazaki et al., supra).","The PPQ compounds may also be analyzed in animal models that are art-accepted animal models for increased intestinal fluid secretion. By way of example, a closed intestinal loop model of cholera, suckling mouse model of cholera, and in vivo imaging of gastrointestinal transit may be used for characterizing the PPQ compounds described herein (see, e.g., Takeda et al., 19:752-54 (1978); see also, e.g., Spira et al., 32:739-747 (1981)).","Methods of inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport include in vitro methods that comprise contacting a cell with any one or more of the PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) as described herein, under conditions and for a time sufficient for CFTR present in the outer membrane of the cell and the compound to interact. Cells (or cell lines) that may be used in such methods are cells that expresses CFTR and have channels or pores formed by CFTR in the cell membrane. Exemplary cells and cell lines include without limitation a Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cell (including a FRT cell that co-expresses human or other animal wildtype CFTR and the halide indicator YFP-H148Q or other comparable yellow fluorescent protein); a cultured human bronchial epithelial cell; and a gastrointestinal cell (such as T84 human intestinal epithelial cells)) that comprises CFTR in the outer membrane of the cell. Such methods are useful for identifying analogs of the PPQ compounds (i.e., species of structure I including species of substructures (IA) and (IB)) described herein and for characterizing the PPQ compounds described herein.","In certain embodiments, the cell is contacted in an in vitro assay, and the cell may be obtained from a subject or from a biological sample. A biological sample may be a blood sample (from which serum or plasma may be prepared and cells isolated), biopsy specimen, body fluids (e.g., lung lavage, ascites, mucosal washings, synovial fluid), bone marrow, lymph nodes, tissue explant (e.g., kidney cells), organ culture (e.g., kidney), or any other tissue or cell preparation from a subject or a biological source. A sample may further refer to a tissue or cell preparation in which the morphological integrity or physical state has been disrupted, for example, by dissection, dissociation, solubilization, fractionation, homogenization, biochemical or chemical extraction, pulverization, lyophilization, sonication, or any other means for processing a sample derived from a subject or biological source. The subject or biological source may be a human or non-human animal, a primary cell culture (e.g., immune cells, virus infected cells), or culture adapted cell line, including but not limited to, genetically engineered cell lines that may contain chromosomally integrated or episomal recombinant nucleic acid sequences, immortalized or immortalizable cell lines, somatic cell hybrid cell lines, differentiated or differentiatable cell lines, transformed cell lines, and the like.","Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Using Pharmaceutical Compositions","Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising any one or more of the PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof). The compounds described herein may be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition for use in treatment or preventive (or prophylactic) treatment (e.g., reducing the likelihood of occurrence of cyst formation), of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which includes autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD). In other embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one PPQ compound may be formulated for use in treatment or preventive treatment (i.e., for reducing the likelihood of occurrence) of a disease, condition, or disorder manifested by increased intestinal fluid secretion, such as secretory diarrhea.","In pharmaceutical dosage forms, any one or more of the PPQ compounds of structure I, substructures (IA), (IB) and specific structures described herein may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative, such as a salt, or they may also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The methods and excipients described herein are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.","Optimal doses may generally be determined using experimental models and\/or clinical trials. The optimal dose may depend upon the body mass, weight, or blood volume of the subject. In general, the amount of a PPQ compound of structure I (and substructures thereof) described herein, that is present in a dose, ranges from about 0.01 \u03bcg to about 1000 \u03bcg per kg weight of the host. The use of the minimum dose that is sufficient to provide effective therapy is usually preferred. Subjects may generally be monitored for therapeutic effectiveness using assays suitable for the condition being treated or prevented, which assays will be familiar to those having ordinary skill in the art and are described herein. The level of a compound that is administered to a subject may be monitored by determining the level of the compound in a biological fluid, for example, in the blood, blood fraction (e.g., serum), and\/or in the urine, and\/or other biological sample from the subject. Any method practiced in the art to detect the compound may be used to measure the level of compound during the course of a therapeutic regimen.","The dose of a composition comprising at least one of the PPQ compounds described herein for treating PCKD may depend upon the subject's condition, that is, stage of the disease, renal function, severity of symptoms caused by enlarged cysts, general health status, as well as age, gender, and weight, and other factors apparent to a person skilled in the medical art. Similarly, the dose of the PPQ compound for treating a disease or disorder associated with aberrantly increased CFTR function, including but not limited to intestinal fluid secretion, secretory diarrhea, such as a toxin-induced diarrhea, or secretory diarrhea associated with or a sequelae of an enteropathogenic infection, Traveler's diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), AIDS, chemotherapy and other diseases or conditions described herein may be determined according to parameters understood by a person skilled in the medical art. Accordingly, the appropriate dose may depend upon the subject's condition, that is, stage of the disease, general health status, as well as age, gender, and weight, and other factors considered by a person skilled in the medical art.","Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a manner appropriate to the disease or disorder to be treated as determined by persons skilled in the medical arts. An appropriate dose and a suitable duration and frequency of administration will be determined by such factors as the condition of the patient, the type and severity of the patient's disease, the particular form of the active ingredient, and the method of administration. In general, an appropriate dose (or effective dose) and treatment regimen provides the composition(s) comprising at least one PPQ compound in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit (for example, an improved clinical outcome, such as more frequent complete or partial remissions, or longer disease-free and\/or overall survival, or a lessening of symptom severity or other benefit as described in detail above). When a subject is treated for aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, clinical assessment of the level of dehydration and\/or electrolyte imbalance may be performed to determine the level of effectiveness of a compound and whether dose or other administration parameters (such as frequency of administration or route of administration) should be adjusted.","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (or PCKD) and polycystic renal disease are used interchangeably, and refer to a group of disorders characterized by a large number of cysts distributed throughout enlarged kidneys. The resultant cyst development leads to impairment of kidney function and can eventually cause kidney failure. PDK includes autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and recessive autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), in all stages of development, regardless of the underlying etiology or cause. Effectiveness of a treatment for PKD may be monitored by one or more of several methods practiced in the medical art including, for example, by monitoring renal function by standard measurements, and by radiologic investigations that are performed with ultrasounds, computerized tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging, which are useful for evaluating renal cyst morphology and volume and estimating the amount of residual renal parenchyma.","To evaluate and to monitor the effectiveness of any one of the PPQ compounds described herein to treat PKD or a related disease or condition, one or more of several clinical assay methods may be performed that are familiar to a person skilled in the clinical art. For example, a clinical method called a urea clearance test may be performed. A blood sample is obtained from a subject to whom the compound is being administered so that the amount of urea in the bloodstream can be determined. In addition, a first urine sample is collected from the subject and at least one hour later, a second urine sample is collected. The amount of urea quantified in the urine indicates the amount of urea that is filtered, or cleared by the kidneys into the urine. Another clinical assay method measures urine osmolality (i.e., the amount of dissolved solute particles in the urine). Inability of the kidneys to concentrate the urine in response to restricted fluid intake, or to dilute the urine in response to increased fluid intake during osmolality testing may indicate decreased kidney function.","Urea is a by-product of protein metabolism and is formed in the liver. Urea is then filtered from the blood and excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The BUN (blood urea nitrogen) test measures the amount of nitrogen contained in the urea. High BUN levels may indicate kidney dysfunction, but because blood urea nitrogen is also affected by protein intake and liver function, the test is usually performed in conjunction with determination of blood creatinine, which is considered a more specific indicator of kidney function. Low clearance values for creatinine and urea indicate diminished ability of the kidneys to filter these waste products from the blood and excrete them in the urine. As clearance levels decrease, blood levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen increase. An abnormally elevated blood creatinine, a more specific and sensitive indicator of kidney disease than the BUN, is diagnostic of impaired kidney function.","The pharmaceutical compositions described herein that comprise at least one PPQ compound may be administered to a subject in need by any one of several routes that effectively deliver an effective amount of the compound. Such administrative routes include, for example, oral, parenteral, enteral, rectal, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, intramuscular, and transdermal. By way of example, at least one or more of the compounds may be administered to a mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., by an enteral route, which includes administration directly to the tract via a tube inserted into the nose, stomach, or small intestine) or to a mucosal surface of the oral or nasal cavities, or (e.g., intranasal, buccal, sublingual, and the like). These administrative methods and additional methods are discussed in greater detail herein.","A pharmaceutical composition may be a sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion, which additionally comprises a physiologically acceptable excipient (pharmaceutically acceptable or suitable excipient or carrier) (i.e., a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the activity of the active ingredient). Such compositions may be in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas (aerosol). Alternatively, compositions described herein may be formulated as a lyophilizate, or compounds may be encapsulated within liposomes using technology known in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other components, which may be biologically active or inactive. Such components include, but are not limited to, buffers (e.g., neutral buffered saline or phosphate buffered saline), carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans), mannitol, proteins, polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine, antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione, stabilizers, dyes, flavoring agents, and suspending agents and\/or preservatives.","Any suitable excipient or carrier known to those of ordinary skill in the art for use in pharmaceutical compositions may be employed in the compositions described herein. Excipients for therapeutic use are well known, and are described, for example, in (Gennaro, 21Ed. Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. (2005)). In general, the type of excipient is selected based on the mode of administration. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for any appropriate manner of administration, including, for example, topical, oral, nasal, intrathecal, rectal, vaginal, intraocular, subconjunctival, sublingual or parenteral administration, including subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal, intracavernous, intrameatal or intraurethral injection or infusion. For parenteral administration, the carrier preferably comprises water, saline, alcohol, a fat, a wax or a buffer. For oral administration, any of the above excipients or a solid excipient or carrier, such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, kaolin, glycerin, starch dextrins, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, glucose, sucrose and\/or magnesium carbonate, may be employed.","A pharmaceutical composition (e.g., for oral administration or delivery by injection) may be in the form of a liquid. A liquid pharmaceutical composition may include, for example, one or more of the following: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, preferably physiological saline, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride, fixed oils that may serve as the solvent or suspending medium, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, propylene glycol or other solvents; antibacterial agents; antioxidants; chelating agents; buffers and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. A parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. The use of physiological saline is preferred, and an injectable pharmaceutical composition is preferably sterile.","A composition comprising any one of the compounds of structure (I) and substructures (IA) and (IB) described herein may be formulated for sustained or slow release. Such compositions may generally be prepared using well known technology and administered by, for example, oral, rectal or subcutaneous implantation, or by implantation at the desired target site. Sustained-release formulations may contain a compound dispersed in a carrier matrix and\/or contained within a reservoir surrounded by a rate controlling membrane. Excipients for use within such formulations are biocompatible, and may also be biodegradable; preferably the formulation provides a relatively constant level of active component release. The amount of active compound contained within a sustained release formulation depends upon the site of implantation, the rate and expected duration of release, and the nature of the condition to be treated or prevented.","For oral formulations, a PPQ compound of structure (I) and substructures (IA) and (IB) can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders, such as starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, and acacia; with disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, or xanthan gum; with lubricants, such as talc, sodium oleate, magnesium stearate sodium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, or sodium chloride; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and flavoring agents. The compounds may be formulated with a buffering agent to provide for protection of the compound from low pH of the gastric environment and\/or an enteric coating. The PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) may be formulated for oral delivery with a flavoring agent, e.g., in a liquid, solid or semi-solid formulation and\/or with an enteric coating.","Oral formulations may be provided as gelatin capsules, which may contain the active compound along with powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar carriers and diluents may be used to make compressed tablets. Tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of active ingredients over a period of time. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may contain coloring and\/or flavoring agents to increase acceptance of the compound by the subject.","The PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) described herein can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds described herein can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.","The PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) described herein may be used in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation. The compounds may be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.","Any one or more of the PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) described herein may be administered topically (e.g., by transdermal administration). Topical formulations may be in the form of a transdermal patch, ointment, paste, lotion, cream, gel, and the like. Topical formulations may include one or more of a penetrating agent, thickener, diluent, emulsifier, dispersing aid, or binder. When a PPQ compound is formulated for transdermal delivery, the compound may be formulated with or for use with a penetration enhancer. Penetration enhancers, which include chemical penetration enhancers and physical penetration enhancers, facilitate delivery of the compound through the skin, and may also be referred to as \u201cpermeation enhancers\u201d interchangeably. Physical penetration enhancers include, for example, electrophoretic techniques such as iontophoresis, use of ultrasound (or \u201cphonophoresis\u201d), and the like. Chemical penetration enhancers are agents administered either prior to, with, or immediately following compound administration, which increase the permeability of the skin, particularly the stratum corneum, to provide for enhanced penetration of the drug through the skin. Additional chemical and physical penetration enhancers are described in, for example, Transdermal Delivery of Drugs, A. F. Kydonieus (ED) 1987 CRL Press; Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers, eds. Smith et al. (CRC Press, 1995); Lenneruas et al., 2002; 54(4):499-508; Karande et al., 2002; 19(5):655-60; Vaddi et al., 2002 July; 91(7):1639-51; Ventura et al., 2001; 9(5):379-93; Shokri et al., 2001; 228(1-2):99-107; Suzuki et al., 2001; 24(6):698-700; Alberti et al., 2001; 71(3):319-27; Goldstein et al., 2001; 57(2):301-5; Kiijavainen et al., 2000; 10(2):97-102; and Tenjarla et al., 1999; 192(2):147-58.","When a PPQ compound of structure I (and substructures thereof) is formulated with a chemical penetration enhancer, the penetration enhancer is selected for compatibility with the compound, and is present in an amount sufficient to facilitate delivery of the compound through skin of a subject, e.g., for delivery of the compound to the systemic circulation. The PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) may be provided in a drug delivery patch, e.g., a transmucosal or transdermal patch, and can be formulated with a penetration enhancer. The patch generally includes a backing layer, which is impermeable to the compound and other formulation components, a matrix in contact with one side of the backing layer, which matrix provides for sustained release, which may be controlled release, of the compound, and an adhesive layer, which is on the same side of the backing layer as the matrix. The matrix can be selected as is suitable for the route of administration, and can be, for example, a polymeric or hydrogel matrix.","In one embodiment, the PPQ compounds of structure I (and substructures thereof) are delivered to the gastrointestinal tract of the subject to provide for decreased fluid secretion.

Assays were performed at 48 h after plating the cells when the cells were just confluent. For some experiments, measurements were made using T84 human intestinal epithelial cells and for other experiments, measurements were obtained using primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells, which were obtained and grown essentially as previously described (see, e.g., 3 and 27).","The compound collections used for screening to identify CFTR inhibitors included approximately 105,000 synthetic small molecules from ChemDiv (San Diego, Calif.) and Asinex (San Diego, Calif.), and approximately 7500 purified natural compounds from Analyticon (Potsdam, Germany), Timtek (Newark, N.J.), and Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, Pa.). Compounds were maintained as DMSO stock solutions. Structure-activity analysis was performed using analogs purchased from ChemDiv and Asinex.","B. Compound Screening\u2014Assays were performed using an automated screening platform (Beckman) equipped with FLUOStar fluorescence platereaders (BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany) as described (see Ma et al., supra). Each well of a 96-well plate containing FRT cells was washed 3 times in PBS (300 \u03bcL\/wash), leaving 50 \u03bcL PBS. Ten \u03bcL of a CFTR-activating cocktail (5 \u03bcM forskolin, 100 \u03bcM IBMX, 25 \u03bcM apigenin in PBS) were added, and after 5 min, test compounds (0.5 \u03bcL of 1 mM DMSO solution) were added to each well at 25 \u03bcM final compound concentration. After 15 min, 96-well plates were transferred to a plate reader for fluorescence assay. Each well was assayed individually for CFTR-mediated iodide influx by recording fluorescence continuously (200 ms per point) for 2 s (baseline) and then for 10 s after rapid addition of 160 \u03bcL of isosmolar PBS in which 137 mM chloride was replaced by iodide. The initial rate of iodide influx was computed from fluorescence data by non-linear regression. Each plate contained negative (DMSO vehicle) and positive (10 \u03bcM CFTR-172) controls.","C. Short-Circuit Current Measurements\u2014Snapwell inserts containing CFTR-expressing FRT cells (stably expressing human wildtype CFTR), T84 cells, or human bronchial epithelial cells were mounted in Ussing chambers. For FRT cells the hemichambers were filled with 5 mL of 75 mM NaCl and 75 mM Na gluconate (apical), and 150 mM NaCl (basolateral) (pH 7.3), and the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with 250 \u03bcg\/mL amphotericin B. For bronchial epithelial cells and T84 cells, both hemichambers contained a Krebs-bicarbonate solution. Hemichambers were continuously bubbled with air (FRT cells) or 5% COin air (bronchial and T84 cells) and maintained at 37\u00b0 C. Short-circuit current was recorded continuously using a DVC-1000 voltage clamp (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Fla.) using Ag\/AgCl electrodes and 3 M KCl agar bridges.","D. Patch-Clamp Analysis\u2014Whole cell recordings were performed using FRT cells stably expressing human wildtype CFTR. The pipette solution contained 140 mM N-methyl D-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl), 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM Tris-ATP, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), and the bath solution contained 140 mM N-methyl D-glucamine chloride, 1 mM CaCl, 1 mM MgCl, 10 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Experiments were performed at room temperature (22-25\u00b0 C.). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 3-5 Mohm after fire polishing. Seal resistances were typically between 3 and 10 Gohm. After establishing the whole-cell configuration, CFTR was activated by adding forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Whole cell currents were elicited by applying hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage pulses from a holding potential of 0 mV to potentials between \u2212100 mV and +100 mV in steps of 20 mV. Current was filtered at 5 kHz and digitized and analyzed using an AxoScope 10.0 system and a Digidata\u00ae 1440A AC\/DC converter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The single channel characteristics of CFTR were analyzed in the cell-attached configuration using fire-polished pipettes with a resistance of 10-15 Mohm. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 NMDG-Cl, 1 CaCl, 1 MgCl, 5 glucose and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), and the bath solution contained 140 KCl, 1 CaCl, 1 MgCl, 5 glucose and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Recordings were performed at room temperature using an Axopatch-200B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, Calif.). The voltage and current data were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and stored for later analysis. Single channel data were digitally filtered at 25 Hz, and analyzed using Clampfit 10.0 software (Axon Instruments).","E. Embryonic Organ Culture Model of PKD\u2014Mouse embryos were obtained at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5). Metanephroi were dissected and placed on transparent Falcon 0.4-mm diameter porous cell culture inserts as described (see, e.g., Sonawane et al., 15:718-728 (2008)). To the culture inserts was added DMEM\/Ham's F-12 nutrient medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 5 \u03bcg\/mL insulin, 5 \u03bcg\/mL transferrin, 2.8 nM selenium, 25 ng\/ml prostaglandin E, 32 pg\/ml T3, 250 U\/ml penicillin and 250 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin. Kidneys were maintained in a 37\u00b0 C. humidified COincubator for up to 8 days. Culture medium containing 100 \u03bcM 8-Br-cAMP, with or without CFTR inhibitor, was replaced (in the lower chamber) every 12 h. In some studies CFTR inhibitor was added at 3 days after 8-Br-cAMP to test its efficacy in reversing pre-formed cysts. Kidneys were photographed using a Nikon inverted microscope (Nikon TE 2000-S) equipped with 2\u00d7 objective lens, 520 nm bandpass filter, and high-resolution CCD camera. Percentage cyst area was calculated as total cyst area divided by total kidney area.","Collections of synthetic and natural compounds were screened according to the screening procedures described in Example 2. A cell-based fluorescence assay was used in which CFTR inhibitors were identified by reduced iodide influx in FRT cells co-expressing human CFTR and a YFP halide sensor. CFTR was maximally activated by a mixture of agonists having different activating mechanisms. Inhibition of iodide influx was observed as reduced YFP fluorescence quenching in response to rapid iodide addition to each well of 96-well plates. Based on prior knowledge that a small percent of active CFTR inhibitors are identified from random screening of compounds, primary screening was performed at 25 \u03bcM test compounds that were pre-incubated for 15 min prior to measuring fluorescence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0174"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"sub":"inh"},"Structure-activity analysis was undertaken to identify the most potent PPQ-class CFTR inhibitors for further characterization and biological testing. Of 347 commercially available PPQ analogs that were screened using the fluorescence screening assay, 54 compounds inhibited CFTR-mediated iodide influx by greater than 50% at 25 \u03bcM. Table 1 summarizes CFTR inhibition data for exemplary PPQ compounds that inhibit CFTR.  summarizes CFTR inhibitory activity of PPQ compounds with respect to the effect of various substituents of the PPQ compounds. PPQ analogs having a 5-methyl furanyl moiety (PPQ-101 to PPQ-105) showed greater inhibition potencies than unsubstituted furanyl and thiophene analogs (Group 1, Table 1). Compounds comprising other heterocycles such as 1H-benzimidazole-2-yl and chromenone in place of furan were inactive. Analogs containing phenyls, PPQ-201 to PPQ-203, PPQ-209 and PPQ-210 (Group 2, Table 1) were moderately less potent than the furan analogs PPQ-101 and PPQ-102. In summary, as indicated in Table 1 and , PPQ compounds exhibiting the greatest CFTR inhibition activity had a 5-methyl furan ring, 3-methylphenyl moiety, and the pyrimido[4\u2032,5\u2032-3,4]pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline template. The furan moiety in many of the active compounds could be replaced with the relatively stable phenyl moiety with minimal loss of activity. All active analogs had a phenyl ring (substituted or unsubstituted) at the 2-position of pyrrole. Methyl substituents on this phenyl ring increased CFTR inhibition potency, as observed for PPQ-101, 102, 103 and PPQ-215, 202, 213. Aromatization of PPQ-102 to PPQ-102b (compound 8, see ), which removes the stereocenter, which results in a planar structure, abolished CFTR inhibition activity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0176"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

was synthesized as described in Example 1, confirmed, and further characterized. Short circuit current analysis was performed as described in Example 2.  (left) shows PPQ-102 inhibition of chloride current in CFTR-expressing FRT cells following CFTR stimulation by the cAMP agonist CPT-cAMP. Measurements were taken in the presence of a transepithelial chloride gradient and following basolateral membrane permeabilization with amphotericin B so that measured current is a direct, quantitative measure of CFTR chloride conductance. PPQ inhibition of CFTR was approximately 100% at higher concentrations, with IC\u02dc90 nM (see , right). Inhibition occurred over several minutes at low PPQ-102 concentrations, suggesting an intracellular site of action. Inhibition was reversible, which was observed by complete restoration of CFTR chloride current after 30 min incubation with 2 \u03bcM PPQ-102, followed by 10 min washout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0181"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C"],"sub":["50 ","50 ","inh"],"i":"J.

PPQ-102 at 0.5 \u03bcM exhibited approximately 65% inhibition of CFTR chloride current. As shown in  (right), an approximately linear current-voltage relationship for CFTR is observed (see also, e.g., Sheppard et al., 79:S23-452 (1999); Gadsby et al., 40:477-483 (2006)). The CFTR current-voltage relationship remained linear after PPQ-102 addition, indicting a voltage-independent block mechanism, as expected for an uncharged inhibitor.","Cell-attached patch recordings were performed to examine single-channel CFTR function. The results are presented in . Addition of 10 \u03bcM forskolin and 100 \u03bcM IBMX to the bath resulted in CFTR channel opening. CFTR unitary conductance was 7 pS at +80 mV. Application of 1 \u03bcM PPQ-102 did not change unitary conductance, but reduced channel activity markedly as seen by the less frequent channel openings as illustrated in  (left). Channel open probability (P) was reduced from 0.50\u00b10.04 to 0.14\u00b10.03. Mean channel open time did not significantly change, but mean channel closed time was greatly increased (see , right). Without wishing to be bound by theory, these results suggest that PPQ-102 inhibits CFTR by an altered channel gating mechanism, with stabilization of the channel closed state.","This Example describes analysis of the PPQ compound, PPQ-102, in an embryonic kidney culture model of polycystic kidney disease.","Kidneys were removed from day 13.5 embryonic mice and maintained in organ culture where they continue to grow. Examination of kidneys by transmission light microscopy showed that the kidneys in organ culture did not form cysts under control conditions. Multiple cysts did form and progressively enlarged when the culture medium was supplemented with the CFTR agonist 8-Br-cAMP (see , left). Inclusion of PPQ-102 in the culture medium did not affect kidney growth, but significantly reduced the number and size of renal cysts formed in the 8-Br-cAMP-containing medium.  (right) summarizes the percentage area occupied by cysts from studies performed on many kidneys, showing approximately 60% inhibition of cyst formation by 0.5 \u03bcM PPQ-102 and near complete absence of cysts at 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM PPQ-102. In control studies in which 2.5 \u03bcM PPQ-102 was removed after 3 days in organ culture, cysts rapidly enlarged in the continued presence of 8-Br-cAMP, indicating that the inhibition effect of PPQ-102 is reversible.  shows representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained paraffin sections of control and 8-Br-cAMP-treated kidneys cultured for 4 day in the presence of indicated concentrations of PPQ-102. In agreement with the transmission light micrographs of intact kidneys, PPQ-102 reduced cyst size.","The ability of PPQ-102 to reduce fluid accumulation in pre-formed cysts was tested by adding PPQ-102 to the 8-Br-cAMP-containing medium after kidneys were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP.  shows reduction in cyst size over 1 and 2 days after inclusion of PPQ-102 in the culture medium. Without wishing to be bound by theory, shrinking of pre-formed cysts by PPQ-102 supports that renal cystogenesis involves a balance between active fluid secretion into and absorption from the cyst lumen.","All U.S. patents, U.S. patent application publications, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications, and non-patent publications referred to in this specification and\/or listed in the Application Data Sheet, are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety.","From the foregoing, although specific embodiments have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.
