title: Systems and methods of check detection
abstract: A digital image of a check may be divided into segments. The segments may be processed to determine the edges between the background data and the check data in the segments of the digital image. A histogram of each segment may be determined and used to determine the edges of the check image portions in the segments and thus the edges of the check. The data outside the edges of the check image portions in the segments may be considered to be background data and may be identified and/or removed. The segments, with the background data removed, may be recombined into an image of the check and provided into a digital image file that may be transmitted to an institution system for deposit of the check in an account.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Checks typically provide a safe and convenient method for an individual such as a payor to transfer funds to a payee. To use a check, the individual usually opens a checking account, or other similar account, at a financial institution and deposits funds, which are then available for later withdrawal. To transfer funds with a check, the payor usually designates a payee and an amount payable on the check. In addition, the payor often signs the check. Once the check has been signed, it is usually deemed negotiable, meaning the check may be validly transferred to the payee upon delivery. By signing and transferring the check to the payee, the payor authorizes funds to be withdrawn from the payor's account on behalf of the payee.","While a check may provide a payor with a convenient and secure form of payment, receiving a check may put certain burdens on the payee, such as the time and effort required to deposit the check. For example, depositing a check typically involves going to a local bank branch and physically presenting the check to a bank teller. To reduce such burdens for the payee, systems and methods have been developed to enable the remote deposit of checks. For example, the payee may scan a check in a digital image using a scanner or other imaging device and a computing device. The financial institution may then receive from the payee the digital image of the check. The financial institution may then use the digital image to credit funds to the payee.","However, such a technique requires the efficient and accurate detection of a check in the digital image. Detecting and extracting the check image from the background image in the digital image is difficult.","A digital image of a check may be divided into segments. The segments may be processed to determine the edges between the background data and the check data in the segments of the digital image. The data outside the edges of the check image portions in the segments may be considered to be background data and may be identified and\/or removed. The segments, with the background data identified or removed, may be recombined into an image of the check and provided into a digital image file that may be transmitted to an institution system for deposit of the check in an account.","In an implementation, a histogram of each segment may be determined and used to determine the edges of the check image portions in the segments and thus the edges of the check.","In an implementation, after the segments are recombined, corners of the image of the check may be detected and used to process a copy of the digital image. The processed copy may used for deposit of the check in an account.","In an implementation, convolution filtering may be used on each segment to identify and\/or remove background data of each segment.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","205","205","200","200","185","200"]},"A negotiable instrument typically includes a type of contract that obligates one party to pay a specified sum of money to another party. Negotiable instruments may include checks, money orders, cashier's checks, drafts, bills of exchange, promissory notes, and the like. A check instructs a financial institution to pay an amount of money from a specific account held in the payor's name with that financial institution to an account held in the payee's name. A money order is a trusted financial instrument that is a payment order for a pre-specified amount of money. It is a more trusted method of payment than a personal check because the funds for the amount shown on the money order must be prepaid. A cashier's check (also known as a bank check, official check, teller's check, bank draft or treasurer's check) is a check guaranteed by a bank and may be purchased from a bank. Cashier's checks are usually treated as cash since most banks clear them instantly.","The user  may be an individual or entity who owns an account  that may be held at the institution  and is accessible via the institution system . The account  may be any type of account for depositing funds, such as a savings account, a checking account, a brokerage account, and the like. Although only one account  is shown, it is contemplated that the user  may have any number of accounts held at the institution . The user  may deposit a check  or other negotiable instrument in the account  either electronically or physically. The institution  may process and\/or clear the check  or other negotiable instrument.","The user  may communicate with the institution  and the institution system  by way of a communications network  such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, and the like. The user  may also communicate with the institution  or the institution system  by phone, email, instant messaging, text messaging, web chat, facsimile, postal mail, and the like.","The user  may remotely electronically deposit the check  at the institution . It is noted that although examples and implementations described herein may refer to a check, the techniques and systems described herein are contemplated for, and may be used for, any negotiable instrument, such as a money order, a cashier's check, a check guaranteed by a bank, or the like. Similarly, the techniques and systems described herein are contemplated for and may be used with any form or document whose image may be captured with a scanner, camera, or other imaging device for subsequent storage and\/or processing.","The user  may access the institution  via the institution system  by opening a communication pathway via the communications network  using a user computing device . There may be several ways in which the communication pathway may be established, including, but not limited to, an Internet connection via a website  of the institution system . The user  may access the website  and log into the website  using credentials, such as, but not limited to, a username and a password.","The user  may use an imaging device , such as a scanner or camera, to generate a digital image of the check . The digital image may be used to create a digital image file  that may be sent to the institution system  and used by the institution , in conjunction with the institution system , to process a deposit of the check  whose image  is comprised within the digital image file . In an implementation, the digital image file  may be augmented by secondary data which may be information relating to the deposit of the check , such as an account number and a deposit amount, for example.","The user  may place the check  on a background and generate a digital image comprising an image of the check (e.g., a check image) and a portion of the background (e.g., a background image) using the imaging device  or other device such as a camera that may be standalone or part of a phone or other user computing device. Any background may be used, although a dark background or a consistently colored background may provide more optimal results. In an implementation, white and yellow backgrounds may not be used. It is noted that although examples and implementations described herein may refer to a check image and check data, the term \u201ccheck image\u201d may refer to any foreground image in a digital image (as opposed to the background image) and the term \u201ccheck data\u201d may refer to any foreground data in a digital image (as opposed to background data). Thus, the \u201ccheck image\u201d and the \u201ccheck data\u201d may refer to the foreground image and foreground data in implementations involving any negotiable instrument, form, or document.","In an implementation, the digital image generated by the imaging device  comprises check data and background data. The check data pertains to the check image in the digital image and the background data pertains to the background in the digital image on which the image of the check  is disposed. An example of such a digital image is further described with respect to . In an implementation, a minimum ratio of check image size (or area) to background image size (or area) may be provided in the digital image generated by the imaging device . Examples include, and are not limited to, at least five percent of the image may comprise a check image, at least one percent of the image may comprise background, the check image may be surrounded by at least one pixel of background all the way around the check image, etc.","As described further herein, the user computing device  may comprise an image processing engine  that removes some or the entire background data of the digital image generated by the imaging device  (or a grayscale image of the digital image generated by the imaging device ), resulting in an image that has an increased amount of the check image relative to the background image.","The digital image (or a grayscale image of the digital image generated by the imaging device ) may be divided into plural (i.e., more than one) segments and each segment may be processed to determine the edges between the background image and the check image in the segment. In an implementation, a histogram of each segment may be determined and used to determine the edges of the check image portions in the segments and thus the edges of the check. The data outside the edges of the check image portions in the segments may be considered to be background data and may be identified and\/or removed. In an implementation, the segments, with the background data removed, may be recombined into an image  of the check  and provided into a digital image file  that may be transmitted to the institution system  for deposit of the check  in the account .","Thus, the digital image of the check  may be divided into segments, processed to remove the background data, and recombined at the user computing device  (or the institution system  in an implementation). In an implementation, the image processing engine  of the user computing device  may comprise a grayscale converter , an image segmenter , a segment processor , a segment recombiner , and a recombined image processor . In an implementation, some of the processes associated with the image processing engine  may be executed in parallel. For example, the image segmenter  and the segment processor , as described further herein, may operate in parallel rather than sequentially.","The grayscale converter  may convert the digital image generated by the imaging device  to grayscale using known techniques. In photography and computing, a grayscale digital image is an image in which the value of each pixel is a single sample, that is, it carries only intensity information. Images of this sort are composed exclusively of shades of gray, varying from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest. Conversion of a color image to grayscale is well known and any known technique(s) may be used.","The grayscale image generated by the grayscale converter  may be provided to the image segmenter  which may divide the image into a predetermined number of segments, such as 4 segments, 6 segments, 8 segments, etc. Each segment may comprise a portion of the check image (i.e., the check data) and a portion of the background image (i.e., the background data) and an edge between the two portions. The segments may be equal in size or may differ in size. An example of an image divided into segments is further described with respect to .","As described further with respect to the methods , , , and  for example, the segment processor  may process each of the segments to identify and\/or remove background data. In an implementation, histograms may be used to detect or identify background data and check data. The histogram of each segment can be used to determine an edge of the check image in the digital image of the check so that some or the entire background image can be removed or disregarded for subsequent processing.","A histogram is a well known graph and may be used to display where all of the brightness levels contained in an image are found, from the darkest to the brightest. These values may be provided across the bottom of the graph from left (darkest) to right (brightest). The vertical axis (the height of points on the graph) shows how much of the image is found at any particular brightness level. An example of a histogram for a segment of an image comprising check data and background data is further described with respect to .","The segment recombiner  may recombine the processed segments to form an image comprising the check. The recombined image processor  may process the recombined image (e.g., as described further herein with respect to the methods , , , and ) and generate a digital image file  that may be provided to the institution system  for deposit of the check  represented as an image  in the digital image file .","In an implementation, instead of the user computing device  performing the image segmentation and segment processing, the image segmentation and segment processing may be performed by the institution system  on a digital image file received from the user computing device .","The user  may thus generate a digital image of the check  using the imaging device , in an implementation. For example, after endorsing the check , the user  may use a device such as the imaging device  and\/or the user computing device  for example, to make a digital image of the front sides and\/or back sides of the check  and storing the digital image(s) in a digital image file. The images of the front side and the back side of the check  may be processed using the techniques described herein. The images may be processed as separate files or as images in single file. The images of the front side and the back side of the check  may be captured sequentially, e.g., pursuant to the user  flipping the check  over after an image of the front of the check  has been captured.","The digital image file  comprising an image  of the check may be transmitted to the institution system . The user  may send the digital image file  and any secondary data to the institution system  along with a request to deposit the check  into an account, such as the account . In an implementation, the user  may attach the digital image file  to an email and send the digital image file  to the institution system  using the same device used to make the digital image file  of the check  or another computing device. However, any technique for sending a digital image file  to the institution system  may be used, such as providing a digital image file  from storage to the website  associated with the institution system .","The institution  in conjunction with the institution system  may process the deposit request according to the digital image file  and any secondary data. Thus, the institution  in conjunction with the institution system  may process the digital image file  comprising the image  of the check  for deposit.","In an implementation, the institution system  may retrieve the image  of the check  from the digital image file  and process the check  from the image  for deposit. Any image processing technology, software, or other application(s) may be used to retrieve the image  of the check  from the digital image file  and to obtain the relevant data of the check  from the digital image file . The institution system  may determine whether the financial information associated with the check  may be valid.","Upon receipt and processing of the digital image file  and approval of the check  associated therewith, the institution  may credit the funds of the check  to the account . It will be appreciated that the examples herein are for purposes of illustration and explanation only, and that an embodiment is not limited to such examples.","The user computing device  may be integral with the device used to make the digital image of the check  and\/or the digital image file  or separate from the device used to make the digital image of the check  and\/or the digital image file . The user computing device  may be a personal computer (PC), a handheld computing device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, or a smartphone, for example. The user computing device  may comprise an imaging device  such as a camera, scanner, or other device in which an image of the check  may be obtained.","In an implementation, the user computing device  may be a mobile device that comprises a camera which can capture a digital image of the check  by taking a picture of the front and\/or back of the check . The back of the check may provide endorsement verification, such as the signature of the person or party the check is made out to. The user  may send the digital image file  to the institution system  using the mobile device. An example user computing device  is described with respect to . It is contemplated that any device that is capable of generating a digital image may be used to make a digital image of the check  which may be processed for sending to the institution system  as a digital image file . Additional devices that may be used in the generation and\/or transmission of a digital image include a digital camera, a photocopier, a fax machine, and the like, for example.","The institution system  may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including, but not limited to, computers, servers, databases, or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors, databases, storage drives, registers, cache, random access memory (RAM) chips, data buses, or the like and\/or software components such as operating systems, database management applications, or the like. According to an embodiment, the electronic devices may include a network-based server that may process the financial information and may receive the digital image file  from the user .","The electronic devices may receive the digital image file  and may perform an initial analysis on the quality of the image of the check  in the digital image file , the readability of the data contained therein, or the like. For example, the electronic devices may determine whether the amount payable and other information may be readable such that it may be obtained and processed by the institution  to credit the account  associated with the user .","The institution system  may include a user interface module , an image processor , and a data source access engine . The user interface module  may generate and format one or more pages of content  as a unified graphical presentation that may be provided to the user computing device  or a representative computing device . In an implementation, the page(s) of content  may be provided to the user computing device  and\/or the representative computing device  via a secure website  associated with the institution system .","In an implementation, the institution system  may use the image processor  to process the digital image file  comprising an image  of the check  received from the user  for use by the institution  in the processing and\/or clearance of the check . The image processor  may process multiple frames of the image if the image is comprised of multiple frames (e.g., the front side and the back side of a check).","For example, after receiving the digital image file  of the check , the image processor  may retrieve the image(s)  of the check  and process the image  or an image based on the image  for deposit. The image processor  may use any known image processing software or other application(s) to obtain the image  and any relevant data of the check  from the digital image file .","The image processor  has access to data, files, and documents pertaining to the user  as well as any other data, files, and documents that are internal or external to the institution system  that may be useful in processing the digital image file  and\/or the data contained therein.","In an implementation, the image processing engine  may be provided at the institution system  instead of the user computing device . For example, the image processing engine , comprising the grayscale converter , the image segmenter , the segment processor , the segment recombiner , and the recombined image processor , may be comprised within the image processor . The functions of the image processing engine  may thus be performed at the institution system  side as opposed to the user computing device  side. In such an implementation, the user computing device  may perform some image processing (e.g., the image may be converted to grayscale and compressed) and the resulting processed image may be uploaded to the institution system  for processing with the image processing engine .","The institution system  has the ability to retrieve information from one or more data sources  via the data source access engine . Data pertaining to the user  and\/or the user account  and\/or processing and clearing of a check may be retrieved from data source(s)  and\/or external data sources. The retrieved data may be stored centrally, perhaps in storage . Other information may be provided to the institution system  from the user  and\/or the representative .","Data source(s)  may contain data, metadata, email, files, and\/or documents that the institution system  maintains pertaining to the user , such as personal data such as name, physical address, email address, etc. and financial data such as credit card numbers and checking account numbers. Such data may be useful for processing the digital image file . Additionally or alternatively, the institution  or the institution system  may access this information when processing or clearing a check.","The representative computing device , as well as the user computing device , may provide access to a system which is coupled to the institution system . A system may be configured to format and transmit a graphical user interface to the representative  and\/or the user , and through the graphical user interface provide the representative  and\/or the user  the ability to interact with information that may be maintained, requested, and\/or provided by the institution system . As mentioned above, the institution system  may provide a unified graphical presentation output. In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation is combined with other materials and transmitted to the representative  and\/or the user .","A user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user  and\/or the representative  through which access to check processing and clearing data and status and related data can be accomplished. Any technology that provides interactivity through a web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.","The institution system  may comprise one or more computing devices . The computing device(s)  may have one or more processors , storage  (e.g., storage devices, memory, etc.), and software modules . The computing device(s) , including processor(s) , storage , and software modules , may be used in the performance of the techniques and operations described herein.","Examples of software modules  may include modules that may be used in conjunction with receiving and processing a digital image file  comprising an image  of the check , retrieving data from the digital image file , generating web page content for display, and receiving instructions from the representative  or the user , for example. While specific functionality is described herein as occurring with respect to specific modules, the functionality may likewise be performed by more, fewer, or other modules.

Although four segments , , ,  are shown in , any plural number of segments may be used with techniques described herein. Although the segments , , , , are formed by dividing the image  into quadrants, the segments may be formed by any techniques, take any shape, and have any area, subject to a constraint that each segment comprises a portion of the check data  and a portion of the background data  separated by a portion of the edge . In this manner, two distinct areas of density corresponding to the background of the image and the check data of the image may be provided in a histogram. In an implementation, each segment only contains a portion of the check data  and a portion of the background data  separated by a portion of the edge  and no additional portions of data (e.g., does not contain additional check data or background data that would give rise to an additional (e.g., a third) distinct area of density in a histogram).","As noted above, a histogram may be generated for each segment and used to distinguish between check data and background data (e.g., by determining an edge between the check image and the background image).  is a diagram of an example histogram  for a segment of an image comprising check data and background data (such as one of the segments , , ,  of ). The horizontal axis of the histogram  represents the grayscale level between 0 and 255, where 0 represents true black and 255 represents true white. The vertical axis represents the amount of the image at a particular grayscale level of the horizontal axis. Any known technique for generating a histogram for a grayscale image may be used. The histogram  shows two distinct areas of density (i.e., two distinct density distributions). The density area  closer to the grayscale level of zero corresponds to the background of the image, and the density area  closer to the grayscale level of 255 corresponds to the check data.","A threshold point  (or threshold level) may be determined between the two areas  and  and may be taken to correspond to an edge between the background data and the check data. The threshold point  may be determined using any known technique for determining a minimum between two curves or areas on a histogram. The threshold point  may be determined to be in a valley between the peak of the density area  and the peak of the density area . In an implementation, the threshold point  may be determined using the slopes of the two curves corresponding to the areas  and .","The threshold point  may be used to separate the check image from the background image. In an implementation, the portion of the image corresponding to the area to the left of the threshold point  may be filtered out of the segment, thereby leaving the check data (and thus the check image) in the segment. In an implementation, thresholding may be accomplished by flooring the values to the left of the threshold point , where flooring is making all pixels values in the image  (i.e., black) to the left of the threshold point , and raising all pixel values to the right of the threshold point  to equal 255 (i.e., white) (Range: threshold point to 255).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502"]},"At , the user may open a communication pathway with an institution that may be associated with an account for depositing funds by logging into a website of the institution, for example.
