title: Providing remote application logs for cloud applications
abstract: Applications and their application components are deployed on a cloud platform. The application components generate application logs on the underlying cloud runtime infrastructure of the cloud platform. In one aspect, the application logs may be stored on a network storage on the cloud platform. In another aspect, the application logs may be stored on the cloud runtime infrastructure. The cloud platform provides a service that exposes an interface to remotely provide the stored application logs. The exposed interface is instantiated to process remote requests for application logs for a specified application component. The remote requests are sent from a client. The requested application logs are retrieved based on the implementation of the interface. The application logs are provided to the client.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The increasing software complexity results in changes to product cycles, requirements and models for delivering software applications. Changes in customers' needs require flexibility in terms of processes, landscape and software components. Operational costs are high and a lot is spent on maintenance of the existing infrastructural equipment. Traditionally, business customers have to build and maintain their own infrastructure to run on-premise applications. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources as a service over a network (e.g., the Internet). By applying the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model and offering business applications that are hosted online, the maintenance costs decrease and time is saved. Software vendors can use the cloud environment to quickly deploy existing software solutions. SaaS is a delivery model, where a cloud service provider provides software applications and various hardware and software resources on-demand when requested by an end user (e.g., customer). A customer of on-demand applications is free from the procurement and maintenance of the hardware and software needed for executing the applications.","Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is another category of cloud computing solutions that provides the computing platform including operating system, programming language execution environment, database, and web server to facilitate the development and deployment of on-demand applications and services. In PaaS offerings, the customer is responsible for more of the execution environment than in the SaaS model. However, with PaaS offerings the customer has greater control over the application. Applications can run as SaaS on the infrastructure that is used with a PaaS provider. Another level of cloud-computing solution is Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), in which the service provider offers computing resources in the form of physical or virtual machines, data storage, networks, load balancers, etc. In some cases, the customer provides applications to be executed, possibly along with operating system images and other portions of the execution runtime environment.","Application developers or users of cloud-based applications need access to the underlying infrastructure to perform certain operations. This way, they can have a similar experience to what they have when working with on-premise solutions. Direct access to the underlying infrastructure (e.g. virtual machines (VMs) with operating systems and application servers installed on top of them) in a PaaS environment is usually given to a defined number of users, such as platform operators. Monitoring systems help administrators to identify resource bottlenecks or problems and take the required action. During the development phase, it is a common practice to insert logging statements within the code to produce informative logs at runtime that can be helpful for troubleshooting or for analysis purposes.","Logging is a process of creating and storing permanent records of events for a particular system or software application that can be reviewed, printed, and analyzed. These records can contain short messages, the source of the records, timestamps of the events, log levels specifying the importance of the records, etc. Log messages can include a detailed sequence of statements that describe the events happening during an operation as they are executed. Logger objects have predefined levels that specify the granularity that will be applied when logging messages in the log files. A logging configuration can be defined for a particular software application or component. The logging configuration defines the log levels that will be applied while the software application or component is running Java\u00ae logging framework is a logging package for the Java\u00ae Platform that defines a couple of log levels for a logger object, e.g., fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace, others. Based on the log level and the events that occur during the execution of the application, log messages are generated and stored as logged data (e.g. in log files). Log messages can be used not only by application developers, but also by the system administrators that identify problems in system operations. Therefore, it is essential to keep logs during the whole execution of a given software application or a system. To retrieve the logged data for an application deployed on a cloud platform, the underlying cloud infrastructure should be accessed.","Embodiments of techniques for providing remote application logs for cloud applications are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Monitoring application servers and application components that run on top of the servers is a process that is important for on-premise and on-demand solutions. Software applications that are offered as SaaS are deployed on a given cloud platform and run on data centers operated by a cloud vendor. As more and more applications are offered as services, the need for maintenance of these applications increases. Application developers need to monitor the applications during runtime and therefore need access to the stored application logs when troubleshooting customer's problems. However, when an application is deployed on a cloud platform, the cloud runtime infrastructure cannot be directly accessed by the application developer. Thus, application developers should be enabled to remotely preview relevant application logs to easily analyze the behavior of running applications. In addition, application developers need to access this logging information without the additional assistance from cloud platform operators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","105","110","110","102","110","102","102","1","115","2","120","125","1","130","1","135","2","140","1","135","2","140","1","115","2","120","145","150","125"]},"In one embodiment, the request sent from the client  can specify which application components are monitored and request the stored logged data for them. For example, the client  can be a web application for providing information about deployed application components on the cloud platform . Another example of the client  can be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides the option of a software developer to access the Cloud Platform Monitoring System . The IDE can be the Eclipse\u00ae development environment which could be used to develop applications in various programming languages, such as, but not limited to, Java\u00ae, Perl\u00ae, C\u00ae, C++\u00ae, PHP\u00ae, etc. Furthermore, the client  can be a plug-in in the Eclipse\u00ae development environment. Yet another example of the client  can be a command-line console client that a user can use to enter commands. The command-line console client can be designed to communicate with the Cloud Platform Monitoring System . In one embodiment, the client  can be provided by the cloud platform .","In one embodiment, the cloud platform  can provide platform accounts that can be used by clients, such as the client . In one embodiment, an account can be a logical entity for separation, such as an account that a customer of a cloud platform can receive. For example, customers can use the account for their own business needs and use a cloud provided space for the account for creating different applications. The cloud provided space may be a repository, or storage. One account can use one space for a number of applications deployed and started on the cloud platform. The applications can also include a number of application components.","The request from the client  can be received over a remote communication channel . For example, the communication channel can be based on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The Cloud Platform Monitoring System  can retrieve remote application logs (e.g. logged data) for the requested application components from the application components deployed and started on VMs, e.g. Virtual Machine_ , Virtual Machine_ , Virtual Machine_N , and other VMs, provided by the cloud platform and having application components running on top of them. In one embodiment, the execution of the application components, such as Application Component  , can record log messages. In another embodiment, the recorded log messages can be interpreted as logged data describing the behavior of a running software component, a software application, or a software system. The logged data may correspond to logger objects that are inserted in the programming code of the Application Component_ . The logged data can be stored on a server running on a VM, such as the Virtual Machine_ , Virtual machine_ , etc. After processing the request from the client , the Cloud Platform Monitoring System  may provide the requested logged data for the defined application components. For example, the logged data may be provided over HTTP communication channel and displayed by a client in a web browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","1","280","270","260","270","260","260","270","250","260","250","260","250","235","230","240","240","240","205"]},"In one embodiment, the cloud platform  can provide a monitoring system  that includes the Log Service . The Log Service  can expose an API (Application Programming Interface)  which can be accessed by external units, such as a client . The API  may represent a specification that defines the communication between software components. In one embodiment, the API can provide interfaces that allow operations like listing available log files for deployed application components, getting a specified log file, etc. These operations can support authentication and authorization features. The service can serve responses to the client's calls that request logged data for defined application components or applications. The calls made from the client  can be received over a remote communication channel , for example, based on HTTP. The exposed API  can include an interface, which can be a programming interface. In one embodiment, the implementation of the interface retrieves logged data for the requested application components or applications. For example, a client  may request from the Log Service  the logged data for the Application Component . The Log Service  provides the API  where the interface is instantiated and can serve requests from the client . The retrieved requested logged data can be provided to the client . For example, the logged data may be provided for downloading in a file format, or presented in a web browser.","In one embodiment, the design and implementation of the Log Service  can be based on a Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style. REST defines a set of architectural principles by which one can design a service (web service) that is concentrated on resources that are transferred over HTTP. REST principles can be applied with a wide range of clients written in different programming languages. Web services that are based on the REST architecture style (also called RESTful Web services) use HTTP method explicitly and in a way consistent with the protocol definition. With RESTful services, there is a one-to-one mapping between create, read, update, and delete operations and HTTP methods. For example, when retrieving a resource, a GET method is used. RESTful Web services expose directly structure-like Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). The Log Service  can be designed as a RESTful service, which exposes an API to various clients that can be built on top of it to present application log files (logged data) to end users (e.g. application developers). In one embodiment, an end user may request logged data by using a web browser. In another embodiment, a custom application or a mobile application may be developed in such a manner that they use the logging functionality provided by the Log Service .","The API specification may define methods that can be used. If the API is a REST API, the REST API specification may provide description of the HTTP methods that are available and a path that can be used for a Uniform Resource Location (URL)-based request. Table 1 presents a specification for two exemplary methods provided by a REST API. These methods can provide remotely application logs for cloud deployed applications and application components for an authenticated and authorized user of an account on a cloud platform (such as the cloud platform , ). The specification may further describe the possible HTTP response codes, which can be returned to the client that requested the logged data. For example, the response code can be \u201c200\u201d, which means that the request has succeeded. If the response code is \u201c401\u201d, this means that the request was unauthenticated. Response code \u201c403\u201d represents a response when the user (client) is not allowed to access the logged data that is requested for the account\/application\/component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Possible"]},{"entry":["HTTP",{},{},"Response"]},{"entry":["Method","Request Path","Description","Codes"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["GET","\/:account\/:","Returns all log files for a given","\u201c200\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"application\/:","application component identified by","\u201c401\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"component","\/:account\/:application\/:component","\u201c403\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"\u201c404\u201d"]},{"entry":["GET","\/:account\/:","Returns the content of a given log","\u201c200\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"application\/:","file within a given application","\u201c401\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"component\/:","component","\u201c403\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"file",{},"\u201c404"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The request path is described with parameters\u2014account, application, component, and file.
