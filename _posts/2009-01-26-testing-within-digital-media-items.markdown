{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Electronic distribution of information has gained in importance with the proliferation of personal computers and has undergone a tremendous upsurge in popularity as the Internet has become widely available. With the widespread use of the Internet, it has become possible to distribute large, coherent units of information using electronic technologies.","Advances in electronic and computer-related technologies have permitted computers to be packaged into smaller and more powerful electronic devices. An electronic device may be used to receive and process information. The electronic device may provide compact storage of the information as well as ease of access to the information. For example, a single electronic device may store a large quantity of information that might be downloaded instantaneously at any time via the Internet. In addition, the electronic device may be backed up, so that physical damage to the device does not necessarily correspond to a loss of the information stored on the device.","In addition, a user may interact with the electronic device. For example, the user may read information that is displayed by the electronic device. Further, the user may instruct the device to display a specific piece of information stored on the electronic device. As such, benefits may be realized from improved systems and methods for interacting with an electronic device.","According to one illustrative implementation, this disclosure sets forth functionality for downloading items to a user device. The functionality may be manifested in various systems, modules, computer readable media, data structures, methods, and other forms.","The \u201citem\u201d referenced above may correspond to any type of content. In one case, the item corresponds to a digital media item. The media item may include, without limitation, text content, image content, audio content, video content, hypertext protocol content, and so on, or any combination of these kinds of content. In addition, or alternatively, the item may include instruction-bearing content, such as machine readable program code, markup language content, script content, and so forth. For instance, an item may correspond to a software upgrade or the like.","More specifically, in one case, the term \u201citem\u201d may refer to a specific unit of merchandisable content, such as a book (e.g., an \u201ceBook\u201d), an issue of a magazine, and so on. Alternatively, an item may refer to smaller parts of a merchandisable unit, such as a chapter of a book or a song in an album. Alternatively, an item may refer to a larger compilation of component items which are related in any manner. For instance, an item may refer to multiple issues of a magazine in a particular year.","The term \u201centry\u201d corresponds to information which refers to an item. For example, a list of entries may include reference information which identifies respective media items.","Certain drawings illustrate the features by showing various logic, modules, components, functionality, and so forth. The terms \u201clogic,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cfunctionality\u201d and the like generally represent hardware, software, firmware, or any combination of these elements, or yet some other kind of implementation. For instance, in the case of a software implementation, the terms \u201clogic,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d or \u201cfunctionality\u201d may represent instruction-bearing content to perform specified tasks when executed on a processing unit or units (e.g., a CPU or CPUs). The instruction-bearing content may be stored in one or more machine-readable media.","The term \u201cmachine-readable media\u201d or the like refers to any kind of media for retaining information in any form, including various kinds of storage devices (magnetic, optical, static, etc.). The term \u201cmachine-readable media\u201d also encompasses transitory forms of representing information, including various hardwired and\/or wireless links for transmitting the information from one point to another.","Other figures illustrate features in signal diagram form and\/or flowchart form. In this mode of explanation, certain operations are described as constituting distinct tasks performed in a certain order. Such implementations are illustrative and non-limiting. Separate operations described in these figures may be grouped together and performed in a single operation, while certain single operations may be performed in multiple parts. Certain operations may be performed in an order different from the order illustrated in the figures. Certain operations may be performed by different agents than is identified in the figures. The operations shown in the figures may be implemented by software, firmware, hardware, manual processing, or other form, or by any combination of these forms.","In general, the various features described in the implementations may be regarded as optional features, meaning that these features may be omitted or replaced with other features. Further, the various implementations described herein may be supplemented by adding additional features.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","104","104"]},"As explained above, the term \u201citem\u201d has broad connotation. The following list, which is non-exhaustive, identifies representative types of items.","An item may correspond to an eBook item. An eBook item, in turn, may refer to a book in electronic form or to one or more portions of a book (such as a chapter of a book) or to a compilation of multiple books (such as a book series), and so on. An eBook is an example of a general class of items referred to herein as pre-generated items. The term pre-generated item refers to content typically (although not necessarily) provided to a user in response to the user's on-demand request for the content after it has been received and stored by the IPS .","An item may correspond to an eBook item with interactive testing capability. An eBook item with interactive testing capability is an eBook item that includes one or more interactive tests with the eBook that allows the user to be tested with respect to the eBook. More details regarding an eBook item with interactive testing capability are found below.","An item of content may also correspond to a subscription-related item. A subscription-related item refers to any item the user receives based on a schedule or based on some other type of pre-established arrangement. Without limitation, representative forms of subscription-related items include magazines, journals, newspapers, newsletters, and so on. Other forms of subscription-related items include electronic feeds of various types, such as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, and so on. In contrast to a pre-generated item, a subscription-related item is typically provided to a user in response to the receipt of the item by the IPS , rather than the user's on-demand request for a pre-generated item.","An item may also correspond to a personal document item, or simply \u201cpersonal item.\u201d A personal item refers to a document the user forwards in advance to the IPS , whereupon the IPS  converts the item to a device-readable format.","An item may also correspond to audio content, such as a piece of music, a collection of music, an audio book, and so on. An item may also correspond to a bundle of information generated in response to a query made by the user. An item may also correspond to instruction-bearing content, such as a software update. An item may also correspond to advertising material downloaded to the user device by any entity or combination of entities. Various rules may be applied to govern the downloading of this type of item.","An item may also correspond to a sample of a more complete version of the item. In one case, a sample-type item may embed one or more links to allow the user to acquire its full-version counterpart, or another part (e.g., chapter) of the item. In another case, a publisher or author may release an eBook or other item in a series of installments. Each installment may be regarded as an item.","An item may correspond to a draft of an item, meaning an item in a state that its author does not regard as necessarily final. The term \u201citem\u201d may encompass yet other forms of content; the above types of items are representative.","The item-providing system (IPS)  corresponds to any functionality or combination of functionality for forwarding items to the user device . In one case, the IPS  may correspond to network-accessible server-based functionality, various data stores, and\/or other data processing equipment. The IPS  may be implemented by a single collection of functionality provided at a single physical site. Alternatively, the IPS  may be implemented by multiple collections of functionality, optionally provided at plural physical sites. The IPS  may be administered by a single entity or plural entities.","In one case, the IPS  corresponds to an entity which provides items to users upon the users' purchase of the items. In this role, the IPS  may essentially act as a bookseller or the like. In one particular commercial environment, the IPS  may also offer services which allow users to purchase hard-copy books for physical delivery to the users; in this context, the IPS  may allow users to download electronic items to respective user devices as part of its entire suite of services. In other cases, the IPS  corresponds to an entity which provides items to users on a non-fee basis or on the basis of some other type of alternative compensation arrangement. Thus, the term \u201cprovider\u201d of items should be construed broadly to encompass educational institutions, governmental organizations, libraries, non-profit organizations, and so on, or some cooperative combination of any two or more entities.","The user device  corresponds to any type of electronic processing device  for receiving items from the IPS . In one implementation, the user device  is readily portable, meaning the user may freely carry the user device  from one location to another. In one particular case, the user device is designed as a book reader device, also known as an eBook reader device. In this case, the user device  functions as the electronic counterpart of a paper-based book. The user may hold the user device  in a manner similar to a physical book; the user may electronically turn the pages of the book, and so on.","Without limitation,  illustrates a particular type of eBook reader device. Additional details regarding this particular type of reader device are provided below. Alternatively, the user device  may correspond to any other type of portable device, such as a portable music player, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a game module, a laptop computer, and so on, and\/or any combination of these types of devices. Alternatively, or in addition, the user device  may correspond to a device which is not readily portable, such as a personal computer, a set-top box associated with a television, a gaming console, and so on.","A communication infrastructure  bi-directionally couples the IPS  to the user device . Namely, the IPS  downloads items, upgrades, testing content, and\/or other information to the user device  via the communication infrastructure . The IPS  receives various instructions and other data from the user device  via the communication infrastructure .","The communication infrastructure  may include any combination of communication functionality, including any combination of hardwired links and\/or wireless links, etc. For instance,  (to be discussed below in turn) shows one implementation of the communication infrastructure  which includes a combination of a wide area network (WAN) and wireless infrastructure. By virtue of the wireless component of the communication infrastructure , the user may use the user device  to purchase items and consume items without being tethered to the IPS  via hardwired links. Thus, for instance, a user may purchase and consume an eBook using the device while riding in a car as a passenger, while hiking in a park, while boating on a lake, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["108","102","104","108","104","102","110","104","102","102"]},"The user device  receives the list from the IPS  in response to the second message  (note  does not specifically identify the transmission of the list from the IPS  to the user device ). If the instructions identify items to be downloaded, in a third message , the user device  sends a request to the IPS , asking the IPS  to download the items identified in the list. In a fourth message , the IPS  downloads the requested items to the user device . In effect, the user device  retrieves the items using a pull approach, but the pull approach is initiated by a push operation (by virtue of the IPS  \u201cpushing\u201d a notification message  to the user device ).","In one case, the notification message  may correspond to a certain type of notification message used to commence voice mode interaction, such as a telephone ring. In this case, the notification message  is also referred to as a Terrestrial Phone Home or a TelePhone Home (TPH) signal. (It will be appreciated that the identifiers Terrestrial Phone Home, TelePhone Home, TPH, etc. are arbitrary labels of convenience to facilitate explanation herein.) The other messages may take the form of data mode messages.","In one case, the user device  may be configured to receive and act on the TPH signal without actually formally answering the TPH signal. In other words, the user device  receives the TPH signal and does not make a voice connection, but rather initiates steps to download items from the IPS . In some environments, a wireless provider system may charge a fee when a call is answered, but not if a user device is called and does not answer. Thus, the strategy of ringing the user device  without an answer may allow the IPS  to communicate instructions to the user device  without incurring a fee for the user device  or the IPS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200","102","104","106"]},"The communication infrastructure  includes multiple components. A first component is a wireless provider system . The wireless provider system  corresponds to any infrastructure for providing a wireless exchange  with the user device . In one case, the wireless provider system  is implemented using various data processing equipment, communication towers, and so forth (not shown).","Alternatively, or in addition, the wireless provider system  may rely on satellite technology to exchange information with the user device . The wireless provider system  may use any form of electromagnetic energy to transfer signals, such as, without limitation, radio-wave signals. The wireless provider system  may use any communication technology to transfer signals, such as, without limitation, spread spectrum technology, implemented, for instance, using the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) protocol. The wireless provider system  may be administered by a single entity or by a cooperative combination of multiple entities.","The communication infrastructure  also includes a communication-enabling system . One purpose of the communication-enabling system  is to serve as an intermediary in passing information between the IPS  and the wireless provider system . The communication-enabling system  may be implemented in any manner, such as, without limitation, by one or more server-type computers, data stores, and\/or other data processing equipment. The communication enabling system may expose one or more Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) . The IPS  may call on the APIs  to perform various respective functions.","The communication-enabling system  communicates with the wireless provider system  via a dedicated channel , also referred to as a dedicated communication pipe or private pipe. The channel  is dedicated in the sense it is exclusively used to transfer information between the communication-enabling system  and the wireless provider system . In contrast, the communication enabling system  communicates with the IPS  via a non-dedicated communication mechanism, such as a public Wide Area Network (WAN) . For example, the WAN  may represent the Internet.","The communication enabling system  may serve as an adaptor. For instance, assume that, in one particular implementation, the IPS  acts as a data center which is set up to receive information via a wide area public network. Assume further the wireless provider system  is set up to interact with clients via a private pipe. The communication-enabling system  interacts with the IPS  via the wide area network  and the wireless provider system  via the private pipe , thus accommodating the processing preferences of the IPS  and the wireless provider system . By virtue of this intermediary role, the communication-enabling system  may be referred to as a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE), while the IPS  may be referred to as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO).","In terms of a business paradigm, the IPS  may interact with the wireless provider system  using a wholesale account. On this basis, the IPS  may pay the wireless provider system  a fee based on the aggregate use of the wireless provider system  by all of the user devices. The IPS  may recoup these costs through fees charged to the end-users. In this illustrative business scenario, the wireless provider system  does not send bills directly to the users who operate the user devices.","More specifically, the wireless provider system  handles an entire amount of communication traffic  associated with all uses of its services. A subset of the entire amount of communication traffic  represents IPS-related communication traffic , also referred to as merchant-related communication traffic. The IPS-related traffic  represents the exchange of information occurring between the IPS  and all of the user devices which interact with the IPS . The wireless provider system  discriminates the IPS-related traffic  from other traffic based on unique key information associated with the IPS-related traffic .","The wireless provider system  may prepare a bill based on the total amount of IPS related traffic . As noted above, the wireless provider system  may seek payment for its services from the IPS , not the individual users of the devices.","The examples set forth above are representative; other strategies may be used to exchange information between the IPS  and the user device . In alternative cases, for instance, the system  may be configured such that the wireless provider system  does indeed recoup costs directly from individual users. Or the system  may be configured such that the wireless provider system  submits bills to either the IPS  (in aggregate) or to the individual users, at the option of the individual respective users.","The users may access the IPS  through alternative communication routes which bypass the wireless provider system . For instance, as indicated by alternative access path , a user may use a personal computer or the like to access the IPS  via the wide area network , circumventing the wireless provider system  and the communication-enabling system . The user may download items through this route in conventional fashion. The user may then transfer the items from the personal computer to the user device , e.g., via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) transfer mechanism, through the manual transfer of a portable memory device, and so on. This mode of transfer may be particularly appropriate for large files, such as audio books and the like. Transferring such a large amount of data in wireless fashion may have a relatively high cost. However, the system  may also be configured to transfer large files (such as audio files) via the wireless exchange .","The system  of  also provides various security-related features. According to one feature, the system  applies multiple layers of authentication. Namely, the wireless provider system  includes authentication functionality A  to perform a first level of authentication. The communication-enabling system  provides authentication functionality A  to perform a second level of authentication. The IPS  provides authentication functionality A  to perform a third layer of authentication. Each layer of authentication performs checking to ensure the user device currently attempting to interact with the IPS  is duly authorized to access the IPS . The distributed nature of the authentication helps ensure someone who has obtained a user device through improper means cannot gain access to the services provided by the IPS .","According to another security-related feature, the system  may provide various constraints which restrict the manner in which a user may use the device . For example, the communication-enabling system  may be configured such that it will allow user devices to access only one or more predetermined addresses associated with the IPS . This means that, in one case, a user cannot use the user device  to directly access a network-accessible site without being first routed through the IPS . This prevents the user from using the user device  as an unrestricted broadband interface to network-accessible resources.","More specifically, the IPS  may include a web browsing proxy (to be discussed below in greater detail). When the user attempts to access a network accessible resource , the communication enabling system  first directs the user to the browsing proxy module. The browsing proxy module may then either deny the request or accept the request by allowing the user to access the network-accessible resource . The browsing proxy module may apply various rules (to be discussed) in determining whether to deny or accept the request to access the network-accessible resource . In this manner, the communication-enabling system  and the IPS  do not permit the user to directly access the network accessible resources.","In another case, the system  may allow the user to directly interact with network-accessible resources, that is, without being routed through the IPS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","102","104","300"]},"In another implementation, the system  may use some other communication infrastructure than is shown in , which may optionally omit the use of wireless communication.","Addressing the details of the IPS  first, this system  performs various functions. Different modules are associated with these different functions. One module is a content reception system . The content reception system  receives content from one or more sources of content . The sources  may represent any type of provider of content, such as eBook publishers, newspaper publishers, other publishers of periodicals, various feed sources, music sources, and so on.","The sources  may be administered by a single entity or may be administered by separate respective entities. Further, the entity administering the IPS  may correspond to a same entity which administers one or more of the sources . Alternatively, or in addition, the entity administering the IPS  may interact with one or more different entities administering one or more respective sources . In the latter case, the entity administering the IPS  may enter into an agreement with the source entities to receive content from these source entities.","In the above example, the entities associated with the sources  may correspond to commercial organizations or other types of organizations. In another case, one or more of the sources may correspond to individual users, such as the creators of the items. For example, a user may directly provide items to the IPS . Alternatively, or in addition, a user may supply content to a community repository of items, and the IPS  may receive content from this repository, and so on.","The content creation system  may obtain the content through various mechanisms. In one case, the content reception system  obtains the content via one or more networks . The networks  may represent a WAN, such as the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), or some combination thereof. The content reception system  may receive the information in various forms using any protocol or combination of protocols. For instance, the content reception system  may receive the information by making a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, by making a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) request, by receiving a feed (e.g., an RSS feed), and so forth.","In another case, the IPS  may obtain content via a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of sources . More generally, the content reception system  may proactively request the content in an on-demand manner (based on a pull method of information transfer). Or the content reception system  may receive the content in response to independent transfer operations initiated and performed by the sources  (based on a push method of information transfer). Alternatively, the content reception system  may use a combination of pull and push transfer mechanisms to receive the content.","The content reception system  may receive content in the form of items. Without limitation, the items may include eBooks, audio books, music, magazine issues, journal issues, newspaper editions, various feeds, and so forth. In one case, the content reception system  may receive some items expressed in a format not readable by the user device  (where the user device may optionally be configured to receive, process, and present content expressed in one or more predefined formats). To address this situation, the content reception system  may convert the items from their original format into a device-readable format (such as, without limitation, the .mobi format).","The content reception system  stores the items received (and optionally converts them to another format) in a content store . The content store  includes one or more storage systems for retaining items in electronic form, located at a single site or distributed over plural sites, administered by one or more entities.","The IPS  also includes a subscription module . The subscription module  manages users' subscriptions to subscription-related items. Generally, a subscription entitles a user to receive one or more subscription-related items (which are yet to be received and stored by the content reception system ) based on any type of consideration or combination of considerations. Without limitation, subscription-related item types include magazines, journals, newsletters, newspapers, various feeds, and so forth. Users may arrange to receive subscription-related items by purchasing such subscriptions, or, more generally, by registering to receive such subscriptions (which, in some cases, may not involve the payment of a fee).","Alternatively, or in addition, the IPS  may automatically register users to receive subscription-related items without the involvement of the users (and possibly without the approval of the users). The latter scenario may be appropriate in the case in which the IPS  (or some other entity) registers a user to receive unsolicited advertisements, newsletters, and so on. The system  may allow the user to opt out of receiving such unsolicited information.","The IPS  may consult the subscription module  to determine which user devices should receive a newly-received subscription-related item. For instance, upon receiving an electronic issue of the magazine Forbes, the IPS  consults the subscription module  to determine the users who have paid to receive this magazine. The IPS  then sends the issue to the appropriate user devices.","An item delivery system  represents the functionality which actually performs the transfer of content to the user device . In one illustrative representation, the item-delivery system  includes two components: a to-do list server module  and a content delivery module . The to-do list server module  generally provides instructions for the user device . The instructions direct the user device  to retrieve items and perform other operations. The content delivery module  allows the user device  to obtain the items identified in the instructions received from the to-do list server module .","More specifically, in a first phase of information retrieval, the to-do list server module  sends a notification message to the user device . As described above, in one illustrative implementation, the to-do list server module  may send the notification message as a telephone ring. The user device  responds to the notification message by waking up (if \u201casleep\u201d), which may involve switching from a first power state to a second power state (where the second power state consumes more power than the first power state). The user device  may optionally respond to the notification message without formally answering the signal, which avoids or reduces a fee associated with the wireless message.","The user device  may then contact the to-do list server module  to request instructions from the to-do list server module . More specifically, for each user device, the to-do list server module  maintains a list of entries, also referred to herein as a \u201cto-do queue.\u201d An entry provides an instruction for a user device to perform an action. As will be described in greater detail below, there are different instructions that a device may be directed to perform, wherein a collection of instructions defines an IPS-device interaction protocol. One such action (e.g., associated with a GET instruction of the protocol) directs the user device  to retrieve an item from a specified location by specifying an appropriate network address (e.g., a URL) and appropriate arguments.","In a first phase of the downloading procedure, the user device  may retrieve n such entries, wherein n is an integer. In one scenario, the number n may be a subset of a total number of items in the to-do queue associated with the user device . In a second phase of the downloading procedure, the user device  may contact the content delivery module  to retrieve one or more items identified in the GET-related entries.","In general, after receiving the notification message (which may be implemented as a telephone ring), the item delivery system  may interact with the user device  in a data mode, e.g., using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or some other protocol or combination of protocols.","The IPS  may also include a merchant store module . The merchant store module  may provide access to an item catalog , which, in turn, may provide information regarding a plurality of items (such as eBooks, audio books, subscription related items, testing content, and so on). As will be described in greater detail below, the merchant store module  may include functionality allowing a user to search and browse though the item catalog . The merchant store module  may also include functionality allowing a user to purchase items (or, more generally, acquire items based on any terms).","In one case, a user may interact with the merchant store module  via the user device  using wireless communication. Alternatively, or in addition, the user may interact with the merchant store module  via another type of device , such as a personal computer, optionally via wired links. In either case, when the user purchases or otherwise acquires an item via the merchant store module , the IPS  may invoke the item delivery system  to deliver the item to the user.","The IPS  may also include a personal media library module . The personal media library module  may store, for each user, a list of the user's prior purchases. More specifically, in one case, the personal media library module  may provide metadata information regarding eBook items and other on-demand selections (e.g., \u201ca la carte\u201d selections, such as subscription issues, testing content, etc.) which a user already owns. The personal media library module  may also provide links to the items in the content store . As will be described in greater detail below, to download an eBook item (or the like) which the user has already purchased, the user device  contacts the content delivery module .","The content delivery module  may interact with permission information and linking information in the personal media library module  in order to download the item to the user. In one use scenario, the user device  may access the content delivery module  in this manner to initiate downloading of an item which has been previously purchased by the user but has been deleted by the user device  for any reason.","The IPS  may also include a browsing proxy module . The browsing proxy module  may allow the user to access one or more network-accessible resources  via a browser module (to be discussed below) resident on the user device . As explained in the context of , when the user requests access to a particular network-accessible resource, the system  may first direct the user to the browsing proxy module . The browsing proxy module  may then apply various environment-specific business rules to determine whether or not to grant such access, and if granted, under what terms to grant such access. Through this mechanism, in one implementation, the user may be precluded from directly accessing the network accessible resources  using the user device .","The IPS  may also include various security-related features, such as one or more authorization stores . The authorization stores  may provide information which enables various components of the IPS  to determine whether to allow the user to perform various functions, such as access the merchant store module , download items, change settings, and so on.","The above-enumerated list of modules is representative and is not exhaustive of the types of functions performed by the IPS . As indicated by the label \u201cOther Server-Side Functionality,\u201d the IPS  may include additional functions, many of which are described below.","Now turning to the device-side features of the system , the user device  may include a device to-do list processing module . The purpose of the device to do list processing module  may be to interact with the item delivery system  to download items from the item delivery system . Namely, in a first phase of the downloading procedure, the device to-do list processing module  may first receive a notification message from the to-do list server module , which prompts it to wake up (if \u201casleep\u201d) and contact the to-do list server module  to retrieve a set of n entries.","Each entry may include an instruction which directs the device to-do list processing module  to perform an action. In a second phase, for a GET-type entry, the device to-do list processing module  may contact the content delivery module  to request and retrieve an item identified by the GET-type entry. As will be described in greater detail below, the user device  may signal a successful completion of the download process or a failure in the download process.","Upon downloading an item, the user device  may store the item in a device side memory , which in one example is a flash-type memory and may be any other type of memory in other examples. Although not shown, the user device  may also exchange information with any other source of content . In one illustrative case, the other source of content  may represent a personal computer or other data processing device. Such other source of content  may transfer an item to the user device  via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection and\/or any other type(s) of connection(s). In this scenario, the other source of content , in turn, may receive the item from the IPS  (or other source) via hardwired connection (e.g., non-wireless connection). For example, to receive an audio book, the user may use a personal computer to non-wirelessly download the audio book from a network-accessible source of such content. The user may then transfer the audio book to the user device  via USB connection. In another illustrative case, the other source of content  may represent a portable memory module of any type, such as a flash type memory module, a magnetic memory module, an optical memory module, and so on.","The user device  may also include a reader module . The illustrative purpose of the reader module  is to present media items for consumption by the user using the user device . For example, the reader module  may be used to display an eBook to the user to provide a user experience which simulates the reading of a paper-based physical book.","The user device  may also include a content manager module . The purpose of the content manager module  is to allow the user to manage items available for consumption using the user device . For example, the content manager module  may allow the user to view a list of items available for consumption.","The content manager module  may also identify the sources of respective items: one such source corresponds to the device memory ; another source corresponds to an attached portable memory (e.g., represented by the other source ); another source corresponds to items identified in the personal media library module  (as may be revealed, in turn, by device-side metadata provided by the IPS ); another source corresponds to subscription-related items identified by the subscription module , and so on. The content manager module  may allow the user to filter and sort the items in various ways. For example, the user may selectively view items which originate from the device store .","The user device  may also include a store interaction module . The store interaction module  may allow the user device  to interact with the merchant store module . The user may engage the store interaction module  to search and browse through items, to purchase items, to read and author customer reviews, and so on. As described above, the user may also use a personal computer or the like to interact with the merchant store module  via hardwired links.","The above-enumerated list of modules is representative and is not exhaustive of the types of functions performed by the user device . As indicated by the label \u201cOther Device-Side Functionality,\u201d the user device  may include additional functions, many of which are described below. In fact,  shows additional device-side functionality. For completeness,  also identifies the various modules described above, including the device to-do list processing module , the device memory , the reader module , the content manager module , and the store interaction module . These features perform the functions described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["104","402","402","104","328","326","102"]},"As explained above, the browsing proxy module  may permit or deny access to the network-accessible resources  based on a set of environment-specific rules. If permitted access, the device-side browser module  includes functionality for interpreting the content received from a network-accessible source and presenting such content to the user.","The user device  may also include searching and indexing functionality . The indexing aspect of this functionality  provides a mechanism for indexing an item received from the IPS  and\/or for interacting with an index generated and supplied by the IPS  or by some other source. An index for a particular item (such as an eBook or newspaper edition) identifies the component parts (e.g., words) in the item, linking the component parts to their respective locations in the item. The searching aspect of the functionality  provides a mechanism for searching for identified components (e.g., words, phrases, etc.) in an item, and for performing other search-related functions. The searching aspect relies on the indexing aspect.","The user device  also may include an annotation module . The annotation module  allows a user to create annotations to supplement a particular item. For instance, the user may create one type of annotation to mark a page, thus acting in the manner of a bookmark. The user may create another type of annotation highlighting a portion of the item, such as a word, phrase, sentence, etc. in an eBook.","The user may create another type of annotation by adding one or more notes to an item. Generally, the annotation module  may store annotation information which identifies the types of annotations created, the locations within the item associated with the annotations, the content of the annotations (e.g., in the case of note-type annotations), and so on.","More specifically, the user device  may locally store the annotations. Further, the IPS  may optionally store the annotations in a backup store; this allows the user to download the annotations in the event they are deleted from a device-side store. Wherever stored, the user device  may restore the annotations upon presentation of the corresponding item which is the \u201ctarget\u201d or subject of the annotations. For example, when a user accesses an eBook which has been annotated on one or more prior occasions, the annotation module  may access the annotation information and display the user's annotations within the text. The annotation module  may also perform a related function allowing a user to identify and extract (e.g., \u201cclip\u201d) one or more portions of an item and store such portions in a clipping file. In one illustrative case, clippings are stored as unencrypted text files. In one case, the annotations can be associated with a particular entity, such as a user. Alternatively, or in addition, the annotations can be associated with a copy of the annotated item, such as an eBook.","The user device  may also include a home presentation module . The home presentation module  may provide a home page when the user first turns on the user device and\/or at other junctures. The home page may act as a general portal allowing a user to access media items and various features provided by the user device . In one illustrative case, the home page may present a summary of some (or all) of the items available for consumption using the user device .","The user device  may also include an audio play module . The audio player module  may provide an interface which allows the user to play back and interact with audio items, such as music, audio books and the like.","The above-described features of the user device  may pertain to applications with which the user may interact or which otherwise play a high-level role in the user's interaction with the user device . The user device  may include a number of other features to perform various lower-level tasks, possibly as background-type operations.","Power management functionality  performs one such background-type operation. More specifically, the power management functionality  corresponds to a collection of hardware and\/or software features operating to manage the power consumed by the user device . The power management functionality  generally operates to reduce the power consumed by the device . The power management functionality  achieves this goal by selectively powering down features not actively being used (or for which there is an assumption these features are not actively being used). The power management functionality  achieves particularly noteworthy power savings by powering down features which make large power demands, such as one or more features associated with wireless communication.","The user device  may also include performance Monitoring and Testing (MT) functionality . The MT functionality  maintains a performance log  identifying the behavior of the device . The IPS  and\/or other entities may access the performance log , along with other information gleaned from the communication infrastructure , to help diagnose anomalies in the operation of the user device  and the system  as a whole. The MT functionality  may also interact with testing functionality provided by the IPS  and\/or other entities. For example, the MT functionality  may respond to test probes generated by the IPS .","The user device  may also include an upgrade-related functionality . The upgrade-related functionality  allows the user device  to receive and integrate instruction-bearing update items (such as software updates). In one case, the upgrade-related functionality  may automatically receive instruction-bearing items provided by the IPS  (and\/or by other entities). An administrator at the IPS  may manually initiate the upgrade procedure by which an instruction-bearing update item is forwarded to the user device . Or an automated IPS-side routine may initiate the upgrade procedure. In any event, the user device may receive the instruction-bearing update item without the involvement of the user or with minimal involvement from the user. In this sense, the upgrade procedure may be viewed as \u201ctransparent.\u201d In another case, the upgrade-related functionality  may be operated by the user to manually access a source of instruction-bearing items (such as a prescribed website or the like) and download an item from this source.","In one implementation, the upgrade-related functionality  may forward version information to the IPS . The version information identifies the version of the instruction-bearing content being used by the user device . The IPS  may determine whether this version information is out-of-date (by reference to current version information). If out-of-date, the IPS  may react appropriately, e.g., by downloading an instruction-bearing item to the user device .","To repeat, the above-enumerated list of modules is representative and is not exhaustive of the types of functions performed by the user device . As indicated by the label \u201cOther Device-Side Functionality,\u201d the user device  may include additional functions.","The IPS  described above may interact with any type of user device . In one case, the user device  is a portable-type device, meaning a device designed to be readily carried from location to location. In one specific case, the user device  allows the user to consume the media items while holding the user device , e.g., in a manner which simulates the way a user might hold a physical book. A portable user device may take the form of an eBook reader device, a portable music player, a personal digital assistant, a mobile telephone, a game module, a laptop computer, and so forth, and\/or any combination of these types of devices. Alternatively, or in addition, the user device  may correspond to a device not readily portable, such as a personal computer, set-top box associated with a television, gaming console, and so on.","Without limitation,  shows one type of user device  which may be used to interact with the IPS . The user device  may include a wedge-shaped body designed to fit easily in the hands of a user, generally having the size of a paperback book. Other user devices may adopt different shapes and sizes.","In one representative design, the user device  includes two display parts: a main display part  and a supplemental display part . The main display part  presents various pages provided by the store interaction module , the reader module , the browser module , and so on. In one case, the supplemental display part  is used to present a cursor. The user may position the cursor to identify laterally adjacent portions in the main display part . Without limitation, in one illustrative case, the main display part  and\/or the supplemental display part  may be implemented using electronic paper technology, such as provided by E Ink Corporation of Cambridge, Mass. This technology presents information using a non-volatile mechanism; using this technology, the user device  may retain information on its display even when the device is powered off.","The user device  includes various input keys and mechanisms. A cursor-movement mechanism  allows a user to move a cursor within the supplemental display part . In one representative case, the cursor-movement mechanism  may include a cursor wheel that may be rotated to move a cursor up and down within the supplemental display part . The cursor-movement mechanism  may be configured to allow the user to make a selection by pressing down the wheel. Other types of selection mechanisms may be used, such as a touch-sensitive display, a series of vertically and\/or horizontally arrayed keys along the edge(s) of the main display part , one or more graphical scroll bar(s) in the main display part , a five-way controller or joystick, and so on.","The user device  also includes various page-turning buttons, such as next page buttons (, ) and a previous page button . The next page buttons (, ) advance the user to a next page in an item (relative to a page that is currently being displayed). The previous page  button advances the user to a previous page in an item (relative to a page that is currently being displayed). The user device  may also include a page-turning input mechanism  actuated by the user's thumb as it passes over the mechanism . This user experience simulates the manner in which a user turns a page in a physical book (e.g., by \u201cthumbing through\u201d a book). The user device  may also include a back button  allowing the user to advance to a previous page when using the browsing module . Although not shown, the user device  may include a switch for turning power on and off, a switch for enabling and disabling a wireless interface, and so on. The user device  may also include a keyboard . The keyboard  may include alphanumeric keys. The keys may be shaped and oriented in a manner which facilitates the user's interaction with the keys while the user holds the device  in the manner of a physical book. The user may use the keyboard  to enter search terms, annotations, URLs, and so forth. The user may also use the keyboard  to respond to testing content.
