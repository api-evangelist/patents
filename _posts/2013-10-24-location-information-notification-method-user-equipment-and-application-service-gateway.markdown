In this solution, outdoor coverage is performed by using a macro network, and indoor coverage is performed by a femto (Femto) network, thereby achieving the indoor coverage of the network signals.","In the uBro solution, if a user equipment (UE, User Equipment) used by a user is located indoors, the user equipment may be covered by both the Femto network and the macro network. Because tariffs of using these two networks by the user are different, considering the user's right to know, an operator needs to notify the user of a type of a currently used network thereof.","In the prior art, a location information notification method is mainly implemented by using a mobility management (MM, Mobility Management) information technology or an information technology of general packet radio service (GPRS, General Packet Radio Service) mobility management (GMM, GPRS Mobility Management). A specific process is roughly as follows:","When the UE enters a coverage area of the Femto network from a coverage area of the macro network or enters a coverage area of the macro network from a coverage area of the Femto network, a location area changes, and the UE initiates a location update process to a core network. In the location update process, the core network delivers MM information or GMM information to the UE. After receiving the MM information or the GMM information, the UE reads an identifier of a network on which the UE is currently located therefrom and displays the identifier of the network on a screen of the UE, so that the user is capable of learning the type of the currently used network.","To use the MM information or the GMM information, the UE needs to have an MM information interface or a GMM information interface. Currently, there are various UEs, and application-layer software that they use greatly differs. In a practical application, there is a relatively serious problem in compatibility of the MM information or the GMM information between different UEs.","Inventors of the present invention have performed a compatibility test on mobile phones of each mainstream mobile phone vendor on a current market. The test relates to 29 mobile phones of eight vendors. It can be seen from the test that 31.04% of the mobile phones do not support the MM information or the GMM information at all. In repeated test processes, 6.9% of the mobile phones display the information with probabilities, and 24.13% of the mobile phones have other problems, such as a display delay.","Therefore, in the prior art, the solution in which location information notification is implemented by using the MM information or the GMM information has a poor reliability and cannot accurately and effectively notify the user of location information.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a location information notification method, a user equipment, and an application service gateway that are capable of accurately and effectively notifying a user of location information.","A location information notification method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: acquiring, by a user equipment UE, current camping location information of the UE through an application programming interface API; performing, by the UE, matching between the current camping location information and a preset location information configuration table; and sending out, by the UE, corresponding prompt information according to a matching result.","A location information notification method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: receiving, by an application service gateway ASG, a configuration table acquiring request sent by a user equipment UE; and feeding back, by the ASG, a location information configuration table to the UE, where the location information configuration table is used to indicate a camping location information range of a femto Femto network.","A user equipment according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: a location information acquiring unit, configured to acquire current camping location information of the user equipment UE through an application programming interface API; a matching unit, configured to perform matching between the current camping location information acquired by the location information acquiring unit and a preset location information configuration table; and a prompting unit, configured to send out corresponding prompt information according to a matching result obtained by the matching unit.","An application service gateway according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: a receiving unit, configured to receive a configuration table acquiring request sent by a user equipment UE; and a responding unit, configured to feed back a location information configuration table to the UE, where the location information configuration table is used to indicate a camping location information range of a femto Femto network.","As can be seen from the preceding technical solutions, the embodiments of the present invention have the following advantages:","In the embodiments of the present invention, a UE may acquire current camping location information of the UE through an application programming interface (API, Application Program Interface), and then the UE may determine, according to a matching relationship between the camping location information and a preset location information configuration table, a network on which it is located and send out corresponding prompt information. Almost all UEs having an operating system include an API, and currently, usage specifications and related standard protocols of the API are relatively mature. Therefore, a process of acquiring the camping location information through the API interface is relatively reliable, and various UEs are capable of accurately and effectively notifying a user of location information.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a location information notification method, a user equipment, and an application service gateway that are capable of accurately and effectively notifying a user of location information.","Referring to , a location information notification method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"b":"101"},"In this embodiment, when the UE needs to prompt a user with a current camping network, the UE may acquire the current camping location information of the UE through its own API.","It should be noted that in this embodiment, the UE may locally acquire the current camping location information of the UE through the API and may also acquire the current camping location information of the UE from another network-side device through the API.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"b":"102"},"After acquiring the current camping location information of the UE, the UE may perform the matching between the camping location information and the preset location information configuration table.","In this embodiment, the preset location information configuration table may be used to indicate a camping location information range of a first network, and the UE may acquire the preset location information configuration table from an application service gateway (ASG, Application Service Gateway).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"b":"103"},"In this embodiment, after the matching is completed, the UE may send out the corresponding prompt information according to the matching result, which may be specifically as follows:","If the matching succeeds, the UE sends out first prompt information; and if the matching fails, the UE sends out second prompt information; and","the first prompt information may be used to indicate that the UE currently camps on the first network, and the second prompt information may be used to indicate that the UE currently camps on a second network.","In this embodiment, a UE may acquire current camping location information of the UE through an API, and then the UE may determine, according to a matching relationship between the camping location information and a preset location information configuration table, a network on which it is located and send out corresponding prompt information.

The information is processed by a radio interface layer (RIL, Radio Interface Layer) function of the Windows Mobile operating system and saved in a memory of the Windows Mobile terminal.","When the Windows Mobile terminal needs to prompt a user with a current camping network, the Windows Mobile terminal may directly invoke an API of the RIL function, so as to acquire the previously saved LAC and CELLID, or the Windows Mobile terminal may use other software\/functions to invoke the API of the RIL function, so as to acquire the previously saved LAC and CELLID.
