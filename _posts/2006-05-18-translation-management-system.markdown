title: Translation management system
abstract: A translation management system in a computer environment. A preferred embodiment of the invention automatically detects when a document, data stream, or non-text file in the master language has been updated and notifies the user which corresponding documents, data streams, or non-text files in the other languages require translation which are then staged and dynamically routed and sequenced to individual translation resources where the actual translation is performed. Management status, reporting, scheduling, and accounting information is sent to the user as the translation process ensues. The user is notified of the completion of translation and the invention coordinates the delivery of the translated documents, data streams, or non-text files back to the user's site for installation and optional review. The invention makes a variety of translation resources instantly available to the user which include both automated translation tools as well as human translators. The translation resources are connected to the invention using a flexible architecture that can be deployed on intranets as well as the Internet.

No. 10\/313,518, filed Dec. 5, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,207,005,which is a Continuation Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/239,495, filed on Jan. 28, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,526,426 which claims priority from Provisional Application No. 60\/075,740, filed on Feb. 23, 1998, which are each incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference made thereto.","1. Technical Field","The invention relates to the multilingual translation of documents in a computer environment. More particularly, the invention relates to the management of monolingual documents, data streams, non-text files, and databases to enable their translation into target languages in a computer environment.","2. Description of the Prior Art","The surge of growth in Internet access across the world has created the need for multilingual Web sites. The majority of Web sites are created in English which creates a problem for non-English speaking Internet users. This also creates a problem for Web site managers that maintain Web sites that are, or attempt to be, multilingual. The Web site content must be constantly maintained to be up to date and synchronized in all of the languages supported by the Web site.","One approach is shown in PCT International Publication Number WO97\/18516 of Flanagan et al., published on 22 May, 1997. This application integrates a machine translator in the end user's Web browser. The user selects the desired target language and the Web document retrieved by the browser is then translated by the machine translator. Unfortunately, errors occur in the translation and the appropriate content is not consistently displayed to the user.","An alternative implementation in the above application places pre-translated Web pages on a Web server. The Web server stores all of the translated Web pages locally. The Web site visitor sends a request to the Web server for a page in a specific language. The Web server searches for the pre-translated page that has been stored locally and sends it to the Web visitor's Web browser. This creates a storage and file management problem on the Web server because of the duplication of each entire page of the Web site.","Some search engines on the Internet offer an option to translate the hits that come back from a search query into different languages. The user initiates the translation through a menu selection. The translation is performed automatically by machine.","Japanese Pat. No. 9-114852 is a method for a search unit which takes a search string in a second foreign language and translates it into a first foreign language. The translated search string is used to search the original document which is in the first foreign language.","Japanese Pat. No. 9-44502 is a method wherein a document in a first foreign language is translated into a second foreign language. The two documents are then displayed separately or together through a user interface.","European Pat. No. 0376741B1 issued to Francisco on 18 Oct., 1995, is a method for displaying error messages on a document collating and envelope stuffing machine. Said error messages exist simultaneously in a plurality of languages and are displayed in the language specified by the user. This approach has storage and maintenance problems because each error message must be duplicated in its entirety for each language.","European Pat. Appl. No. EP0774722A2 of Microsoft Corporation published on 21 May 1997, is a method for an information retrieval system that separates the design and content components of a document page. Pages are created with controls that define areas for content to be inserted into said pages.","It would be advantageous to provide a translation management system that gives the user local control of the multilingual translation of electronic content. It would further be advantageous to provide a translation management system that allows the user to easily manage, schedule, and track translation resources and the content that are sent to the translation resources, thereby enhancing the maintainability of the system as a whole.","The invention provides a translation management system. The invention utilizes an intuitive user interface for managing document translation for multilingual Internet Web sites, documents, data streams, and non-text files, enabling the user to incrementally update the language content of a Web site or document and enhancing the maintainability and storage of multilingual electronic content.","A preferred embodiment of the invention automatically detects when a document, data stream, or non-text file in the master language has been updated and notifies the user which corresponding documents, data streams, or non-text files in the other languages require translation. The documents, data streams, or non-text files requiring translation are staged and dynamically routed and sequenced to individual translation resources where the actual translation is performed.","Management status, reporting, scheduling, and accounting information is sent to the user as the translation process ensues. The user is notified of the completion of translation and the invention coordinates the delivery of the translated documents, data streams, or non-text files back to the user's site for installation and optional review.","The invention makes a variety of translation resources instantly available to the user. These translation resources include both automated translation tools as well as human translators. The translation resources are connected to the invention using a flexible architecture that can be deployed on intranets as well as the Internet.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description in combination with the accompanying drawings, illustrating, by way of example, the principles of the invention.","The invention is embodied in a translation management system for computer applications. A system according to the invention provides an intuitive user interface for managing document content translation for multilingual Internet Web sites, documents, data streams, and non-text files, enabling the user to incrementally update the language content of a Web site or document and automatically initiate the translation of the content into the corresponding target languages, keeping the multilingual content synchronized and enhancing its maintainability and storage. Many existing application programs use approaches that make it difficult for the user to manage the translation and synchronization of multilingual content.","A preferred embodiment of the invention provides a comprehensive suite of three modules that allow a user to build, operate and maintain a multilingual Web site easily and efficiently. The invention enhances an existing Web site by adding advanced multilingual content management and process control capabilities to the customer's Web server. It also uses standard and open interfaces thus enabling the invention to work with all Web servers on supported platforms.","Each module is easy to set up and does not require special modifications to the Web site. The invention provides an easy migration path from early-stage customers who are only interested in measuring overseas visitor traffic to more sophisticated customers who need to manage the rapid translation of changing content on large, distributed multilingual Web sites.","Referring to , the invention provides three components. The Visitor module , the Developer module, and the Workflow Manager module . Each module accesses one or more language and country databases and file systems . The Visitor , Developer , and Workflow Manager  modules can operate in the same environment or in a standalone mode.","The Visitor module greatly enhances the multilingual Web site visitor's experience by providing an automated and seamless way to serve content in the correct language. Web site publishers can serve all their multilingual content through a single point of entry using the Visitor module. Web site visitors will immediately understand the information they see when they enter a site because it will be instantly presented in their language and for their country.","With respect to , the Visitor module  works in tandem with a customer's existing Web server . It automatically determines the language and country of a Web site visitor and directs the Web server  to deliver the appropriate localized content contained in one or more country\/language databases and\/or file-based content in a file system  to the visitor's browser . Recently accessed localized content is placed into a Cache . The content is placed in the Cache  so that if a similar request comes in for a document in that language and for that country, then the cached version will be pushed out to the browser . This saves time and processor overhead for accessing the database and file system  to rebuild the requested content. In addition, Visitor  informs the browser  of the proper font and content encoding needed to display the selected language and enables the browser  to download the font using, for example, Bitstream's TrueDoc technology, if required.","The Visitor module intercepts input text that is submitted using an HTML form (e.g., a customer feedback form), and writes it into a form database , in a manner so that it is easily translated later via the Workflow Manager. Most Web sites have forms that allow site visitors to submit comments or request more information from the site host. This feedback might not be in English and would otherwise be incomprehensible to the recipient in a multilingual environment.","The form database  includes sufficient information to identify the country, language and encoding of the text to properly interpret it for subsequent translation. Furthermore, the invention includes a novel database viewer which allows the translated content to be viewed in the context of the form in which it was originally entered.","Referring to , the Visitor module determines the Web site visitor's language and country  from one or more of the following criteria:\n\n","The Visitor module supports content in all languages and encodings, including Unicode. Manual language selection is easily implemented through the use of a special command set described later in this document thus eliminating the need for complex CGI scripts or interlinked pages. The required content for the Web site visitor's language and country is checked to see if has been previously requested and resident in the cache . If the content is in the cache, then it is delivered from the cache .","If the required content is not in the cache, then the Web server is notified of the appropriate localized content required . The appropriate content is then placed into the cache for future reference . The Web site visitor's country and language preferences are recorded in the server log . The enhanced Web server log gives the site manager a detailed breakdown of country and language for visitors to the Web site. Finally, the browser is notified of the proper display font and allowed to download the font .","Input text that is submitted using an HTML form is intercepted . The text is converted to an internal format  and is placed in the forms database  for later translation.","The Developer module enables the Web site developer to build a single \u2018master\u2019 site which is subsequently displayed in any number of languages, compared with conventional methods whereby the site is re-engineered for each language.","Referring to , the Developer module contains all of the features of the Visitor module  which records the Web site visitor's country and language preferences in the server log .","A toolkit  is provided which allows a master site to be built that is language and country-independent. The actual language content is placed in a language and country database and\/or file system  where it is easily managed and maintained. When a visitor enters the site, the requested document is automatically served in the visitor's language and for the visitor's country by filling in a document template from the master site with the correct language and country content from one or more databases.","This structure makes the site more compact, reduces site resource requirements and lowers the cost of operating the site.","The cost of making a design change is also reduced as only the master site needs to be updated. This is in contrast to the more time-consuming and expensive approach of propagating a single change throughout all language versions of the site which is unnecessary with the invention.","Keeping the translated content in a database  also makes it extremely easy and cost-effective to add additional languages to the site. Adding a language simply involves translating the appropriate content and creating new entries in the database . The Developer module makes it unnecessary to replicate the entire site for each new language and country as would typically be the case.","The toolkit  offers the multilingual Web designer a great deal of flexibility. It allows a site to be built which combines content common to all languages with content that is specific to a particular language and country. For example, company-wide information which needs to be served in all languages is easily combined with regional-specific information that may only be required in a single language.","The invention provides special tags that are used to insert language or country-specific content into an HTML document. The tags are: Multi-country server-side includes (MCSSI); and Multi-language server-side includes (MLSSI). MCSSI allows locale-specific elements of an HTML document to be dynamically included as a function of the current region or country, while MLSSI allows localized elements of an HTML document to be included as a function of the current language.","The Developer module also supports the incremental construction of a multilingual Web site through a feature that makes it unnecessary to fully populate the site's language matrix completely with documents. If a requested document does not exist (i.e., it has not been translated into the requested language), the invention automatically retrieves the document in the next most appropriate language for the visitor, or the default language of the document, as specified by the Web site manager. Documents can exist on separate servers and\/or databases.","The invention walks down a priority list of languages for a designated country. If a document in the language that is first on the priority list is not present on the server, it then looks for the next most appropriate language. The list is sorted according to the most prevalent language or dialect for a particular country. For example, the languages entries for Egypt are {arabic, french, english, berber}. A visitor from Egypt will be presented with a requested document in Arabic, if it is available. If it is not, the system will look for one in French, and so on.","When a visitor is presented with content in an alternate language, an informational text message can be included telling the visitor that the preferred language was not available. The informational text is supplied in the most recently valid language for the visitor's country and language and is embedded within Javascript code. The Javascript code is embedded within the HTML stream that is sent back to the server. The HTML \u201cbody\u201d tag has an optional attribute where Javascript code can be inserted after the tag. The informational text contained within the Javascript code is in english and enclosed within the appropriate system tags described below, enabling it to be replaced with its translation in the most recently valid language of the visitor. The informational text has been pretranslated into all of the languages in the system database for the customer. This allows easy access to the appropriate translation for the informational text based on the most recently valid language for the visitor's country and language.","This allows a multilingual Web site to be built incrementally, such that only a portion of the documents on the site need be translated and documents not available in a requested language will be served in the next most appropriate language for a Web site visitor.","This also gives the customer the option of translating only a subset of the total content on the site. The Developer module controls all aspects of content navigation and delivery for the entire site so that a visitor will always be served in the most appropriate language, based on what language content is actually available on the server. The visitor will never see an error message (i.e. a \u201c404\u2014document not found\u201d) because the requested content is not available in the visitor's language.","Regions are mapped and organized according to the Web site's needs. For example, a mutli-user server can have a separate region definition for each user's site. The regions file organizes the regions, countries, and languages that the user is concerned with and is configured by the user. The user sets up a mapping, for example, one user can have information specific to Italy and another user can have information that is just concerned with the European region and is not concerned with Italy. This approach allows a hierarchical region-based lookup scheme. Content is hierarchically stored as country and language independent elements such that a one-to-many and many-to-one mapping exists between country and language. The advantage to this approach is that there is no content duplication; the user has only as many files in the system as he has unique content.","With respect to , the toolkit  also features a novel mechanism to create localized content for specific geographic regions or countries by using a template-based approach to dynamically create documents tailored for a specific language or country. This feature makes it easy to create a true global site localized for each area of the world with the smallest achievable site footprint on the Web server .","A template contains placeholders for country and language-specific information that has been removed from a document. This information is dynamically inserted from a TermDB  (an external glossary), another template or document located in a database or file system , or provided automatically by the Developer module  when the composite document is presented to the browser .","The basic approach to creating a template has two steps. First, remove as much country and language-specific information as possible from a document. Then, replace this information with appropriate tags and commands specific to the invention and described later in this document.","The advantage to using templates is that a single document can easily support many languages and countries. For example, a single form or CGI-generated document can be constructed so that it will be automatically localized for different languages and locales. This significantly reduces the number of documents that have to be maintained on the site and makes it very easy to add new languages. It also allows a single update to a document to be immediately propagated to all languages and countries.","This technique allows country or regional content to be conveniently separated from the structure of the document, thereby making it easy to change a design often by updating a single file. This in turn eliminates the ripple effect often seen when a single change must propagate through all of the localized documents on the site. This allows the Web Server  to control the locale-independent templates , language-specific elements , country-specific elements , and static HTML content .","Visitors to a multilingual Web site may wish to enter information and feedback into a fill-out form in their local language to send back to the Web site manager. A mechanism is provided, and described above, which facilitates the acquisition and translation of this information. The Developer module captures and tags all such information in a sufficient manner so it can be subsequently translated and analyzed by the customer.","This approach allows a site to be built with minimal effort and cost, and allows the site to grow over time to meet the exact needs of the customer.","Referring to , the Workflow Manager module enables the Web site manager to orchestrate the creation of foreign language versions of the site and to automatically keep them synchronized and up-to-date, cost-effectively and with minimal effort. The Workflow Manager module provides a Manager's Console , access to a Workflow Pipeline , and customizable Translation Resources . Translation queues  hold the incoming translated documents and outgoing documents to be translated. Documents, data streams, and non-text content are stored in one or more language and country databases and\/or file systems . Data streams and non-text content are considered documents in the following text.","A brief summary of the duties of the three primary components are:\n\n","The Workflow Manager module is the core component of the invention. The module allows the Web site manager, with no prior linguistic experience, to effortlessly manage the traditionally complex process of translating and updating a multilingual Web site.","The Workflow Manager module provides a natural migration path beyond the Visitor and Developer modules. The Visitor and Developer modules provide a solution to efficiently serve and organize content on a multilingual Web site. The Workflow Manager completes the product family by enabling the language content on the site to be kept up-to-date, efficiently and cost-effectively.","The Web's very nature is dynamic. A monolingual Web site must be updated frequently to remain current. A multilingual Web site has an even more demanding problem of requiring all languages to be updated and synchronized simultaneously. Using traditional techniques, the cost and time required to perform this update and synchronization exceed the benefit and lifetime of the newly updated information to be served, effectively rendering the Web site useless. The Workflow Manager provides a solution to this paradox by reducing the cost and time requirement for language update and synchronization dramatically, thereby ensuring that information on the Web site is always current, regardless of language.","The Manager's Console is the user interface for the Workflow Manager and is the primary point of interaction for the Web site manager.","Referring to , the Manager's Console detects when a document in the master language has been updated . It then notifies the Web site manager which corresponding documents in the other languages require translation . The Manager's Console provides \u201cone-touch\u201d translation, whereby at the click of a button, documents from any source requiring translation are converted to the internal format , staged down the Workflow Pipeline  then dynamically routed and sequenced to the individual Translation Resources where the actual translation is performed. Documents may be Web based and non-Web based and may also contain non-text elements. The documents may contain or refer to additional dependent components such as graphics, audio, video, and other multi-media elements.","When the Web site manager initiates the translation process, the newly updated master language document and its constituent elements, together with associated control information will be converted by the Console to an internal format, one which is more suitable for information transport over the Workflow Pipeline .","The Manager's Console automatically controls the sequencing and selection of Translation Resources during workflow processing according to subject matter of the document to be processed, target language of the translation, quality level (whether draft-only or high quality is required) and other variables. The Web site manager can also individually specify the use of a specific set of Translation Resources.","The Manager's Console provides management status and reporting as the translation process ensues . It then automatically notifies the Web site manager of the document translation completion and coordinates the delivery of the translated documents back to the Web site for installation and optional review . The Web site manager can directly install the translated documents back onto the active area of the Web site at the click of a button, or can make them available for internal review within the organization.","Status information is presented through a highly usable interface that facilitates interaction and improves the productivity of the Web site manager. The Console interface is designed to allow translation and update of the multilingual Web site to be performed cost-effectively and with minimal effort by a non-specialist.","New languages are easily added to the site as well. The Web site manager simply selects the new language from a pulldown list , and the Manager's Console automatically initiates the translation of documents into the desired language, under the control of the Web site manager . The documents are converted to the internal format used by the invention  and staged down the Workflow Pipeline .","The Manager's Console also has a built-in access and version control system which allows it to be easily integrated with a third-party authoring or document management system on the Web site.","With respect to , a task view of the Manager's Console is shown. The Update Status module  updates the Web site manager of the document translation status. The Complete Document module  retrieves the translated document and its constituent or dependent components from the Translation queues  and updates the associated document status information. The document delivery to the Web site manager is then coordinated by the Coordinate Document Delivery module .","Documents that need to be translated are extracted from the language and country databases and file systems  and are sent to Translation Queues . The Project Analyzer module  receives project components, in the form of documents and other electronic content from the Translation Queues  and analyzes the project in sufficient detail to determine project cost and resource requirements.","The Project Analyzer module  waits until all elements of a project have been received. It then sends the Scheduler module  a description of the project and instructs the Scheduler module  to begin the project. Typically, the Project Analyzer module  works with the Accounting Manager module  to generate a project cost estimate prior to beginning the project.","Once the Scheduler module  receives the project information from the Project Analyzer module , it creates Work Packets, Job Tickets and a Project Schedule. A single project consists of a set of Work Packets and associated Job Tickets. Each Job Ticket contains a reference to a Translation Resource. A set of Job Tickets is associated with a single Work Packet and describes the activities to be performed by that Work Packet. The Scheduler module  generates a Schedule that is sent to the Manager's Console for review and validation. The documents and their constituent or dependent components are then scheduled and sent down to the Workflow Pipeline.","The Scheduler module  updates the Project Schedule  and notifies the Accounting Manager module  during the course of the project. This permits the Project Schedule  to be adjusted when there are changes in the availability of Translation Resources, or when manual changes are made to the project by an operator via the Manager's Console.","The Accounting Manager module  updates customer and Translation Resource accounting in the Accounting Database  as jobs complete. The Accounting Manager module  generates project cost estimates (based on input from the Project Analyzer module ), handles customer billing, and is responsible for generating purchase orders for Translation Resources, when needed.","Completed documents and their constituent or dependent components that have been checked by the Web site manager are then installed in one or more language and country databases and\/or file systems  by the Monitor Database Documents module .","The Workflow Pipeline is a transport layer that delivers documents and their constituent or dependent components requiring translation to the Translation Resources where the actual work is performed. The Workflow Pipeline is heavily instrumented so that status and tracking of ongoing work is instantly conveyed to the Web site manager on the Manager's Console.","The Workflow Pipeline uses a highly configurable architecture allowing a variety of Translation Resources to be instantly available to the Web site manager. These Translation Resources include both automated translation tools as well as human translators.","Translation Resources are connected to the Pipeline using an open Application Programming Interface (API) known as an Adaptor. Adaptors allow a variety of Translation Resources to be connected to the Pipeline, making it easy to tailor the Workflow Manager to meet a customer's requirements. The flexible Pipeline architecture can be deployed on intranets as well as the Internet.","Referring to , Generators  are provided that convert the internal format document that is used within the Pipeline to the appropriate format required by the Translation Resource. The Adaptors  invoke the specific generator for the appropriate Translation Resource . Each Adaptor accepts the internal format document, sends the document to the appropriate Generator  which converts the format to one that is acceptable to the Translation Resource  attached to the Adaptor . The Generator  sends the newly formatted document to the Adaptor  which in turn sends it to the Translation Resource . When the document has been translated by the Translation Resource , the Adaptor  accepts the document and its associated information, and invokes a Parser  which converts the document back into the internal format. The Parser  distributes the packet back up the Pipeline.","Parsers are also invoked whenever a document is extracted from the Translation queues and sent down the Pipeline. The Parser converts the document into the internal format. Generators are, in a similar manner, invoked whenever a translated document is posted back onto the Translation queues after completion of translation. The Generator converts the internal format document back to the document's original format (e.g., HTML). The document is then sent to the final destination.","With respect to , the Adaptor converts work packets to the appropriate Translation Resource format . The packets are then routed to the appropriate Translation Resource .","The Adaptor also receives packets from Translation resources . The packet is converted back to the work packet format  and the status and control information in the work packet is updated . The Manager's Console is then notified of the work packet's availability  in the translation queue.","This degree of flexibility allows new translation technologies and translation service providers to be quickly integrated into the workflow process. Additional resources are easily allocated to accommodate sites which require frequent update and synchronization.","Referring to , a task view of the Adaptor is shown. The Convert to Translation Resource module  converts work packets to the appropriate Translation Resource format that is understood by the resource. The packets are then routed to the Translation Resource by the Route Packet module .","Packets are received by the Receive Packet module . The Convert\/Update Packet module  performs the packet conversion back to the work packet format and updates the packet's status and control information. It then notifies the Manager's Console that the work packet is available in the translation queue.","The Workflow Pipeline together with the Translation Resources allow the translation process to proceed rapidly and efficiently.","Translation Resources are centralized or distributed functional blocks which are connected to the Workflow Pipeline where the actual work, including translation, is performed. A typical workflow process will use one or more Translation Resources in a specified sequence to complete the required work.","A Translation Resource performs translation or other linguistic functions on a set of input documents and their constituent or dependent components and produces a set of output documents that have been transformed linguistically.","The Workflow Pipeline connects to any type of Translation Resource.","Four examples of Translation Resources are:\n\n","Machine translation is software which provides fully automatic, draft-quality translations.","Translation memory systems provide a database of source\/target translation pairs for a particular document. When an updated version of a document needs to be translated, the translation memory can be used to pre-translate the document with translations from the previous version of the document.","Human translators are linked to the Workflow Pipeline through a special Adaptor that connects to the Internet or a customer's intranet. This allows any translator, anywhere in the world, to join a virtual translation team and provide translation services to multilingual Web sites or any other translation application serviced by the invention.","Terminology management systems provide functions that are necessary to support the entire translation process, such as automated generation and retrieval of client-specific glossaries and lexicons. Both human-based as well as technology-based Translation Resources require access to appropriate glossaries and lexicons to ensure that linguistic transformations are performed in the correct terminological domain.","Technology-based Translation Resources are easily upgraded as their technology improves. For example, older machine translation or translation memory systems are replaced with newer systems simply by unplugging the old systems and plugging in the new ones through the Adaptors on the Workflow Pipeline.","The Manager's Console provides the Web site manager with fully automated management of the entire translation process. The following is a description of how the Web site manager interacts with the Manager's Console in the process of keeping a site up-to-date.","With respect to , when the site is current and all language content is up-to-date, the Manager's Console  reports to the Web site manager  that no action is required.","If a document in the master language is subsequently updated\u2014perhaps out-of-date product information on the Web site is being updated\u2014the Console  will immediately alert the Web site manager  that the corresponding foreign language versions of the document are out-of-date and need to be re-translated.","From this point, the Web site manager simply clicks on a button, using the Console's  \u201cone-touch\u201d translation feature, to automatically initiate the re-translation and update of each document. No additional action is required from the Web site manager  until the documents have been translated and are ready to be mounted back onto the site.","When the Web site manager  initiates the translation process, the newly updated master language document together with associated control information will be converted by the Console  to an internal format, one which is more suitable for information transport over the Workflow Pipeline . The converted document together with relevant control and status information is known as a work packet. The Workflow Pipeline  is responsible for sending and receiving work packets to an appropriate set of Translation Resources , ,  where they are processed.","The sequence in which the Translation Resources are engaged by the Pipeline is pre-determined according to:\n\n","When a work packet is dispatched to a Translation Resource  for processing, the packet first flows from the translation queues , through the Pipeline Adaptor for that Resource where it is converted from the Workflow's internal format into one that can be processed by that Resource.","Once the Translation Resource  has finished its processing, the packet which contains the work completed by the Translation Resource  flows back through the Adaptor where it is re-converted back into the Pipeline's internal format. The Adaptor is also responsible for analyzing the completion status of the Translation Resource and updating the packet's control and status information accordingly.","A simplified example of a typical workflow sequence is shown below.\n\n","Since the Pipeline  is heavily instrumented, the Console  gives the Web Site manager  continuous updates on the progress of the translation. The Console  also uses status information to automatically provide dynamic dispatch and control decisions to achieve the fastest and most cost-effective turnaround time.","After completion of the workflow sequence, the translated documents are routed back to the Console  where the Web site manager  is notified of their completion. From there, the Web site manager  can directly install the translated documents back onto the active area of the Web site , file system (local or remote), or database (local or remote) at the click of a button, or can make them available for internal review within the organization. For example, when the translated documents are installed onto the active area of the Web site , they are referenced by the appropriate language HTML commands , , , , ,  inserted into the Web site pages and the translated content is removed from the translated documents and stored back in the database.","New languages are easily added to the Web site. The Web site manager simply needs to select the new language from a pulldown list along with the desired documents on the Manager's Console and the necessary steps will be automatically invoked to initiate the translation.","The invention provides the Web site manager with an effortless way of keeping the site up-to-date.","One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that, although the invention has been described in the context of Web sites, the same concept applies to other applications. For example, in a fax application, documents are scanned and sent through the invention for translation into selected languages. The translated documents are then automatically faxed to selected locations. Another example would be a universal translator where spoken words are converted into a data stream and sent through the invention for translation into designated languages. The translated data stream is converted back into audible speech and sent to the designated audiences.","The invention is scalable to provide multilingual presentation and management functions across multiple servers in a distributed environment. For example, some sites might have English content on one server, Japanese on another, and so on. Each server will have installed on its respective site, an instance of the invention communicating with other instances of the invention throughout the system. One server is designated the master, and the others are slaves for the purpose of managing content. The servers communicate over a dedicated interface allowing content to be managed in a distributed fashion. This configuration also supports mirrored sites across multiple servers.","One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that, although a single user system is specifically mentioned, the same concept applies to multi-user systems, for example, a multi-user configuration would be appropriate for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that serves multiple customers, with and without multilingual sites, from a single instance of the invention.","The following is an excerpt of a user manual describing the Visitor and Developer modules for a preferred embodiment of the invention called \u201cWebPlexer\u201d:","3. Detailed Functional Description","The following sections are ordered beginning with basic functions and gradually progressing to those that are more advanced. Similar functions have been grouped together logically for easy reading.","3.1 Communication Ports","WebPlexer has 3 network ports. These ports are used to communicate with the client, the Web server, and the console. The ports can be assigned to any available port number on your system and are specified in WebPlexer's WP_Config file.","The 3 ports are:\n\n","Port numbers are assigned starting at 1. Lower numbers are reserved for dedicated processes like ftp(), http(), and telnet(). The lower numbered ports are also privileged in that they require root-level authority to use.","For testing, we recommend choosing an available port with a number of at least 3000.","3.1.1 Operating Modes","WebPlexer's InternetPort and ServerPort are configured to support two modes of operation, \u2018test mode\u2019 and \u2018production mode\u2019.","3.1.1.1 Test Mode","In test mode, a separate access path is created for clients to send requests to WebPlexer. Normal http requests to port  and the existing Web server are not affected. This permits off-line testing of WebPlexer functionality until the site has been validated.","To configure test mode:\n\n","To access the Web server via WebPlexer, you would type a URL of the form:\n\n","Normal requests of the form:\n\n","You can make WebPlexer available to ordinary port  users, even in test mode, by including a special link on a page to send a request to WebPlexer's port.","For example,\n\n","In production mode, WebPlexer is configured to process all http requests before they reach the Web server. This would normally be done once off-line testing was completed and the site was ready to go into production.","To configure production mode:\n\n","Normal requests of the form:\n\n","You can still access the Web server directly, with a URL of the form:\n\n","InternetPort is set by editing the line:\n\n","This setting can also be overridden by a command line flag.

Please see Section 3.11, \u201cRuntime Options,\u201d for more information.","3.2 Logs","WebPlexer supports 3 types of logs:\n\n","The filenames of these logs are defined in the WP_Config file. Additional information on how to define the log files can be found in Chapter 4, \u201cContents of WebPlexer Files.\u201d","NOTE: A fourth log, the Usage Log is generated by the updtusage tool that analyzes the Information Log. This tool will be included in a future release.","The function of each log is described below. A detailed specification can be found in Section 4.4, \u201cLog Specifications.\u201d","3.2.1 AccessLog","The AccessLog records information about each request received by WebPlexer, such as date, time, and request type. WebPlexer command requests (WPCommands) are also logged.","NOTE: When WebPlexer is configured for \u201cproduction mode\u201d (see Section 3.1.1.2, \u201cProduction Mode\u201d), WebPlexer's Access Log should be used in place of the Web server's access log for analysis and auditing purposes (the Web server's access log will show all requests originating from WebPlexer).","Examples of AccessLog entries are:\n\n","The InformationLog contains detailed information about WebPlexer's language selection processing for each request.","Examples of InformationLog entries are:\n\n","The ErrorLog shows any errors that occurred during WebPlexer operation, or during the processing of a request.","Examples of ErrorLog entries are:\n\n","The UsageLog contains a summary of country and language statistics. It is generated from the InformationLog using the usage log analysis tool. The UsageLog can be further processed using the visits log analysis tool.

Please see Section 3.9.2, \u201cSPAMM (Sparse Matrix Manager),\u201d for more information on this feature.","3.3.2 Setting Up Language Selection","WebPlexer's Language Selection feature is enabled by editing a few lines in the WP_Map file, located in the main WebPlexer directory. Once the file has been set up, any of the language selection modes (browser-specified, automatic, manual) are available.","The information that needs to be entered in the WP_Map file is:\n\n","These four pieces of information together make up what is known as a \u201cURL group\u201d declaration.","Often a single server will serve multiple sites.

Please refer to the example WP_Map file supplied with this release while reading the following sections.","3.3.2.1 Specifying the Top-Level URL","The top-level URL is specified by adding lines of the form\n\n","to the WP_Map file.","where",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0179","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0036","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0036-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0037","list-style":"none"},"li":"<path>"}}}},"is the directory path of the top-level URL below the htdoc root.\n\n","is either \u2018d\u2019 or \u2018f\u2019 depending on whether the path is a directory or a file.","NOTE: In the current implementation, when a directory is specified, it is also necessary to specify the corresponding top-level file as well (usually index.html).","In the previous example, there would be two lines reading:\n\n","Note that this file (\/joe\/index.html) does not actually exist in the document hierarchy but should match the URL the user will type when entering the site.","If the selected language were French, the URL mappings would be:\n\n","The language-to-directory map and charset (document encoding) are specified by adding lines of the form:\n\n","is the name of the language. Please see Appendix B., \u201cList of Available Languages,\u201d for a list of which languages are available for this release.\n\n","is the name of the subdirectory containing documents of that language.\n\n","is the encoding used for documents in that language (e.g. ISO-8859-1)","In the previous example, these lines would read:\n\n","The local default languages tell WebPlexer which language to use in case the requested language is not available on the server.","There are two local default languages that need to be specified. The first is called \u201cothers\u201d and the second is simply called \u201cdefault\u201d.","The \u201cothers\u201d language is chosen when the requested language is valid but does not exist on the server.","For example, if English, French, and Spanish documents exist on the server, but the requested language is Russian, WebPlexer will use the language defined as \u201cothers\u201d.","The \u201cdefault\u201d language is chosen when WebPlexer cannot determine the language of a request and none has been specified by the browser. This can happen when the country of origin cannot be determined because the hostname is unavailable, for example, when the requester is behind a firewall.","These directories are specified by including the following lines in the WP_Map file:\n\n","It is usually the case that \u201cothers\u201d and \u201cdefault\u201d are both set to English.","In the example above, these lines would read:\n\n","The next sections describe the language selection algorithms in more detail.","3.3.3 Browser-Specified Language Selection","In browser-specified language selection, the browser sends its language preference along with the http request. The language is set through a preference or option setting in the browser. The preference is sent to WebPlexer in the \u201cAccept-Language\u201d header within the request message.","The Accept-Language header is described in the http specification. The specification allows the browser to send more than one language in the header. The group of languages is ordered with the most desirable language first.","WebPlexer uses the Accept-Language header to select the correct language. The header is only used when the request is to a URL that matches the top-level URL given in the WP_Map file (see Section 4.2.1, \u201cSpecifying the Top-Level URL\u201d).","For example, if the top-level URL were \/joe, and the browser preference were set to Spanish, a request to:\n\n","would cause the URL to be mapped to:\n\n","and sent to the Web server.","If the browser has specified more than one language, WebPlexer goes through the languages in order and stop when it finds the first one that is present on the server if none of the languages are found, WebPlexer uses the \u201cothers\u201d language specified in the WP_Map file (see Section 4.2.2.1, \u201cothers:\u201d)","Once the language has been determined, WebPlexer redirects the browser to the directory for that language. All accesses to relative links within the requested document stay within that directory.","Changing the browser's language preference does not have any effect until the top-level URL is again requested and the browser re-enters the site. The recommended way to change language within a language directory is by manual selection (see Section 3.3.5, \u201cManual Language Selection\u201d).","Browser-specified language selection has the highest priority upon entry to the site.","3.3.4 Automatic Language Selection","In automatic language selection, WebPlexer determines the language by first determining the country from the requester's domain, then looking up the language for that country in a database.","Automatic language selection is only active under the following two conditions.\n\n","NOTE: If the browser has specified a language preference, it overrides any automatic language selection.","For example, if the top-level URL were \/joe, and the host domain were eiffel.tower.fr, a request to:\n\n","The country-to-language database contains a list of languages for each country.","These languages are arranged in order of frequency from most-used to least-used.","This list of languages is processed in the same way as preferred languages are handled when received from a browser (see Section 3.3.3, \u201cBrowser-Specified Language Selection\u201d). This means that the languages are examined until the first one present on the server is found.","For example, the languages of Switzerland are german, {french, italian, romansch} and will be searched in that order. The rules for selecting the local default languages are the same as for browser-specified languages, if the language cannot be found.","3.3.5 Manual Language Selection","Manual language selection is effective at any time. Manual language selection overrides any automatic or browser-specified language.","Manual language selection is performed by issuing a WPCommand whose type is \u201clanguage\u201d. WPCommands are more fully described in Section","3.6.3.3, \u201cWPCommands.\u201d They result in the browser sending a request to WebPlexer of the form:\n\n","NOTE: language (plus country) means that the language directory is appended with the currently selected country (e.g. english_United-States)","Note that even with manual language selection, the languages and directories in the WP_Map file still need to be set up as in automatic language selection.","3.3.6 Cookie-Based Language Selection","3.3.6.1 Using WPCommand?language","WPCommands are normally issued through hypertext links embedded in an HTML document. This statement illustrates a simple example,\n\n","If the user is currently looking at an English document, clicking on the word \u2018French\u2019 will cause the browser to send WebPlexer a request for the URL\n\n","The manual language selection feature is performed completely by WebPlexer, without the need for CGI scripts or complex interlinking of HTML documents. It merely requires the addition of a link in the HTML to send the WPCommand to WebPlexer for each desired language.","The WPCommand hypertext link can be used like any other HTML link, that is, it can be placed within a table, connected to a graphic or icon, or built into an imagemap.","3.3.6.2 Using WPCommand?link","The method described above works well when the number of languages is small. However, as the number of languages on the server increases, there may not be enough space to have the links for all the languages appear on each page.","In this case, a generic mechanism exists for handling WPCommands that will move all of the language selection links off to a separate page. Once the links are moved, a hypertext link that points to this special language selection page is placed on each page of your site.","Because of the need to return to the originating page when the language is changed, WebPlexer requires that a special WPCommand be used to invoke the link to the change language page.","This WPCommand is of type \u2018link\u2019 and takes the name of the page to link to as an argument. Its external behavior is the same as if a direct HTML link were used, except it notifies WebPlexer that a change language (or change country) WPCommand is about to be issued.","This allows WebPlexer to return the browser to the originating page once the language has changed.","In the HTML, this link would be coded as\n\n","WebPlexer provides a method of optionally forcing the selection of specific language(s) for certain hostnames or ip addresses.","This feature overrides automatic language selection when the top-level URL specified in the WP_Map file is requested. A browser-specified language preference will still be used if specified.","There are two files used to specify automatic language selection overrides: HostNameMap and IPAddrMap, both of which are in WebPlexer's language subdirectory.","The format of these files is described in Section 4.3, \u201cMap Overrides.\u201d","3.3.8 Setting the Global Default Language","The global default language is set in the WP_Map file with the directive:\n\n","The global default language is used as the default for the console and for some WebPlexer initialization.","3.3.9 Content Tagging and Support for Multilingual Browsers","Content tagging allows WebPlexer to inform the browser of the language and charset used to encode a document when the document is accessed. Some browsers, like Netscape Navigator, use this information to automatically switch to the correct font and encoding for a particular language.","Content tagging is always active whenever a document is fetched from a language directory that is specified in the WP_Map file.","When a document is content tagged, the http Content-Language and Content-Type response headers are returned with the document to indicate the language and charset in use.","These fields are automatically updated by WebPlexer even when the language is changed by manual selection.","3.4 Country Selection","WebPlexer provides three ways by which the country of an incoming request is determined.\n\n","These are described in detail below.","3.4.1 Automatic Country Selection","With automatic country selection, WebPlexer determines the country from the requester's domain. If the domain cannot be determined (usually because the requester is behind a firewall), the country is set to the global default country (see Section 3.4.5, \u201cSetting the Global Default Country\u201d).","Automatic country selection is only active when the browser request is to the top-level URL specified in the WP_Map file. See Section 3.3.2.1, \u201cSpecifying the Top-Level URL,\u201d for a detailed description of how to set the top-level URL. Once the country has been determined, its value is saved by appending it to the language directory in the mapped URL.","For example, if the top-level URL were \/joe, and the host domain was eiffel.tower.fr, a request to:\n\n","By embedding the country name in the URL, WebPlexer can retain the country setting for the lifetime of this session.","3.4.2 Manual Country Selection","Manual country selection is performed by issuing a WPCommand of type \u201ccountry\u201d. WPCommands are more fully described in Section 3.6.3.3, \u201cWPCommands.\u201d They result in the browser sending a request to WebPlexer of the form:\n\n","For example, if the current country is France and the current language is French, and the current document being viewed is info.html, to request that the country be changed to German, this request should be sent to WebPlexer:\n\n","WebPlexer will respond with a new URL that looks like\n\n","Regions are defined in the WP_Regions file. Regions allow groups of countries to be combined into geographical areas that are meaningful for the type of content that is on the site.","For example, if a company had one sales office in Europe, and another in Asia, and had developed Web site content that was specific to these markets, it might want to create two regions like this:\n\n","Regions can be either user-defined or pre-defined (default). User-defined regions are specified in the WP_Regions file (see Section 4.9, \u201cWP_Regions\u201d).","Pre-defined (default) regions are established by WebPlexer. Please see Appendix D., \u201cList of WebPlexer Default Regions,\u201d for more information.","Regions are used by the multi-country server-side include feature (see \u201cMulti-Country Server-Side Includes (MCSSI)\u201d). They allow specific content to be presented to users from countries in those regions when they enter the Web site.","3.4.5 Setting the Global Default Country","The global default country is set in the WP_Map file with the directive:\n\n","The global default country is used as the default for the console and for some additional WebPlexer functions.","3.5 Country and Language Management","WebPlexer has the unique ability to independently maintain both the country and the language associated with each request. This provides a great deal of flexibility in selectively targeting content to specific regions or countries of the world and, at the same time, making that content available in multiple languages.","It is important to understand how WebPlexer's country management and language management are different and how they are similar.","In the following description, the term \u201csession\u201d refers to a logical grouping of requests between browser and WebPlexer. A session begins with the browser making a request for the top-level URL. It ends with the final response being sent from WebPlexer to the browser. A session can have any number of request\/response pairs between these two endpoints.","A session has a state associated with it. Included in this state are the country and language of the requester.","Once the country and language state have been determined from the initial request, they remain unchanged until the browser initiates an action like manually changing the country or language.","Unfortunately, the http protocol used for data transport on the Web is a stateless protocol. This means that the protocol does not allow state to be maintained from one request to another.","WebPlexer uses a unique persistence mechanism for retaining session state across multiple requests. This mechanism allows country and language information to be saved throughout the lifetime of a session.","WebPlexer uses a simple 4-step algorithm for managing country and language when processing a request:\n\n","Once the country and language for a request have been established, they are available as state variables within the HTML and can be used for:\n\n","WebPlexer's 4-step algorithm for country and language management is described in more detail below.","3.5.1 Determine Country","WebPlexer will first determine the country of the requester if it is not known (on an initial request), or when it is manually selected (through a WebPlexer change country command (see Section 3.4.2, \u201cManual Country Selection\u201d)).","3.5.2 Determine Language from Country","WebPlexer uses the country from the previous step to determine the slanguage of the requester. A list of languages for the selected country is obtained from a database and the first one that matches a language present on the server is selected.","For example, if the requestor's country were Switzerland, the requestor's language could be set to either german, french, italian, or romansch depending on which one was found first on the server.","The exceptions to this rule are:\n\n","WebPlexer uses the country to dynamically select content specific to that country. This allows the content to change based on the geographic location of the requester. The actual selection mechanism is controlled by the multi-country server-side include feature. This feature is more fully described in \u201cMulti-Country Server-Side Includes (MCSSI).\u201d Additional information can be found in Section 3.6.1, \u201cTemplate Model,\u201d which describes WebPlexer's template model.","3.5.4 Modify Content for Language","WebPlexer presents the content in the language selected by the requestor.","There are 3 methods that WebPlexer uses to present content in the selected language:\n\n","The Multilingual ToolKit is a set of HTML extensions and templates that simplifies the design and construction of multi-language and multi-country Web pages.","The Multilingual ToolKit consists of several key WebPlexer resources:\n\n","The following sections discuss the specific components of the Multilingual ToolKit in more detail.","3.6.1 Template Model","WebPlexer's Multilingual ToolKit uses a template-based approach to dynamically create documents tailored for a specific language or country.","A template contains placeholders for country and language-specific information that has been removed from a document. This information is dynamically inserted from a TermDB, another template or document, or provided automatically by WebPlexer when the composite document is presented to the browser.","The basic approach to creating a template has two steps. First, remove as much country and language-specific information as possible from a document. Then, replace this information with appropriate WebPlexer tags and commands.","The advantage to using templates is that a single document can easily support many languages and countries.","For example, a single form or CGI-generated document can be constructed so that it will be automatically localized for different languages and locales.","This significantly reduces the number of documents that have to be maintained on the site and makes it very easy to add new languages. It also allows a single update to a document to be immediately propagated to all languages and countries.","This technique also allows country or regional content to be conveniently separated from the structure of the document, making it easy to change a design often by updating a single file. This eliminates the ripple effect often seen when a single change must propagate through all of the localized documents on the site.","3.6.1.1 Template Types","WebPlexer supports three basic kinds of templates.\n\n","One document may contain all three template types. We call such a document a \u201ccomposite\u201d document, since it is made up of multiple elements.","Most documents will have a mixture of these three basic types. In the sample included with this release, the file \u2018info.html\u2019 is a combination of static and tag-based templates, whereas the template of \u2018contact.html\u2019 is completely tag-based.","Please look through the sample files in the htdocs directory of this release for examples showing the use of templates.","File-based templates require the server-side include feature. This feature is not available in the current release.","Tag-based templates are the most generic and allow a single document to be used across all languages and countries.","In general, the smaller the amount of static content in a template, the more generic the template is and the fewer the number of times it needs to be instantiated.","The next sections discuss the template types in more detail.","Static","Static templates are not really templates at all. They are simply collections of static text.","File-Based","File-based templates allow external files containing localized content such as country, regional, or language-specific information to be inserted dynamically into a document. File-based templates are provided using the server-side include feature described in Section 3.6.3.5, \u201cServer-Side Includes.\u201d","Tag-Based","Tag-based templates allow replacement of marked-up text with translations from an external TermDB according to the selected country or language. Tag-based templates are provided using the WebPlexer HTML extensions described in Section 3.6.3.1, \u201cWPReplace.\u201d","3.6.2 TermDBs\u2122","A TermDB is an HTML representation of a multilingual glossary. The glossary is built in the form of an HTML table. Rows in the table correspond to entries in the glossary, be they words, phrases, or arbitrary strings. Columns in the table correspond to individual languages in the glossary such as English, French, or German.","One language in the TermDB is designated the primary language and is assigned to column 1 of the table.

When a document is requested in a particular language, WebPlexer will go to that cell of the matrix and try to retrieve the corresponding document.","If the document is not there (i.e. it has not been translated into the requested language), WebPlexer will automatically retrieve it from the default language directory specified by the \u201cdefault::\u201d declaration in the WP_Map file for this top-level URL (see Section 4.2, \u201cWP_Map,\u201d for an explanation of how to set up the default language directory).","SPAMM is completely transparent in operation. It does not require any special set-up or configuration. It also works with MLSSI so that if an included file cannot be found in the current language directory, it will look in the default directory instead.","Please note that even when SPAMM fetches a document from the default directory, WebPlexer still maintains the correct settings of country and language. This means that if a browser clicks on a link from within a document that was fetched from the default language directory (through SPAMM), WebPlexer will look for the new document in the currently active language directory, not in the default language directory.","3.9.3 Specifying Language-to-Directory Mapping","The mapping of language to directory must be specified in the WP_Map file so the document manager can locate documents in the correct language.","Please see Section 3.3.2.2, \u201cSpecifying the Language-to-Directory Map and Charset,\u201d for detailed information on how to specify this mapping.","3.9.4 Specifying Charsets","Please see Section 3.3.2.2, \u201cSpecifying the Language-to-Directory Map and Charset,\u201d for detailed information on how to specify the charset used to encode a document. This information is used by the document manager.","3.9.5 Using Multi-Country Server-Side Includes (MCSSI)","MCSSI allows an HTML document to be easily customized with country and regional-specific content using a highly modular, \u201cbuilding-block\u201d approach. This reduces the number of individual files that need to be kept on the server, lowering the cost and time required to maintain the site.","One application of MCSSI is to insert a targeted, country-specific banner at the top of an HTML page. It can also be used to easily tailor a marketing message for a specific country or region. For example, a travel company could use this feature to publish different airfares to various countries or regions. Or, tour packages or travel information could be presented only to those countries or regions where it is relevant.","The following is a simple example of an HTML document that shows how MCSSI is used.\n\n","When this document is processed, WebPlexer will first determine the current language and replace the string \u201cWelcome to the ABC Travel Site\u201d with its translation out of the TermDB. Please see Section 3.6.3.1, \u201cWPReplace,\u201d for a description of WPReplace tags and how the replacement is done. Note that this is not part of the MCSSI operation but is included to make the example a bit more realistic.","Next, WebPlexer will process the MCSSI statement as follows:\n\n","Note that the included MCSSI file can contain additional WebPlexer tags, including MLSSI and WPReplace tags. This allows the MCSSI file to be further customized for the current language, by replacing strings with their translations using the TermDB.","MCSSI is very easy to use by following the steps given below.\n\n","a. Place country-specific content in these directories:\n\n","b. Place regional-specific content in these directories:\n\n","c. Place generic content (all regions and countries) in this directory:","where:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0473","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0143","list-style":"none"},"li":["<head_of_mcssi_directory>\n\nis the top-level directory of the MCSSI area on the server and is defined in the WP_Config file (see Section 4.1, \u201cWP_Config\u201d).\n","<mcssi_file>\n\nis the target file to be included.\n","4. Include a statement in your HTML of the form:","<!--#WP_include_MCSSI \u201cairfares.html\u201d -->\n\nwhere \u201cairfares.html\u201d is the name of the target MCSSI file.\n","5. When WebPlexer detects the MCSSI include when processing the HTML, it will fetch the file from the appropriate directory (3a, b, or c from above\u2014where ever it finds it first), and insert it in-line into the HTML stream.","6. Any WPReplace or WebPlexer tags that are found in the inserted file will be resolved after the file is inserted."]}},"Please note that language-dependent content is normally not included in MCSSI files and that template tags (see Section 3.6.1.1, \u201cTemplate Types\u201d) such as WPReplace (see Section 3.6.3.1, \u201cWPReplace\u201d) or MLSSI (see \u201cMulti-Language Server-Side Includes (MLSSI)\u201d) should be used instead.","Language-dependent content means any static text that is present in the file. Including language-dependent content within an MCSSI file is not recommended since an MCSSI file is included based on the setting of the current country. In other words, MCSSI files should contain only country or regional-specific content and be independent of language.","For example, if the current country of the browser is Switzerland, the user might be viewing the site in either French or German. If an MCSSI file for Switzerland is included that contains static text in French, the language will be wrong if the browser is requesting German.","This problem can be easily solved by replacing the static text in the MCSSI file with template tags, either by\n\n","MLSSI is typically used to customize an HTML document by including HTML that might be too complex to be managed by WPReplace tags. For example, MLSSI can be used to include a language-specific heading at the top of a form constructed out of WPReplace tags.","Please see Section 3.6.3.1, \u201cWPReplace,\u201d for further information about WPReplace tags.","MLSSI also helps to separate the form of a Web site (the structure and layout of the site) from its content (the actual message to be displayed on the browser).","The design and layout of a multi-language site is usually very similar, and often invariant, across languages. MLSSI allows the language-dependent parts of the content to be isolated from the structural design making it easy to update the design of the site and have changes reflected automatically across all of the languages. Likewise, MLSSI allows language content to be easily updated and maintained without affecting the overall site design.","Another application of MLSSI is to include language-specific graphics or image maps within a template file.","For example, a form-based HTML document that is a pure template can be customized with a language-specific banner and graphic at the top of the file as
