Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to reactive armor, and in particular, to a radially, orthogonal, tubular energetically rotated armor and method.","2. Background Art","Conventional reactive armor structures and systems that are configured to defeat projectile and\/or other threats include systems and methods that have been implemented with varying degrees of success since the 1970's. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,368,660; 4,665,794; 4,981,067; 5,025,707; 5,293,806; 5,637,824; 5,824,941; 6,311,605; 6,345,563; 6,846,372; 7,424,845; 7,540,229; and U.S. Published Applications 2006\/0065111; 2006\/0162539; and 2009\/0173250 provide examples of some conventional protective armoring structures, systems, and methods.","However, conventional reactive armor generally presents compromises and limitations in performance, generally manifested as inadequate performance against threats and\/or potential hazard to nearby individuals and\/or equipment, collateral damage, and the like. In many cases, conventional reactive armors are either too fast reacting or too slow reacting for effective defeat of some threats. As such, there is a desire for improved reactive armor systems and methods.","Accordingly, the present invention may provide an improved system and method for reactive armor.","According to the present invention, a system for a reactive armor may be provided. The reactive armor may include: a tube having a substantially central longitudinal axis, and at least two force reaction faces that are parallel to the axis; a casing that includes a back, at least two sides, and at least two end blocks; the sides extend away from the back, the blocks are fastened to the sides at edges opposite of the back, and the tube is positioned between the blocks to form a cover to the casing; initiators included between the end blocks and the force reaction faces; a sensor subsystem that detects a threat, wherein the sensor subsystem is coupled to the initiators, and the sensor subsystem generates an initiation signal in response to the detection of the threat; and when the initiators receive the initiation signal, the initiators substantially simultaneously generate a force such that the tube is rotated about the axis to rotationally defeat the threat.","The force reaction faces are bases of wedges that are formed on the outer surface of the tube.","The force reaction faces are surfaces on plates located on one or both ends of the tube and substantially at the axis.","The tube is formed from at least one of aluminum, light weight steel, and titanium.","In one embodiment, the initiators are chemical explosive material.","In another embodiment, the initiators are magnetic force impulse reactive devices.","The tube has a preferred diameter of less than 6 inches.","The tube has a diameter in a range of 2 inches to 6 inches.","The tube has a wall thickness in a range of 1\/16 inch to V1 inch.","The rotational velocity of the tube reaches greater that 1000 revolutions per second in response to the force.","Further, the present invention may provide a method for defeating a threat, the method comprising: (a) mounting a reactive armor to a structure to be protected from the threat, wherein the armor includes: a tube having a substantially central longitudinal axis, and at least two force reaction faces that are parallel to the axis; a casing that includes a back that is mounted to the structure, at least two sides, and at least two end blocks; wherein the sides extend away from the back, the blocks are fastened to the sides at edges opposite of the back, and the tube is positioned between the blocks to form a cover to the casing; initiators included between the end blocks and the force reaction faces; a sensor subsystem, wherein the sensor subsystem is coupled to the initiators; (b) generating an initiation signal via the sensor subsystem in response to detection of the threat, and transmitting the initiation signal to the initiators; and (c) generating a force such that the tube is rotated about the axis to rotationally defeat the threat, when the initiators receive the initiation signal.","The force reaction faces are bases of wedges that are formed on the outer surface of the tube.","The force reaction faces are surfaces on plates located on one or both ends of the tube and substantially at the axis.","The tube is formed from at least one of aluminum, light weight steel, and titanium.","The initiators are chemical explosive material.","The initiators are magnetic force impulse reactive devices.","The tube has a preferred diameter of less than 6 inches.","The tube has a diameter in a range of 2 inches to 6 inches.","The tube has a wall thickness in a range of 1\/16 inch to \u00bc inch.","The rotational velocity of the tube reaches greater that 1000 revolutions per second in response to the force.","The above features, and other features and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed descriptions thereof when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.","The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood by one skilled in the appropriate art.","The singular forms such as \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example, reference to \u201ca material\u201d includes reference to one or more of such materials, and \u201can element\u201d includes reference to one or more of such elements.","As used herein, \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cabout\u201d, when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material, characteristic, parameter, and the like, refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly, \u201csubstantially free of\u201d or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition, characteristic, or property. Particularly, assemblies that are identified as being \u201csubstantially free of\u201d are either completely absent of the characteristic, or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.","A plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, materials, subassemblies, and the like may be presented in a common list or table for convenience. However, these lists or tables should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. As such, no individual member of such list should be considered a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on the presentation in a common group so specifically described.","Concentrations, values, dimensions, amounts, and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits, but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units, 3 dimensional units, 10 dimensional units, and the like; and sub-ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units, 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units, and the like.","With reference to the Figures, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. Generally, the present invention provides an improved system and method for reactive armor. In particular, a Radially, Orthogonal, Tubular Energetically Rotated Armor (ROTERA) is generally provided. Structures that may be protected by a reactive armor according to the present invention are vehicles such as tanks, armored personnel carriers, armored fighting vehicles; armored static structures such as buildings, above-ground portions of bunkers or shelters, containers for the storage of water, fuel, chemicals, munitions; and the like. The reactive armor system and method according to the present invention may be implemented as stand-alone armor, or alternatively may be implemented in connection with (e.g., integrated with) conventional passive armor and\/or conventional active armor.","Referring to , an end view of a reactive armor mechanism (e.g., apparatus, device, system, assembly, subassembly, etc.)  is shown. The reactive armor system  generally comprises a tube , a casing , at least one rotation initiator  (e.g., a pair of rotation initiators and ), and a detector subassembly (system) .","The tube (i.e., generally tubular or cylindrically shaped element)  generally has a central, longitudinal axis, A. The tube  may include a pair of substantially thin wall sections  (e.g., walls and ). Respective wedge (tooth) shaped sections  (e.g., wedges and ) may be formed on or integral with the outer surface of the wall sections .","Each of the wedges  generally includes a base (e.g., force pad, foot, force reaction surface, etc.)  (e.g., respective bases and ). The bases  may be substantially longitudinal; and have a face that is parallel to the axis, A. The tube  is generally positioned such that the bases  are adjacent to a respective initiator  (i.e., the wedge generally includes a base that is adjacent to the initiator ; and the wedge generally includes a base that is adjacent to the initiator ). Relative to the radial surface of the tube , each of the bases  are generally facing opposing directions, similar to teeth on a ratchet wheel.","The casing  may comprise a back , sides (walls)  (e.g., a side and a side ), and end plates (blocks)  (e.g., an end plate and an endplate ). The back  is generally positioned (i.e., mounted, located, fixed, fastened, attached, etc.) such that the armor  provides protection to a vehicle, building, and the like, as described above. The walls  are generally positioned (i.e., located, fixed, fastened, attached, etc.) to extend perpendicularly from opposing edges of the back  to form a void . The tube  is generally positioned to cap (cover) the void .","One of the walls  (e.g., the wall ) may be shorter that the other wall (e.g., the wall ). The end plate may be adjacent to the end of the wall that is opposite the back . The initiator may be positioned between the end plate and the base . The end plate may be adjacent to the end of the wall that is opposite the back . The sides  extend away from the back , each of the blocks  are fastened to the sides  at edges opposite of the back . The initiator may be positioned (i.e., located, fixed, fastened, attached, included, etc.) between the end plate and the base ","The initiators  may be implemented as apparatuses that generate rapid, propelling force to rapidly rotate the tube  about the axis, A, when triggered. In one example, the initiators  may be implemented as explosive devices such as strips of C4, dynamite, or the like. In another example, the initiators  may be implemented as opposing (e.g., opposite polarity) plates that generate magnetic capacitance force. However, the initiators  may be implemented as any appropriate rapid, propelling force generating devices to meet the design criteria of a particular application as would be understood by one of skill in the art.","The detection system (e.g., sensor system, alert system, etc.)  generally includes a connector subsystem (e.g., link, interconnect, wire, cable, tubing, etc.)  to provide communication with the initiators  (i.e., to couple the detector  to the initiators ). The detection subassembly  may be implemented as a conventional sensor equipped threat detection and alert apparatus. Examples of apparatuses that may be implemented as the detection subassembly  may be found in (i) U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,809, issued Apr. 10, 2007 to Schade et al., which is incorporated by reference in its entirety; and (ii) U.S. Pat. No. 7,827,900, issued Nov. 9, 2010 to Beach et al., which is incorporated by reference in its entirety; however, the detection and alert sensor system  may be implemented via any appropriate apparatus to meet the design criteria of a particular application as would be known to one of skill in the art.","Referring to , an end view of the armor  is illustrated at a time shortly before impingement (i.e., hit, strike, penetration, etc.) of a threat  into the armor  (i.e., when the threat  is imminent). The threat  may include one or more projectiles, metal fragments, fluid metals, penetrating jets (\u201cthorns\u201d, \u201cspikes\u201d, etc.) as generated by chemical energy rounds, high energy kinetic rounds, and the like. The armor  is generally positioned such that the longitudinal, outer radial surface of the tube  faces the anticipated direction of the threat , and the area to be protected is thus behind the back  of the casing . The armor  may potentially mitigate, disrupt, diminish, reduce, and\/or eliminate damaging or harmful effects of the threat  and collateral effects.","When an imminent threat (e.g., the threat ) is detected, the alert system  may generate a signal (e.g., TRIG). The signal TRIG is generally transmitted substantially simultaneously to the initiators .","Referring to , an end view of the armor  is illustrated at a time shortly after impingement (i.e., hit, strike, penetration, etc.) of the threat  into the armor . Impingement of the threat  may generate a rupture (e.g., hole, tear, puncture, intrusion, etc.) . However, the threat  may not necessarily penetrate the tube . For clarity of explanation, the tube  is illustrated as a sectional end view at the location of the rupture .","When the initiators  receive the signal TRIG, the initiators  may generate a rapid, forceful response (e.g., explosion, repulsion, and the like) against the respective bases  and the end plates  that may generate rapid, propelling forces to rapidly rotate the tube  about the axis, A.","The armor  generally comprises a reactive armor mechanism that utilizes the rotationally accelerated tube  to impinge and defeat the threat  and\/or penetration . The tube  generally disrupts the threat . The armor  generally utilizes energetic force (e.g., explosive force, magnetic capacitance force, etc.) generated via the initiators  to rapidly accelerate a tubular armor material  about the central axis, A; thus feeding the undamaged armor material of the walls  and\/or wedges  into the incoming threat , similar to a grinding wheel. With the armor , the objective is to not throw material such as occurs when a conventional reactive armor, for example, conventional flyer plate armor, is implemented to defeat threats. Rather, in response to the threat , the armor  generally rotates the material of the tube  around the central axis, A, impinging the threat  in a manner similar to a grinding wheel. As such, the armor  has the potential to reduce the risk of fratricide and collateral damage.","The tube  is generally implemented from common metallic materials that are significantly lighter than solid monolithic armor. Such metallic materials may include aluminum, light weight steel, titanium, thin composite, and the like. As such, the armor  has the potential to achieve a significant mass efficiency when compared to conventional armor approaches, especially conventional non-reactive armor where thick layers of heavy materials such as steel and ceramic are implemented.","The ROTERA system  generally rotates a tubular object (i.e., the tube ) into the path of an incoming projectile (i.e., the threat ). As the incoming stream of threat particles  hit the tube , the rotating tube  feeds fresh metallic material of the walls  and the teeth  into the path of the threat stream  disrupting the particle alignment and defeating the threat .","Rotating the tube  is generally implemented by providing substantial, balanced and immediate force as generated by the initiators , rotating the tube  at or above 1000 revolutions per second. Explosive or extreme magnetic force impulse from the initiators  is generally implemented to achieve this rotational acceleration. The force generated from the reaction of the initiators  generally rotates of the tube  in the appropriate amount of time in response to the signal TRIG that is transmitted by the detection system  when the threat  is imminent. This a significant energetic force event achieved through magnetic force impulse or explosive force impulse as generated by the initiators .","Referring to , an end view of an alternative embodiment of the tube  is illustrated. As illustrated in , the armor  may be implemented having a tube  that has spokes (e.g., legs, etc.)  and a plate (e.g., tab, etc.)  having a face that is parallel to the axis, A; instead of the wedges . The plate  may be located on one or both ends of the tube ; substantially at the axis, A; and may be fastened to one or more of the spokes . The force pads (force reaction faces)  may be implemented as surfaces on the outer opposing faces of the plate . The end blocks  are generally extended generally towards the axis, A, at the end of the tube  to provide a force reaction surface face that is adjacent to the initiator , while remaining recessed and substantially adjacent to the outer surface of the tube  for remainder of the length of the tube  to form an \u201cL\u201d shape.","The impulse force that is generated by the initiators  may be either applied with a force reaction face at the base of teeth shaped elements (i.e., at bases ) shown in , or, alternatively, through axial or shaft loading via the force reaction faces  near the axis, A, similar to a tire on a motorized vehicle as illustrated on .","The tube  may comprise of a tube of 6 inches or less diameter (e.g., a range of 2 inches to 6 inches). The wall  may have a thickness that can be varied (e.g., a range of 1\/16 inch to \u00bc inch), but thicker wall diameter may be desirable to keep tube deformation to a minimum during reaction to the threat . The rotational velocity of the tube  generally reaches greater that 1000 revolutions per second. A large energetic force impulse is generated when the initiators  are activated in response to an imminent threat . Explosive or magnetic force from the initiators  generally provides the acceleration and rotational velocity to the tube .","The triggering mechanism  is implemented to energize the system (i.e., generate the signal TRIG in response to detection of the threat ). The detection system  may include a break screen\/make screen routed to a magnetic power source (e.g., capacitor and the like) to create a magnetic energetic event when the initiators  are implemented to provide magnetic capacitive force. A low order explosive trigger that would set off a larger order explosive may also be implemented to initiate an explosive energetic event when the initiators  are implemented as chemical explosive materials or devices. The triggering mechanism  is implemented using an apparatus that acts (i.e., transmits the signal TRIG) faster than the threat  to initiate the energetic event that rotates the tube .","When the threat particle  activates the triggering device , the triggering device  set offs the energetic mechanism (i.e., transmits the signal TRIG which activates the initiators ) that drives the tube  in a rotational fashion. See . Once the energetic event is initiated, the ROTERA  tube  rotationally accelerates and begins impinging the threat particle stream . This impingement is continuous as the tube  rotates. Note also the displacement of the end plates . As the tube  is impinged by the threat , the disrupted threat  particles misalign and spread apart in the tube hole (break-up zone, interior of the tube ) . See . Eventually the disrupted threat  particles will reach the back side of the rotating tube , and again be impinged (e.g., impingement ), and disrupted by the tube wall . The remaining threat particles  that still penetrate the back wall  of the rotating tube  will generally disperse and be caught (captured) by the passive vehicle armor back  behind ROTERA  in the void . See .","As is apparent then from the above detailed description, the present invention may provide an improved system active armor.","Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
