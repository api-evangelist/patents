{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ONE EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/111,497 filed Dec. 8, 1998, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates generally to a gateway device and, more particularly, to a universal network gateway for enabling a computer to transparently access and communicate with a service provider network.","In order for a computer to function properly in a network environment, the computer must be appropriately configured. Among other things, this configuration process establishes the protocol and other parameters by which the computer transmits and receives data. In one common example, a plurality of computers are networked to create a local area network (LAN). In the LAN, each computer must be appropriately configured in order to exchange data over the network. Since most networks are customized to meet a unique set of requirements, computers that are part of different networks are generally configured in different manners in order to appropriately communicate with their respective networks.","While desktop computers generally remain a part of the same network for a substantial period of time, laptops, handhelds, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellphones or other portable computers (collectively \u201cportable computers\u201d) are specifically designed to be transportable. As such, portable computers are connected to different networks at different times depending upon the location of the computer. In a common example in which the portable computer serves as an employee's desktop computer, the portable computer is configured to communicate with their employer's network, i.e., the enterprise network. When the employee travels, however, the portable computer may be connected to different networks that communicate in different manners. In this regard, the employee may connect the portable computer to the network maintained by an airport, a hotel, a cellular telephone network operator or any other locale in order to access the enterprise network, the Internet or some other on-line service. The portable computer is also commonly brought to the employee's residence where it is used to access various networks, such as, the enterprise network, a home network, the Internet and the like. Since these other networks are configured somewhat differently, however, the portable computer must also be reconfigured in order to properly communicate with these other networks. Typically, this configuration is performed by the user each time that the portable computer is connected to a different network. As will be apparent, this repeated reconfiguration of the portable computer is not only quite time consuming, but is also prone to errors. The reconfiguration procedure may even be beyond the capabilities of many users or in violation of their employer's IT policy. Accordingly, special software must also typically be loaded onto the user's computer to support reconfiguration.","In addition, user digital communications addresses such as internet or IP addresses are conventionally associated with a fixed physical location, such as a user's business telephone line. However, portable communications devices such as laptop computers are becoming increasingly popular, and it is common for a user to access the internet from locations as diverse as hotel rooms and airplanes.","Digital communications networks are set up to route communications addressed to a communication address to the associated physical location. Thus, if a laptop computer is connected to a remote location, communications to and from the computer will not be associated with the user's communications address.","In order for a computer (host) to communicate across a network (e.g., the internet), software protocols (e.g., Transport Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP)) must be loaded into the host. A host computer sends information (i.e., packets of data) to devices on the network (routers) which receive the packets and send the packets back to the destination host.","The destination host will route replies back using a similar process. Each host computer and router must be configured so it will know who to send the packets of data to. A router will receive the packets only if the host computers specifically send (address) the packets to that router. If a host is configured incorrectly (bad address), then the host computer and router will be unable to communicate.","With the advent of mobile computers (laptops) and the desire to plug them into various networks to gain access to the resources on the network and internet, a mobile computer must be configured for each network it plugs into. Traditionally this new configuration can be done either (i) manually in software on the mobile computer (usually causing the mobile computer to be restarted to load in the new configuration), or (ii) with a new set of protocols which must be utilized on the mobile computer to obtain the configuration information from a device on the network to which the computer is being connected. When new services (protocols) are created to add functionality to the host computers, these new protocols must be updated in the host computers or routers, depending upon the type of new functionality being added.","As described by U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/816,174 now abandoned and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60\/111,497, 60\/160,973, 60\/161,189, 60\/161,139, 60\/160,890 and 60\/161,182, a universal subscriber gateway device has been developed by Nomadix, Inc. of Westlake Village, Calif. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference. The gateway device serves as an interface connecting the user to a number of networks or other online services. For example, the gateway device can serve as a gateway to the Internet, the enterprise network, or other networks and\/or on-line services. In addition to serving as a gateway, the gateway device automatically adapts to a computer, in order that it may communicate with the new network in a manner that is transparent both to the user and the new network. Once the gateway device has appropriately adapted to the user's computer, the computer can appropriately communicate via the new network, such as the network at a hotel, at home, at an airport, or any other location, in order to access other networks, such as the enterprise network, or other online services, such as the Internet.","The portable computer user, and more specifically the remote or laptop user, benefits from being able to access a myriad of computer networks without having to undergo the time-consuming and all-too-often daunting task of reconfiguring their host computer in accordance with network specific configurations. In addition, no additional software need be loaded onto the computer prior to connection to the other network. From another perspective, the network service provider benefits from avoiding \u201con-site\u201d visits and\/or technical support calls from the user who is unable to properly re-configure the portable computer. In this fashion, the gateway device is capable of providing more efficient network access and network maintenance to the user and the network operator.","Gateway devices are typically used to provide network access to the remote portable computer user, such as users in hotels, airports and other locations where the remote portable computer user may reside. Additionally, gateway devices have found wide-spread use in multi-resident dwellings as a means of providing the residents an intranet that networks the residents, broadband Internet access and the capability to adapt to the variances of the resident's individual enterprise networks. With the advent of even smaller portable computing devices, such as handhelds, PDAs, and the like, the locations where these users may reside becomes almost limitless.","User access to computer networks has been traditionally based upon the identity of the computer or computer user rather than the location of the accessing computer. For example, in conventional dial up modem access to computer networks, such as the Internet, a user must typically enter identification information such as the user's name and password. This user input information is then compared to a database of user profiles to determine if the user should be granted access. The database may also indicate the type of access and other related information, such as fees due. For example, where a subscriber to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) has purchased Internet access, a user profile database may contain information which not only enables the user to be authenticated, but tracks the user success for accounting purposes, such as maintaining a history of the user's access time on the network.","However, where the location-based access is established, access to the network cannot be based upon an individual user or computer, as multiple persons can obtain access from a given location, possibly utilizing different computers. Moreover, requiring each user to enter identification information for access overrides any convenience offered by simple, transparent location-based access to computer networks. Transparent network access is also impeded where access is not based upon location-based identification, but rather based upon user input identification information, where the gateway device enables a user to access networks based upon the user's computer settings. For instance, if a user's computer is configured to access a home network, identifying the computer may require the computer to be reconfigured.","Typical network access servers typically allow access to a server based upon a user's information, such as a user name. Authentication was typically done via a user name and password, which is an all or nothing approach. In other words, a user is either allowed access or denied access to a network. Therefore, user's can not be dynamically authorized access to a network such that the user's access and authorization to particular networks or sites can be determined and varied based upon attributes associated with the user, user's location, or packets received from the user's computer.","What is needed is an AAA method and system that allows users dynamic access based upon any number of variables, such as a user's location, a user name or password, a user's location. It would be advantageous for a user to be authorized access based on these variables. Furthermore, it would be advantageous for users to have flexible access to particular sites or services based upon these attributes. Therefore, an ISP or enterprise network can selectively permit access to users, and permit the user.","Therefore, an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting method and system would be desirable which enables a user transparent access to a computer network employing a gateway device, where the computer network can dynamically and selectively authorize a network access. Furthermore, authentication and access rights can be transparently based upon the location from which access is requested, or based upon another attribute associated with the user's computer so that the user is not required to be queried for information and no additional configuration software need be loaded on the user's computer. Moreover, if the user is queried for access information, the user's data should be stored such that subsequent attempts to access the network do not require the user to establish authorization.","The present invention comprises a method and system for selectively implementing and enforcing Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA). The authentication capability can be based upon multiple methods. First, AAA can be done based upon where the traffic is originating, such as a location, computer, circuit, or user. Secondly, the authentication and authorization capability can be based upon the type of services the user is attempting to access, such as a destination address. This can be a destination port or Internet address, a TCP port, a network. Third, AAA can be based upon the content type or protocol being transmitted. For example, each packet can be filtered through the selective AAA process, so that a user can be authorized access to a particular location. Each time the user attempts to access a different location, the user is subject to the AAA, so the user may be prevented access from a particular site the AAA method deems inaccessible to the user based upon the user's authorization. Alternatively, the AAA method according to the present invention allows users to connect directly to a specific site, such as credit card or billing servers which collect billing information, which can indicate that the user has paid, so that the user is thereafter authorized access to networks. Additionally, a user's authorization can depend upon a specific time, so that the user can be kicked off a network at a specific time, after a specific time has elapsed, or according to other dynamic information determined by the network provider.","According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for transparently authorizing, authenticating and accounting users having access to a destination network is disclosed, wherein the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings. The method includes receiving at a gateway device a request from a user for access to the destination network and identifying an attribute associated with the user based upon a packet received by the gateway device, wherein the packet is transmitted from the user's computer, wherein the user computer remains configured for accessing the home network, and wherein no additional configuration software need be installed on the user computer. The method also includes accessing a user profile corresponding to the user and stored in a user profile database, where the user profile is accessed based upon the attribute associated with the user, and determining if the user is entitled to access the destination network based upon the user profile.","According to one aspect of the invention, a location identifier is assigned to the location from which the request for access to the destination network is transmitted, where the location identifier is the attribute associated with the user. Thus, the packets received by the gateway device indicate the locations from which the requests were transmitted. The location identifier may be a virtual local area network (VLAN) ID assigned to the location from which the request for access was transmitted.","Furthermore, according to one aspect of the method of the present invention, the user profile database can be updated when new users access the destination network such that the user can be quickly authorized access once identified by a user name or password. Additionally, a historical log of user access to the destination network may be maintained in respective user profiles so that the system can accurately bill users for access to the destination network.","According to the method of the present invention, determining if the user is entitled to access the destination network can include denying the user access where the user's profile indicates that the user is denied access. However, the user may be directed to a login page in instances which the user's profile is not located within the user profile database.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a system for authorizing, authenticating and accounting users having transparent access to a destination network is disclosed, where the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings. The system includes a gateway device for receiving a request from a user for access to the destination network, and means for identifying an attribute associated with the user based upon a packet received by the gateway device, wherein the packet is transmitted from the user's computer, wherein the user's computer is configured for accessing the home network, and wherein no additional configuration software need be installed on the user computer. The system also includes a user profile database comprising stored access information that is in communication with the gateway device, wherein access information corresponding to the user is identified by the attribute associated with the user, and an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server in communication with the gateway device and user profile database, where the AAA server determines if user is entitled to access the destination network based upon the access information stored within the user profile database.","According to one aspect of the invention, the means for identifying can be provided by an access concentrator in communication with the gateway device. Furthermore, the packet transmitted to the gateway device can include a VLAN ID, a circuit ID, or a media access control (MAC) address for identifying the location from which the request for access was transmitted.","The user profile database includes a plurality of user profiles, wherein each respective user profile of the plurality of user profiles contains access information, and where each respective user profile contains historical data relating to the duration of destination network access for use in determining the charges due for the destination network access. Additionally, the user profile database can be located within the AAA server. The AAA server, can, in turn, be located within the gateway device.","The Authentication, Authorization and Accounting method and system according to the present invention enables users transparent access to a computer network employing a gateway device, where the computer network can authenticate and authorize access rights based upon the location from which access is requested, or based upon another attribute associated with the user in a manner transparent to the user. In this regard, the method and system of the present invention permit Authentication, Authorization and Accounting without requiring the user to reconfigure their computer and without requiring additional configuration software to be loaded upon the user's computer.","According to another embodiment, a portable \u201cNomadic\u201d router or translator is provided. The nomadic router enables a laptop computer or other portable terminal which is configured to be connected to a local home network to be connected to any location on the internet or other digital data communication system. The nomadic router automatically and transparently re-configures the terminal to its new location and processes outgoing and incoming data:","The nomadic router includes a processor which appears as the home network to the terminal, and appears as the terminal to the communication system. The terminal has a permanent address, the nomadic router has a router address, and the terminal transmits outgoing data to the system including the permanent address as a source address. The processor translates the outgoing data by replacing the permanent address with the router address as the source address. The terminal receives incoming data from the system including the router address as a destination address, and the processor translates the incoming data by replacing the router address with the permanent address as the destination address.","The terminal can be directly connected to a point on a local network, and the nomadic router connected to another point in the network. The nomadic router can be employed to implement numerous applications including nomadic e-mail, network file synchronizer, database synchronizer, instant network, nomadic internet, mobile virtual private network and trade show router, and can also be utilized as a fixed nomadic router.","The nomadic router can be implemented as software and\/or hardware. The nomadic router establishes location and device transparency for a digital communication terminal such as a laptop computer. The terminal can be connected to any of a variety of networks and locations which can employ a variety of communication interface devices.","The nomadic router automatically converts the actual location address to a unique communication address for the user such as an internet address, such that the terminal performs communications originating from the communication address regardless of the physical location of the terminal.","The nomadic router also automatically configures the terminal to utilize a selected one of the interface devices, and switches from one to another if the first device malfunctions or becomes otherwise unavailable.","The nomadic router includes software and services which can be packaged in a personal portable device to support a rich set of computing and communications capabilities and services to accommodate the mobility of nomads (users) in a transparent, integrated, and convenient form. This is accomplished by providing device transparency and location transparency to the user.","There is a vast array of communication device alternatives such as Ethernet, Wireless LAN, and dialup modem among which the users switches when in the office, moving around the office, or on the road (such as at a hotel, airport, or home). The device transparency in the nomadic router provides seamless switching among these devices (easily, transparently, intelligently, and without session loss. The location transparency support in the nomadic router prevents users from having to reconfigure (e.g., IP and gateway address) their network device (laptop) each time they move to a new network or subnetwork.","The present nomadic router provides a separation of location and identity by providing a permanent IP address to the network device (host). The nomadic router provides independence between the location, communication device, and the host operating system. There are no new standards need to be adopted by the networking community. All specialized processing is stored internally to the nomadic router with standard interfaces to the host device and various communication devices.","The nomadic router supports the migration to Network Computers by providing identity and security services for the user. The nomadic router also supports multiple parallel communication paths across the communications network for soft handoff, increased throughput, and fault tolerance by supporting multiple communication substrates.","A portable router for enabling a data communication terminal to be location and device transparent according to the present invention, comprises: a first module for storing a digital communication address of a user; a second module for detecting a data communication network location to which the terminal is connected; a third module for detecting communication devices that are connected to the terminal; a fourth module for establishing data communication between the terminal and the network such that the communication address of the location from the second module is automatically converted to the communication address of the user from the first module; and a fifth module for automatically selecting a communication device which was detected by the third module for use by the fourth module.","The present nomadic router utilizes a unique process embodied in a self-contained apparatus which manipulates the packets of data being sent between the host computers and routers. This process provides an intelligent active universal translation of the content of the packets being transmitted between the host computer and nomadic router. The translation allows the host computer to communicate with the nomadic router even when the host computer is not configured to communicate with the nomadic router.","This is achieved by the nomadic router pretending to be the router which the host is configured for, and by the nomadic router pretending to be the host which the router expects to communicate with. Therefore, the nomadic router supports the mobility of computers in that it enables these computers to plug into the network at different locations (location independence) without having to install, configure, or utilize any new protocols on the mobile computer.","The mobile computer continues to operate without being aware of the change in location or new configuration, and the nomadic router translates the data allowing the host to think that it is communicating with the router. By putting this process in a self-contained apparatus, the deployment of new protocols can be performed independently of the host computer and its operating system (host independent).","All specialized processing and translation is stored internally in the nomadic router with standard interfaces to the host device and various communication devices. Thus, no new standards need be adopted. By removing the complexity of supporting different network environments out of the mobile computer and into this self-contained apparatus, the nomadic router allows the host computer to maintain a very minimal set of software protocols and functionality (e.g., the minimum functionality typically installed in network computers) to communicate-across the network.","The nomadic router translation ability also enables the use of alternate communication paths (device independence) without the host computer being aware of any new communication device that utilizes an alternate communication path. The translation of the packets is done not just at the physical, link, or network layer of the protocol stack but at the transport and application layers as well. This allows the network card, protocol stack, and application running on the host computer to be independent of the network environment and configuration.","As an example of the communication device independence, the translation allows soft handoff, increased throughput, and fault tolerance by supporting multiple communication substrates. In addition, the nomadic router translation ability provides a flexible process for deploying enhanced nomadic and mobile computing software and services such as filtering of packets and determining which packets should be allowed to be transmitted between the mobile computer and the nomadic router or local area network (Internal Firewall).","The router apparatus can be: (i) carried with the mobile user (e.g., using an external box); (ii) attached to the mobile computer (e.g., PCMCIA card); (iii) installed inside the mobile computer (e.g., a chip in the laptop); (iv) or installed into the network infrastructure so it will already be there when the mobile computer user arrives (e.g., a box which plugs into the local area network translating packets being sent between the host and nomadic router, or a chip which is installed in routers on the network). The nomadic router can also be provided in the form of software which is loaded into and run in the mobile computer or another computer or router on a network.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, taken together with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Referring now to , a computer system  including a gateway device  is depicted in block diagram form. The computer system  typically includes a plurality of computers  that access a computer network in order to gain access to networks  or other online services . For example, the computers  can be plugged into ports that are located in different rooms of a hotel, business, or a multi-dwelling unit. Alternatively, the computers  can be plugged into ports in an airport, an arena, or the like. The gateway device  provides an interface between the plurality of computers  and the various networks  or other online services . One embodiment of a gateway device has been described by the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/816,174.","Most commonly, the gateway device  is located near the computers  at a relatively low position in the overall network (i.e., the gateway device  will be located within the hotel, multi-unit residence, airport, etc.). However, the gateway device  can be located at a higher position in the system by being located closer to the various networks  or other online services , if so desired. Although the gateway device  can be physically embodied in many different fashions, the gateway device  typically includes a controller and a memory device in which software is stored that defines the operational characteristics of the gateway device . Alternatively, the gateway device  can be embedded within another network device, such as an access concentrator  or a router . For ample, the gateway device  could be located at a network operating center or could be located before or after a router  in the computer network. Moreover, the software that defines the functioning of the gateway device  can be stored on a PCMCIA card that can be inserted into a computer of the plurality of computers  in order to automatically reconfigure the computer to communicate with a different computer system, such as the networks  and online services .","The computer system  typically includes an access concentrator  positioned between the computers  and the gateway device  for multiplexing the signals received from the plurality of computers onto a link to the gateway device . Depending upon the medium by which the computers  are connected to the access concentrator, the access concentrator  can be configured in different manners. For example, the access concentrator can be a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) for signals transmitted via regular telephone lines, a cable head end for signals transmitted via coaxial cables, a wireless access point (WAP) for signals transmitted via a wireless network, a cable modem termination shelf (CMTS), a switch or the like. As also shown in , the computer system  typically includes one or more routers  and\/or servers (not shown in ) to control or direct traffic to and from a plurality of computer networks  or other online services . While the computer system  is depicted to have a single router, the computer system  can have a plurality of routers, switches, bridges, or the like that are arranged in some hierarchical fashion in order to appropriately route traffic to and from the various networks  or online services . In this regard, the gateway device  typically establishes a link with one or more routers. The routers, in turn, establish links with the servers of other networks or other online service providers, such as internet service providers, based upon the user's selection. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that one or more devices illustrated in  may be combinable. For example, although not shown, the router  may be located entirely within the gateway device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","112","114","112"]},"The communications device  can be part of any type of communication system to which the host computer  can be connected. Such communication systems include, but are not limited to, local networks, wide area networks, dial-up and direct internet connections, etc. In a typical application the communications device will connect the host computer to a local network which itself is connected to the internet. Thus, the host device  is able to communicate with an unlimited number of networks and nodes which are themselves interconnected with routers, switches, bridges, etc. in any known manner.","The present router  includes a terminal interface which normally is used to connect the router  to the host device , and a system interface which connects the router  to the communications device . As will be further described below, the router  generally includes a processor consisting of hardware and\/or software which implements the required functionality. The router  is further configured to operate in an alternate mode in which the host device  is connected directly to a network, and the router  is also connected to a point in the network via the system interface . In this case, the terminal interface  as is unused.","Although the device  is described herein as being a router, it will be understood that the router  is not a conventional router in that it includes the capability for providing interconnectability between networks. Instead, the present router  is essentially a translator which enables the host device  to be automatically and transparently connected to any communications device , and process incoming and outgoing data for the device .","The host device  is provided with a permanent internet address which is conveniently not changed in accordance with the present invention. The device  is also initially configured to communicate with a particular gateway or other home device at its base location. The gateway has a home address which the device  attempts to locate when it is connected to any communication system. Without the functionality of the present nomadic router , the host device  would not be able to operate at a remote location because it would not find its gateway.","It will be understood that the term \u201chome\u201d does not relate to a residence, but is the network, gateway or other communication device or system to which the terminal is normally connected and which corresponds to the home interne or IP address.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["116","112","114","116","118","110","120","118","116","120","122","124","110"]},"The present router operates with host computers, routers, and other network devices through well-defined standard interfaces such as specified by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) and IEEE standardization committees. These standards specify the packet format, content, and physical communication characteristics. As shown in , host computers have to be configured at various layers of the protocol stack depending on the communication capabilities and configuration of the current network being attached to.","Hubs, as shown in , provide a well-defined interface to connect host computers and network devices by transmitting packets across multiple physical connections. Hubs do not provide any manipulate or translation of the content of the packets being transmitted.","Bridges or switches, as shown in , provide an intelligent filtering mechanism by which they only transmit packets across multiple physical connection based upon which physical connection the device is connected to, according to the link layer addressing (Media Access Control Address). Bridges and switches do not manipulate the content of the packet and do not provide any higher layer protocol functionality.","Routers, as shown in , accept packets based upon the destination address at the network layer in the packet. The host computer must explicitly address the packet at the link layer to the router. The router will then retransmit the packet across the correct physical connection based upon how it is configured. No modification or translation of the packet is performed at any layer of the protocol stack other than the network layer.","Firewalls, as shown in , filter packets at the network and transport layers to only allow certain packets to be retransmitted on to the other physical connection. Firewalls do not manipulate the content of the packet, only forward it on to the next hop in the network if it passes the transport (port) or network (IP address) filter.","Proxys and gateways, as show in , only receive packets explicitly addressed to them by host computers. They only manipulate packets at the application level. The present nomadic outer , as shown in , manipulates the content of the jackets at the link, network, transport, and application layers of the protocol stack to provide a translation between how the host computer is configured and the configuration of the network the host computer is currently attached to.","Unlike all other devices shown in to , the router  will automatically intercept and translate packets without the other devices being aware of the router  or have to be configured to use it. The translation algorithms in the router  which provide this location independence are provided completely internal to the router . Thus no new standards need to be developed, accepted, or implemented in host computers  or routers  to deploy new network services when using the nomadic router.","Whenever a new or different communication device (which includes the link and physical layers) is utilized in a host computer , the host computer's network layer must be aware of this new communication device. Since the router  has it's own network interface to the communication device, alternate communication devices can be utilized in the router  which the host computer  can utilize but does not have to be configured to use.","Permanent Addressing not Location Based","Today we communicate with individuals in terms of the location of their communications instruments (for instance, their computer's IP address or their fax machine's phone number). In order to support mobility and changing communication environments and devices, it is necessary to create an environment where people communicate with other people, and not specifically with the devices they use. To transparently support mobility and adaptivity in a wireless, potentially ad-hoc, communication internetwork, a common virtual network must be provided by an intelligent device or agent which supports the various computing hosts and communication devices.","The present nomadic router  provides the mapping between the location based IP address used in the Internet today and the permanent user based address housed in the host CPU in the device . This is illustrated in  as \u201cIP Mapping\u201d. This mapping is done without support or knowledge of such mapping by the host CPU or user.","The Internet RFC 2002 Mobile IP protocol specifies the mapping between permanent and temporary IP addresses. The unique aspect of the nomadic router is that the Mobile IP protocols are not necessarily running in, or supported by, the host CPU but rather are internal to the nomadic router. The host configuration information such as its IP number are discovered or determined as illustrated\u2014in  and stored in the nomadic router  as illustrated in  as \u201cHost Info.\u201d This configuration process is overviewed in .","Optional Off-Loaded Processing","As illustrated in , the nomadic router  can provide off-load communication processing for the host CPU by being physically separate from the host device . The adaptation, selection, and transportation of information across the network is performed by the nomadic router . This allows the host terminal or device  to utilize the network without having to directly support the network protocols. By having the nomadic router be responsible for adapting to the current network substrate, the host CPU can maintain a higher performance by not having to run the routing, adaptation, packetization, etc. algorithms or packet processing.","The nomadic router can also queue, transmit, and receive data independent of whether or not the host device  is available or even attached. The CPU  built into the nomadic router  provides all necessary computing routines to be a fully functional network co-processor independent of the host CPU. This will allow increased battery for the user since the nomadic router does not have numerous user I\/O devices as does the host device .","Location Independence","The instant network nomadic router provides the ability to provide ubiquitous and reliable support in a location independent fashion. This removes any burden on the user for device reconfiguration (e.g., IP address configuration, gateway or next hop router address, netmask, link level parameters, and security permissions) or data transmission.","The problem with existing protocol stacks is that communicating devices have to be reconfigured every time the communication environment changes. TCP\/IP requires a new network, node and gateway number. Appletalk will automatically choose an unused node number and discover the network number, but all open communications are lost and services have to be restarted to begin using the new information.","This occurs, for example, when a PowerBook is plugged into a network, put to sleep, and then powered up in a different network. All network services, are restarted upon wakeup, and network applications get confused if they, are not restarted. The nomadic router solves this problem by providing temporary as well as permanent network and node numbers similar, to that provided by Mobile IP. However, the nomadic router will also work with other protocol stacks (e.g., AppleTalk).","Mobile IP provides location independence at the network level and not at the link level. All link level parameters, which are device specific, will be automatically configured as illustrated in  when a new communications (network interface) device is attached to the nomadic router. The nomadic router completely eliminates the need for manual configuration by adaptively supporting device independence.","A problem with existing routers today is that they require manual configuration and exist external to the node. To overcome this, the nomadic router can support automatic configuration and full router functionality internally. This allows a mobile or nomadic node to adapt to various communication and network devices dynamically, such as when the user plugs in a PCMCIA card or attaches a communications device to the serial port.","Once the nomadic router becomes aware of the available communication devices and activates them, the transport of data across the multiple communication substrates can take place. The unique algorithm and protocol in the nomadic router which chooses the most appropriate device to use, is shown in  and  as part of the nomadic router Device Checker through the \u201cnomadic router Device Selection\u201d across each interface.","There are numerous factors that can affect the selection of utilizing one or more devices. Such factors typically include available bandwidth, cost to initiate and maintain connection, power requirements and availability, and user's preference.","Another feature of the nomadic router is the support for alternate or simultaneous use of various communication substrates. This is performed as part of step  in  when the source address is that of the communication substrate that the nomadic router is going to send the packet out on. Host computers will now indirectly be able to utilize two or more communication substrates, either to increase throughput or to provide soft-, handoff capability.","This functionality is not supported in today's typical protocol stacks (e.g., TCP\/IP or AppleTalk). Once the nomadic router becomes aware of the available communication devices and activates them, the transport of data across the multiple communication substrates can take place. The unique algorithm and protocol in the nomadic router which chooses the most appropriate device to use is part of the \u201cnomadic router Device Checker\u201d through the \u201cnomadic router Device Selection\u201d across each interface.","There are numerous factors that can affect the selection of utilizing one or more devices. Such factors typically include available bandwidth, cost to initiate and maintain connection, power requirements and availability, and user's preference.","Apparatus Packaging","As described above, the nomadic router can be packaged in several different hardware configurations. The nomadic router can be embedded in the host computer, or network device such as a switch or router. It can also be implemented as a PCMCIA card which plugs into the host computer or as self-contained external box.","Each nomadic router can have from one to many interfaces. If the router  is put into the network infrastructure, it doesn't have to be carried around with the mobile user. As shown in , the nomadic router  is attached to a Local Area Network (LAN) of the network infrastructure which constitutes the communications device  through the system interface . The LAN  is connected through a conventional router  to the interne . In this case, the host computer interface of the nomadic router  is not needed since packets from the host computer  are received through the LAN .","To provide a secure interface between the host computer  and network  to prevent host computers from being able to watch (sniff) packets on the network , the nomadic router  can have one interface to the host computer  (terminal interface ) and a second interface () to the network  as shown in , and provide filtering to which packets and retransmitted between the various interfaces thus providing a firewall type of security device but which operates internally on the network.","In order to support multiple host computers , with a single nomadic router , the nomadic router  may have multiple host interfaces , . . . , as shown in and in  and a network or system interface ","If the nomadic router is carried around by the mobile user, it can take the form of a PCMCIA card. In , the nomadic router  is implemented as a PCMCIA card. The processing and translation capability is stored inside the card and the interface to the host computer  is through a PCMCIA BUS interface or communication card .","As shown in , the PCMCIA card can fit in a type III slot where there is a connector on the nomadic router  which accepts the communication card  (a type II PCMCIA card.) In this mode, the nomadic router doesn't not have to have the communication device specific components inside the PCMCIA card.","The nomadic router  can also take the form of a type II PCMCIA card. In this form, the communication device or card  plugs into the opposite end of the nomadic router card  as illustrated in .","Translation Operation of the Nomadic Router","Initialization and Self Configuration","The nomadic router initialization and self configuration process provides the means by which the nomadic router is able to learn about the host computer and network so it knows what translation is necessary.","Host Learning","The nomadic router  is able to learn about how the host computer  is configured by looking at the content of the packets being sent from the host computer . Rather than the host computer  sending packets directly to the router  or other network device, which is what it is initially configured to do, the nomadic router  is able redirect all outbound packets from the host computer  to itself. This redirection can be accomplished in several ways as described below.","1. Proxy ARP Packet Interception and Host Reconfiguration","Whenever a host computer  has an IP packet which it needs to send to a router  or other network device, it uses the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to obtain the link layer Media Access Control address (MAC address). As illustrated in , when the host computer  broadcasts and ARP request for the MAC address of a destination node, the nomadic router  receives this ARP request broadcast and responds with its MAC address (not that of the destination node).","When the host computer  receives this ARP reply from the nomadic router , which contains the MAC address of the nomadic router , the host computer  will cache this MAC address in the host computer  and send all packets destined for the configured router or network device to the nomadic router . The host computer  will think that the MAC address is that of the configured IP network device, but in reality, the nomadic router  is pretending (proxying) to be the device (its home gateway) that the host computer  expects to find.","The nomadic router  is also able to reconfigure and intercept return packets from a router or other network device using the same process.","2. Promiscuous Mode Packet Interception","Since the MAC address is cached in the host computer  for a short period of time, the host computer  will not send out a new ARP request to obtain the MAC address again unless a timeout period occurs or the cache is cleared such as when the computer  is restarted.","When a conventional network device receives or hears a packet with a MAC address which does not match its own, it will ignore or drop the packet. Since it is possible to rapidly switch from one network environment to another using a portable computer, the nomadic router  must be able to intercept packets even when the MAC address is not that of the nomadic router's home gateway or device.","This is accomplished by placing the nomadic router's network connection in promiscuous mode. In this mode, the network connection on the nomadic router accepts all packets being transmitted on the communication link, not just ones being broadcasted or addressed specifically to it.","3. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Service","A host computer is able to utilize the DHCP service to obtain the configuration information rather than being manually configured. The host computer utilizing the DHCP service requires that a DHCP server be installed on the network segment to which it is currently attached. If the host computer  is utilizing this service and requests configuration information using DHCP, the nomadic router  will intercept these requests and respond with configuration information for the host computer  to use.","Network Learning","The nomadic router is able to learn about the network environment it is currently attached using several different methods as described below.","1. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)","Whenever a different network connection is connected on the nomadic router, it will broadcast a DHCP request to obtain configuration information for the current network. If no DHCP service is available on the network, it will switch to another method to learn about the network configuration.","2. Router Information Packets","Routers on the network will periodically broadcast router information packets which are used to build routing tables and allow routers to adapt to changes in the network. The nomadic router  will listen on the network for these router information packets. When one is received, it will extract out the configuration information from these packets.","3. Passive Listening","By placing the nomadic router's network connection in promiscuous mode, where is receives all packets not just ones destined for it, it is able to examine all packets on the network to discover how the network is configured. It is also able to determine the IP addresses used on the local area network and which machines are routers by the final destination address not being the next hop address.","Using this method, the nomadic router  is passively able to learn how the network is configured and will elect to use an unused IP address. If that IP address does become used by another network device, it will switch over to another unused IP address.","4. Manual Configuration","The network configuration information can be manually configured in the nomadic router . This information can be set using an embedded web server, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) tools, an application running on one of the computers in the network, or other suitable means. When manual configuration is used to set the network information, the nomadic router  will still learn about the host information automatically and provide all the translation capabilities so the host computers do not have to be aware of the correct network information of the LAN to which they are currently connected.","Packet Translation","The nomadic router's packet translation function provides a mapping between location and service dependent configurations used by the host computer  and that used by the network  to which it is currently attached. For outbound traffic from the host; computer  to the network , the translation function changes the content of the packet such as the source address, checksum, and application specific parameters, causing all packets sent out to the network  be directed back to the nomadic router  rather than to the host computer .","The inbound traffic from the network  arriving at the nomadic router , which is really for the host computer , is passed through the translation function so the host computer  thinks that the replies were sent directly to it. The host computer  will be completely unaware of all the translation being performed by the nomadic router .","The translation functions works as illustrated in and . In these figures, the operations performed in the OSI\/ISO model application, transport, network, link and physical layers are illustrated in rows opposite the layer designations. The operations performed by the host computer , nomadic router  and network  are illustrated in columns below the device designations.","The host computer  will generate network packets using the current configuration stored in the host computer  using the standard protocol stack as shown in step . This configuration information is either manually configured in the host computer  or obtained using DHCP.","As shown in step , when the host computer  addresses the link level destination address, the address automatically obtained using the Proxy ARP packet interception routine described earlier, this will cause the host computer  to send the packet to the network address of its standard router or home gateway device, but using the link level address of the nomadic router .","In step , the packet is transmitted across the standard physical connection between the host computer  and nomadic router . As shown in step , the nomadic router  will receive the packet at the link level either due to the Proxy ARP function which reconfigured the host computer's MAC address, or the nomadic router  will have the link level in promiscuous mode which it will cause it to receive the packet even if destined to a different MAC address.","Once the packet is passed to the network layer, shown in step , the nomadic router translation function will modify the content of the packet to change the source address to that match of the nomadic router's address instead of the host computer's address. It will also translate other location dependent information such as the name of the local Domain Name Service (DNS) server. When translating the DNS packet, it will change the source address to that of the nomadic router's address and the destination address to that of a local DNS server.","Once the network layer translation is complete, the packet can be translated at the application and transport layers. The application layer is translated next, as shown in step , since the transport layer requires a pseudo network layer header which includes the source and destination addresses and the content from the application layer.","At the application layer translation, any addresses which describe the source address of the host computer, such as with FTP, are translated to be that of the nomadic router's address. Any application layer destination addresses, such as a local proxy server, are translated to match that of the server running on the current network.","Once this application translation is complete, the transport layer, as shown in step , can complete the checksum and any port number manipulation. The port number is manipulated if more than one host computer  is attached to the nomadic router . Each host computer  when it sends out a request using a specific port is translated to match an available inbound port on the nomadic router .","The port number assigned for use with each host computer  is stored in a table in the nomadic router  and is utilized with the reply packet described later. Finally the packet is sent out over the network  in step .","When a reply packet comes in from the network , as shown in step , the nomadic router  will receive the packet. In step , the nomadic router  will perform the reverse network layer translation to set the destination address to that of the host computer rather  than the nomadic router's address, and any source address to that replaced by the nomadic router  in step .","Once this network translation is complete, the packet is translated at the application layer, as shown in step , to change the destination address to that of the host computer  and the source address to the original destination address stored from step . In step , any port manipulation performed in step  is changed to the original setting and a new checksum is computed. Finally, as shown in step , the packet is sent to the host computer  which then processes the packet normally.","Options of the Nomadic Router","By way of motivation, many communication infrastructures are varied and fragmented, and this problem is likely to be exacerbated as more technologies are introduced. For example, high performance LANs, wireless services, cellular telephony, satellite, ubiquitous paging networks, all provide varying degrees of coverage, cost and bandwidth\/delay characteristics.","Nomadic Intranet","The Nomadic Intranet provides all network, server type, services for users who which to dynamically create an ad hoc network. This is similar to the instant network nomadic router except the nomadic intranet is a single device with multiple ports into which laptop\/devices can be plugged. The instant network nomadic router is distributed to (one per) each host device. The nomadic intranet not only provides ad hoc networking but can also provide services such as temporary file storage, protocol conversion, act as a print server, and provide other services described as part of the Basic nomadic router.","Fixed Nomadic Router","The Fixed nomadic router provides the same basic functionality and architecture as the portable nomadic router but is stored in one location. The fixed nomadic router acts as a surrogate or \u201cHome Agent\u201d for the user when he\/she is away on travel. When the user wishes to register or utilize their host device elsewhere in the network, the portable nomadic router will register with the fixed nomadic router where it is temporarily attached to the network so information can be forwarded to the user's new location. The fixed nomadic router can also be used to house the master copy of the user's E-mail for the nomadic E-mail service, or files for the nomadic file synchronizer.","Mobile Virtual Private Network","The nomadic router provides the mapping between the location based IP address used in the internet today and the permanent user based address housed in the host CPU. This mapping is done without support or knowledge of such mapping by the host CPU or user. The Internet RFC 2002 Mobile IP protocol specifies the mapping between permanent and temporary IP addresses. The unique aspect of the nomadic router is that the Mobile IP protocols are not necessarily running in, or supported by, the host CPU but rather are internal to the nomadic router.","By implementing this protocol as part of the translation function in the nomadic router, the nomadic router can encapsulate packets from the host computer and transmit them back to the fixed nomadic router which are sent out (un-encapsulated) on the native (home) network. Replies from the home network are received by the fixed nomadic router and are encapsulated and sent back to the nomadic router. When packets are transmitted between the nomadic router and fixed nomadic router, the packets are encrypted and sent using the Internet Tunneling Protocol.","Since the nomadic router provides location independence and the fixed nomadic router forwards all packets from a corresponding host to the host computer via the nomadic router, any changes in the location, failure of a network link, or attachment point of the mobile host computer does not cause any open session to be lost. This session loss prevention is possible since the fixed nomadic router pretends to be the mobile host computer, and the nomadic router pretends to be the home network. The fixed nomadic router and nomadic router translation functions hide the link and network loss from the transport and application session.","Communication between users and networks or online services may be effectuated through ports, for example, located within hotel rooms or multi-dwelling units, or through conventional dial-up communications, such as through the use of telephone or cable modems. According to one aspect of the invention, users can be are redirected to a portal page, as described below. After being redirected to the portal page, the user is subjected to a AAA process. Based upon the AAA process, the user may be permitted transparent access to the destination network or may be redirected to a login page in order to gather additional information to identify the user.","In order to allow a user of the computer to communicate transparently with computer networks  or online services , the gateway device must be able to communicate with the user computer, as well as the various online services  or networks . In order to support this communication, the gateway device  generally performs a packet translation function that is transparent to both the user and the network. In this regard, for outbound traffic from a computer to a network or on-line service, the gateway device  changes attributes within the packet coming from the user, such as the source address, checksum, and application specific parameters, to meet the criteria of the network to which the user has accessed. In addition, the outgoing packet includes an attribute that will direct all incoming packets from the accessed network to be routed through the gateway device. In contrast, the inbound traffic from the computer network or other online service that is routed through the gateway device undergoes a translation function at the gateway device so that the packets are properly formatted for the user's host computer. In this manner, the packet translation process that takes place at the gateway device  is transparent to the host, which appears to send and receive data directly from the accessed computer network. By implementing the gateway device as an interface between the user and the computer network or other online service, however, the user will eliminate the need to re-configure their computer  upon accessing subsequent networks as well as the need to load special configuration software on their computer to support the reconfiguration.","Identifying the user is crucial in authorizing access to networks or online services, as such services are typically provided for a fee and may be customized based upon the user, user's location, or user's computer. As such, the system of the present invention includes means for identifying a user based upon an attribute associated with the user that is contained within the packet transmitted from the user's computer. Attributes can include information such as the source, destination and type of traffic. In general, identifying a user's computer that accesses the network can be done by a MAC address associated with the user's computer. Identifying the a user accessing a network based upon a MAC address is well known to those of skill in the art, and will not be discussed in detail herein. Additionally, the attribute can be based upon a user name and ID, or according to one advantageous embodiment, a particular location, such as from a communications port in a hotel room. Such location-based identification in computer systems employing VLAN tagging and those not employing VLAN tagging according to the present invention will first be described. However, it should be appreciated that location based authorization is just one method of identifying a user which may be authenticated, authorized and accounted according to the present invention. As stated above, a user's computer can be identified based on a MAC address associated with the computer. A user can also be identified based upon a username and password. Additionally, a user can be identified according to a combination of these attributes.","The authentication capability can be based upon multiple methods. First, AAA can be done based upon where the traffic is originating, such as a location, computer, circuit, or user. Secondly, the authentication and authorization capability can be based upon the type of services the user is attempting to access, such as a destination address. This can be a destination port or Internet address, a TCP port, a network. Third, AAA can be based upon the content type or protocol being transmitted. For example, each packet can be filtered through the selective AAA process, so that a user can be authorized access to a particular location. Each time the user attempts to access a different location, the user is subject to the AAA, so the user may be prevented access from a particular site the AAA method deems inaccessible to the user based upon the user's authorization. Alternatively, the AAA method according to the present invention allows users to connect directly to a specific site, such as credit card or billing servers which collect billing information, which can indicate that the user has paid, so that the user is thereafter authorized access to networks. Additionally, a user's authorization can depend upon a specific time, so that the user can be kicked off a network at a specific time, after a specific time has elapsed, or according to other dynamic information determined by the network provider.","Therefore, AAA can be based upon the source, destination, and type of traffic. Upon receiving a packet, the AAA module will look at various parameters such as the link layer information, such as the circuit, source MAC address, VLAN tag, circuit ID, along with network information such as source IP addresses, source port. This source information is stored into a AAA subscriber table. Secondly, information is gathered about the destination, such as the destination IP addresses, destination port, to determine what type of authentication is needed to access particular services. Third, the packet is interrogated to receive information such as the protocol type, port or the packet type to determine what type of authentication is required for a packet to be authorized for network access. Once this information is gathered, a matching of the authentication requirements versus the authorization is applied. If there is a match, the packet is forwarded and allowed access. If this match fails, the subscriber information for that packet is set as pending for authorization. Pending for authorization packets require further authentication and authorization before being allowed to access the system. Authorization can be determined based upon the attributes determined by the packet, or if not matched, the user will have to provide authentication, which can be done as described in the HPR patent, U.S. Pat. No. 6,636,894, issued Oct. 21, 2003, filed Dec. 8, 1999, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods For Redirecting Users Having Transparent Computer Access To A Network Using A Gateway Device Having Redirection Capability\u201d, in the name of inventor Short et al. The '894 Short patent is herein incorporated by reference.","For example, once the gateway device identifies the location from which access is requested, such as from a specific port of a hotel room, the gateway device can then determine the access rights of the user at that specific location. It should be appreciated that as an alternative to location-based identification the gateway device may identify a user or a user's computer based upon attributes other than location. For example, the gateway device may receive a MAC address identifying a particular user's computer (for example, a user in communication with the gateway device through a conventional modem), as is well known in the art, although the embodiments described herein will refer primarily to location-based identification as described above. Additionally, a user can be identified by the gateway device based upon a user ID and password which the user can input in response to a query for such information. This is discussed below and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,636,894, issued Oct. 21, 2003, in the name inventor Short et al., entitled \u201cSystems and Methods For Redirecting Users Having Transparent Computer Access To A Network Using A Gateway Device Having Redirection Capability\u201d, filed concurrently with this application and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, a user staying in a particular hotel room may be authorized access based upon the user's location. Alternatively, the user can be authorized access to the network and online services based upon the user's identification, or the user's computer, regardless where the user is obtaining access. Furthermore, access may be associated with a combination of attributes. For example, a user may be authorized access to a network where the user has input the user's identification and has accessed the network from a particular room. Such a requirement could prevent unauthorized users also staying in a particular room from obtaining network access.","Regardless of the means in which access is obtained and an attribute associated with the user is identified, access rights of users are determined according to an AAA method implemented by a AAA server. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the AAA server is located entirely within the gateway device. Alternatively, the AAA server can also be located external to the gateway device.","One function of the AAA server is to identify the user in communication with the gateway device in a manner that is transparent to the user. That is, the user will not be required to reconfigure the computer or otherwise change the home network settings, and no additional configuration software will have to be added to the computer. After a packet is received by the gateway device, as described in detail above, information contained within the packet is stored within a subscription table. The subscription table is a database of user information. In particular, the subscription table can maintain any information or attribute known about a user, including a circuit ID or MAC address, such that a particular user or user location can be identified upon accessing the computer system. After a packet is received, and attributes associated with a user are obtained, information corresponding to the packet is received from the subscription table. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the packet may identify the location of the port from which access is obtained based upon location-based authorization, as described above, or a specific computer based upon a MAC address, as is well known in the art. Regardless of connection means however, any attribute or anything known about the user or location of the traffic, can be stored in the subscriber table. The subscription table and information stored therein may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, as well known in the art, that is either disposed within the gateway device or external.","After receiving a request for access from a user and identifying the user or location through the use of the subscription table, the AAA server then determines the access rights of the particular user. What is done with the user depends upon information contained in the user's profile. Profiles of all users (i.e., identified by MAC address or by location or by some other attribute) are stored in a user profile database, which may be located internal to or external to the gateway device. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that although the user profile database is discussed herein as being separate and distinct from the subscription table, the two databases may be combined into one database containing both user subscription data as well as user profile data.","The user's profile can contain information that is based upon the user or the user's location (as established by location-based identification), and generally includes information concerning the access rights of a user or location. For example, the user profile database may establish that a user with a given MAC address has purchased access, or that a given circuit ID has free access or unlimited access. Guests in a particular room or rooms of a hotel, for example, suites and penthouses, may receive free unlimited internet access. Therefore, access rights can be available contingent upon the user's location (e.g. room) or location status (e.g. suite). In this event, no further identification is required, as the location from which the users are requesting access is known to the gateway device and stored in the subscription table.","In addition to storing whether users have valid access rights, the user profile database can also include specialized access information particular to a specific location or user, such as the bandwidth of the user's access, or a homepage to which a user should be directed. For example, a user accessing the network from a penthouse may receive a higher access band rate than someone accessing the destination network from a typical hotel room. Additionally, a user profile can include historical data relating to a user's access to the network, including the amount of time a user has accessed the network. Such historical information can be used to determine any fees which may be charged to the user, or due from the user, for access. Specialized access information contained within the user profile may be established by the system administrator, or by the user who has purchased or otherwise established access to the network. For example, where a user is transparently accessing the gateway device from a hotel room, the hotel network administrator may enter user access information into the profile database based upon access rights associated with a room in the hotel. This can also be done automatically by the gateway device or a local management system, such as a hotel property management system, when the user checks into his or her room. Additionally, the user may establish the information to be contained within the profile database upon first accessing the gateway device, as will be described in detail below. For instance, a new user may be directed to enter their credit card number to obtain access to the system. Whereas the subscription table initially identifies the user and maintains location information, the user profile database includes information concerning the details of the user's access privileges, as well as any specialized information for each user.","As noted above, user profile database can be maintained within the gateway device, or it can be located external to the gateway device. For example, where a hotel wishes to establish transparent network access for customers from hotel rooms, the hotel may maintain the profile database locally within the gateway device. Alternatively, if external to the gateway device, the profile database will can contain the same information and be accessed by the gateway device to ascertain user's access rights. According to one embodiment of the invention, the profile database can be maintained outside of the gateway device by an internet service provider.","Upon receiving the location of a port or identity of a user transparently communicating with the gateway device, the AAA server compares the identification information contained within the packet to user profile information stored within the user profile database. This comparison may be accomplished using a computer having an operating system and software therein for comparing identification information in the received packet to records stored within the user profile database. Where users are not identified automatically based upon their location, the users may be required to identify themselves using a login and ID, so that their identification can be compared to user profiles stored within the user profile database. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the AAA server could query the user's computer, and more specifically, the user's browser, to obtain identification information stored therein so that the AAA server does not have to query a user for user information, thereby further making the AAA process of the present invention transparent to the user.","The user profile database may comprise programmable storage means located on a conventional personal computer, mainframe computer, or another suitable storage device known in the art. Additionally, the means for comparing the received data to the data within the database can comprise any software, such as an executable software program, which can compare data. For example, the AAA server may store user profiles on a hard drive of a personal computer, and the means for comparing the received user data to the user profiles resident on the computer can include computer software, such as Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Excel is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.). According to another embodiment of the invention, the AAA server can comprise a remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS), which is a well known authentication and accounting system used by a number of network service providers (NSPs).","Once a user's profile has been determined by access to the user's profile in the user database, three possible actions can result. Specifically, once a user's profile has been retrieved the AAA server may determine a user to have access, to be pending or in progress, or to not have access.","First, a user is deemed valid (i.e., to have access) where the user's profile in the user profile database states so. If a user is determined to be valid, the user's traffic can be allowed to proceed out of the gateway device from the portal page to the networks or online services the user wishes to access, or the user may be redirected to a portal page, typically, a more user-specific portal page, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,636,894, issued Oct. 21, 2003, in the name inventor Short et al., entitled \u201cSystems and Methods For Redirecting Users Having Transparent Computer Access To A Network Using A Gateway Device Having Redirection Capability, (hereinafter \u201cRedirecting Application\u201d) filed concurrently herewith, prior to being allowed access to the destination network. For example, a user may be automatically forwarded to a user-input destination address, such as an Internet address, for example, where a user has free access associated with the user's hotel room. Alternatively, this may occur where the user has already purchased access and the user has not exhausted available access time.","If the second scenario occurs, in which the user is deemed pending or \u2018in progress\u2019, the user may take steps to become authenticated so that the user's information may be recorded in the user profile database and the user is deemed valid. For example, a user may have to enter into a purchase agreement, requiring the user to enter a credit card number. If the user needs to purchase access, or if the system needs additional information about the user, the user can be redirected from the portal page via Home Page Redirect (HPR) and Stack Address Translation (SAT) to a location, such as a login page, established to validate new users. SAT and HPR can intervene to direct the user to a webserver (external or internal) where the user has to login and identify themselves. This process is described in detail below and in more detail in the Redirecting Application.","According to one illustrative example, a user profile database is maintained by an ISP which may be associated with the computer network for providing Internet service to those users on the network. Although unlimited access could be granted to users based on their location or MAC address, access may also be limited based on the access for which a user has paid. For example, the user profile database may route a user to a login page, where the user must enter user data, such as a user id and password. In this embodiment, a network access server (NAS) , located within the gateway device , can receive user data. Upon receiving user data representing the identity of a user attempting to access the network, a primary function of the NAS  is to grant or deny the user access to the network.","Although the NAS  grants and denies access to users, the NAS  does not determine whether each user is allowed to connect to the network and, if so, what type of connection should be established. Rather, these determinations are made by the AAA server , described in detail above. Upon receiving user data the NAS  can, if necessary, reconfigure the data such that the data will be in the proper format to be received by the AAA server . In addition to reconfiguring the user data, the NAS  can also encrypt the user data such that the user identity and password will be protected during transmission to the AAA server . After reconfiguration, and optionally, encryption, the NAS  transmits the data to the AAA server  with a query to request that the AAA server  authenticate the user","The AAA server  stores user profiles corresponding to users authorized to access the network. The user profiles typically include user identifications, passwords, access authorization, billing, and other pertinent user information. The AAA server  compares stored user profiles with the user data received from the gateway device  to determine if the user should be granted access to the network. As such, the AAA server  generally comprises a database and data storage means. According to one embodiment of the invention, the AAA server  is maintained by an ISP. In this embodiment, the user profiles stored by the AAA server  establish those users that can obtain Internet access via the ISP network. The ISP edits user profiles within the AAA server  to reflect those users who may become authorized or unauthorized to access the network.","Continuing with the illustrative example, the ISP may only register user profiles in the authentication database after users have been identified by the ISP and necessary billing information, such as addresses and credit card numbers, have been submitted. If the ISP has not posted a user profile in the AAA server  at the time of authentication, the user will not be permitted access to the network. If this occurs, the user may be asked to submit profile information to the ISP so that the ISP can add the user's profile to the AAA server . Furthermore, this may also be done the first time a user attempts to access the gateway device . The information may be entered by the user with the aid of webpage, a pop-up control panel or user interface, which can open when the user initially connects to the gateway device , as effectuated by HPR and SAT. As will be discussed below, the gateway device can request user information and forward it to the ISP such that the user does not know an ISP is receiving the information.","In an embodiment, the AAA server  is located outside of the gateway device, although it may alternatively be located within the gateway device. For example, the location of the AAA server  may be such that the NAS  communicates with the AAA server  via internet protocol. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the AAA server  may be located at any internet address and stored on any computer accessible via internet protocol. Locating the AAA server  outside the network can provide a number of advantages. First, the administrative burden on the network is alleviated because the network does not have to set up and maintain separate authentication databases on each network or gateway device. This is especially important because each gateway device  allows a finite number of users to access the network, so that multiple gateway devices may be required. Secondly, administering and maintaining one consolidated database of authentication data is easier than multiple smaller databases.","Referring again to the illustrative AAA example, after any requisite reconfiguration, the NAS  can transmit user data to the AAA server  with a query to request that the AAA server  authenticate the user. The AAA server  receives the user data and then compares the received user data to user profiles stored within its database. Where a customer is not identified by location, establishing access to the gateway device will typically involve a process in which a user must enter their identity and a password, and in some instances a desired billing scheme and service level as offered by the gateway administrator or network operator (information hereinafter collectively referred to as user data). Additionally, the user data can include information such as a user's social security number and a credit card number. As described briefly above and in more detail below, the gateway device can direct the user to a webpage that requests desired data. However, where the customer is identified by location, the customer may only have to choose connection options, such as fixed fee or pay-per-use access, or a particular baud rate where the user can pay a premium for a higher speed connection, as the identity of the user may be known based upon location, and the user's payment information may already be known, such as where access is obtained via a port in a hotel room.","Assuming that a user has been deemed pending or \u2018in progress\u2019, the gateway device typically presents users with a login page that enables new users to subscribe to the computer network so that they may subsequently obtain transparent access to networks or online services transparently through the gateway device. To direct the users to a login page the AAA server calls upon a HPR function. The HPR directs the user to the login page, and after the user has entered requisite information into the login page, the AAA server adds the new information to the customer profile database and can direct the user to the user's desired destination, such as an Internet address, or a portal page created by the network provider or users. Thus, new users can gain access to networks or online services without being predefined in the user profile database.","Because the gateway device is transparent to the user, the user communicates with the gateway device without the user's knowledge. This transparent communication results in a plug and play capability which enables a user to plug a computer into a port and directly access the internet or another online service without reconfiguring his or her computer from the home network settings resident on the computer and without requiring additional software to be loaded on the user computer. Therefore, the functions of the AAA server, and of HPR can be completely transparent to the user. For example, utilizing the system and method of the present invention, a user who has not purchased network access, and does not receive free network access, can plug into a port of the computer network and request connection to an Internet address through the user's Internet browser. After being directed to a portal page, the AAA server, unbeknownst to the user, identifies this user as pending (i.e., no information for that user has been identified in the user profile database), and calls upon the HPR function to send the user from the portal page to a login page which is different from the destination address initially entered by the user. Specifically, the HPR function as well as the SAT, discussed below, are performed by the AAA server and\/or gateway device.","In an embodiment, the redirection is accomplished by a Home Page Redirect (HPR) performed by the gateway device, a AAA server, or by a portal page redirect unit located internal to or external to the gateway device. To achieve this redirection, HPR utilizes a SAT operation to direct the user from a portal page to a new destination at which a login page is presented, which is preferably local to the gateway device so that the redirection will be efficient and fast. This is accomplished by redirecting the user to a protocol stack using network and port address translation to the portal server that can be internal to the computer network or gateway device. More specifically, the AAA server receives the user's Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request for a web page and sends back the HTTP response reversing the network and port address translation the portal server, essentially acting as a transparent \u2018go-between\u2019 to the user and new webserver. It will be appreciated, however, that to receive the HTTP request the AAA server must initially open a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the another server in line with the user-requested internet address.","According to one aspect of the present invention, when a user initially attempts to access a destination location, the gateway device, AAA server or portal page redirect unit receives this request and routes the traffic to a protocol stack on a temporary server, which can be local to the gateway device. This can occur where a user initially opens a web browser resident on the user's computer and attempts to access a destination address, such as an Internet site. The destination address can also include any address accessible via the network or an online service, and can include the portal page. The protocol stack can pretend to be the user-entered destination location long enough to complete a connection or \u2018handshake\u2019. Thereafter, this protocol stack directs the user to the portal server, which can be local to the gateway device to facilitate higher speed communication. The redirection to the portal server can be accomplished by redirecting web pages only, rather than all traffic, including E-mails, FTPs, or any other traffic. Therefore, once authorized, if a user does not attempt to access a webpage through the user's interne browser, the gateway device can forward the communication transparently to the user's requested destination without requiring the user to access the portal page. Furthermore, according to one aspect of the invention specific user-input destination addresses may be authorized to pass through the gateway device without being redirected.","Furthermore, redirecting the user to a portal page can comprise redirecting the user to a portal page created by an administrator associated with the portal page, or redirecting the user to a portal page customized by the user.","The portal page can also be specialized based on the user, user's location, user's computer, or any combination thereof. For example, assuming that the user has been authenticated and has authorization, the gateway device can present users with a portal page that identifies, among other things, the online services or other computer networks that are accessible via the gateway device. In addition, the portal page presented by the gateway device can provide information regarding the current parameters or settings that will govern the access provided to the particular user. As such, the gateway administrator can readily alter the parameters or other settings in order to tailor the service according to their particular application. Typically, changes in the parameters or other settings that will potentially utilize additional resources of the computer system will come at a cost, such that the gateway administrator will charge the user a higher rate for their service. For example, a user may elect to increase the transfer rate at which signals are transmitted across the computer network and pay a correspondingly higher price for the expedited service.","After receiving the user's login information, the AAA server will create a user profile utilizing this information so that the user will be able to obtain immediate access to the network next time the user logs in without being required to enter login information again. The AAA server can create a profile for the user in a locally stored user profile database, as described above, or can update the user profile in a database external to the gateway device. Regardless of the location of the user profile, the next time the user attempts to login the user's profile will be located in the user profile database, the user's access rights determined, and the user allowed transparent access to networks or services.","Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.","Systems and Methods for Redirecting Users Having Transparent Computer Access to a Network Using a Gateway Device Having Redirection Capability","Systems and methods for dynamically creating new users having transparent computer access to a destination network, wherein the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings. The system includes a gateway device for receiving a request from a user for access to the destination network, a user profile database comprising stored access information and in communication with the gateway device, and an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server in communication with the gateway device and user profile database. The AAA server determines if user is entitled to access the destination network based upon the access information stored within the user profile database, and wherein the AAA server redirects the user to a login page where the access information does not indicate the user's right to access the destination network. The systems and methods of the present invention can also redirect users having transparent computer access to a destination network, wherein the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings.","In order for a computer to function properly in a network environment, the computer must be appropriately configured. Among other things, this configuration process establishes the protocol and other parameters by which the computer transmits and receives data. In one common example, a plurality of computers are networked to create a local area network (LAN). In the LAN, each computer must be appropriately configured in order to exchange data over the network. Since most networks are customized to meet a unique set of requirements, computers that are part of different networks are generally configured in different manners in order to appropriately communicate with their respective networks.","While desktop computers generally remain a part of the same network for a substantial period of time, laptops, handhelds, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellphones or other portable computers (collectively \u201cportable computers\u201d) are specifically designed to be transportable. As such, portable computers are connected to different networks at different times depending upon the location of the computer. In a common example in which the portable computer serves as an employee's desktop computer, the portable computer is configured to communicate with their employer's network, i.e., the enterprise network. When the employee travels, however, the portable computer may be connected to different networks that communicate in different manners. In this regard, the employee may connect the portable computer to the network maintained by an airport, a hotel, a cellular telephone network operator or any other locale in order to access the enterprise network, the Internet or some other on-line service. The portable computer is also commonly brought to the employee's residence where it is used to access various networks, such as, the enterprise network, a home network, the Internet and the like. Since these other networks are configured somewhat differently, however, the portable computer must also be reconfigured in order to properly communicate with these other networks. Typically, this configuration is performed by the user each time the portable computer is connected to a different network. As will be apparent, this repeated reconfiguration of the portable computer is not only quite time consuming, but is also prone to errors. The reconfiguration procedure may even be beyond the capabilities of many users or in violation of their employer's IT policy. Importantly, special software must also typically be loaded onto the user's computer to support reconfiguration.","As described by U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/816,174 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60\/111,497, 60\/160,973, 60\/161,189, 60\/161,139, 60\/160,890 and 60\/161,182, a universal subscriber gateway device has been developed by Nomadix, Inc. of Westlake Village, Calif. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference. The gateway device serves as an interface connecting the user to a number of networks or other online services. For example, the gateway device can serve as a gateway to the Internet, the enterprise network, or other networks and\/or on-line services. In addition to serving as a gateway, the gateway device automatically adapts to a computer, in order that it may communicate with the new network in a manner that is transparent both to the user and the new network. Once the gateway device has appropriately adapted to the user's computer, the computer can appropriately communicate via the new network, such as the network at a hotel, at home, at an airport, or any other location, in order to access other networks, such as the enterprise network, or other online services, such as the Internet.","The portable computer user, and more specifically the remote or laptop user, benefits from being able to access a myriad of computer networks without having to undergo the time-consuming and all-too-often daunting task of reconfiguring their host computer in accordance with network specific configurations. In addition, no additional software need be loaded onto the computer prior to connection to the other network. From another perspective, the network service provider benefits from avoiding \u201con-site\u201d visits and\/or technical support calls from the user who is unable to properly re-configure the portable computer. In this fashion, the gateway device is capable of providing more efficient network access and network maintenance to the user and the network operator.","Gateway devices are typically used to provide network access to the remote portable computer user, such as users in hotels, airports and other location where the remote portable computer user may reside. Additionally, gateway devices have found wide-spread use in multi-resident dwellings as a means of providing the residents an intranet that networks the residents, broadband Internet access and the capability to adapt to the variances of the resident's individual enterprise network needs. With the advent of even smaller portable computing devices, such as handhelds, PDAs, and the like, the locations where these users may reside become almost limitless.","Through gateway devices Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or enterprise network (such as a LAN established by an entity such as a hotel) providers can permit a wide variety of users simple and transparent access to their networks and to other online services. To take advantage of transparent user access to their computer networks and online services enterprise networks or ISPs should be able to redirect users to portal pages that the enterprise or internet service providers wish the user to access or view. For instance, where users are located at an airport, the enterprise network administrator may wish to direct users to a portal page containing arrival and departure information, or to a portal page having the user's itinerary thereon to provide the user an incentive to access the network. ISPs, for example, may wish users to access the ISPs portal page for up to the date news and weather, information regarding the user's Internet service, and paid advertisements.","Homepage redirection has been accomplished in the prior art. For example, America Online (AOL) users, upon accessing the internet, are directed to an AOL homepage from which the users can select a variety of AOL services, and which includes advertising from various companies. Typically, direction of users to such a page benefits the ISP because advertisers pay money to the ISP each time a user accesses the Internet, as subscribers are a captive audience to advertising. Advertisers pay for such advertising not only because of the captive audience, but because advertisers can tailor advertisements based upon the typical audience accessing the internet. Furthermore, AOL may market its services through its homepage, and its homepage may be attractive to potential subscribers. Directing users to a particular page may serve an additional function. Users may be directed to a particular page, such as a login page, so that the user may enter login information to be authenticated and authorized access on the network. Furthermore, users may wish to establish their own specialized portal page, such as a page including favorite links, a page linking the user to the user's business, or a page including any other items relevant to the user.","However, such redirection of users to homepages has been traditionally based upon software installed on a user's computer and\/or configurations of user computers in communication with a home network. For example, where a user's computer is appropriately configured for access to a home network, the user's computer can be configured to access a particular homepage on that network. This can be the case, for example, in businesses where users computers are configured to access an intranet homepage or an internet page specific to that company and located on the internet.","Therefore, a method and system would be desirable which enables a user transparent access to a computer network employing a gateway device where the computer network can provide access to users and direct the users to portal pages established by the user, network administrator or another entity, where the direction is preferably based upon attributes associated with a user, such as the user's location, identity, computer, or a combination thereof. Furthermore, such redirection should be able to redirect users to a login page when the user does not otherwise have access to online services or networks so that the user may login to be authenticated and authorized access on the network.","The present invention comprises a method and system for redirecting users to a portal page where users have transparent access to a computer network utilizing a gateway device. The method and system advantageously operates in a manner transparent to the user since the user need not reconfigure their computer and no additional software need be added to the computer for reconfiguration purposes.","According to the invention, users accessing the gateway device are redirected to a portal page. Where stored user profiles permit the users access to the destination network, the users can be forwarded to the destination network or a portal page established by the network, user, or another entity. Otherwise, users are directed to a login page in which the users must input user information so that the users can obtain access to networks and online services. The redirection function according to the present invention can be utilized to direct new or existing users to customized homepages established by the gateway device or individual users.","A method for dynamically creating new users having transparent computer access to a destination network is disclosed, wherein the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings. The method includes receiving at a gateway device a request from a user for access to a destination network, determining if the user is entitled access to the destination network based upon a user profile corresponding to the user and stored within a user profile database in communication with the gateway device, and redirecting the user to a login page when the user profile does not include rights to access the destination network. Furthermore, the method of the present invention can include the step of forwarding the user to the destination network when the user profile includes rights to access the destination network. The method can also include the step of automatically redirecting the user to a portal page following receipt of a request for access to the destination network prior to determining if the user is entitled access to the destination network","According to one aspect of the invention, the method can include the step of establishing a login page on a webserver local to the gateway device prior to redirecting the user to the login page. The method can also include accepting user information at the login page which is thereafter utilized by the gateway device to authorize the user access to the destination network. The user profile database can be updated with the user information.","According to another aspect of the invention, the user may be forwarded from the login page and returned to a portal page or directed to a destination address which can be an Internet destination address. Redirecting the user to a login page can include redirecting a browser located on the user's computer to the login page. Furthermore, redirecting the browser located on the user's computer can include receiving a Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request for the destination address and responding with an HTTP response corresponding to the login page.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a system for dynamically creating new users having transparent computer access to a destination network is disclosed, wherein the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings. The system includes a gateway device for receiving a request from a user for access to the destination network, and a user profile database comprising stored access information and in communication with the gateway device. The system further includes an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server in communication with the gateway device and user profile database, where the AAA server determines if a user is entitled to access the destination network based upon the access information stored within the user profile database, and wherein the AAA server redirects the user to a login page where the access information does not indicate the user's right to access the destination network. The system can also direct the user to a portal page upon the user's access to the network, prior to determining the access rights of the user.","According to one aspect of the invention, the login page is maintained local to the gateway device. The user profile database and AAA server can also be located within the gateway device. Furthermore, the user profile database can be located within the AAA server.","According to another embodiment of the invention, the user profile database includes a plurality of user profiles, wherein each respective user profile of the plurality of user profiles contains access information. In addition, each respective user profile may contain historical data relating to the duration of destination network access for use in determining the charges due for the destination network access.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a method for redirecting users having transparent computer access to a destination network is disclosed, wherein the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings. The method includes receiving at a gateway device a request from a user for access to a destination address, such as an Internet address, and redirecting the user to a portal page, wherein the user computer remains configured for accessing the home network, and wherein no additional configuration software need be installed on the user's computer. Furthermore, redirecting the user to a portal page can comprise redirecting the user to a portal page created by an administrator associated with the portal page, or redirecting the user to a portal page customized by the user.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a system for redirecting users having transparent computer access to a destination network is disclosed, where the users otherwise have access to a home network through home network settings resident on the users' computers, and wherein the users can access the destination network without altering the home network settings.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Referring now to , a computer system  including a gateway device  is depicted in block diagram form. The computer system  typically includes a plurality of computers  that access a computer network in order to gain access to networks  or other online services . For example, the computers  can be plugged into ports that are located in different rooms of a hotel, business, or a multi-dwelling unit. Alternatively, the computers  can be plugged into ports in an airport, an arena, or the like. The gateway device  provides an interface between the plurality of computers  and the various networks  or other online services . One embodiment of a gateway device has been described by the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/816,174.","Most commonly, the gateway device  is located near the computers  at a relatively low position in the overall network (i.e., the gateway device  will be located within the hotel, multi-unit residence, airport, etc.). However, the gateway device  can be located at a higher position in the system by being located closer to the various networks  or other online services , if so desired. For example, the gateway device  could be located at a network operating center or could be located before or after a router  in the computer network. Although the gateway device  can be physically embodied in many different fashions, the gateway device  typically includes a controller and a memory device in which software is stored that defines the operational characteristics of the gateway device . Alternatively, the gateway device  can be embedded within another network device, such as an access concentrator  or a router . Moreover, the software that defines the functioning of the gateway device  can be stored on a PCMCIA card that can be inserted into a computer of the plurality of computers  in order to automatically reconfigure the computer to communicate with a different computer system, such as the networks  and online services .","The computer system  typically includes an access concentrator  positioned between the computers  and the gateway device  for multiplexing the signals received from the plurality of computers onto a link to the gateway device . Depending upon the medium by which the computers  are connected to the access concentrator, the access concentrator  can be configured in different manners. For example, the access concentrator can be a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) for signals transmitted via regular telephone lines, a cable head end for signals transmitted via coaxial cables, a wireless access point (WAP) for signals transmitted via a wireless network, a cable modem termination shelf (CMTS), a switch or the like. As also shown in , the computer system  typically includes one or more routers  and\/or servers (not shown in ) to control or direct traffic to and from a plurality of computer networks  or other online services . While the computer system  is depicted to have a single router, the computer system  can have a plurality of routers, switches, bridges, or the like that are arranged in some hierarchical fashion in order to appropriately traffic to and from the various networks  or online services . In this regard, the gateway device  typically establishes a link with one or more routers. The routers, in turn, establish links with the servers of other networks or other online service providers, such as internet service providers, based upon the user's selection. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that one or more devices illustrated in  may be combinable. For example, although not shown, the router  may be located entirely within the gateway device .","The gateway device  of the present invention is specifically designed to adapt to the configuration of each of the computers  that log onto the computer system  in a manner that is transparent to the user and the computer networks  or online services . In the embodiment shown in , the computer system  employs dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) service, which is a protocol well known to those of skill in the art and currently implemented in many computer networks. In DHCP networks an IP address is assigned to an individual computer of the plurality of computers  when the computer logs onto the computer network through communication with the gateway device . The DHCP service can be provided by an external DHCP server  or it can be provided by an internal DHCP server located within the gateway device.","In order to allow a user of the computer to communicate transparently with computer networks  or online services , the gateway device must be able to communicate with the user computer, as well as the various online services  or networks . In order to support this communication, the gateway device  generally performs a packet translation function that is transparent to both the user and the network. In this regard, for outbound traffic from a computer to a network or on-line service, the gateway device  changes attributes within the packet coming from the user, such as the source address, checksum, and application specific parameters, to meet the criteria of the network to which the user has accessed. In addition, the outgoing packet includes an attribute that will direct all incoming packets from the accessed network to be routed through the gateway device. In contrast, the inbound traffic from the computer network or other online service that is routed through the gateway device undergoes a translation function at the gateway device so that the packets are properly formatted for the user's host computer. In this manner, the packet translation process that takes place at the gateway device  is transparent to the host, which appears to send and receive data directly from the accessed computer network. By implementing the gateway device as an interface between the user and the computer network or other online service, however, the user will eliminate the need to re-configure their computer  upon accessing subsequent networks as well as the need to load special configuration software on their computer to support the reconfiguration.","Communication between users and networks or online services may be effectuated through ports, for example, located within hotel rooms or multi-dwelling units, or through conventional dial-up communications, such as through the use of telephone or cable modems. According to one aspect of the invention, users can be are redirected to a portal page, as described below. After being redirected to the portal page, the user is subjected to a AAA process. Based upon the AAA process, the user may be permitted transparent access to the destination network or may be redirected to a login page in order to gather additional information to identify the user.","Identifying the user is crucial in authorizing access to networks or online services, as such services are typically provided for a fee and may be customized based upon the user, user's location, or user's computer. As discussed below, the user's identification may be used to direct the user to a specific portal page, which can be a particular webpage. As such, the system of the present invention includes means for identifying a user based upon an attribute associated with the user that is contained within the packet transmitted from the user's computer. Attributes can include any data well known in the art for identifying the user, the user's location, and\/or the user's computer. In general, identifying a user's computer that accesses a network can be done by a media access control (MAC) associated with the computer. Identifying a computer based upon a MAC address is well known to those of skill in the art, and will not be discussed in detail herein. Additionally, the attribute can be based upon a user name, ID, or according to one advantageous embodiment described below, a particular location, such as from a communications port in a hotel room. As such, the location of the user can be the identifiable attribute.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, after a user accesses the computer network using a computer in communication with the gateway device , as described above, the user is directed to a portal page. The portal page may be maintained by an ISP or an enterprise network, or by any entry maintaining a webpage on the Internet. According to one aspect of the invention, the portal page can be a webpage containing any information whatsoever, and can be created by the ISP, enterprise network administrator or user. The portal page can contain information specific to the user accessing the network, as discussed in detail below.","Regardless of whether a user accessing the computer network is authorized access to the network, the user is redirected to a portal page. After being redirected to a portal page, the gateway device of the present invention determines the authorization and access rights of the user based upon an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting method, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/458,602 entitled \u201cSystems And Methods For Authorizing, Authenticating And Accounting Users Having Transparent Computer Access To A Network Using A Gateway Device\u201d filed concurrently with this application and incorporated by reference.","According to one aspect of the invention, a user may be identified and authorized access to the network or online services based upon attributes associated with the user, such as the user's location or the user's computer. When this occurs, the user can be forwarded to a portal page unique to that user. As described below, and in the U.S. patent application incorporated by reference immediately above, the user may be identified without being queried to input any identification information so that upon accessing the computer network the user is automatically directed to a generic portal page or a portal page established specifically for and unique to that user. According to another aspect of the invention, a user may be identified and authorized access based upon the user's identity after being redirected to the portal page. The user may have to enter a login name and password while at the portal page or after being directed to a login page so that the ISP or other entity maintaining the gateway device can identify the user. After entering identifying data, the user may be directed to a particular portal page, as in the first aspect described above. According to a third aspect of the invention, the user is not authorized access to the network. Where this occurs the user will be directed from the portal page to a login page where the user will have to input identification information, such as the user's name, address, credit card number, and other relevant data so that the user may be authorized to access the network. After the user enters sufficient login data to establish authorization, the user may be redirected to a portal page.","The redirection is accomplished by a Home Page Redirect (HPR) performed by the gateway device, a AAA server, or by a portal page redirect unit located internal to or external to the gateway device. To accomplish the redirection of a user to a portal page, HPR utilizes a Stack Address Translation (SAT) operation to direct the user to the portal page, which is preferably local to the gateway device so that the redirection will be efficient and fast. This is accomplished by redirecting the user to a protocol stack using network and port address translation to the portal server that can be internal to the computer network or gateway device. More specifically, the gateway device, AAA server or portal page redirect unit receives the user's HTTP request for a web page and sends back the HTTP response reversing the network and port address translation the portal server, essentially acting as a transparent \u2018go-between\u2019 to the user and portal server. It will be appreciated, however, that to receive the HTTP request the gateway device, AAA server or portal page redirect unit must initially open a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to a server in line with the user-requested internet address.","According to one aspect of the present invention, when a user initially attempts to access a destination location, the gateway device, AAA server or portal page redirect unit receives this request and routes the traffic to a protocol stack on a temporary server, which can be local to the gateway device. This can occur where a user initially opens a web browser resident on the user's computer and attempts to access a destination address, such as an Internet site. The destination address can also include any address accessible via the network or an online service, and can include the portal page. The protocol stack can pretend to be the user-entered destination location long enough to complete a connection or \u2018handshake\u2019. Thereafter, this protocol stack directs the user to the portal server, which can be local to the gateway device to facilitate higher speed communication. The redirection to the portal server can be accomplished by redirecting web pages only, rather than all traffic, including E-mails, FTPs, or any other traffic. Therefore, once authorized, if a user does not attempt to access a webpage through the user's internet browser, the gateway device can forward the communication transparently to the user's requested destination without requiring the user to access the portal page. Furthermore, according to one aspect of the invention specific user-input destination addresses may be authorized to pass through the gateway device without being redirected.","The portal page can also be specialized based on the user, user's location, user's computer, or any combination thereof. For example, assuming that the user has been authenticated and has authorization, the gateway device can present users with a portal page that identifies, among other things, the online services or other computer networks that are accessible via the gateway device. In addition, the portal page presented by the gateway device can provide information regarding the current parameters or settings that will govern the access provided to the particular user. As such, the gateway administrator can readily alter the parameters or other settings in order to tailor the service according to their particular application. Typically, changes in the parameters or other settings that will potentially utilize additional resources of the computer system will come at a cost, such that the gateway administrator will charge the user a higher rate for their service. For example, a user may elect to increase the transfer rate at which signals are transmitted across the computer network and pay a correspondingly higher price for the expedited service.","The portal page may include advertising tailored to the specific needs of the user. The gateway device would be capable of tailoring the material based upon user profiles in the network. The portal page may also incorporate surveys or links to surveys to provide the network provider with beneficial statistical data. As an ancillary benefit, the user who responds to the surveys may be rewarded with network access credit or upgraded quality. Additionally, the service provided could offer additional services to the user by way of the portal page or links to these services may be offered on the portal page. These services offered by the network service provider are not limited to the services related to the network connection. For example, a hotel may desire to offer the user in-room food service or a multi-unit dwelling may want to offer house cleaning service.","The portal page may also comprise information related to the status of the current network session. By way of example this information may include, current billing structure data, the category\/level of service that the user has chosen, the bandwidth being provided to the user, the bytes of information currently sent or received, the current status of network connection(s) and the duration of the existing network connection(s). It is to be understood, by those skilled in the art to which this invention relates that all conceivable useful information relating to the current network session could be displayed to the user in a multitude of combinations as defined by the user and\/or the gateway administrator. The gateway administrator will have the capability to dynamically change the information supplied in the portal page based on many factors, including the location of the user, the profile of the user and the chosen billing scheme and service level. The information provided in the portal page may prompt the user to adjust any number of specific parameters, such as the billing scheme, the routing, the level of service and\/or other user-related parameters.","The portal page may be implemented with an object-oriented programming language such as Java developed by Sun Microsystems, Incorporated of Mountain View, Calif. The code that defines the portal page can be embodied within the gateway device, while the display monitor and the driver are located with the host computers that are in communication with the gateway device. The object oriented programming language that is used should be capable of creating executable content (i.e. self-running applications) that can be easily distributed through networking environments. The object oriented programming language should be capable of creating special programs, typically referred to as applets that can be incorporated in portal pages to make them interactive. In this invention the applets take the form of the portal pages. It should be noted that the chosen object-oriented programming language would require that a compatible web browser be implemented to interpret and run the portal page. It is also possible to implement the portal page using other programming languages, such as HTML, SGML and XML; however, these languages may not be able to provide all the dynamic capabilities that languages, such as Java provide.","By re-directing the user to the portal page the gateway administrator or network operator is provided the opportunity to present the user with updated information pertaining to the remote location (i.e. the hotel, the airport etc.). By way of example the portal page may provide for links to the corporate home page, a travel site on the Internet, an Internet search engine and a network provider home page. Additionally, the buttons or any other field within the portal page may include other types of information options, such as advertising fields or user-specific links or fields based upon data found in the user's profile or inputted by the user.","It will be appreciated that the portal page is not limited to supplying information related to the user's billing and service plans. It is also possible to configure the portal page to include information that is customized to the user or the location\/site from which the user is remotely located. For example, the user may be located at a hotel for the purpose of attending a specific convention or conference either in the hotel or within the immediate vicinity of the hotel. The gateway device may have \u201clearned\u201d this information about the user through an initial log-on profile inquiry or the gateway administer may have inputted this information into a database.","The gateway device can store user profile information within a user-specific AAA database, as described below, or it can store and retrieve data from external databases. The gateway device can be configured to recognize these profiles and to customize the portal page accordingly. In the hotel scenario, the portal page may include a link for convention or conference services offered by the hotel.","In another example of location specific portal page data, the user may be remotely accessing the gateway device while located in a specific airport terminal. The gateway device will be configured so that it is capable of providing ready access to information related to that specific airport terminal, i.e. information pertaining to the current flights scheduled to depart and arrive that terminal, the retail services offered in that specific terminal, etc. In this manner, the portal page may include a link for terminal specific flight information and\/or terminal specific retail services available to the user.","It will also be appreciated that the HPR may be configured so a user is redirected to a portal page upon specific default occurrences, such as a time out, or according to preset time. For example, the portal page may act as a screen-saver, where the user is redirected to a portal page after a given period of inactivity. These functions may be established by the ISP or enterprise network administrator.","Customization of the information comprising the portal page is not limited to the gateway administrator or the network operator. The user may also be able to customize the information that is provided in the portal page. The user customization may be accomplished either directly by the user configuring the portal page manually or indirectly from the gateway device configuring the portal page in response to data found in the user-specific profile. In the manual embodiment the user may be asked to choose which information or type of information they would like supplied in the portal page for that specific network session. For instance, the user may require an alarm clock counter to insure an appointment is met or the user may require periodical updates of a specific stock quote. The information that a user customizes for the portal page may be network session specific, may be associated with the duration of a gateway subscription or may be stored in a user profile for an indefinite period of time. The gateway device's ability to communicate with numerous user databases provides the basis for storing user specific profiles for extended periods of time.","As explained above, the portal page presented to the user can be dependent upon an attribute associated with the user, such as the user's identification, the user's location, an address associated with the user's computer, or a combination thereof. The means in which a user is identified and access rights are determined is based upon an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) method implemented by the AAA server, and disclosed in this application.","One function of the AAA server is to identify the user in communication with the gateway device in a manner that is transparent to the user. That is, the user will not be required to reconfigure the computer or otherwise change the home network settings, and no additional configuration software will have to be added to the computer. According to one embodiment of the present invention, after a user is directed to a portal page, the AAA server can be accessed to authorize and authenticate the user. Therefore, upon accessing the network, the user may be forwarded to a generic portal page, and after the user may be authenticated, the user can be forwarded via HPR and SAT to a specialized portal page, as described above.","After receiving a request for access from a user, forwarding the user to a portal page, and identifying the user or location the AAA server then determines the access rights of the particular user. In addition to storing whether users have valid access rights, the user profile database can also include specialized access information particular to a specific location or user, such as the bandwidth of the user's access, or a portal page to which a user should be directed. For example, a user accessing the network from a penthouse may receive a higher access band rate than someone accessing the destination network from a typical hotel room. Additionally, a user profile can include historical data relating to a user's access to the network, including the amount of time a user has accessed the network. Such historical information can be used to determine any fees which may be charged to the user, or due from the user, for access. Specialized access information contained within the user profile may be established by the system administrator, or by the user who has purchased or otherwise established access to the network. For example, where a user is transparently accessing the gateway device from a hotel room, the hotel network administrator may enter user access information into the profile database based upon access rights associated with a room in the hotel. This can also be done automatically by the gateway device or a local management system, such as a hotel property management system, when the user checks into his or her room.","Assuming that a user does not have a subscription for access to the network, a login page enables new users to subscribe to the computer network so that they may subsequently obtain access to networks or online services transparently through the gateway device. The user may take steps to become authenticated so that the user's information may be recorded in the user profile database and the user is deemed valid. For example, a user may have to enter into a purchase agreement, requiring the user to enter a credit card number. If the user needs to purchase access, or if the system needs additional information about the user, the user is redirected from the portal page via HPR and SAT to a location, such as a login page, established to validate new users. SAT and HPR can intervene to direct the user to a webserver (external or internal) where the user has to login and identify themselves. Location-based information and authorization, as described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60\/161,093, incorporated herein by reference, can be sent to the portal page as part of this redirection process. This enables the portal page to be customized to include customized information, such as locale restaurant ads or train schedules.","Assuming that a user has not been authorized access to the network based upon location based identification or user input identification, the user must provide the gateway device with sufficient information to become authorized access. Where the user is not authorized access the user is forwarded via HPR and SAT from the portal page to a login page. The login page enables new users to subscribe to the computer network so that they may subsequently obtain access to networks or online services transparently through the gateway device. To direct the users to a login page the AAA server calls upon the HPR function. The HPR directs the user to the login page, and after the user has entered requisite information into the login page, the AAA server adds the new information to the customer profile database and can direct the user to the user's desired destination, such as an Internet address or can return the user to a portal page, depending upon the design of the system. Thus, new users can gain access to networks or online services without being predefined in the user profile database.","After receiving the user's login information, the AAA server will create a user profile utilizing this information so that the user will be able to obtain immediate access to the network next time the user logs in without being required to enter login information again. The AAA server can create a profile for the user in a locally stored user profile database, or can update the user profile in a database external to the gateway device. Regardless of the location of the user profile, the next time the user attempts to login the user's profile will be located in the user profile database, the user's access rights determined, and the user allowed transparent access to networks or services."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIGS. 8","i":["a ","g "],"b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIGS. 10","i":["a ","b "],"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIGS. 11","i":["a ","d "],"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
