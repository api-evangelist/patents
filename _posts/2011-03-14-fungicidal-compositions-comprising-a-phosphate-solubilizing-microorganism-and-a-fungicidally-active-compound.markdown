Furthermore, in many cases, synergistic effects are obtained.","The present invention furthermore relates to compositions comprising a mixture of a microorganism (I) (component 1) and one compound selected from the groups A) to F) (component 2) and at least one further active compound useful for plant protection, e. g. selected from the groups A) to F) (component 3), as described above, and if desired one suitable solvent or solid carrier. Those mixtures are of particular interest, since many of them at the same application rate show higher efficiencies against harmful fungi. Furthermore, combating harmful fungi with a mixture of a microorganism (I) (component 1) and one compound selected from the groups A) to F) (component 2), as described above, is more efficient than combating those fungi with microorganism (I) or individual fungicides from groups A) to F). By applying microorganism (I) together with at least one active substance from groups A) to I) a synergistic effect can be obtained, i.e. more then simple addition of the individual effects is obtained (synergistic mixtures).","In binary mixtures, i.e. compositions according to the invention comprising microorganism (I) (component 1) and one compound (II) (component 2), e. g. one active substance from groups A) to F), the weight ratio of component 1 and component 2 generally depends from the properties of the active substances used, usually it is in the range of from 1:1000 to 1000:1, often in the range of from 1:200 to 200:1, regularly in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1, preferably in the range of from 1:20 to 20:1, more preferably in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1 and in particular in the range of from 1:3 to 3:1.","In ternary mixtures, i.e. compositions according to the invention comprising microorganism (I) (component 1) and a first compound (II) (component 2) and a second compound (II) (component 3), e. g. two active substances from groups A) to F), the weight ratio of component 1 and component 2 depends from the properties of the active substances used, preferably it is in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1 and particularly in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1, and the weight ratio of component 1 and component 3 preferably is in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1 and particularly in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1.","The components can be used individually or already partially or completely mixed with one another to prepare the composition according to the invention.

One or more of the components may already be combined together or pre-formulated. In those embodiments where more than two components are provided in a kit, the components may already be combined together and as such are packaged in a single container such as a vial, bottle, can, pouch, bag or canister. In other embodiments, two or more components of a kit may be packaged separately, i. e., not pre-formulated. As such, kits may include one or more separate containers such as vials, cans, bottles, pouches, bags or canisters, each container containing a separate component for a composition. In both forms, a component of the kit may be applied separately from or together with the further components or as a component of a combination composition according to the invention for preparing the composition according to the invention.","The user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage device, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank or a spray plane.
