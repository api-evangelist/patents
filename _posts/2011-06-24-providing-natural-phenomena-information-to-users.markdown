{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","System Overview"],"p":["The embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to providing information (data) related to natural phenomena using online information systems. More particularly, the embodiments herein relate to automatically determining prominent cities that are most susceptible to transient natural phenomena.","Transient natural phenomena such as hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the like can cause devastating damage to populated areas that are in the vicinity or path of these natural phenomena. To prepare the public for natural phenomena, various national, regional and scientific organizations monitor, track and predict the likely behavior of transient natural phenomena. These organizations provide information to the public about the behavior and location of a natural phenomenon to warn the public of any possible danger resulting from the phenomenon. While the information provided by these natural phenomena agencies is beneficial to the public, it does entail certain problems and inefficiencies. One such problem is the difficulty of predicting the path or extent of a natural phenomenon.","The embodiments herein generally describe mechanisms that identify cities that are the most susceptible or in danger of a transient natural phenomena. A transient natural phenomenon is a naturally occurring physical event that is not produced by humans, but may pose danger to humans and\/or property. Typically, these phenomena only occur for a limited duration of time lasting anywhere from a few seconds up to multiple days. Transient natural phenomena include meteorological phenomena such as hurricanes, tropical storms, typhoons, monsoons, snow storms, thunderstorms, and tornadoes as well as oceanographic phenomena such as tsunamis. Additionally, natural phenomena include geological phenomena such as volcanic activity and earthquakes.","In one embodiment, an online geographical information system receives natural phenomena data included in an online data feed from a natural phenomena monitoring organization such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The geographical information system converts the data into a mapping markup language which is used to generate online maps, using presentation elements of the markup language to indicate the current and\/or potential future locations of a natural phenomenon. Based on the natural phenomena data, the geographical information system identifies an area of probable impact and cities that are within the identified area. The geographical information system calculates a score for each identified city that describes the city's prominence as well as the city's susceptibility to the natural phenomenon. That is, the score indicates the aggregate potential danger that the natural phenomenon poses to the people or property that are located in the city. In one embodiment, a city's prominence is correlated to the population of the city. The geographical information system provides users with maps and other online presentations based upon the natural phenomena data, where the presentations include the city of most importance in the area affected by the natural phenomenon as well as attributes that describe the characteristics of the natural phenomenon such as the wind speed, pressure, and intensity of a hurricane, for example.","In one embodiment, the geographical information system provides the natural phenomena data to a user in response to a user search request for location related information, where the user is not intentionally searching for natural phenomena data related to the location. For example, the user may request a map feature from the geographical information system, such as a request for a specific city in an online map. The geographical information system identifies general information related to the map feature as well as any natural phenomena data that is relevant to the search request if applicable. The geographical information system returns in the search results both the general information about the map feature as well as the natural phenomena data associated with the map feature. Thus, the geographical information system provides natural phenomena data that the user may not be aware of that is relevant to the request as well as the information sought out by the user. In one embodiment, the natural phenomena data is presented in an online map that displays the natural phenomenon and its attributes.","Alternatively, the geographical information system may automatically update a viewport of a user's client with natural phenomena data. The geographical information system monitors the viewport of the user's client to determine the geographical area displayed on an online map currently being viewed by the user. The geographical information system updates the online map with natural phenomenon data after determining that natural phenomena data is available for the geographical area displayed on the online map. By updating the online map with the natural phenomena data, the geographical information system informs the user viewing the map of the phenomenon occurring in the geographical area displayed on the map.","The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not intended to be limiting. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification and claims.","The figures depict various embodiments for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"In one embodiment, a transient natural phenomenon is a naturally occurring physical event that is not produced by humans, but may harm humans or property. In the discussion herein, natural phenomena will be generally discussed with respect to hurricanes, but it is understood that the mechanisms herein may be applied to any type of transient natural phenomena.","As shown in , the geographical information system  includes a front end interface , a conversion module , an identification module , a map module , a map database , and a natural phenomena (\u201cNP\u201d) database . Each of these modules and databases is described in further detail below. Many conventional features, such as firewalls, load balancers, application servers, failover servers, site management tools and so forth are not shown so as not to obscure the features of the system.","In one embodiment, a suitable website for implementation of the geographical information system  is the GOOGLE\u2122 Maps website, found at maps.google.com. Other map sites are known as well, and can be adapted to operate according to the teaching disclosed herein. The term \u201cwebsite\u201d represents any computer system adapted to serve content using any networking protocol, and is not intended to be limited to content uploaded or downloaded via the Internet or the HTTP protocol. In general, functions described in one embodiment as being performed on the server side can also be performed on the client side in other embodiments if appropriate. In addition, the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together.","In one embodiment, the geographical information system  is implemented as server program executing on server-class computer comprising a CPU, memory, network interface, peripheral interfaces, and other well known components. In one embodiment, the computers themselves run an operating system such as LINUX, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS X, have generally high performance CPUs, 2G or more of memory, and 1TB or more of disk storage. Of course, other types of computers can be used, and it is expected that as more powerful computers are developed in the future, they can be configured in accordance with the teachings here. The functionality implemented by any of the elements can be provided by computer program products (e.g., as computer executable instructions) that are stored in non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums (e.g., RAM, hard disk, or optical\/magnetic media).","In one embodiment, and as shown in , a client  executing a browser  or a map application connects to the geographical information system  to allow a user to view online maps provided by the geographical information system . The client  may connect to the geographical information system  via a network  such as the Internet or any combination of a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a mobile, wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network. While only a single client  is shown in , in general very large numbers (e.g., millions) of clients are supported and can be in communication with the geographical information system  at any time. In one embodiment, the client  can be implemented using any of a variety of different computing devices, some examples of which are personal computers, digital assistants, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, mobile phones, smart phones and laptop computers.","The browser  may include any application that allows users of clients  to access web pages on the World Wide Web. Suitable applications include, but are not limited to GOOGLE CHROME, MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR, MOZILLA FIREFOX, and APPLE SAFARI. The browser  allows the user of client  to access websites comprising online maps provided by the geographical information system  via a user interface provided by the front end interface . Through the interface , a user can view online maps provided by the geographical information system  that include transient natural phenomena data.","A natural phenomena information source  provides natural phenomena data to the geographical information system  via network . The natural phenomena information source  publicly distributes information about transient natural phenomena. The natural phenomena information source  may provide the natural phenomena data in various formats such as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, e-mail updates, plain text files, and\/or Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) data contained in shapefiles. Other file formats may be used in different embodiments. Examples of natural phenomena information sources  include the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), and Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. While only one natural phenomena information source  is shown in , in general, any number of natural phenomena information sources  are supported and can be in communication with the geographical information system  at any time.","Generally, the natural phenomena data provided by the natural phenomena information source  describes attributes of transient natural phenomena. Attributes of a natural phenomenon generally depend on the phenomenon type and describe characteristics of the natural phenomenon. For a hurricane phenomenon, the attributes of the hurricane comprise the wind speed (miles or kilometers per hour) of the hurricane, the location of the center of the hurricane in terms of geospatial identifiers (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) at a given time, the heading or route of the hurricane, the central pressure of the hurricane, the hurricane intensity that characterizes the destructive potential of the hurricane, hurricane name, and\/or hurricane identification number. In another example, for a tsunami phenomenon the attributes of the tsunami include the maximum water height (feet or meters) of the tsunami, speed (miles or kilometers per hour) of the tsunami at a given time, the magnitude of the earthquake that caused the tsunami, and\/or the location of the source of the tsunami in terms of geospatial identifiers (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates). For an earthquake phenomenon, the attributes may include the location of the source of the earthquake in terms of geospatial identifiers (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) and the magnitude of the earthquake that characterizes the relative size of the earthquake. Each natural phenomenon information source  provides a schema which describes the semantics of the phenomenon data that it publishes.","Geographical Information System","As shown in , the geographical information system  comprises a NP database . The NP database  stores natural phenomena data received from the natural phenomena information source  as described above in markup language format. In one embodiment, the markup language is the KML. KML is a file format used to display geographic data in the browser , and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,353,114, which is incorporated by reference herein. KML uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes and is based on the extensible markup language (XML). In one embodiment, the NP database  stores the natural phenomena data received from the natural phenomena information source  for a hurricane or any other type of natural phenomenon in KML. A transient natural phenomenon is represented in KML as a placemark and the phenomenon's attributes are represented as a data name along with their corresponding value.","Below is an example KML file for Tropical Storm Aere:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d encoding=\u201cUTF-8\u201d?>"},{"entry":"<kml xmlns=\u201chttp:\/\/www.opengis.net\/kml\/2.2\u201d"},{"entry":"xmlns:gx=\u201chttp:\/\/www.google.com\/kml\/ext\/2.2\u201d"},{"entry":"xmlns:kml=\u201chttp:\/\/www.opengis.net\/kml\/2.2\u201d"},{"entry":"xmlns:atom=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom\u201d>"},{"entry":"<Document>"},{"entry":"\u2003<Placemark>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<name>Tropical Storm Aere<\/name>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<description><![CDATA[&nbsp;<img style=\u201cdisplay:none\u201d "},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003width=\u201c1\u201d height=\u201c1\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003src=\u201chttp:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/gen_204?ct=google_earth:pop-"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003up&oi=events-"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003tropical_storms._._.xx.8854658a77382ede_xx&cad=lat:17.9,"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003lon:122.2,quad:02 303\u201d \/>]]><\/description>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<ExtendedData>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<Data name=\u201cADVISORY\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<value>TROPICAL CYCLONE ADVISORY<\/value>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/Data>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<Data name=\u201cTCSPEED_MPH\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<value>9.206<\/value>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/Data>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<Data name=\u201cEPOCH_TIME\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<value>1304942400<\/value>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/Data>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<Data name=\u201cINTENSITY_MPH\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<value>40.28<\/value>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/Data>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<Data name=\u201cLON\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<value>122 .2<\/value>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/Data>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<Data name=\u201cSTORMSRC\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<value>RSMC Tokyo -

The placemark is used to mark the current position of the natural phenomenon, here Tropical Storm Aere, on an online map. The KML file for the natural phenomenon includes attributes for the tropical storm (hurricane) received from the natural phenomenon source . These attributes include the wind speed of the hurricane represented by the data name \u201cMAXWIND_MPH,\u201d the location of the hurricane in latitude and longitude coordinates represented by the data name \u201cLAT\u201d and the data name \u201cLON,\u201d the local time associated with the attributes represented by the data name \u201cLOCAL_TIME,\u201d and the date associated with the attributes represented by the data names \u201cMONTH,\u201d \u201cDAY,\u201d and \u201cYEAR\u201d as well as other attributes included above. Other attributes of the natural phenomenon are included in the example KML file shown above.","The map database  stores map information associated with map features that are displayed on digital or online maps. The map information defines parameters used to render map features for online maps as well as information associated with the map features such as businesses, restaurants, etc. associated with the map features. In one embodiment, a map feature represents a real world object that can be represented on an online map such as countries, provinces, islands, states, bodies of water, cities, natural features (e.g., mountain ranges), buildings, etc. The map database  may store the map feature information in a presentation independent format, or in a format suited for presentation, such as the aforementioned KML or other markup language.","In one embodiment, the conversion module  converts natural phenomena data received from the natural phenomena information source  into KML. The conversion module  requests natural phenomena data from the natural phenomena information source  at predetermined intervals of time. For example, the conversion module  may request natural phenomena data at an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. Any other suitable time interval can be used in other embodiments. Alternatively, the conversion module  may receive the natural phenomena data when it becomes available from the natural phenomena information source . That is, once natural phenomena data is available to the information source , the source  provides the data to the geographical information system .","To convert the natural phenomena data into KML, the conversion module  maps attributes of the natural phenomena data received from the natural phenomena information source  into their corresponding KML attributes. In one embodiment, the conversion module  accesses a set of rules that map each XML attribute included in the natural phenomena data into its associated KML attribute. For example, in an RSS feed the XML attributes for the location of a hurricane may be indicated as \u201clatitude\u201d and \u201clongitude.\u201d The set of rules may associate these attributes to the KML attributes of \u201cLAT\u201d and \u201cLON.\u201d Accordingly, the conversion module  converts the location data from the natural phenomena data into their associated KML format in this example. The particular rules for mapping or associated natural phenomenon data to KML attributes can be readily determined from the schema for each natural phenomenon information source .","The identification module  identifies automatically and periodically cities that are most susceptible to natural phenomena. More specifically, the identification module  identifies the most prominent city in terms of population that will be most impacted by the natural phenomena. For example, the identification module  automatically determines which prominent city is subject to a high degree of danger from an incoming hurricane, given a current natural phenomenon information data feed pertaining to a given hurricane. Continuing this example, consider a town with a population of 10 people that is directly in the path of a hurricane and New York City that is 100 km from the hurricane. Although New York City is less likely to be impacted by the hurricane compared to the town, the identification module  identifies New York City as the prominent city that will be most impacted by the hurricane. Because the population of New York City is much greater than the population of the town, more people are in New York City will be affected by the hurricane which results in New York City being identified as the most impacted city. Note that in other embodiments, prominence of a city may be based on other factors in combination with population.","The identification module  identifies the current location of the hurricane in terms of geospatial identifiers such as latitude and longitude coordinates. In one embodiment, the location of the hurricane corresponds to the circulation center or eye of the hurricane. The identification module  identifies from the map database  a list of cities that are within a threshold distance (e.g., 1,000 kilometers) from the hurricane's current location and are within the heading of the hurricane. The cities identified by the identification module  represent a candidate set cities which are susceptible to the hurricane because they are close to the hurricane in terms of distance. A larger threshold value increases the number of candidate cities to be evaluated, and a lower threshold value decreases them. Different threshold values can be used for different types of natural phenomena, e.g., 1,000 km for hurricanes, but only 200 km for tornadoes.","The identification module  calculates a locality score for each identified city in the list. The locality score for each city indicates a measure of the hurricane's impact on the city combined with a measure of the city's prominence. As previously mentioned, the prominence of a city corresponds to the population of the city. That is, the greater the population of the city the more prominent the city and vice versa. Other factors may be considered in other embodiments to determine the city's prominence. Generally, the higher the value of the locality score the more impacted the city will be due to the hurricane and vice versa. In one embodiment, the locality score for each city in the list is calculated according to the following variables determined for each city:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":"=","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":"population","mrow":{"mi":["Max","Pop"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},"mi":"\u03c1"}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":"where population is the population of the city and MaxPop is a constant representing the most populated city of interest. Here, MaxPop is set at 32,000,000, which represents the population of the Tokyo metropolitan area, which is by some measures the most populous city in the world, and p is a constant weight set to 0.15. Note that in other embodiments other values can be used to represent the most populous city in the world and the weight."}},"T: contribution of time to the locality score:\n        \n        ","E: contribution of the elevation of the city. Generally, a city is more susceptible to a hurricane if the city is close to sea level in terms of elevation. Thus, a city's higher elevation could mitigate the susceptibility of a city to a hurricane.\n        \n        ","C: contribution of the city's distance to the nearest coastline. Generally, a city is more susceptible to a hurricane if the city is close to a coastline in terms of distance;\n        \n        ","B: contribution of the city's distance from the hurricane's projected path of travel or track.\n        \n        "]}}}},"The relationship of these variables to each other in an exemplary embodiment is represented by the equation as follows:\n\nlocalityScore=\n","Thus, the identification module  calculates a locality score for each candidate city based on the above equation, or some similar function using the P, T, E, C, and B factors, or their equivalents. The identification module  ranks the candidate cities based on the locality score calculated for each candidate city. The identification module  determines the candidate city with the highest locality score, which is then deemed to be the most impacted city due to the natural phenomenon, here, a hurricane.","The identification module  updates the KML data for the natural phenomenon in the NP database  with an indication of the identified city that is most susceptible to the hurricane. For the KML example described above for Tropical Storm Aere, the identification module  may include in the KML file the attribute and value of:\n\n<Data name=\u201cCITY_OF_GREATEST_IMPORTANCE\u201d><value>Amulung<\/value>\n\nIn this example, the attribute \u201cCITY_OF_GREATEST_IMPORTANCE\u201d indicates that the city of \u201cAmulung\u201d is most impacted city due to the storm. Alternatively, the identification module  may update the KML data for the hurricane with a list of the cities with the highest locality scores (e.g., top three).\n","The map module  is any web-based application known in the art that provides online or digital maps and information about map features to users. Exemplary web-based applications include GOOGLE Maps and GOOGLE Earth. The map module  utilizes the map information in the map database  to generate two-dimensional and\/or three-dimensional digital maps and populate the maps with map features.","In one embodiment, the map module  provides natural phenomenon data in online maps. Specifically, the map module  generates an online map that includes, as appropriate, the city which will be most impacted due to a natural phenomenon based on the natural phenomenon KML data stored in the NP database . Alternatively, the online map includes the top cities (e.g., N highest scoring cities) that will be most impacted due to the natural phenomenon or all the cities that that will be impacted due to the natural phenomenon. For example, the map module  accesses the hurricane's KML data as well as the map feature information from the map database  to generate an online map that includes the hurricane data for the geographical area represented by the map feature information. Where the hurricane's KML data lists the impacted cites, the map module  determines whether each of these cities is visible in the viewport for a requesting client, and if so, provides an appropriate graphical element for the hurricane.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","201","200","203"]},"Specifically, map  displays the circulation center of the hurricane at three different time intervals: +0 hour, +12 hours, and +24 hours. Circulation center A represents the hurricane's center location when the hurricane formed and circulation center B represents the hurricane's center location after 12 hours from when the hurricane formed. Lastly, circulation center C represents the hurricane's location after 24 hours of the formation of the hurricane. While only a 24 hour forecast is shown in map , it is understood that the hurricane cone may illustrate a forecast for any number of days such as a three-day or five-day forecast.","The map module  creates the hurricane cone  by drawing circles (or other bounding shape, e.g., ellipse) centered at each forecast point: +0 hour, +12 hours, and +24 hours. In one embodiment, the radius of each circle at each forecast point is equal to two-thirds of the historical official forecast errors for the natural phenomena information source  for hurricanes during the preceding five year period in the geographical region. The map module  constructs the cone by drawing a tangent line that connects the outside boundary of all the circles.","In addition, the map  illustrates an example of a group of top cities that will be impacted by the hurricane: New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport. For each city, the map module  provides an indication  of the values for the variables that are used to calculate each city's locality score as well as the city's locality score. As shown in the indication A, the city of New Orleans is most impacted by the hurricane based on the variables shown in the indication A such as population, elevation, coast distance, time from the storm, and the best track distance. In this example, New Orleans is associated with a locality score of 0.244 whereas Baton Rouge and Shreveport are respectively associated with the locality scores of 0.027 and 0.003. Because New Orleans is associated with the higher locality score, it is the city that is most impacted by the hurricane.","In one embodiment, the map module  includes an information window in online maps that provides additional information about a hurricane, when the hurricane's current location puts it within the area being viewed in the viewport of the client. The information included in the information window comprises news related to the hurricane. In one embodiment, the map module  may obtain stored news that are related to the hurricane or may obtain the news from external sources.  illustrates an example of an information window  about the Tropical Cyclone Carlos. As shown in , information window  comprises various tabs that are associated with information about the hurricane. In , the news tab  is currently selected which causes the information window  to display a news article related to the hurricane.","In one embodiment, the information included in the information window comprises a hurricane advisory received from the natural phenomena information source  which is stored in the NP database  for the phenomenon. A hurricane advisory includes remarks describing the hurricane's location, intensity, movement, and any precautions that should be taken.  illustrates the information window  displaying a hurricane advisory for Tropical Cyclone Carlos. In FIG. AB, the advisory tab  is selected which causes the advisory to be displayed in the information window .","The information included in the information window may also comprise an overview of the hurricane. The overview describes the attributes of the hurricane stored in the NP database  including the name of the hurricane, hurricane number, movement, sea level pressure, and wind speed.  illustrates an overview of Tropical Storm Carlos in the information window . As shown in , the overview tab  is selected which causes the information window  to display the overview information.","In one embodiment, the map module  provides hurricane data upon request from the client . The map module  may receive an explicit request for hurricane data from a client  such as a search for a hurricane that is currently occurring. Accordingly, the map module  generates an online map that includes the hurricane data as described above for display on the client .","Alternatively, the map module  may receive a search query for a map feature such as a city, state, country, province, or country from the client . In addition to providing the client  general information pertaining to the map feature (e.g., a city), such as associated businesses, the map module  provides the client  with any hurricane data that is related to the map feature if appropriate. Thus, the geographical information system  performs the two useful functions of providing search results related to the map feature as well as hurricane data related to the map feature.","Based on the search query, the map module  searches the NP database  for currently occurring hurricanes. The map module  identifies whether the requested map feature is susceptible to a hurricane as well as the city (or cities) that is most susceptible to the hurricane. If the requested map feature is not within the threshold distance of a hurricane, the geographical information system  provides the client  with search results associated with the map feature that do not include with hurricane data. However, if the requested map feature is within the threshold distance of the hurricane, the map module  determines the city that is most likely to be impacted by the hurricane and the map feature's likelihood of being impacted by the hurricane if the map feature is a city. The map module  provides search results to the client  including an online map with an indication of the most impacted city as well as hurricane data that is relevant to the search query to the client . If the requested map feature is a city, the map module  includes the requested city's susceptibility to the hurricane. Additionally, the search results may include other information pertaining to the search request for the map feature other than hurricane data.","Rather than providing hurricane data responsive to a search query, the map module  automatically updates currently viewed online maps at clients  with hurricane data if appropriate. In one embodiment, the map module  monitors the viewport of the browser  to identify the geographical area of an online map being viewed on the client . The map module  identifies from the NP database  whether a hurricane or other natural phenomenon is occurring in the geographical area. If so, the map module  updates the online map with the hurricane data described above such as the city that is most likely to be impacted by the hurricane as well as the hurricane cone illustrating the trajectory of the hurricane.","Note that the map module  may provide hurricane data to client  in other manners than an online map. For example, the map module  may send an e-mail, text message, and\/or a cell phone call with the hurricane data to the client .","Process for Providing Natural Phenomena Data","Referring now to , there is shown one embodiment of a computer-implemented method performed by the geographical information system  for providing natural phenomena data to a client . Note that in alternative embodiments, other steps may be performed other than those shown in .","Here, the geographical information system  receives 401 a search query for a map feature. The search query may be received from a client of user, in which case the query may represent a user's desire for information related to the map feature. Or the query may be received from another system, which generates the query automatically. The requested map feature may be a city, state, country, continent, province, island, or any other type of physical feature that can be represented on a map. The geographical information system  identifies  information associated with the map feature, and obtains its location (e.g., latitude and longitude, geocode, or other representation of location). The identified information is representative of general search results such as for example business or restaurants located in a city indicated in the query, news articles about the map feature, or general information about the map feature.","The geographical information system  simultaneously determines  whether the map feature is susceptible to a natural phenomenon. That is, the geographical information system  searches the NP database  to determine whether the map feature is within a threshold distance from a natural phenomenon that is currently occurring, based on the location of the map feature, and the current location of the natural phenomenon. If not, the geographical information system  provides  search results without any natural phenomenon data and include the identified information associated with the map feature.","However, if the map feature is likely to be impacted by the natural phenomenon by being within the appropriate threshold distance of the natural phenomenon, the geographical information system  determines  natural phenomenon data corresponding to the natural phenomenon such as the city that is most likely to be impacted by the natural phenomenon as well as attributes of the natural phenomenon. The geographical information system  provides  the search results to the client  to fulfill the search query. Thus, the search results include two types of useful information: general search results associated with the map feature and natural phenomenon data associated with the map feature if applicable. The user at client  is thus provided with hurricane data that is relevant to the search query even though the user was not explicitly seeking the hurricane data.","Referring now to , there is shown one embodiment of a computer-implemented method performed by the geographical information system  for determining  natural phenomenon data. Note that in alternative embodiments, other steps may be performed other than those shown in .","In one embodiment, the geographical information system  identifies  a location of the natural phenomenon in terms of geospatial identifiers such as latitude and longitude coordinates, geocodes, or other equivalent location representation. The geographical information system  identifies  cities within a threshold distance of the natural phenomenon. For example, the geographical information system  identifies cities that are a threshold distance from the circulation center of a hurricane. The geographical information system computes  a locality score for each city that is indicative of the city's prominence and susceptibility to the natural phenomenon. The geographical information system  ranks  the cities based on the calculated locality scores for the cities. The geographical information system  identifies  the most prominent city that that will be impacted by the natural phenomenon based on the locality scores. That is, the geographical information system  identifies the city with the highest locality score relative to the other scores. The geographical information system  may alternatively identify the top cities that are likely to be impacted by the natural phenomenon. The identified city and attributes of the natural phenomenon are included in the search results that are transmitted to the client . If the requested map feature is a city, the geographical information system  includes in the online map the requested city's susceptibility to the natural phenomenon.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or to \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure.
