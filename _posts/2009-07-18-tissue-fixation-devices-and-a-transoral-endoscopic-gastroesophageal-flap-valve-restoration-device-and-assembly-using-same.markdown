{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/783,717, filed on Feb. 20, 2004, which is abandoned. The entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated for all purposes.","The present invention generally relates to tissue fixation devices, and more particularly to devices for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease using the same. The present invention more particularly relates to such tissue fixation devices which may be used in surgical environments and which are self-deploying.","Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition caused by the failure of the anti-reflux barrier located at the gastroesophageal junction to keep the contents of the stomach from splashing into the esophagus. The splashing is known as gastroesophageal reflux. The stomach acid is designed to digest meat, and will digest esophageal tissue when persistently splashed into the esophagus.","A principal reason for regurgitation associated with GERD is the mechanical failure of a deteriorated gastroesophageal flap to close and seal against high pressure in the stomach. Due to reasons including lifestyle, a Grade I normal gastroesophageal flap may deteriorate into a malfunctioning Grade III or absent valve Grade IV gastroesophageal flap. With a deteriorated gastroesophageal flap, the stomach contents are more likely to be regurgitated into the esophagus, the mouth, and even the lungs. The regurgitation is referred to as \u201cheartburn\u201d because the most common symptom is a burning discomfort in the chest under the breastbone. Burning discomfort in the chest and regurgitation (burping up) of sour-tasting gastric juice into the mouth are classic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). When stomach acid is regurgitated into the esophagus, it is usually cleared quickly by esophageal contractions. Heartburn (backwashing of stomach acid and bile onto the esophagus) results when stomach acid is frequently regurgitated into the esophagus and the esophageal wall is inflamed.","Complications develop for some people who have GERD. Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) with erosions and ulcerations (breaks in the lining of the esophagus) can occur from repeated and prolonged acid exposure. If these breaks are deep, bleeding or scarring of the esophagus with formation of a stricture (narrowing of the esophagus) can occur. If the esophagus narrows significantly, then food sticks in the esophagus and the symptom is known as dysphagia. GERD has been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. In a subset of people who have severe GERD, if acid exposure continues, the injured squamous lining is replaced by a precancerous lining (called Barrett's Esophagus) in which a cancerous esophageal adenocarcinoma can develop.","Other complications of GERD may not appear to be related to esophageal disease at all. Some people with GERD may develop recurrent pneumonia (lung infection), asthma (wheezing), or a chronic cough from acid backing up into the esophagus and all the way up through the upper esophageal sphincter into the lungs. In many instances, this occurs at night, while the person is in a supine position and sleeping. Occasionally, a person with severe GERD will be awakened from sleep with a choking sensation. Hoarseness can also occur due to acid reaching the vocal cords, causing a chronic inflammation or injury.","GERD never improves without intervention. Life style changes combined with both medical and surgical treatments exist for GERD. Medical therapies include antacids and proton pump inhibitors. However, the medical therapies only mask the reflux. Patients still get reflux and perhaps emphysema because of particles refluxed into the lungs. Barrett's esophagus results in about 10% of the GERD cases. The esophageal epithelium changes into tissue that tends to become cancerous from repeated acid washing despite the medication.","Several open laparotomy and laproscopic surgical procedures are available for treating GERD. One surgical approach is the Nissen fundoplication. The Nissen approach typically involves a 360-degree wrap of the fundus around the gastroesophageal junction. The procedure has a high incidence of postoperative complications. The Nissen approach creates a 360-degree moveable flap without a fixed portion. Hence, Nissen does not restore the normal movable flap. The patient cannot burp because the fundus was used to make the repair, and may frequently experience dysphagia. Another surgical approach to treating GERD is the Belsey Mark IV (Belsey) fundoplication. The Belsey procedure involves creating a valve by suturing a portion of the stomach to an anterior surface of the esophagus. It reduces some of the postoperative complications encountered with the Nissen fundoplication, but still does not restore the normal movable flap. None of these procedures fully restores the normal anatomical anatomy or produces a normally functioning gastroesophageal junction. Another surgical approach is the Hill repair. In the Hill repair, the gastroesophageal junction is anchored to the posterior abdominal areas, and a 180-degree valve is created by a system of sutures. The Hill procedure restores the moveable flap, the cardiac notch and the Angle of His. However, all of these surgical procedures are very invasive, regardless of whether done as a laproscopic or an open procedure.","New, less surgically invasive approaches to treating GERD involve transoral endoscopic procedures. One procedure contemplates a machine device with robotic arms that is inserted transorally into the stomach. While observing through an endoscope, an endoscopist guides the machine within the stomach to engage a portion of the fundus with a corkscrew-like device on one arm. The arm then pulls on the engaged portion to create a fold of tissue or radial plication at the gastroesophageal junction. Another arm of the machine pinches the excess tissue together and fastens the excess tissue with one pre-tied implant. This procedure does not restore normal anatomy. The fold created does not have anything in common with a valve. In fact, the direction of the radial fold prevents the fold or plication from acting as a flap of a valve.","Another transoral procedure contemplates making a fold of fundus tissue near the deteriorated gastroesophageal flap to recreate the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The procedure requires placing multiple U-shaped tissue clips around the folded fundus to hold it in shape and in place.","This and the previously discussed procedure are both highly dependent on the skill, experience, aggressiveness, and courage of the endoscopist. In addition, these and other procedures may involve esophageal tissue in the repair. Esophageal tissue is fragile and weak. Involvement of esophageal tissue in the repair of a gastroesophageal flap valve poses unnecessary risks to the patient.","A new and improved apparatus and method for restoration of a gastroesophageal flap valve is fully disclosed in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/150,740, filed May 17, 2002, for TRANSORAL ENDOSCOPIC GASTROESOPHAGEAL FLAP VALVE RESTORATION DEVICE, ASSEMBLY, SYSTEM AND METHOD, is assigned to the assignee of this invention, and is incorporated herein by reference. That apparatus and method provides a transoral endoscopic gastroesophageal flap valve restoration. A longitudinal member arranged for transoral placement into a stomach carries a tissue shaper that non-invasively grips and shapes stomach tissue. A tissue fixation device is then deployed to maintain the shaped stomach tissue in a shape approximating a gastroesophageal flap.","Whenever tissue is to be maintained in a shape as, for example, in the improved assembly last mentioned above, it is necessary to fasten at least two layers of tissue together. In applications such as gastroesophageal flap valve restoration, there is very limited room to maneuver a fastener deployment device. For example, this and other medical fastening applications provide confined working channels and spaces and often must be fed through an endoscope to permit visualization or other small lumen guide catheters to the place where the fasteners are to be deployed. To make matters worse, multiple fasteners may also be required. Hence, with current fasteners and deployment arrangements, it is often difficult to direct a single fastener to its intended location, let alone a number of such fasteners.","Once the fastening site is located, the fasteners employed must be truly able to securely maintain the tissue. Also, quite obviously, the fasteners are preferably deployable in the tissue in a manner which does not unduly traumatize the tissue.","The present invention provides a fastener for use in a mammalian body, comprising a first member, a second member, the first and second members having first and second ends, and a connecting member fixed to each of the first and second members intermediate the first and second ends and extending between the first and second members. The first and second members are separated by the connecting member, and one of the first and second members has a longitudinal axis and a through channel along the axis arranged to be slidingly received on a tissue piercing deployment wire.","The connecting member may be flexible permitting another one of the first and second members to be next to the one of the first and second members when the one of the first and second members is on the tissue piercing deployment wire.","One end of the one of the first and second members may include a pointed tip. The pointed tip may be conical or comprise a tapered sectioned portion.","Both the first and second members may include a longitudinal axis and a through channel along each respective axis. One end of both the first and second members may include a pointed tip. The pointed tips may point in opposite directions.","The through channels are arranged to be slidingly received by the tissue piercing deployment wire. The connecting member may be flexible permitting the first and second members to be in line with each other on the tissue piercing deployment wire.","The first member, second member, and the connecting member may all be formed of plastic material and in one piece or multiple pieces.","The connecting member of the fastener may be formed of plastic elastic material. Alternatively, the connecting member may be formed of a plastic, permanently deformable material. The plastic material may include a color pigment contrasting with body tissue color to enable visualization of the fastener with an endoscope.","The connecting member has a vertical dimension and a horizontal dimension transverse to the vertical dimension, and the horizontal dimension may be substantially less than the vertical dimension rendering the connecting member readily bendable in a horizontal plane. At least one of the first and second members may include a plurality of longitudinally spaced vertical slots rendering the at least one of the first and second members flexible in a direction opposite the slots but stiff in a direction of the slots. The device may comprise a plurality of the connecting members.","The fastener may alternatively be formed of metal and particularly a shape memory material. The first and second members may then be self-deployable. One of the first and second members may be self-deployable while on the tissue piercing deployment wire.","At least one of the first and second members may be self-deployable upon removal from the tissue piercing deployment wire. The at least one of the first and second members is preferably distal to another one of the first and second members and the another one of the first and second members may include a crimp that provides a controlled resistance to movement on the tissue piercing deployment wire.","The first member, the second member, and the connecting member may be integrally formed from a same tubular member stock. The connecting member may comprise a strip of the tubular member formed by a pair of longitudinal substantially parallel, substantially coextensive cuts within the tubular member and the first and second members may be formed by a substantially transverse circumferential cut between the substantially parallel coextensive cuts.","The tubular member may have first and second opposed ends and the substantially parallel substantially coextensive cuts may begin spaced from the first end and terminate spaced from the second end. The first and second members may then be tubular member sections between the circumferential cut and the tubular member first and second ends. An elongated notch may extend from one of the ends of the tubular member, substantially diametrically opposite and juxtaposed to a portion of the connecting member strip.","The invention further provides a fastener assembly for use in a mammalian body. The assembly includes a fastener including a first member, a second member, the first and second members having first and second ends, and a connecting member fixed to each of the first and second members intermediate the first and second ends and extending between the first and second members. The first and second members are separated by the connecting member, and one of the first and second members may have a longitudinal axis and a through channel along the axis. The assembly further includes a deployment wire that slidingly receives the through channel of the one of the first and second members and pierces into the tissue, and a pusher that pushes the one of first and second members into the tissue while on the deployment wire.","The pusher is preferably also arranged to be slidingly received on the deployment wire. The connecting member of the fastener may be flexible, and the assembly may further comprise a guide tube extending over the deployment wire and the fastener. The other one of the first and second members may be disposed next to the one of the first and second members within the guide tube.","One end of the one of the first and second members of the fastener may further include a pointed tip. The pointed tip may comprise a truncated cone. Alternatively, the pointed tip may comprise a sectioned portion. Either one or both of the first and second members may include a longitudinal axis and a through channel along each respective axis. The through channels of the first and second members may be arranged to be slidingly received by the tissue piercing deployment wire and the connecting member is preferably flexible permitting the first and second members to be in line with each other on the tissue piercing deployment wire. The guide tube may then extend over the deployment wire and the fastener.","The invention still further provides a tissue fixation assembly. The assembly includes a fastener and a pair of hingedly coupled first and second arms for receiving the tissue therebetween. The first arm includes a fastener director that directs the fastener into the tissue and the second arm includes an opening permitting the fastener to be driven through the tissue while being held between the first and second arms. The second arm is preferably a frame structure.","The assembly may further comprise a tissue gripper that grips the tissue and pulls the tissue into and between the first and second arms. The first arm may have a tissue engaging surface and the fastener director may include a channel communicating with the tissue engaging surface through which the fastener passes into the tissue.","The fastener director may include a plurality of the channels to direct a like plurality of fasteners into the tissue. The assembly may further comprise a fastener deployment wire that guides the fastener through one of the channels and into the tissue.","The fastener of the assembly may comprise a first member, a second member, the first and second members having first and second ends, and a connecting member fixed to each of the first and second members intermediate the first and second ends and extending between the first and second members. The first and second members are separated by the connecting member when the fastener is deployed. One of the first and second members preferably has a longitudinal axis and a through channel along the axis arranged to be slidingly received on the fastener deployment wire.","The invention still further provides a transoral gastroesophageal flap valve restoration device. The device includes a longitudinal member, a portion of which is arranged for transoral placement into a stomach, a fastener, and a tissue shaper carried on the longitudinal member. The tissue shaper shapes stomach tissue into a shape and includes a pair of hingedly coupled first and second arms for receiving the stomach tissue therebetween, the first arm including a fastener director that directs the fastener into the stomach tissue and the second arm including an opening permitting the fastener to be driven through the stomach tissue while being held between the first and second arms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["40","41","42","43","44","45","46","44","43","41","43","46","47","46","57","48","46","49","49","50","41","43","49","45","43","41","50","49","46","43","51","50","45","43","43","49","49","50"]},"The esophageal tract is controlled by an upper esophageal sphincter (UES)in the neck near the mouth for swallowing, and by the LES  and the GEFV  at the stomach. The normal anti-reflux barrier is primarily formed by the LES  and the GEFV  acting in concert to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach, and to considerably resist reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus  past the gastroesophageal tissue junction . Tissue aboral of the gastroesophageal tissue junction  is generally considered part of the stomach because the tissue protected from stomach acid by its own protective mechanisms. Tissue oral of the gastroesophageal junction  is generally considered part of the esophagus and it is not protected from injury by prolonged exposure to stomach acid. At the gastroesophageal junction , the juncture of the stomach and esophageal tissues form a zigzag line, which is sometimes referred to as the \u201cZ-line.\u201d For the purposes of these specifications, including the claims, \u201cstomach\u201d means the tissue aboral of the gastroesophageal junction .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","49","55","49","55","49","50","49","55","41","52","48","47","57","52","56","55","49","47","50","49","55","49","55","46","41"],"i":"The gastroesophageal flap valve: in vitro and in vivo observations"},"Referring now to , it is a perspective view of a fastener  according to an embodiment of the invention. The fastener  generally includes a first member , a second member , and a connecting member . As may be noted in , the first member  and second member  are substantially parallel and substantially perpendicular to the connecting member  which connects the first member  to the second member .","The first and second members  and  are generally cylindrical. Each has a longitudinal axis  and  and a through channel  and  along the longitudinal axes  and . The through channels  and  are formed by through bores which are dimensioned to be slidingly received on a tissue piercing deployment wire to be described hereinafter.","The first member  also includes a first end  and a second end . Similarly, the second member  includes a first end  and a second end . The first ends  and  form pointed dilation tips  and , respectively. The dilation tips  and  are conical and more particularly take the shape of truncated cones. The pointed tips  and  are pointed in opposite directions.","The first and second members  and  and the connecting  may be formed of different materials and have different textures. These materials may include, for example, plastic materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyglycolic acid, polyurethane, or a thermoplastic elastomer. As may be further noted in , the connecting member  has a vertical dimension  and a horizontal dimension  which is transverse to the vertical dimension. The horizontal dimension is substantially less than the vertical dimension to render the connecting member  readily bendable in a horizontal plane. The connecting member is further rendered bendable by the nature of the plastic material from which the fastener  is formed. The connecting member may be formed from either an elastic plastic or a permanently deformable plastic. An elastic material would prevent compression necrosis in some applications.","Referring now to , it illustrates another fastener  embodying the present invention. As with the fastener  of , the fastener  includes a first member , a second member , and a connecting member . The fastener  may be formed in one piece and a plastic material similar to the fastener  of . The fasteners  and  may be formed of a plastic material which includes a color pigment, for example pthalocyanine blue, for contrasting with the color of body tissue to enable visualization of the fastener with an endoscope during the deployment of the fasteners. In addition, as may be seen in , the fastener  is impregnated with radio opaque material  so as to render the fastener  at least partially viewable under fluoroscopy. The radio opaque particles may be, for example, barium sulfate, bismuth subcarbonate, tungsten powder or tantalum powder.","In addition to the foregoing, the second member  of the fastener  includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced vertical slots . This renders the second member  flexible in a direction opposite the slots but stiff in a direction of the slots. Hence, the second member  is resistant to bending in a first direction indicated by arrow  while being substantially less resistant to bending in a direction indicated by arrow . The reduced resistance to bending in the direction  of the second member  of the fastener  may be utilized to advantage in the deployment of the fastener .","Referring now to , it is a perspective view with portions cut away of a fastener assembly embodying the present invention. The tissue layer portions above the fastener  have been shown cut away in  to enable the deployment procedure to be seen more clearly. The assembly  generally includes a fastener , a deployment wire , a pusher , and a guide tube .","The fastener  takes the form of a further fastener embodiment of the present invention and includes a first member , a second member , and a connecting member . The fastener  differs from the fasteners  and  of , respectively, in that the second member  is of solid construction and does not include a longitudinal through channel or a pointed tip. However, the first member  includes a through channel as previously described and a pointed tip .","The first member  of the fastener  is slidingly received on the deployment wire . The deployment wire  has a pointed tip  for piercing the tissue layers  and  to be fastened together. As will be seen hereinafter, and in accordance with further aspects of the present invention, the tissue layers  and  may be folded stomach tissue which are to be fastened and maintained together to form and maintain a gastroesophageal flap valve.","As will be noted in , the tissue piercing wire , fastener , and the pusher  are all within the guide tube . The guide tube  may take the form of a catheter, for example.","As will be further noted in , the second member  is disposed along side the first member . This is rendered possible by the flexibility of the connecting member . Preferably, the first member, connecting member, and second member are arranged so that the connecting member  lies to the side of the first member  and the second member .","With the first member  of the fastener  slidingly received on the tissue piercing wire  and with the pusher  just touching the first member  on the tissue piercing wire , the tip  of the tissue piercing wire  pierces the tissue layers  and . The subassembly of the tissue piercing wire , fastener , and pusher  may be guided to its intended location relative to the tissue layers  and  by the guide tube . As will be seen hereinafter, this subassembly may be alternatively guided by guide channels arranged to accommodate the tissue piercing wire , fastener , pusher , and the guide tube .","Once the tissue piercing wire  has pierced the tissue layers  and  to be fastened together, the pusher  may be utilized to push the first member  of the fastener  through the tissue layers  and  on the tissue piercing wire . This is illustrated in . As the pusher  pushes the first member  through the tissue layers  and , the connecting member  follows along beside and immediately adjacent to the first member  of the fastener  and the pusher . As may be seen in , the pusher  continues to push the first member  of the fastener  through the tissue layers  and  on the tissue piercing wire  until the end  of the first member  engaging the pusher  clears the second tissue layer . It may also be noted that at this time, the second member  of the fastener  has engaged the surface  of tissue layer .","Referring now to , it will be seen that once the end  of the first member  has cleared the tissue layer , the tissue piercing wire  is then retracted within the pusher  to release the first member .

The first arm  and second arm  are hingedly coupled together at a hinge point . The first arm includes a fastener director . As will be seen hereinafter, stomach tissue layers to be fastened together may be shaped by the tissue shaper  by the first arm  and second arm  confining the stomach tissue layers therebetween. The first arm  has a tissue engaging surface . The first arm further includes a plurality of fastener directing channels . The fastener directly channels  communicate with the tissue engaging surface . Each of the fastener directing channels  serves to direct a fastener into the tissue layers to be fastened together. Accordingly, the fastener directing channels  are configured and dimensioned for receiving a tissue fastener such as, for example, any one of the fasteners previously described herein and embodying the present invention.","The second arm  is a frame structure . The frame structure  defines an opening  to permit the fasteners to be driven through the tissue layers while being held between the first arm  and second arm .","The tissue shaper  further includes a tissue gripper . The tissue gripper  takes the form of a helical coil that grips the stomach tissue. As will be seen hereinafter, the tissue gripper is arranged to pull the stomach tissue into and between the first and second arms  and .","Referring now to , it illustrates the configuration of the device  when shaping stomach tissue into a gastroesophageal flap valve. Here it may be seen that the second arm  has been pivoted relative to the first arm . This permits stomach tissue pulled between the arms  and  to be shaped as a gastroesophageal flap.  shows this in greater detail. Here it may be seen that the tissue gripper  has gripped stomach tissue  to form tissue layers  and  in the shape approximating a gastroesophageal flap. With the stomach tissue  drawn into and between the first arm  and second arm  with the tissue engaging the tissue engaging surface , fasteners may now be directed through the channels  and deployed for fastening stomach tissue layers  and  together. A plurality of channels  are provided to enable a plurality of fasteners to be deployed.","In deploying the fasteners, the fastener directing channels  may serve as guide tubes for guiding tissue piercing wires and pushers as previously described for deploying the fasteners. Alternatively, fastener guide tubes taking the form, for example, of guide tube  previously described, may also be utilized and directed by the channels  in the deployment of the fasteners.","Once the tissue layers  and  are fastened together, they will be maintained in the folded configuration to approximate a gastroesophageal flap valve. The helical coil  may then be rotated to disengage from the tissue and the first and second arms  and  may be pivoted back to an in line configuration for retraction from the stomach and esophagus to complete the gastroesophageal flap valve restoration procedure.","Because in this embodiment, the contacting tissue layers held by the fastener are both serosa tissue, the tissue layers will eventually grow together. Hence, the fasteners of the present invention may be formed of reabsorbable material which, after sufficient time to permit fusion of the tissue layers, will be absorbed by the body.","Referring now to , they illustrate still another fastener  according to an embodiment of the invention. The fastener  generally includes a first member , a second member , and a connecting member structure . As may be noted in  the connecting member structure includes a plurality of connecting members  and . The connecting members  and  connect the first member  to the second member .","The first member  is cylindrical and the second member  is a cylindrical half-section. Each has a longitudinal through channel  and . The through channel  is a through bore which is dimensioned to be a slidingly received on a tissue piercing deployment wire. The channel  is dimensioned to be optionally carried on the deployment wire prior to deployment.","The first member  also includes a conical pointed tip .","The fastener  may be formed of any of the plastic or metal material previously described. As may be further noted in  the connecting members  and  are relatively thin to render the connecting member structure  readily bendable for ease of deployment. The connecting member structure is further rendered bendable of course by the nature of the plastic or metal material from which the fastener  is formed.","Referring now to , they illustrate another fastener  embodying the present invention. As with the previous fastener, the fastener  includes a cylindrical first member , cylindrical half-section  and a connecting member structure . The connecting member structure  includes connecting members  and . Here however, the pointed tip  takes the form of a tapered section of the first member .","As in the previous embodiment the first member  of the fastener  may be slidingly received on a deployment wire. The deployment wire may be received by a bore . The fasteners  and  may be deployed as previously described.","While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, modifications may be made, and it is therefore intended in the appended claims to cover all such changes and modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims.
