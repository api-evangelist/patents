{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/100,452, filed Sep. 15, 1998, entitled \u201cAnnotations for Streaming Video on the Web: System Design and Usage\u201d, to Anoop Gupta and David M. Bargeron.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","This invention relates to networked client\/server systems and to annotating media content in such systems. More particularly, the invention relates to creating, viewing, and temporally positioning annotations for media content.","The advent of computers and their continued technological advancement has revolutionized the manner in which people work and live. An example of such is in the education field, wherein educational presentations (e.g., college lectures, workplace training sessions, etc.) can be provided to a computer user as multimedia data (e.g., video, audio, text, and\/or animation data). Today, such presentations are primarily video and audio, but a richer, broader digital media era is emerging. Educational multimedia presentations provide many benefits, such as allowing the presentation data to be created at a single time yet be presented to different users at different times and in different locations throughout the world.","These multimedia presentations are provided to a user as synchronized media. Synchronized media means multiple media objects that share a common timeline. Video and audio are examples of synchronized media\u2014each is a separate data stream with its own data structure, but the two data streams are played back in synchronization with each other. Virtually any media type can have a timeline. For example, an image object can change like an animated gif file, text can change and move, and animation and digital effects can happen over time. This concept of synchronizing multiple media types is gaining greater meaning and currency with the emergence of more sophisticated media composition frameworks implied by MPEG-4, Dynamic HTML, and other media playback environments.","The term \u201cstreaming\u201d is used to indicate that the data representing the various media types is provided over a network to a client computer on a real-time, as needed basis, rather than being pre-delivered in its entirety before playback. Thus, the client computer renders streaming data as it is received from a network server, rather than waiting for an entire \u201cfile\u201d to be delivered.","Multimedia presentations may also include \u201cannotations\u201d relating to the multimedia presentation. An annotation is data (e.g., audio, text, video, etc.) that corresponds to a multimedia presentation. Annotations can be added by anyone with appropriate access rights to the annotation system (e.g., the lecturer\/trainer or any of the students\/trainees). These annotations typically correspond to a particular temporal location in the multimedia presentation and can provide a replacement for much of the \u201cin-person\u201d interaction and \u201cclassroom discussion\u201d that is lost when the presentation is not made \u201cin-person\u201d or \u201clive\u201d. As part of an annotation, a student can comment on a particular point, to which another student (or lecturer) can respond in a subsequent annotation. This process can continue, allowing a \u201cclassroom discussion\u201d to occur via these annotations.","In the past, there has been little development of a coherent interface to ensure a high-quality user experience in creating and viewing annotations. The invention described below addresses the user experience by providing a user-friendly interface for creating and viewing annotations for multimedia presentations.","In a networked client\/server system, media content as well as annotations corresponding to the media content can be transmitted from a server(s) to a client. A user interface is presented to the user to facilitate creating new annotations and viewing annotations.","According to one aspect of the invention, annotations correspond to a temporal range of the media content as defined by a temporal beginning point and a temporal ending point. When a user desires to create a new annotation the client assists the user in determining the temporal range of the media content to which the new annotation is to correspond. The client receives the user request to create the new annotation, which often times is made after the desired temporal beginning point for the new annotation has passed. The client analyzes the media content and detects likely beginning points for the new annotation and identifies these beginning points to the user. The user can then select one as the beginning point for the new annotation. Analogous assistance can be provided in determining the ending point for the new annotation.","According to another aspect of the invention, the user interface includes implicit information for use in creating and\/or viewing annotations. For example, in one implementation annotations can belong to one or more different annotation sets. The user interface can be associated with selected ones of these different annotation sets, so that any newly created annotations automatically belong to that set, or annotation queries automatically query that set, without requiring the user to specify the set.","According to another aspect of the invention, the user interface includes multiple user-configurable buttons. The user can assign various actions to these buttons, such as the creation of new annotations with pre-identified subject lines, pre-defined content, pre-defined association with particular annotation sets, etc.","General Network Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","11","12","13","15","16"]},"Streaming media server computer  has access to streaming media content in the form of different media streams. These media streams can be individual media streams (e.g., audio, video, graphical, etc.), or alternatively composite media streams including two or more of such individual streams. Some media streams might be stored as files in a database or other file storage system, while other media streams might be supplied to the server on a \u201clive\u201d basis from other data source components through dedicated communications channels or through the Internet itself. Different versions of the same media content (e.g., low-resolution and high resolution versions) may be available to server computer .","There are various standards for streaming media content and composite media streams. \u201cAdvanced Streaming Format\u201d (ASF) is an example of such a standard, including both accepted versions of the standard and proposed standards for future adoption. ASF specifies the way in which multimedia content is stored, streamed, and presented by the tools, servers, and clients of various multimedia vendors. Further details about ASF are available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","Annotation server  controls the storage of annotations and their provision to client computers . The annotation server  manages the annotation meta data store  and the annotation content store . The annotation server  communicates with the client computers  via any of a wide variety of known protocols, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The annotation server  can receive and provide annotations via direct contact with a client computer , or alternatively via electronic mail (email) via email server . The annotation server  similarly communicates with the email server  via any of a wide variety of known protocols, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).","The annotations managed by annotation server  correspond to the streaming media available from media server computer . In the discussions to follow, the annotations are discussed as corresponding to streaming media. However, it should be noted that the annotations can similarly correspond to \u201cpre-delivered\u201d rather than streaming media, such as media previously stored at the client computers  via the network , via removable magnetic or optical disks, etc.","When a user of a client computer  accesses a web page containing streaming media, a conventional web browser of the client computer  contacts the web server  to request a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page. The client-based browser also submits requests to the media server  for streaming data, and the annotation server  for any annotations associated with the streaming data. When a user of a client computer  desires to add or retrieve annotations, the client computer  contacts the annotation server  to perform the desired addition\/retrieval.","Exemplary Computer Environment","In the discussion below, the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more conventional personal computers. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. In a distributed computer environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","10","13","15","1"]},"Computer  includes one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to processors .","The bus  represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . Computer  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from and writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by an SCSI interface  or some other appropriate interface. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk  and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, random access  memories (RAMs) read only memories (ROM), and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM , or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into computer  through input devices such as keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit  through an interface  that is coupled to the system bus. A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as speakers and printers.","Computer  operates in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in FIG. . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet. In the described embodiment of the invention, remote computer  executes an Internet Web browser program such as the \u201cInternet Explorer\u201d Web browser manufactured and distributed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","When used in a LAN networking environment, computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via a serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Generally, the data processors of computer  are programmed by means of instructions stored at different times in the various computer-readable storage media of the computer. Programs and operating systems are typically distributed, for example, on floppy disks or CD-ROMs. From there, they are installed or loaded into the secondary memory of a computer. At execution, they are loaded at least partially into the computer's primary electronic memory. The invention described herein includes these and other various types of computer-readable storage media when such media contain instructions or programs for implementing the steps described below in conjunction with a microprocessor or other data processor. The invention also includes the computer itself when programmed according to the methods and techniques described below. Furthermore, certain sub-components of the computer may be programmed to perform the functions and steps described below. The invention includes such sub-components when they are programmed as described. In addition, the invention described herein includes data structures, described below, as embodied on various types of memory media.","For purposes of illustration, programs and other executable program components such as the operating system are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of the computer, and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.","Client\/Server Relationship",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["15","10","15","10"]},"Client  runs an HTTP services (HttpSvcs) module , which manages communication with server , and an annotation back end (ABE) module , which translates user actions into commands destined for server . A user interface (MMA) module  provides the user interface (UI) for a user to add and select different annotations, and be presented with the annotations. According to one implementation, the user interface module  supports ActiveX controls that display an annotation interface for streaming video on the Web.","Client  also executes a web browser module , which provides a conventional web browsing interface and capabilities for the user to access various servers via network  of FIG. . Web browser  also provides the interface for a user to select particular media streams for presentation. The user can select which one of different versions of multimedia content he or she wishes to receive from media server  of FIG. . This selection can be direct (e.g., entry of a particular URL or selection of a \u201clow resolution\u201d option), or indirect (e.g., entry of a particular desired playback duration or an indication of system capabilities, such as \u201cslow system\u201d or \u201cfast system\u201d). Alternatively, other media presentation interfaces could be used.","Annotation server  includes the Multimedia Annotation Web Server (MAWS) module , which is an Internet Services Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) plug-in for Internet Information Server (IIS) module  Together, these two modules provide the web server functionality of annotation server . Annotation server  also includes an HTTP Services module  which manages communication with client . In addition, annotation server  utilizes The Windows Messaging Subsystem  to facilitate communication with email server  of , and an email reply server  for processing incoming email received from email server .","Annotation server  further includes an annotation back end (ABE) module , which contains functionality for accessing annotation stores  and , for composing outgoing email based on annotation data, and for processing incoming email. Incoming email is received and passed to the ABE module  by the Email Reply Server . Annotation content authored at client , using user interface , is received by ABE  and maintained in annotation content store . Received meta data (control information) corresponding to the annotation content is maintained in annotation meta data store . The annotation content and meta data can be stored in any of a variety of conventional manners, such as in SQL relational databases (e.g., using Microsoft \u201cSQL Server\u201d version 7.0, available from Microsoft Corporation). Annotation server  is illustrated in  as maintaining the annotation content and associated control information (meta data) separately in two different stores. Alternatively, all of the annotation data (content and meta information) can be stored together in a single store, or content may be stored by another distinct storage system on the network  of , such as a file system, media server, email server, or other data store.","Each of the annotations maintained in annotation stores  and  corresponds to each of the different versions of particular multimedia content available to media server . Thus, regardless of the number of different versions of particular multimedia content available to media server , each annotation created by annotation server  is maintained as a single copy corresponding to all of these different versions.","Annotation Storage Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["180","10","18","3","180","182","184","186","188","190","192","194","196","198","200","202","204","182","204","180"]},"Author field  contains data identifying the user who created annotation entry  and who is therefore the author of the annotation. The author is identified by ABE  of  based on the user logged into client  at the time the annotation is created.","Time range field  contains data representing \u201cbegin\u201d and \u201cend\u201d times defining a segment of media timeline to which annotation entry  is associated. Time units field  contains data representing the units of time represented in time range field . Together, time range field  and time units field  identify the relative time range of the annotation represented by annotation entry . This relative time range corresponds to a particular segment of the media content to which annotation entry  is associated. The begin and end times for the annotation are provided by the user via interface  of , or alternatively can be automatically or implicitly derived using a variety of audio and video signal processing techniques, such as sentence detection in audio streams or video object tracking.","The begin and end times stored in time range field  reference the version of the media content being played back when annotation entry  was created, or alternatively reference the base version. The media content can have multiple different versions, some of which may have different presentation timelines (as discussed in more detail below). The particular range of another version, for instance the one currently being viewed by a user, to which the annotation corresponds can thus be readily determined based on the time range field  and time units field , in conjunction with the known relationship among the presentation timeline of the base version, the version being viewed, and the version on which the annotation was originally created.","It should be noted that the time ranges for different annotations can overlap. Thus, for example, a first annotation may correspond to a segment ranging between the first and fourth minutes of media content, a second annotation may correspond to a segment ranging between the second and seventh minutes of the media content, and a third annotation may correspond to a segment ranging between the second and third minutes of the media content.","Alternatively, rather than using the presentation timeline of the media content, different media characteristics can be used to associate the annotation with a particular segment(s) of the media content. For example, annotations could be associated with (or \u201canchored\u201d on) specific objects in the video content, or specific events in the audio content.","Creation time field  contains data specifying the date and time at which annotation entry  is created. The time of creation of annotation entry  is absolute and is not relative to the video or audio content of the media stream to which annotation entry  is associated. Accordingly, a user can specify that annotations which are particularly old, e.g., created more than two weeks earlier, are not to be displayed. ABE  of  stores the creation time and date when the annotation is created.","Title field  contains data representing a title by which the annotation represented by annotation entry  is identified. The title is generally determined by the user and the user enters the data representing the title using conventional and well known user interface techniques. The data can be as simple as ASCII text or as complex as HTML code which can include text having different fonts and type styles, graphics including wallpaper, motion video images, audio, and links to other multimedia documents. The title is also referred to herein as the \u201csubject\u201d or \u201csubject line\u201d for the annotation.","Content field  contains data representing the substantive content of the annotation as authored by the user. The actual data can be stored in content field , or alternatively content field  may store a pointer to (or other indicator of) the content that is stored separately from the entry  itself. In the illustrated example, content field  includes a pointer to (or other identifier of) the annotation content, which in turn is stored in annotation content store . The user enters the data representing the content using conventional and well known user interface techniques. The content added by the user in creating annotation entry  can include any one or more of text, graphics, video, audio, etc. or links thereto. In essence, content field  contains data representing the substantive content the user wishes to include with the presentation of the corresponding media stream at the relative time range represented by time range field  and time units field .","In one implementation, annotations can be any media type with an associated OLE (object linking and embedding)-compliant viewer or editor, including both accepted versions of the OLE standard and proposed standards for future adoption. OLE specifies the way in which data (e.g., files or portions of files) can be linked to or embedded in another file (or portion of a file). Content field  can store the necessary linking and embedding information to link to or embed the data (files, documents, etc.) for the annotation. Further details about OLE are available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","Annotation identifier field  stores data that uniquely identifies annotation entry , while related annotation identifier field  stores data that uniquely identifies a related annotation. Annotation identifier field  can be used by other annotation entries to associate such other annotation entries with annotation entry . In this way, threads of discussion can develop in which a second annotation responds to a first annotation, a third annotation responds to the second annotation and so on. By way of example, an identifier of the first annotation would be stored in related annotation identifier field  of the second annotation, an identifier of the second annotation would be stored in related annotation identifier field  of the third annotation, and so on.","Set identifier(s) field  stores data that identifies one or more sets to which annotation entry  belongs. Media content can have multiple sets of annotations, sets can span multiple media content, and a particular annotation can correspond to one or more of these sets. Which set(s) an annotation belongs to is identified by the author of the annotation. By way of example, media content corresponding to a lecture may include the following sets: \u201cinstructor's comments\u201d, \u201cassistant's comments\u201d, \u201caudio comments\u201d, \u201ctext comments\u201d, \u201cstudent questions\u201d, and each student's personal comments.","Media content identifier field  contains data that uniquely identifies particular multimedia content as the content to which annotation entry  corresponds. Media content identifier  can identify a single media stream (either an individual stream or a composite stream), or alternatively identify multiple different streams that are different versions of the same media content. Media content identifier  can identify media versions in a variety of different manners. According to one embodiment, the data represents a real-time transport protocol (RTP) address of the different media streams. An RTP address is a type of uniform resource locator (URL) by which multimedia documents can be identified in a network. According to an alternate embodiment, a unique identifier is assigned to the content rather than to the individual media streams. According to another alternate embodiment, a different unique identifier of the media streams could be created by annotation server  of FIG.  and assigned to the media streams. Such a unique identifier would also be used by streaming media server  of  to identify the media streams. According to another alternate embodiment, a uniform resource name (URN) such as those described by K. Sollins and L. Mosinter in \u201cFunctional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names,\u201d IETF RFC 1733 (December 1994) could be used to identify the media stream.","User-defined property fields  are one or more user-definable fields that allow users (or user interface designers) to customize the annotation system. Examples of such additional property fields include a \u201creference URL\u201d property which contains the URL of a web page used as reference material for the content of the annotation; a \u201chelp URL\u201d property containing the URL of a help page which can be accessed concerning the content of the annotation; a \u201cview script\u201d property containing JavaScript which is to be executed whenever the annotation is viewed; a \u201cdisplay type\u201d property, which gives the client user interface information about how the annotation is to be displayed; etc.","Sequence number  allows a user to define (via user interface  of ) a custom ordering for the display of annotation identifiers, as discussed in more  detail below. Sequence number  stores the relative position of the annotations with respect to one another in the custom ordering, allowing the custom ordering to be saved for fixture used. In the illustrated example, annotation entry  stores a single sequence number. Alternatively, multiple sequence numbers  may be included in annotation entry  each corresponding to a different custom ordering, or a different annotation set, or a different user, etc.","Annotation Positioning","An annotation can be created by a user of any of the client computers  of FIG. . When a user is playing back multimedia content he or she can add an annotation to any temporal point or range of the content that he or she desires. Situations can arise, however, where the user does not realize that he or she wants to add an annotation until after the desired temporal point or beginning of the temporal range has passed. For example, a user may desire to add an annotation to a particular segment of a lecture. However, the playback of the lecture may be twenty seconds into the segment (or the segment may be over) before the user realizes that he or she wants to add the annotation. Manually searching back through the content to locate the correct temporal point where the annotation should begin can be a difficult and cumbersome process.","User interface module  of  assists the user in temporally positioning the annotation, including assisting the user in locating the correct or starting point for the annotation. Interface module  allows the user to scan back through the multimedia content by identifying the likely beginning points for new ideas or sentences. The user will typically want to set the starting point for an annotation to be the beginning of a sentence or new idea, so interface  allows the user to scan back through the multimedia content jumping from likely beginning point to likely beginning point (e.g., by selecting a \u201crewind\u201d button). Alternatively, interface  may simply jump back to the first (or some other predetermined or dynamically determined number) likely beginning point and use that as the starting point for the annotation without requiring user input.","Interface module  communicates with web browser  or other multimedia presentation application that is presenting the multimedia content to access the multimedia content and locate likely beginning points for sentences or new ideas. Interface  can also communicate to web browser  (or other multimedia presentation application) to present the media content at a particular temporal location (e.g., a likely beginning point). It may also be necessary for interface  or web browser  to access media server  of  to obtain the data for previously-presented portions of the media content.","Likely beginning points for new ideas or sentences can be determined using a wide variety of techniques. Any one of these techniques can be used to determine likely beginning points, or alternatively multiple techniques may be combined. One such technique is referred to as \u201cpause detection\u201d. In pause detection, the audio content is monitored to identify pauses in the audio presentation. Such pauses are selected as likely beginning points as new sentences or ideas are typically preceded by a pause when the presenter is speaking. Another such technique is referred to as \u201cpitch analysis\u201d. In pitch analysis, the audio content is monitored to identify the relative pitch of the presenter's voice. When the presenter is talking about more important ideas or issues the pitch of his or her voice is often higher than when talking about less important ideas or issues. Thus, points where the pitch is higher are likely beginning points for new ideas.","Another such technique is to use conventional speech-to-text conversion techniques to convert the audio content to text. Conventional natural language processing techniques can then be used to identify sentence boundaries.","Yet another such technique is referred to as video frame analysis, in which the video content is monitored. In one implementation, frames of the video content are monitored for movement. For example, a speaker shown in the video content may move his or her hands a significant amount while speaking, and hold them relatively still during pauses. Thus, breaks between sentences or ideas could be identified by detecting breaks in movement of objects in the video content. By way of another example, any of a variety of conventional object recognition and tracking algorithms could be used to identify and track particular objects. Idea or subject breaks can be identified by detecting when the particular objects are no longer in view, or when they stop moving.","Additionally, user interface module  can similarly assist users in determining the ending point for an annotation. Situations can arise where the entire temporal range that the annotation should correspond to has been presented before the user selects to add an annotation. Interface module  can identify likely ending points in the same manner as likely beginning points are identified, allowing the user to scan back through the multimedia content jumping from likely ending point to likely ending point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["152","3"]},"Initially, interface module  receives a user request to add a new annotation corresponding to media content being played back (step ). Upon receipt of the request, interface  identifies the temporal location in the media content being presented at the time the request is received (step ).","Interface  then accesses the media content (e.g., via web browser ) and searches temporally back through the media content for a likely beginning point prior to the temporal location identified in step  (step ). An indication of the likely beginning point is provided to the user, such as beginning playback of the media content at the likely beginning point, or presenting a frame of the video content that corresponds to the likely beginning point (step ).","If the user selects the likely beginning point (step ), such as by actuation of an on-screen button or menu option, then interface  uses the selected beginning point as the starting point for the annotation (step ). Otherwise, interface  continues to determine likely beginning points (step ) and provided indications of the points to the user (step ), until eventually the user selects one.","Additionally, the process of  could be used to \u201cscan\u201d forward temporally rather than scan backwards. A user could scan forward to locate an ending point or beginning point for the annotation. For example, if a user were scanning backwards to identify the beginning point, the user may \u201covershoot\u201d the desired starting point and begin scanning forward.","User Interface","An annotation can be created by a user of any of the client computers  of FIG. . As discussed above with reference to , client  includes an interface module  that presents an interface to a user (e.g., a graphical user interface(GUI)), allowing a user to make requests of annotation server . Numerous windows, dialog boxes, tool bars, etc. can be displayed to the user by interface module , as discussed in more detail below. In the illustrated embodiment, a user can access annotation server  via an annotation toolbar provided by interface .","The interface module  is an application program (or part of an application program) that is executed at client . The interface module  may be incorporated into the web browser, operating system, or run as part of a separate, self-contained application which can be stored locally at client  or alternatively received from a remote server (e.g., web page server  of ) for execution at client .

When interface module  begins displaying the video presentation in portion , it sends a pause request to the multimedia presentation application to pause the presentation of the multimedia content.

Visual content of an annotation identified by an annotation identifier selected in portion  is displayed in annotation content portion .","Configurable buttons  are user-configurable buttons that can be configured by the user to carry out any of a wide variety of actions that he or she desires. In the illustrated example, window  is intended to be used as an \u201cobservation\u201d window via which an individual observing another individual's behavior (e.g., during software testing) can enter comments and notes for later use. Any such comments or notes are added as an annotation and are not made available to the individual being observed (e.g., by blocking access rights to the appropriate annotation set or adding them to a video stream that is not visible to the individual being observed). By configuring the buttons  to actions that the observer is likely to use frequently, the interface is made more user-friendly and allows the observer to record common comments and\/or notes by simply clicking on the appropriate customized buttons.","In the illustrated example of , buttons  include ten user-definable buttons, of which only three have been defined. As part of the definition process, the user provides a title for the button that is displayed as part of window . The three buttons that have been defined are labeled \u201cstart\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d, and \u201cbookmark\u201d.","The meaning of these buttons and their associated actions are dependent on how they have been programmed. For example, the \u201cstart\u201d, and \u201cstop\u201d buttons may simply create new annotations with the subjects of \u201cstart\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d, respectively, with \u201cstart\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d having some intrinsic meaning to the user  no annotation content or body would be included. The \u201cbookmark\u201d button may create a new annotation with a predetermined subject and content to be entered by the user when the annotation is created.","Selecting one of the annotation identifiers in portion  (e.g., by \u201cright clicking\u201d on the identifier) brings up a menu  providing various options to the user, analogous to menu  of FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0158"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["690","690","670","24"]},"However, in window  a new annotation is being entered with the annotation content being input in content portion .
