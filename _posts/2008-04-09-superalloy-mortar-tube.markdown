title: Superalloy mortar tube
abstract: A finless mortar tube made of a superalloy includes, seriatim, a breech end, a beginning taper point, an ending taper point, a lower clamp region, an upper clamp region, and a muzzle end. The nominal wall thickness of the tube is constant from forward of the breech end to the beginning taper point and the nominal wall thickness of the tube decreases from the beginning taper point to the ending taper point. The mortar tube is capable of a substantial increase in the rate of fire compared to conventional mortar tubes.

No. 11\/162,745 filed on Sep. 21, 2005, which claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. provisional patent applications 60\/522,510 filed on Oct. 7, 2004 and 60\/522,566 filed on Oct. 14, 2004, which applications are hereby incorporated by reference.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to mortar tubes, and in particular to finless mortar tubes with reduced wall thicknesses.","Mortars tubes presently used by the United States armed forces are generally available in three sizes of nominal inside diameter, namely, 60 mm (millimeter), 81 mm and 120 mm. The current 60 mm and 81 mm mortar tubes have cooling fins that function to reduce the tube temperature during firing. The mortar tube cooling fins are expensive to manufacture and add additional weight to the mortar tube. The 120 mm mortar tube does not have cooling fins because its required rate of fire is less than the 60 mm and 81 mm mortars. Lightweight finless mortar tubes in the 60 mm and 81 mm sizes that are capable of firing high pressure rounds at the high rates of fire characteristic of United States mortars are not known.","Generally speaking, the soldier in the field benefits whenever anything he\/she must handle is made to weigh less. In \u201cHydrostatic Extrusion of 60 mm Mortar Tubes\u201d (Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, N.Y., October 1974, available from NTIS, Springfield, Va.), DeFries describes the hydrostatic extrusion of four 60 mm tubes made of Inconel, a \u201csuperalloy.\u201d These tubes were relatively thick-walled (approximately 5 mm or greater) and included cooling fins. Although some mechanical tests were performed on the DeFries tubes, it does not appear that the tubes were ever \u201clive-fire\u201d tested. There is a need for a mortar tube that is light in weight (thin-walled), cheap to manufacture (no cooling fins), and capable of rapid, continuous firing without failure.","An object of the invention is to provide mortar tubes that are lighter in weight than known mortar tubes.","Another object of the invention is to provide finless mortar tubes in the 60 mm and 81 mm sizes.","A further object of the invention is to provide light-weight, finless mortar tubes that can withstand rapid, continuous firing rates without plastic deformation.","One aspect of the invention is a mortar tube comprising a tube having no cooling fins, made of a superalloy, and having a nominal constant inside diameter of about 60 mm; the tube comprising, seriatim, a breech end, a beginning taper point, an ending taper point, a lower clamp region, an upper clamp region, and a muzzle end; a nominal wall thickness of the tube being constant from forward of the breech end to the beginning taper point and the nominal wall thickness of the tube decreasing from the beginning taper point to the ending taper point; wherein the tube does not undergo plastic deformation when firing 30 rounds per minute for four minutes and 20 rounds per minute continuous thereafter, at a maximum pressure of about 10,080 psi.","Another aspect of the invention is a mortar tube comprising a tube having no cooling fins, made of a superalloy, and having a nominal constant inside diameter of about 81 mm; the tube comprising, seriatim, a breech end, a beginning taper point, an ending taper point, a lower clamp region, an upper clamp region, and a muzzle end; a nominal wall thickness of the tube being constant from forward of the breech end to the beginning taper point and the nominal wall thickness of the tube decreasing from the beginning taper point to the ending taper point; wherein the tube does not undergo plastic deformation when firing 30 rounds per minute for two minutes and 15 rounds per minute continuous thereafter, at a maximum pressure of about 15,800 psi.","Further aspects of the invention are methods of making mortar tubes from superalloys.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The embodiments of the present invention are mortar tubes that do not have the cooling fins of conventional mortar tubes. The inventive mortar tubes are made of a high strength superalloy. Superalloys are known and typically fall into one of three types, iron based, cobalt based and nickel based. In general, the superalloys have material strengths greater than 140 ksi at tube temperatures greater than 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. The use of a higher strength material permits a thinner wall thickness, as compared to conventional tubes. The mortar tubes made according to the invention weigh approximately thirty percent less than conventional mortar tubes.","Many complex, interrelated and often conflicting factors influence the wall thickness of a mortar tube. Through years of work, the inventors have developed tube profiles for 60 mm and 81 mm finless mortar tubes made of a superalloy, such as Inconel 718 Factors considered include, inter alia, interior ballistics, heat transfer, temperature and pressure profiles, amount of charge per round (charge one to charge four), projectile weight, required rate of fire, wearing of the tube thickness, and stresses not induced by firing, for example, impact stresses caused by dropping the tube on the ground and stresses caused by attaching other components to the tube, such as a bipod. Both computer simulations and live firing test methods were used. Another factor that influences the wall thickness is the manufacturing method. Tubes of a given thickness profile may be satisfactorily produced using one manufacturing method, but another manufacturing method may require adjustments to the tube thickness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["10","10","1","1","10","12","14","10","10","12","10","10","10","12"]},"The rate of fire (ROF) in number of rounds per minute (rds\/min) is an important factor in determining the temperatures that a mortar tube will experience. The higher the ROF number, the higher the temperatures the mortar tube will experience. For an 81 mm finless mortar tube of conventional construction, the maximum ROF is 25 rds\/min for 1 minute and 5 rds\/min sustained. The conventional tube has a low ROF and is unable to satisfy future requirements for operational use.","In the invention, the performance criteria for the 60 mm and 81 mm tubes involve worst case firing conditions wherein the ambient air temperature is 145 F (63 C) and there is no wind related cooling (a calm day). In accordance with the requirements of STANAG 4110 (A NATO STANardization AGreement for the Definition of Pressure Terms and Their Interrelationship for Use in the Design and Proof of Cannons or Mortars and Ammunition), the mortar tube must be able to function within its design requirements without undergoing plastic deformation when firing a 1 in a million max pressure.","The ROF for the inventive 60 mm tube is 30 rounds per minute for 4 minutes and 20 rounds per minute continuous thereafter. The 60 mm round is a charge four round with a 3 lbm projectile. The one in a million pressure for the 60 mm tube is 10,080 psi. For the 60 mm tube, the hottest temperature occurs during the first 4 minutes when the barrel is being fired at 30 rpm.","The ROF for the inventive 81 mm tube is 30 rounds per minute for 2 minutes and 15 rounds per minute continuous thereafter. The 81 mm round is a charge four round with a 9 lbm projectile. The one in a million pressure for the 81 mm tube is 15,800 psi. For the 81 mm tube, the hottest temperature is reached during the sustained firing period at 15 rpm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["20","20"]},"Tube  has a nominal constant inside diameter of about 60 mm.
