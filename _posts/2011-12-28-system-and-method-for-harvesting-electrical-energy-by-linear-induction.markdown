{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) of U.S. provisional patent application 61\/485,736, filed on May 13, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by, or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes.","The present invention relates in general to the field of energy harvesting, particularly in small arms weapon systems, by linear induction. More specifically, this invention relates to resolving the persistent need of the modern war-fighter for readily available, portable electric power on the battlefield, by providing a self-powering or charging capability for the electronic devices.","Equipment incorporating electronics components, such as magnifying optics, telecommunications\/navigation equipment, night vision, range finders, laser designators, and other similar devices, have become indispensible to the soldier particularly on the battlefield. New electronic devices are constantly being developed and deployed as well.","This technology increases the efficiency and safety of the soldiers. In addition, the soldiers' missions are rendered more survivable by enabling rapid identification, situational awareness, and target engagement. While these technological advances provide the armed forces with an important advantage in battle, they also present inherent logistics problems.","More specifically, the batteries that support the electronic devices have a finite life. Even rechargeable battery technology is of limited use to a fielded and fighting soldier. It is common practice to replace batteries going into combat at least daily. Shortage of fresh batteries and the possibility of depletion while in combat pose a serious threat to the modern soldier trying to exploit the enhanced fighting capabilities technology.","It would therefore be desirable to offer self-powering capability for these electronic devices, or a means of battery recharging, while operating away from a power grid. In this way, both the gross mass of batteries needed to operate in the field, and the likelihood of electronics power failure during hot combat would be reduced.","However, there are numerous challenges associated with practically capturing electrical energy from the rounds that are shot from a weapon, because significant energy is wasted in mechanical motion and heat. Modern automatic weapons such as an M16 assault rifle, M4 carbine, M249 squad automatic weapon, and a whole plethora of commercial and military small arms, operate by imparting a portion of a fired round's expanding gas force to cycle the gun's mechanism.","The weapon is generally designed to extract and eject a spent round from the gun barrel, load a subsequent round, and trigger some firing device, all within a fraction of a second. The moving parts therefore must translate in a back and forth manner at high velocities, where speeds exceeding 20 feet per second are not uncommon, at certain times during the recoil and counter-recoil (return) portions of the M249's operation cycle.","What is therefore needed is an advanced system and associated method that uses this high cyclic rate and high speed linear action for capturing electrical energy. Prior to the advent of the present invention, the need for such an optimization framework has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need and describes novel embodiments of a linear induction generator for use in a weapon system to harvest energy by linear induction. More particularly, the linear induction generator resolves the persistent need of the modern war-fighter for readily available, portable electric power on the battlefield, by providing a self-powering or charging capability for the electronic devices.","According to a preferred embodiment, the linear induction generator is mounted (or retrofit) on a weapon to generate raw electric current (or potential). A rectifier circuit (or power conditioner) rectifies and filters (or transforms) the raw electric current (or voltage) to a standard (or useable) current (or voltage). The rectifier circuitry rectifies and smoothes the raw signal, since the output response needs to be of a uniform or near uniform direct-current in order to charge a battery or to operate most small electronics. The rectifier circuit preferably employs a full wave rectifier to capture the entirety of the raw signal. Coupled to a resistor-capacitor filter, the desired voltage can be output and ready for use.","A power distribution logic circuit distributes or channels the usable waveform (current or voltage) either to a centralized power storage, or directly to the device being utilized. A notional system includes a centralized power storage unit, in the form of batteries, capacitor banks, or some other means and permanently mounted with the weapon.","A standardized electrical interface connects the centralized power storage to a standardized rail mounting system. A standardized electrical interface connects the standardized rail mounting system to the battlefield electronics or devices.","The linear induction generator generally includes a matrix of coils, a matrix of magnets, a spindle structure (or spindle assembly), and a dust cover. The linear induction generator is mounted externally to a weapon receiver of the weapon. The coils may be connected in series, in parallel, or in a combination thereof. The matrix of magnets comprises several magnets and is mounted oppositely to the coils.","The electrical potential generated by the linear induction generator will be the same whether the magnetic field generated by the matrix of magnets is fixed, or whether the matrix of coils is fixed, so long as a relative motion exists between the matrix of magnets and the matrix of coils.","The present invention utilizes the potential to extract usable electrical energy from the kinetic energy associated with the operation of an automatic weapon. There are several challenges associated with practically capturing this power. From an energy conservation standpoint, however, the high cyclic rate of the weapon mechanism and the high speed linear action are favorable for energy capture by linear induction.","The general principle behind electricity production in generators, whether linear or rotary, is Faraday induction. Faraday induction is based on the concept that a conductor that moves relative to a surrounding magnetic field (or vice-versa) will experience an induced electrical current that is directly proportional to the relative speed. In a conventional generator, conductive loops of wire rotate within a fixed magnetic field created by either permanent or electro-magnets. Current is generated because the wire coils are changing their orientation with respect to the fixed field. The rate change over time of this quantity, called magnetic flux, is equal to the potential difference (voltage) across the terminals of the loop. Depending on the load that is attached to this circuit, more or less electrical amperage or current is transmitted to this load (e.g., a light bulb).","More specific to the present invention is the concept of linear induction, which is the application of the Faraday induction principle to a conductor-field pair that translates with respect to one another instead of rotating. While more difficult to set up, given the same magnetic field and same relative motion, an identical potential difference will be created.","As shown in , , and , a conductive wire loop (or coil , , , ) moves through a fixed magnetic field, F, that can be generated by either opposing magnets ,  (), a single magnet  (), or a plurality of adjacently, co-planarly disposed magnets , . While only one or two magnets are illustrated in , , and , it should be clear that a larger number of magnets may also be used for increased output.","Because the wire loop  is passing from one oriented field (e.g., S) to an oppositely oriented field (e.g., N), the enclosed areas (Areas A, B, ) and therefore the fluxes, are either increasing or decreasing at a rate proportional to the velocity (dx\/dt) of the relative motion (linear translation) of the wire loop . A decreasing flux occurs at a positively oriented field (Area A) and an increasing flux occurs in a negatively oriented field (Area B). The potential across the terminals of the wire loop  can be superimposed and summed. In this manner, the voltage generated is twice that of a single loop-magnet coupling. This pole-pairing is important to high yield.","As more clearly illustrated in , the coils ,  linearly translate back and forth relative to the magnets , , along two opposing directions, at either the same (or different) translation speeds (or velocities). In a different arrangement, the coils ,  can be fixed and the magnets ,  translate relative to the coils , .","An important feature of the present invention is the use of multiple pole pairs to produce additional yield. As shown in , each pole pair ,  is a pair of magnetic fields in the staggered configuration, paired up with one bundle of conductive loops , , respectively. The area labeled A experiences a decreasing flux in a negative magnetic field, while the area labeled B experiences a decreasing flux in a positive magnetic field. Because the loop (or coil) is a single circuit, current is induced from both areas in the same direction. The same is true of areas B and A. Ideally, the length of the loops (in the direction of travel) is equal to the length of each magnet for maximum output. The output can be multiplied by the number of pole pairs used on the system.","Mathematically, the electrical potential, \u03b5, is proportional to the sum of changing areas of flux and the field strength, B, at the wire loop, , as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u025b","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":["\u03a6","B"]}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"B","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"A"},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]}}},{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"Bw","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]}}}],"mo":"="}}}}}},"Magnetic flux is defined as the total \u201cquantity\u201d of a magnetic circuit's field lines passing through an enclosed conductor. In the present configuration, a delta flux is produced when the conductor or wire loop  moves more or less into the field perpendicular to it normal direction. This area is defined as its width \u201cW\u201d by its length \u201cL\u201d. The length, L, which is immersed at a given time in a particular field, changes proportionally to the speed of translation of the wire loop , with its width, W, remaining constant. The derived relationship, then, reveals that the output is a directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the conductor geometry, and the speed with which they are moving with respect to one another. Each additional loop added to the circuit will contribute in the same fashion.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a means to retro-fit a currently fielded weapon to accept the necessary components: conductive loops, magnetic field, and electronics suite to condition and distribute power either directly to electronics or to a battery charging unit. In a preferred embodiment, powerful permanent magnets are attached on the translating components and the conductive wiring circuit is affixed to the weapon receiver in close proximity to the magnets.","The opposite arrangement, where the magnetic field is stationary is also anticipated by the present invention, although a means of sliding contact\/brush contact with the translating wiring would be added for a proper operation of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","405"]},"A rectifier circuit (or power conditioner)  rectifies and filters (or transforms) the raw electric current (or voltage) to a standard (or useable) current (or voltage).

This power source would, for example, be linked to a pre-existing MIL-STD-1913 rail mounting system which is modified to include a standard electrical interface. Though a paradigm shift in battlefield electronics would be necessary, if lasers, optics, range finders etc., were to entertain the same interface, connection would be accomplished through the act of mounting the device to the rail.","A standardized electrical interface  connects the centralized power storage  to a standardized rail mounting system .

According to the present invention, the gap distance (or clearance) between the magnets and the coils needs to be precisely controlled. Additionally, the space on translating components would be reserved for the secure mounting of magnets. The electronics suit would be integral to the system  as well.","Further applications of the present invention are also possible. As the waveform of each complete firing cycle is known, a small microprocessor  would be able to determine the number of rounds  fired in a given period of time. Located at the rectifier-filter circuit , the number of maxima and minima voltage recordings could be converted into a simple rounds counter that could facilitate in weapon accountability and preventative maintenance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 and 6","b":["500","405","410","510","520","530","540","550"]},"The linear induction generator coil matrix  is mounted externally to a weapon receiver  of the weapon . While in this exemplary embodiment seven coils , , , , , ,  are illustrated, it should be understood that a different number of coils may be used, depending on the weapon . The coils , , , , ,  may be connected in series, in parallel, or in a combination thereof. The matrix of magnets  comprises several magnets, such as those illustrated and described in relation to , , .","The electrical potential generated by the linear induction generator coil matrix  will be the same whether the magnetic field generated by the matrix of magnets  is fixed, or whether the matrix of coils  is fixed, so long as a relative motion exists between the matrix of magnets  and the matrix of coils .","To achieve this configuration on a small system, such as the M249 SAW or M4 carbine, relatively small magnets  are mounted to a moving element (e.g., weapon receiver ) of the weapon , without degrading or impeding the operation of the weapon . The current output will be affected by the lower field strength of the smaller magnets, as a result of the smaller dimensions and larger air gap\/clearances. However, the current output can be augmented the number of magnets of the matrix of magnets , so as to create continuous superposition along as much of the cycle as possible.","With further reference to , each coil (e.g., ) produces a voltage that is proportional to the number of loops  contained therein. The per-coil output is proportional to the number of loops . In one embodiment, the coils are connected in parallel to output a higher current\/amperage at lower voltage. In another embodiment, the coils are connected in series so that the voltage is greatly increased at the cost of the current. High voltage is desirable because it can be transmitted with less loss, and it can further run through the power conditioning circuitry  with less loss. The ultimate application of this power, however, will determine which configuration is more suitable. For example, direct powering of an electronic device would favor higher voltage versus higher current to charge a battery.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 8","b":["9","521","521","527","521"]},"As illustrated in , and according to one embodiment of the present invention, adjacent bundles, e.g., , , are not wired together. Instead, every other coil e.g., ,  is wired together. In order to maximize the loops in the limited amount of space, the coils are placed immediately next to one another. Similarly, each magnet pole pair  (a negative field, adjacent to a positively vectored field) is positioned without clearance. By disconnecting adjacent coils, there is no negation that would occur when one coil attempts to produce a clockwise current and the next produces a counterclockwise current, as would occur when both coils are over the same pole-pair. The two adjacent coils e.g., , , are connected at an electronics suite  where the circuit winding direction is reversed and superposition can apply. This feature allows for the greatest loop density without incurring significant losses.","Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in . Adjacent coils ,  are wired together. However, in order to minimize the current negating affect described above, clearance must be developed between each coil and correspondingly, each magnet. This is achieved by physically separating the coils at the coils structure, and separating the magnets with a non-ferrous spacer. Mounting the magnets between non-ferrous spacers increases the physical distance between the magnets, and thus opposite field lines that may cross the loops. Additionally, this may help contain the field by breaking apart the continuity of the circuits the magnets try to form internally. This configuration eliminates the need to rejoin the two induced currents and is easier to manufacture.","Another feature that optimizes power yield is the spindle structure  (, A, B) which accepts the wire bundles (e.g., ) of the coils (e.g., ) and which maintains their geometry. The spindle structure  includes a base  and a plurality of spindles (e.g., , , , , , , ) are formed. The spindles (-) are separated by a distance, D, which is preferably equal to the length of the magnet in the direction of travel.","While acting as a structural member, the spindle structure  is also important in reducing losses due to leaked magnetic field. The spindle structure  may be constructed either of an iron laminate or a ferrite ceramic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["540","1000","1000"]},"In the alternative embodiment where ferrite ceramic is used to form the spindle structure , termites can have extremely high permeability and have the added benefit of being fairly resistive and light weight, being less dense than iron. They are metal-loaded ceramics with random grain structure which greatly increases the core's efficiency. However, they are relatively brittle, difficult to machine, and costly.","An additional important feature is that the spindle structure  includes a thin layer of an adhesive backed, wear resistant, low friction film, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (TEFLON), as shown in . This layer serves to physically maintain a gap between the matrix of the translating magnets  on a operating group  () of the weapon receiver  and the wire loops.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["500","410","725","550","405","700","725","570","550"]},"The other main component of the linear induction generator coil matrix  is the translating magnetic field, which is comprised of the matrix of high power magnets  and the weapon operating group . As shown in  and , the magnets, e.g., , , are arranged with opposite poles positioned adjacent to one another and normal to the wire loops. In this embodiment, the magnets ,  are attached to the weapon  by milling a slot  () at a practical location on the operating group .","A commercially available adhesive is used to mount the magnets , . This compound is also used on the rotor of a conventional frameless motor or generator. The properties of the adhesive are such that it is highly resistant to shock and vibration (as would be the case in a rotary motor). Alternatively, a new operating rod could be fabricated that is either permanently magnetized or built to accept the magnets , .","An analysis of the linear induction generator coil matrix  can be performed to estimate the power output. All of the parameters that affect yield can be quantified and modeled. These include the geometry of the pole-pairs and loop bundles, magnetic field strength, average gap between loops and magnets, and the time-velocity or velocity-displacement performance of the moving parts.","A representative velocity-displacement curve of the weapon operating group  is shown in . Tracing the curve from point 0 and moving clockwise, a typical gas-operated weapon cycle is revealed. The sharp increase in velocity at the beginning occurs when expanding propellant gas accelerates the piston to its opening velocity. The weapon operating group  and the attached matrix of magnets  then move on their own momentum in free harmonic vibration against a drive spring. At the end of recoil, these parts are brought to a halt and the drive spring returns everything home to fire the next round.","Both portions, recoil and counter-recoil, can be utilized in energy generation. By applying the governing physics of Faraday Induction, a theoretical time curve that plots voltage output can be determined. A representative waveform is shown in , which describes an alternative output current, consistent with polarity switching in the linear induction generator coil matrix . In order to validate this output model, an objective, operable prototype was designed, constructed, and tested.  also overlays a voltage signal that was recorded while live firing a single shot using the present invention. Also shown in , is the voltage signal recorded when firing a 10-round burst from the weapon system .","Another novel application of the present invention is the electromagnetic dampening of the motion. In a linear induction generator application, energy still must be conserved. The electric flow in the wiring is only possible because some of the weapons kinetic energy has been bled out of the system and converted by way of an electromagnetic field. Similarly to a conventional rotary generator or motor, the induced electro-magnetic force tends to act to impede the direction of motion. If the coiling in a conventional generator is connected by an open circuit, the dynamo will spin freely. However, when connected by a load (internal or external), an amount of force must be applied. Similarly, in a linear generator, the greater the voltage produced, the greater the force that will act to halt motion. Because voltage is proportional to the velocity of the translating components, this force is analogous to a viscous damper or buffer.","Many automatic weapons already employ some type of hydraulic or pneumatic damper. These components tend to absorb and dissipate the extra kinetic energy the moving mass has at the end of a cycle (after performing work on the drive spring). The end result is a more controlled rate of fire and less of an impact load on the shooter. When the present linear inductor is installed on a weapon system, it will act against the weapon's operation at a dampening coefficient proportional to its cycle speed, strength of the magnetic field, and number of coils.","When retrofitted to an existing system, the generator is designed not to significantly impede the normal function. This is not typically a problem, as space to incorporate components that would produce a truly disruptive EMF is not available. On the purpose-built system, however, this effect could be utilized to affect the actual dynamics of the weapon cycle. The weapon could be \u201ctuned\u201d for more consistent firing rate and smoother operation by treating the EMF as another drive component, such as the spring stiffness or gas volume that is incorporated into the design. The feature would be reversible as well; disconnecting the circuit would disable the EMF buffering if desired. The technology would provide future weapons engineers an additional design tool to enhance the state of the art.","When the present linear induction generator coil matrix  is integrated into a small arms weapon system, the components are made compact and lightweight in order to be accommodated into man-portable firearms. The integration of the linear induction generator coil matrix  into larger systems, however, is a relatively straight-forward scale up. Self powered medium and large caliber guns impart significant energy to projectiles and by necessity, must incorporate some means of recoil mitigation. Most often, this is achieved by allowing the gun tube to slide a way along a track\/buffer system which absorbs recoil energy and then resets to the in-battery position. This means of automatic firing is analogous to the small caliber weapons and a very similar approach can be taken. For example, permanent magnets may be fixed to the moving barrel within the presence of conductive loops, and mounted to the chassis.","In large and medium caliber weapon applications, the rate of fire is slower, and fewer individual shots are delivered in an engagement. However, the translational velocities can be greater in magnitude and the total displacement larger. These attributes, coupled with the space to incorporate significantly larger permanent magnets and coil volumes will greatly enhance power yield and the potential for dynamic dampening by the electro-motive force. This increase in performance per shot may compensate for the lower overall rate of fire.","It should be understood that other modifications may be made to the present design without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.","Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the invention, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both chemical and functional equivalents thereof.
