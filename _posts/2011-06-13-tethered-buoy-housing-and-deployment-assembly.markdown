One such system is the Recoverable Tethered Optical Fiber (RTOF) buoy, which is deployed to the surface and recovered by an attached tether. Current RTOF buoy system is designed to fit within a relatively large working volume. As such there is a need for a buoy system which can operate in a relatively smaller space.","It is therefore a primary object and general purpose of the present invention to provide a tethered buoy housing and deployment assembly which can be used in smaller sized environments.","With the above object in view, a feature of the present invention is the provision of a tethered buoy housing and deployment assembly comprising a housing for disposition in a sail portion of a submarine or similar structure of an undersea vessel, a tether for interconnecting a portion of the housing and a portion of a buoy, a tether reel mounted in the housing and rotatable to unwind the tether, means for maintaining a selected tension on the tether as the tether is unwound, a platform disposed in the housing and adapted to rise in the housing as the tether is extended, a buoy cradle for releasably retaining the buoy, and a linkage assembly mounted on the platform and adapted to move the buoy between a substantially vertical disposition for retention of the buoy and a tilted disposition for generally aligning the buoy with external water flow for release of the buoy thereinto.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","In the present invention, a caged housing structure  is constructed of preferably 1.5 inch\u00d71.5 inch bars  enclosed by plates  (). Four parallel vertical bars , each approximately 181.5 inches in length, are arranged so as to frame a rectangle  and make up corners , , ,  of the housing structure . An extra 181.5 inch long bar  is added to the two longer sides of the rectangle for support. Perpendicular to the vertical bars are several smaller horizontal bars  (either 14.25 inches or 22.5 inches in length) that support the vertical bars . The bars ,  are welded together to form a cage , with the plates  (approximately 0.25 inches thick, and approximately either 26 inches\u00d760.5 inches or 16.75 inches\u00d760.5 inches) welded to the outside of the cage for added stability against shock. The assembled cage  is mounted on a foundation plate  inside sail  ().","As shown in , at the bottom of the cage , there is mounted a tether reel  and DC brushless pancake motor . The pancake motor  is mounted on top of the reel  and rotates with the reel. A tether reel containment structure  protects the reel  and pins the reel through the center thereof, allowing the reel to spin but not move from its location. The containment structure  also provides support for a level wind  and the DC motor  (See ). The level wind  protrudes from one side of the containment structure , and the DC motor  is mounted on top of a protrusion  ( and ) and is locked down to avoid movement during operation.","When a tether  leaves the reel  and goes through the level wind , a first stop on the way to a buoy  is a low tension sensor  (See ). An alignment pulley , part of an array of tether path elements, at the bottom of an array of the tension sensors directs the tether  into a first sensor pulley . The alignment pulley  is adapted to swivel back and forth on a pin  to accommodate how the tether  is coming off of the level wind .","The sensor pulleys , , ,  are arranged such that the top and bottom pulleys ,  are locked in place, while the two middle pulleys ,  can translate laterally, left to right (side-to-side) within apertures . The two middle pulleys ,  sense how far their centers of rotation are away from each other and an operationally-connected inboard computer (not shown) translates the distance into tether tension. When the tension is too low or too high, an operator is signaled there is a problem.","The tether  comes in from the alignment pulley  and extends clockwise around the bottom sensor pulley , counterclockwise around the next pulley up , clockwise around the next pulley , and counterclockwise around the top sensor pulley .","When the tether  leaves the top pulley , the tether moves through a tether cutter  before continuing on. The tether cutter  is used in situations where the buoy  cannot be saved. The tether cutter  is activated by a small solenoid with a stored-energy device.","The path from the reel  to the buoy  is provided by the tether path elements , as shown in . When the tether  leaves the level wind ; the first of the tether path elements encountered is the alignment pulley , and thereafter the sensor pulleys , , , . As the tether  leaves the tether cutter  on the other end of the low tension sensor ; the tether passes through one of two small rollers on its way to a lift platform  to ensure that the tether  travels the correct path without changing direction.","Roller  can be added proximate to the sensor pulley  while another roller (not shown) can be mounted proximate to platform pulleys , . Following the platform pulleys, the tether  passes through an orifice  in a lift platform , where the tether  passes through a further roller  for alignment () before connecting to the buoy  through a buoy cradle .","The lift platform  is a base for a linkage deployment and retrieval mechanism . The platform  may be made from 1.0 inch thick steel. Holes  are disposed at each end of the platform  for lift platform support rods . The rods  are provided with rubber support rod translation brakes  located on the rods, to avoid over-and-under extension of a hydraulic lift cylinder .","The lift platform  is raised to a proper height by a five-stage double-acting hydraulic cylinder  and guided along the correct path by the lift platform support rods . Prior to rotation, an inner lifting link  of varying relative length is in a lowered position, so that a linkage brake  is resting on a base link .","To achieve rotation, the lifting link  is raised. This is effected by the electrical lift cylinder  and a DC motor . The cylinder  may be driven by a one-horsepower, three-phase AC induction brake motor .","The motor  is supported by the lift platform . This arrangement prevents a large moment from being applied to the motor . The lift cylinder  is vertically actuated by the motor  and pushes up on the link  of varying relative length, causing the link with the buoy cradle  attached thereto, to rotate into position.","The tethered buoy housing and deployment system satisfies the requirements for an outboard antenna system. The maximum hydraulic power supplied by the platform is seventy-six gal\/min at 3000 psi, which is more than is required to power the five-stage double-acting hydraulic cylinder . The available electricity is also sufficient to run the DC motors in the system.","The above described system is sufficiently robust to handle hydrodynamic loading. The electric lift cylinder  and DC motor  are able to actuate deployment and retrieval in the same scenario.","At a platform depth and speed determined to be optimal by the submarine for use of the RTOF, deployment is initiated. At this point, closure doors on the sail  are opened and the five-stage double-acting hydraulic cylinder  is actuated through inboard controls (See ). The hydraulic cylinder  pushes the lift platform  to a pre-specified height. At this point, the electric lift cylinder  and DC motor  take over.","Using inboard controls, the lift cylinder  is raised to the point at which the deployment mechanism  lines up the buoy  with the external water flow. The tether reel  then releases back tension on the tether , which allows the flow caused by the moving submarine to carry the buoy  out of the buoy cradle . The inherent lift buoyancy of the buoy  then lifts the buoy to the surface.","When the RTOF is released, it remains stationary on the surface while the reel releases the tether  in accordance with the forward velocity of the carrying vessel. When the tether  runs out, the buoy slips under the surface quickly, leaving a minimal wake.","The buoy  remains stationary on the surface of the ocean while the carrying vessel moves forward; thereby, causing the tether  to unfurl. Once the end of the tether  is reached, the tether reel  and DC brushless pancake motor  quickly pull the buoy  under the surface and reels the buoy back in. When the buoy  is pulled back in to the buoy cradle ; the electric lift cylinder  is lowered, rotating the buoy back to the vertical stowage position. The five-stage double-acting hydraulic cylinder  is then lowered and closure doors  are shut, completing the full stowage operation of the system.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and assignment of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, and wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 3 and 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
