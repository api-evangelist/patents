{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This is a continuation of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/700,028 filed on Nov. 3, 2003, titled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST SERVICE,\u201d and scheduled to issue on Mar. 29, 2011 as U.S. Pat. No. 7,917,447, the contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Benefits under 35 U.S.C \u00a7120 are hereby claimed.","The disclosed methods and systems relate to communications systems and, more particularly, to network based communications among a group of users sharing at least one common interest.","The Internet has become ubiquitous in contemporary society. Along with proliferation of the Internet itself has come a seemingly endless supply of new applications and uses. One such use of the Internet is as an online communication forum among a group of users. These groups may take many forms, such as, for example, chat rooms, web based discussion forums, and email based forums. A user wishing to participate in a forum may be faced with certain obstacles, such as, for example, finding a group and protecting his true identity when participating in a group. While a group may comprise all users of the Internet, in most instances a user will want to communicate with a subset of Internet users, such as those having an interest in common with the user. For example, a user may be interested in gardening, horseback riding, cross-country skiing and cooking. This user may wish to find others on the Internet sharing one or more of these interests. A group of persons sharing at least one interest with the user is hereinafter referred to as a target group. The user may do an Internet based search using a search engine such as Google\u2122, Dogpile\u2122, MSN\u2122, or the like in order to locate a target group. The problem with these generic searches is that the search criteria normally produce coarse results, in that they are not easily sorted using additional criteria to better focus the output of the search.","At times coarse results, such as finding anyone within a target group sharing an interest for a topic or subject, may satisfy the user. However, at other times the user may only wish to communicate or associate with persons sharing an interest and further satisfying additional search criteria. By way of example, a user may wish to communicate only with people having rose gardening as a hobby that also live in the same state as the user, since not all rose varieties thrive in all climates. In this example, geography was the additional criteria added to an otherwise general, or generic, search for rose gardening groups. Examples of other criteria which the user may want satisfied are, but are not limited to, gender, educational background, age, religious affiliation, affiliations with other organizations, etc. Performing these more complex searches using generally available Internet search engines may not meet the needs of Internet users.","Another potential shortcoming associated with online groups is that a user participating in the group may wish to have his true identity withheld from other participants in the group. True identity, as used herein, refers to information that can be readily used by a recipient to positively identify a sender of a message. For example, a person's full name would reveal his true identity. Additionally, a person's residential or business address, phone number, social security number, driver's license number, etc. may also directly or indirectly reveal his true identity. To prevent other participants on the network from knowing the user's true identity, the user may wish to have an alias associated with him such that the alias allows participants to converse with the user as if they knew his true identity without actually availing the user's true identity to those participants. As used herein, alias refers to any method, device, or technique associated with a user that is employed to mask that user's true identity while still allowing the user to identify himself in some unique manner to other users of the Internet or network. By way of example, if a user having a true identity of John Smith wishes to have an alias associated with his true identity, he may use another name to identify himself when communicating with others on the Internet. In this example, John Smith may use one or more names along the lines of MA_biker, handyman, cross_country, D1234, etc. as aliases when communicating over the Internet.","In order to facilitate group communication, employing an alias should be easy to do for an average Internet user. In addition, the alias should be secure, in that other users of the Internet cannot readily determine the true identity of the person associated with the alias. Current Internet technology places most of the burden associated with aliases on the user wishing to obtain one. This requires that the user be familiar with methods for generating secure aliases. Since many users may be unfamiliar with how to set up aliases, communication within groups is hindered. There exists a need for facilitating the formation of groups among persons sharing an interest. In addition, there is a need for a system and method that assists users with obtaining aliases without requiring them to have special knowledge about establishing them.","Furthermore, the aliases should be capable of random generation by a network device or administrator, or they should be selectable by a user to reflect his characteristics, hobbies, etc. in a manner that does not reveal his true identity.","The objects set forth above as well as further and other objects and advantages of the present invention are achieved by embodiments of the invention described hereinbelow.","In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a method is provided for connecting a plurality of customers sharing a common interest. The customers are connected using a domain which is accessible through a communications network. Furthermore, each of the plurality of customers has a billing address and account associated with a service provider which is further associated with the domain. The method further comprises notifying the plurality of customers about the domain by including information in a billing statement. A capability is provided to each of the plurality of customers allowing them to have access to the domain. At least a subset of the plurality is allowed to communicate with each other using the domain while keeping a true identity of each of the subset from being made available to others of the plurality of customers.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a system is provided for allowing a plurality of customers sharing a common interest to communicate over a network. The system further comprises a service provider having an account with each one of the plurality of customers. A domain associated with the service provider allows each of the plurality of customers to communicate with each other. A billing means associated with the service provider invoices each account, and a notification means associated with the billing means informs each of the customers about the domain. A server associated with the domain allows each of the plurality of customers to access the domain upon authentication. The system can further comprise an, authentication means for allowing at least one of the plurality of customers to establish its identity; an associating means for mapping the identity to an alias associated with the at least one customer and making the alias available to the other of the plurality of customers having access to the domain while concealing the true identity of the at least one customer; storage means for archiving domain information about the at least one of the plurality of customers and allowing the other of the plurality of customers access to the domain; and an interaction means for allowing the other of the plurality of customers having access to the domain to communicate with each other and with the at least one of the plurality of customers using their respective aliases.","In still another aspect of the invention, a computer-readable medium containing a plurality of instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to perform a method for connecting a plurality of customers associated with a service provider and further sharing a common interest through a communication network. The method further comprises providing a capability allowing the plurality of customers to have access to a domain associated with the service provider. Data from at least one of the plurality of customers is accepted. A true identity of the at least one of the plurality of customers based upon at least a portion of the data is verified. The true identity is mapped to an alias associated with the at least one of the plurality of customers. The domain is made available to the at least one of the plurality of customers, thus allowing the plurality of customers with access to the domain to have access only to the alias while keeping the true identity in confidence.","In yet a further aspect of the invention, a human-readable data display for displaying information about a domain having an address associated therewith is provided. Specifically, the information is provided to a customer associated with a service provider. The customer is notified about the domain address by the service provider through a billing statement. The domain is made available to the customer to facilitate communications with persons having a common interest with the customer. The data display further comprises a logon field for receiving input data from the customer where the input data is used to establish an identity of the customer; an alias field for displaying an alias associated with the customer and further being made available to persons having access to the domain and sharing the common interest with the customer; and a selection field for allowing the customer to choose a topic of interest where the topic of interest is linked to at least a subset of the persons sharing the common interest with the customer.","Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent hereinafter in view of the accompanying drawings and detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the scope of which will be pointed out in the appended claims.","To provide an overall understanding of the present invention, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems and methods described herein can be adapted and modified to provide for other suitable applications.
