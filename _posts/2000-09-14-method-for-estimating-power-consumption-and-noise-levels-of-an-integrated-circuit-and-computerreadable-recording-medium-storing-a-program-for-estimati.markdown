Field of the Invention","The present invention is related to a method for estimating power consumption and noise levels of an integrated circuit and, more particularly, a method of estimating power consumption and noise levels of an integrated circuit taking into consideration the signal waveform, the signal probability and the signal correlation on the respective signal lines within an integrated circuit.","2. Description of the Related Art","It becomes possible to manufacture very large scale integrated circuits with the advent of micromachining techniques for LSI circuits. However, the miniaturization of the circuits and the increase in the scale of integration results in the increase in noise level and the increase in power consumption. If the noise level increases, it takes much time to solve the noise problem, rendering the LSI relatively expensive. Also, if the power consumption is increased, the battery provided for an electric appliance is quickly used up for a shorter time while it becomes necessary to provide an expensive heat dissipation package. Accordingly, at the initial stages of a designing procedure, it becomes necessary to estimate the noise level and the electric power as consumed.","The circuit operation inside of the LSI chip has to be investigated for the purpose of estimating the noise level and the electric power as consumed. This is because noise and power consumption ensues from the operation of circuits, i.e., motion of electric charge. One of conventional techniques most usually employed and available for investigating the operation of circuits is the simulation of the operation by the use of test vectors, i.e., tracing the circuit operation in time series by means of a computer.","For example, most of commercial tools for evaluating the operation of circuits such as VerilogXL, PowerMill and HSPICE have been implemented with this technique. The advantages of the simulation of the operation include high precisions. On the other hand, however, it has a disadvantage of a longer processing time to complete the simulation of the operation. The increase in the scale of integration will require a furthermore longer processing time and therefore the technique making use of the simulation of the operation can not be used for future circuits.","Several techniques implemented on the basis of probability simulation are available as alternatives to the simulation of the operation. Generally speaking, the processing time of a technique implemented on the basis of probability simulation is substantially shorter than that of a technique implemented on the basis of the simulation of the operation. For this reason, the technique implemented on the basis of probability simulation is recognized as a promising technique in the future applicable for very large scale integrated circuits. However, the probability simulation is inferior to the simulation of the operation with respect to the accuracy of the evaluation. Because of this, it is the important point for the technique implemented on the basis of probability simulation to improve the accuracy without increasing the processing time. In the followings, two types of the technique implemented on the basis of probability simulation will be explained, i.e.,\n\n","CREST has been published in the paper, F. N. Najm, et.al \u201cProbabilistic Simulation for Reliability Analysis of COMS VLSI Circuits\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Computer Aided Design, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. 439\u2013450,1990.","The characteristics of CREST is the use of probability waveforms which have been statistically synthesized with a plurality of test vectors.  is a schematic diagram showing an exemplary probability waveform. There are illustrated four test vectors at the left side of a block arrow and a probability waveform as synthesized from these test vectors at the left side of the block arrow. Numerals located above the probability waveform includes numerals in squares indicative of the probabilities that the logic value changes from 0 to 1 at the respective time points, and other numerals indicative of the probabilities that the logic values 1 occur at the respective time points. The processing time of CREST is one thousandth of that of the simulation of the operation (HSPICE). However, since it is difficult to take into consideration the spatial correlation signal, the accuracy of CREST is not improved up to the accuracy of the simulation of the operation.","On the other hand, BAM is a technique taking into consideration the spatial signal correlation as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,966. A typical example of the spatial signal correlation is originating from branch and convergence of a signal. In , there are two paths of a signal to reach the node Z from the node A as A\u2192D\u2192Z and A\u2192E\u2192Z. In such a case, a signal at the node D and a signal at the node E are depending upon the same signal at the node A and therefore they are not indpendent to each other. The correlation between the signal at the node D and the signal at the node E is reflected to the operation of the signal at the node Z and the accuracy of estimation of the noise level and the power consumption. In accordance with BAM, the accuracy is improved by taking into consideration the first order influence of the signal correlation. However, since the signal waveform is not considered in the case of BAM, it is not appropriate to make use of BAM for the purpose of analyzing the noise and the power consumption originating from the signal waveform such as a glitch and so forth (malfunction due to the differential arrival times of relevant signals).","The respective features are summarized in the following Table 1",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0015"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"PROCESSING","ACCURACY OF","SIGNAL","SIGNAL"]},{"entry":["SIMULATION TYPE","TIME","ESTIMATION","WAVEFORM","CORRELATION"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["OPERATION","LONG","HIGH","CONSIDERED","CONSIDERED"]},{"entry":"PROBABILITY"},{"entry":["CREST","SHORT","REL.

One of the reasons thereof is the increase in the ratio of the capacitance between adjacent lines to the entire capacitance driven by signals within the circuit under consideration. By virtue of the capacitance between adjacent lines, the operation of a signal is affected by the operation of another signal. This means that the correlation between different signals must be taken into consideration. The influence of the capacitance between adjacent lines depends upon the interval between the switching times of the signals which are affected each other. This means that signal waveforms must be taken into consideration.","The present invention is related to a method for estimating power consumption and noise levels of an integrated circuit which is composed of logic gates connected in the form of a plurality of stages. (1) At the outset, output signal waveforms and occurrence probabilities thereof at the first stage of the logic gates are calculated by the use of signal waveforms and occurrence probabilities thereof at input terminals (hereafter called the primary input terminals) of the integrated circuit; (2) next, output signal waveforms and occurrence probabilities thereof at the second stage of the logic gates are calculated by the use of the output signal waveform and the occurrence probability thereof at the primary input terminals and the output signal waveform and the occurrence probability thereof at the first stage of the logic gates; and","(3) then, output signal waveforms and occurrence probabilities thereof at the n-th stage (n is a natural number) of the logic gates are calculated by the use of the output signal waveform and the occurrence probability thereof at the primary input terminals and the output signal waveform and the occurrence probability thereof at the (n-1)th stage of the logic gates. Thereby, types of the respective elementary waveforms, occurrence probabilities and signal correlations are calculated relating to signals located on each wiring of each stage inside of the integrated circuit and occurring within a predetermined time period.","The elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of all the signals of the circuit can therefore be calculated on the basis of the elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of the primary inputs taking into consideration the signal correlation. Because of this, it is possible to quickly and accurately estimate the power consumption and to lessen the circuit development time and quickly select appropriate packages for LSI circuits.","Hereinbelow, several preferred embodiments in accordance with the present invention will be explained in conjunction with the accompanied drawings.","First of all, the waveform probability which is a basic conceptual feature of the present invention will be explained in conjunction with .","A signal waveform within a synchronized circuit can be sectioned by a certain time interval (called the basic cycle hereinbelow). In usual cases, the basic cycle is identical to the cycle of the clock signal. The pattern of a waveform within the basic cycle is called a elementary waveform. A signal waveform can be recognized as a series of elementary waveforms sectioned by the basic cycle. The waveform probability of a certain elementary waveform is the probability that the certain elementary waveform appears in a certain cycle P(W) designates the waveform probability of the elementary waveform W as follows\n\n()=(number of appearance of the elementary waveform )\/(total number of appearance of all the elementary waveforms)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","For example, in , the elementary waveform that a signal rises from 0 to 1 appears 1st, 3rd, 7th, 9th and 13th basic cycles so that the number of appearance of the elementary waveform is 5 Also, the total number of appearance of all the elementary waveforms is 13. The waveform probability of the elementary waveform rising from 0 to 1 is therefore 5\/13.","Next, the power estimation system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will be explained in conjunction with . The power estimation system in accordance with this embodiment is different from the power estimation system in accordance with a conventional technique in that it is provided with a function to calculate the waveform probability taking into consideration both the signal waveform and the signal correlation.","The power estimation system in accordance with the present invention is designed to accept a technology description , a circuit description  and an input signal waveform probability description , and composed of a delay time calculating section , a waveform probability calculating section  and a power calculating section , and serves to output a power estimation result . These elements will be explained in details.","The technology description  contains information indispensable for the power estimation by means of the waveform probability calculating section . More specifically speaking, for example, there is provided following information,\n\n","The circuit description  contains the information about connection among cells (functional units composed of MOS transistors) and nets (metallic lines for connecting cells to each other).","The input signal waveform probability description  contains the information about types of elementary waveforms at primary input terminals which are terminals for starting calculation by means of the waveform probability calculating section , and the information about the waveform probabilities of the elementary waveforms at the primary input terminals. The primary inputs are given as the input signals to the entirety of the circuit and the output signals from the flip-flops inside of the circuit. The elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of the output signals from the flip-flops inside of the circuit can be obtained by means of the simulation of the operation, in which delay times are not taken into consideration, at the initial stages of a designing procedure (RT level and so forth).","The delay time calculating section  serves to calculate, on the basis of the circuit description  and the technology description , the delay time from the input terminal to the output terminal of a cell and the delay time of a signal on a net from the output terminal of one cell to the input terminal of another cell.","The waveform probability calculating section  serves to propagate the elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of the primary inputs through the inside of the circuit in order to calculate the elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of the signals on the respective nets inside of the circuit. The algorithm for use in the waveform probability calculating section will be described below.","The power calculating section  serves to calculate the power consumption with reference to the elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of the signals on the respective nets inside of the circuit. The power consumption of a CMOS circuit can be obtained by calculating the frequency of the switching operation per unit time of said signal.","The frequency of the switching operation per unit time of said signal can be calculated on the basis of the equation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["The","frequency","of","the","switching","operation","per","unit","time"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"W"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(","\u2062",")"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["The","frequency","of","the","switching","operation"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["within","the","elementary","waveform","W"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}}]}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"W"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["The","basic","cycle"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"\/"}],"mo":"\u00d7"}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"For example, in the case of the waveform as illustrated in , the frequency of the switching operation per unit time can be calculated as follows.","The frequency of the switching operation and the waveform probability of the first elementary waveform from the left are 0 and 1\/13 respectively.","The frequency of the switching operation and the waveform probability of the second elementary waveform from the left are 1 and 5\/13 respectively.","The frequency of the switching operation and the waveform probability of the third elementary waveform from the left are 1 and 4\/13 respectively.","The frequency of the switching operation and the waveform probability of the fourth elementary waveform from the left are 0 and 2\/13 respectively.","The frequency of the switching operation and the waveform probability of the fifth elementary waveform from the left are 2 and 1\/13 respectively.

It is easy to extend the technique to that applicable to the case that there is a correlation among the primary inputs. Namely, there are provided groups of the primary inputs in order that the primary inputs having correlations to each other belong to the same group. w as described above can be redefined as the combination of the elementary waveforms of the respective groups.","The most important gist of the present invention resides in that the signal correlation is taken into consideration by the use of the equation (4) and the equation (5-1).","The conditional probabilities P(W|w) of the respective signals have to be calculated for making use of the equation (4) and the equation (5-1). However, it is not necessary to start from the primary inputs. The conditional probabilities P(W|w) can be calculated from the input signal waveform probability of the previous cells by making use of the equation (5-1).","The differences between the present embodiment of the present invention and the prior art techniques will be explained. The present embodiment is related to a kind of the probability simulator and therefore apparently distinguished from the simulation of the operation in accordance with the prior art technique.","Also, the present embodiment is different from the prior art technique CREST in that the signal correlation is taken into consideration by the use of the equation (4) and the equation (5-1).","Furthermore, the present embodiment is different from the prior art technique BAM in that the signal waveforms is taken into consideration.","In accordance with the present embodiment, the elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of all the signals of the circuit can be calculated on the basis of the elementary waveforms and the waveform probabilities of the primary inputs taking into consideration the signal correlation. Also, it is possible to take into consideration the deformation of waveforms and therefore the power consumption due to a glitch.","Because of this, it is possible to quickly and accurately estimate the power consumption and to lessen the circuit development time and quickly select appropriate packages for LSI circuits.","In accordance with the present embodiment, it is possible to distinguish the differences which can not be distinguished by means of CREST. For example, it is impossible to distinguish the following two cases when a probability waveform having transition probabilities at time  and time  is given in accordance with CREST.","(1) Statistical average of a waveform having transitions at time  and time ","(1) Statistical average of a waveform having a transition at time  and a waveform having a transition at time ","On the other hand, in accordance with the present embodiment, a waveform is handled as a statistical event so that it is possible to distinguish (1) and (2) from each other.","If the subsequent gate is an inverter which has a differential delay time between the rising time and the falling time, the transitions may possibly disappear in the case of (1). Namely, if the falling edge precedes the rising edge, the waveform can no longer be changed to have a constant value. Contrary to this, the transitions shall not disappear in the case of (2). The accuracy of estimation of the power consumption and the noise level is affected by whether or not the transitions are maintained. Accordingly, in accordance with the present embodiment capable distinguishing (1) and (2) from each other, the accuracy of estimation is improved as compared with CREST, which is not capable distinguishing (1) and (2) from each other.","Examples of waveforms of the cases (1) and (2) and the statistical average thereof will be more specifically explained with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},"The statistical average of the waveform as illustrated in  and the waveform as illustrated in  is illustrated in .","On the other hand,  shows an example of a waveform having a transition from 0 to 1 at time  while and  shows an example of a waveform having a transition from 1 to 0 at time .

In accordance with the present embodiment, the waveform probability (as different from the probability waveform of CREST) is introduced for use in calculating probabilities taking into consideration the signal correlations with similar equations as used in the conventional technique BAM.
