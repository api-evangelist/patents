Technical Field","The present disclosure relates generally to wireless networks and, more specifically, to a client device configured to connect with a home network.","2. Description of the Related Art","Home networks, in which multiple computing and\/or peripheral devices are communicatively linked together in a consumer's home, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. A home environment may include one or more computers, a wireless router, a dsl modem, and one or more other devices capable of connecting to the home network. Conventionally, each device in the home network must be individually configured to connect to the network and, once configured, may then communicate with each of the other devices attached to the home network.","In practice, however, procedures for establishing and provisioning services on a home network are typically too involved for the majority of home network users to implement reliably. For example, a network user may need to manually reconfigure the home network router, determine a network IP address and\/or hostname for each device, establish network credentials, register the various services for each device, etc. Furthermore, in order for a device to locate another device on the home network, a device must establish communication using a unique IP address of the other device. Such connections are typically defined as peer-to-peer connections. A user may be required to manually keep track of which address is associated with which device or service in order to configure the devices to communicate on the home network. The manual configuration procedures described above make it a challenge for unsophisticated users to reliably setup a home network and provision services on the home network.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for systems and methods that reliably and conveniently enable the user of a home network to automatically configure and provision devices to connect to the home network.","For clarity, identical reference numbers have been used, where applicable, to designate identical elements that are common between figures.

It will be appreciated that the network discovery module , the registration module , the diagnostic module , and the firmware upgrade module  may be implemented in either hardware or software on the client device (N).","The network discovery module  is configured to implement operations that enable the client device (N) to discover and connect to the smart network . For example, the network discovery module  may include a DHCP client for requesting an IP address to be assigned to the client device (N) and a DNS client that enables the client device (N) to resolve domain names for different devices or services into an IP address on the smart network  or the external network . In one embodiment, the network discovery module  may be configured to receive broadcast data packets on an antenna (N) of the client device (N) that indicate one or more SSIDs of various wireless networks within range of the client device (N). The client device (N) may determine which wireless access point to connect to based on one or more selection criteria included in the network discovery module . For example, the client device (N) may be configured to connect to the wireless access point with the strongest signal which may indicate the wireless access point in closest proximity to the client device (N). In another embodiment, the client device (N) may be configured to connect to a wireless network configured with a well-known SSID, such as homenetwork.","In yet another embodiment, the client device (N) may connect to the smart network  via a wired interface such as the wired network interface  of the smart network host device . For example, the client device (N) may be connected to the smart network host device  via an Ethernet cable. In other embodiments, the client device (N) may connect to the smart network  via a wired interface of a smart network extender device  or a wired interface of a smart network connector device .","For example, the smart network host device  may be configured as a wireless access point that hosts multiple virtual access points. A first virtual access point is configured with a well-known SSID that provides basic connectivity for a client device (N) to attempt to connect to the smart network . Each client device (N) may be configured to attempt to connect to any available access points associated with the well-known SSID. A second virtual access point may be configured with an SSID unique to the smart network host device . A client device (N) may not know the SSID associated with the second virtual access point the first time the client device (N) attempts to connect to the smart network host device . Thus, the client device (N) may be configured to connect to the first virtual access point in order to attempt to authenticate the client device (N) with the smart network  using network credentials passed to the smart network host device  via an ID device (N) associated with the client device (N). In one embodiment, the client device (N) and the smart network host device  are configured to perform an authentication procedure based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol where a handshake is performed between the client device (N) and the smart network host device  to authenticate the network credentials without broadcasting the network credentials on the wireless link established via the first virtual access point. Based on the successful authentication of the client device (N) with the smart network host device , the smart network host device  may transmit the SSID associated with the second virtual access point to the client device  via the link established with the first virtual access point. The client device (N) may store the SSID of the second virtual access point in a memory of the client device (N) so that the client device can re-connect directly to the second virtual access point at a subsequent time without having to authenticate itself over the first virtual access point. A third virtual access point may be configured manually by an owner of the smart network host device , creating a unique SSID and credentials for the third virtual access point. The owner may establish a password to access the third virtual access point via well-known wireless security protocols such as WPA or WEP. The client device (N) may store the SSID and the credentials for the third virtual access point in the memory to facilitate re-connection to the third virtual access point on subsequent attempts to connect to the smart network . In one embodiment, the first and second virtual access points are transparent to the owner and are configured to perform background functions for automatic discovery, connection, and provisioning of the smart network with an associated client device (N).","In one embodiment, the network discovery module  may be configured to generate and transmit an XML-SOAP message to the smart network host device  that includes details about the services  and capabilities of the client device (N). The smart network host device  may be configured to provide additional virtual access points associated with additional SSIDs for the smart network . The runtime server  of the smart network host device  may be configured to determine, based on the information received from the client device (N), a level of service the client device (N) requests for proper operation, such as a minimum bandwidth of the wireless link. Then, the runtime server  may determine that the client device (N) should connect to a particular virtual access point provided by the smart network host device  in order to provide the client device (N) with a particular level of service. For example, the smart network host device  may be configured to provide different levels of service on different virtual access points. In this manner, the smart network host device , which may operate on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands specified by the IEEE 802.11n wireless protocol, may force a particular client device (N) to connect via the 2.4 GHz band and not the 5 GHz band, as specified by different SSIDs.","The registration module  is configured to implement operations that enable the client device (N) and any services  exposed to the smart network  by the client device (N) to be registered with a central authority for the smart network , such as the smart network host device . In one embodiment, the registration module  may be configured to generate and transmit XML-SOAP messages to the smart network host device  requesting the smart network host device  to register the client device (N) and services  on the smart network . The registrar server  on the smart network host device  may assign a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to the client device (N) and transmit an XML-SOAP message to the client device (N) that includes the assigned FQDN for the client device (N). Similarly, the registrar server  may also assign FQDNs to each of the services  exposed to the smart network  by the client device (N) and transmit each of the FQDNs assigned to the different services  back to the registration module  as well. Once the client device (N) and services  are registered with the smart network host device , the registration module  may enable the client device (N) or services  to transmit data to or receive data from various devices connected to the smart network . For example, the registration module  may be configured to discover other client devices  or services  that are available to a client device (N) connected to the smart network  in response to a query sent from the registration module  to the smart network host device .","In one embodiment, the registration module  is configured to transmit an XML-SOAP message to the registrar server  that provides the registrar server  with information about the client device (N) such as manufacturer information, firmware information, status information, service information and the like. The registrar server  is configured to parse the XML-SOAP message to retrieve information necessary to register the client device (N) with the smart network . The registration module  may also be configured to retrieve details about the services  that are running on the client device (N) and transmit the details in an XML-SOAP message to the smart network host device . In another embodiment, the registration module  may be configured to update information stored by the registrar server  associated with the client device (N) or services . For example, a client device (N) that is configured to provide a storage service () to other client devices  or services  on the smart network  may exhaust the available storage space on the client device (N). Thus, the client device (N) may be configured to send an XML-SOAP message to the registrar server  that indicates that the service () is no longer available on the smart network .","The diagnostic module  is configured to implement operations that enable diagnostic services to be implemented for the client device (N). For example, software executing on a processor in the client device (N) may be configured to generate and transmit XML-SOAP messages to the smart network host device  that indicate the current status of the client device (N) and\/or one or more services  running on the client device (N). The diagnostic module  may expose information about the configuration, network topology and historical connectivity of client devices  connected to the smart network  to aid in the debugging of network issues by a user of the smart network  or support staff associated with the manufacturer of the client device (N).","In one embodiment, portal  running on a computer  connected to the smart network  may be configured to transmit an XML-SOAP message to the diagnostic module  that queries the client device (N) for status updates. The client device (N) may generate a corresponding XML-SOAP message to transmit to the portal  that includes information on the current status of the client device (N) as well as zero or more services  running on the client device (N). For example, the status may indicate that the client device (N) is in a standby mode or some other power saving mode or the status may indicate that a service  is currently busy and cannot process a request from a different client device . In another embodiment, the diagnostic module  may be configured to transmit XML-SOAP messages to the smart network host device , which acts as a central repository for diagnostic information for all client devices  and services  connected to the smart network . In yet another embodiment, the diagnostic module  may be configured to gather diagnostic reports from other client devices  connected to the smart network , or from the smart network host device , and forward the diagnostic reports to a portal on the external network  hosted by the manufacturer of the client device (N) to aid in troubleshooting network problems experienced by the client device (N).","The firmware upgrade module  is configured to implement operations that enable updates to the firmware of the client device (N). In one embodiment, the firmware upgrade module  may be configured to receive XML-SOAP messages from the smart network host device  that request the client device  to connect to a portal on the external network  and download a firmware update for the client device . The firmware upgrade module  may also be configured to transmit an XML-SOAP message to the smart network host device  that identifies the current version of the firmware installed on the client device (N). The firmware upgrade module  may also be configured to determine whether updates to the firmware are available on the external network , schedule an update of the firmware to be installed on the client device, and ensure that the firmware update does not interrupt a pending operation between the client device (N) and a different client device  connected to the smart network . In another embodiment, the firmware upgrade module  may enable the firmware to be updated automatically by the smart network host device  or a service provided on the external network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3E","FIGS. 1A-1F"],"b":["300","130","102","100","130","2","130"]},"As shown, the method  begins at step , where a client device (N) connects to a wireless access point that provides connectivity to the smart network . In one embodiment, client device (N) includes a network discovery module  configured to attempt to connect to any wireless access point associated with a well-known SSID. If the network discovery module  detects that a wireless access point associated with the well-known SSID is in range, then the network discovery module  attempts to authenticate the client device (N) with a smart network host device  configured to provide the wireless access point associated with the well-known SSID. In another embodiment, the network discovery module  may be configured to determine a plurality of wireless access points associated with the well-known SSID that are within range of the client device (N). If there are no wireless access points associated with the well-known SSID within range of the client device (N), then the client device (N) may attempt to connect to any wireless access point that provides a connection to a wireless network. In such cases, the client device (N) may disable certain functions of the client device (N) that are optimized for use with a smart network host device . If there are more than one wireless access point associated with the same well-known SSID within range of the client device (N), then the client device (N) may attempt to connect to the wireless access point that is both associated with the well-known SSID and has the strongest wireless signal, which may indicate that the selected wireless access point is the closest wireless access point in proximity to the client device.","At step , the client device (N) attempts to authenticate itself with the smart network host device  associated with the wireless network corresponding to the wireless access point that the client device (N) successfully connected to in step . In one embodiment, the network discovery module  performs a handshake operation with the smart network host device  to authenticate the client device (N) with the smart network . The handshake operation may pass EAP messages from the smart network host device  to the client device (N) and from the client device (N) to the smart network host device . The EAP messages enable the client device (N) to verify that the smart network host device  possesses network credentials associated with the client device (N) and enables the smart network host device  to verify that the client device (N) possesses the same network credentials that the smart network host device  associates with the client device (N). The handshake operation allows such verification without ever transmitting the network credentials between the client device (N) and the smart network host device  via the wireless link . In one embodiment, the network credentials may be shared with the smart network host device  by physically placing an ID device (N) associated with the client device (N) in close proximity to the smart network host device . In other embodiments, the network credentials may be shared in any other technically feasible manner, such as via a USB key or by prompting a user to manually enter the network credentials via a user interface associated with the smart network host device .","At step , the client device (N) determines whether the authentication was successful. In one embodiment, if the client device (N) determines that the smart network host device  does not possess the correct network credentials for the client device (N) (i.e., the ID device (N) has not been read by the smart network host device ), then the client device (N) terminates the wireless link established with the smart network host device , and method  returns to step  where the client device (N) attempts to establish a connection with another wireless network. Returning to step , if the client device (N) determines that the authentication was successful, then method  proceeds to step  where the client device (N) transmits data that includes information related to the client device (N) such as capabilities of the client device (N) or information about services  running on the client device (N).","At step , the client device (N) receives a response message from the smart network host device  that indicates a new wireless access point to establish a secure connection between the smart network host device  and the client device (N). At step , the client device (N) establishes a secure connection to the new wireless access point. In one embodiment, the client device (N) re-connects to the new wireless access point and establishes a secure socket connection via any technically feasible protocol such as the secure socket layer (SSL), transport layer security (TLS), or X.509 protocols. Once the secure connection is established, method  proceeds to step  where the client device (N) receives yet another SSID and associated network credentials for a user-level wireless access point. In one embodiment, an owner may establish the SSID and network credentials for the user-level wireless access point prior to step , such as during the setup of the smart network host device , which are then passed to the client device (N) via the secure connection established in step . Consequently, the client device (N) uses the SSID and network credentials established by the owner for normal operation, whereas the lower level virtual access points are established by the smart network host device  to enable easy connection of the client device (N) to the smart network  with little manual configuration required by the owner. For example, the owner may configure the smart network host device  during an initial setup routine, providing an SSID and network credentials that the owner establishes and that may be broadcast by the smart network host device . However, each client device (N) configured for use with the smart network that is introduced to the smart network will establish a secure connection to the smart network host device  via the paired ID device (N), which only needs to be placed in proximity of the smart network host device , and will automatically retrieve the owner's SSID and network credentials from the smart network host device  without requiring the owner of the smart network  to remember and re-enter the SSID and network credentials for each new device added to the smart network . At step , client device (N) establishes a secure connection to the user-level wireless access point.","At step  and as shown in , the client device (N) may transmit information related to the client device (N) to the smart network host device , which determines whether the client device (N) should connect to a different virtual access point established by the smart network host device . At step , the client device (N) may receive a message from the smart network host device  that includes a new SSID and network credentials for a new virtual access point established by the smart network host device  and instructs the client device (N) to re-connect to the new virtual access point. At step , the client device (N) may terminate the connection to the smart network host device  and re-connect to the new virtual access point using the new SSID and network credentials received in step , and the method  proceeds to step .","At step  and as shown in , a client device (N) transmits a registration message to the smart network host device . In one embodiment, a client device (N) includes a registration module  configured to transmit an XML-SOAP message to the smart network host device  that requests the client device (N) to be registered with the smart network host device . At step , the client device (N) receives a response message from the smart network host device  that includes an FQDN assigned to the client device (N) by the smart network host device . At step , the client device (N) determines whether the client device (N) is configured to expose at least one service  to the smart network. If the client device (N) is not configured to expose any services , then method  proceeds to step . Returning to step , if the client device (N) is configured to expose at least one service , then method  proceeds to step  where client device (N) transmits a registration message to the smart network host device  requesting the at least one service to be registered with the smart network . At step , the client device (N) receives a response message from the smart network host device  that includes one or more FQDNs corresponding to each instance of the at least one service running on the client device (N).","At step  and as shown in , a client device (N) transmits diagnostic information about the client device (N) to the network host. In one embodiment, a client device (N) includes a diagnostic module  configured to collect information such as status information related to the client device (N), status information related to any services  running on the client device (N), or any other type of relevant information that may be used to troubleshoot issues with the client device (N) or smart network . The smart network host device  may act as a central repository for all diagnostic information, and may track historical trends in diagnostic information. At step , client device (N) queries the smart network host device  to request additional diagnostic information related to other devices connected to the smart network . At step , the client device (N) receives a response from the smart network host device  that includes at least some additional diagnostic information related to the smart network . At step , the client device (N) may be configured to transmit the diagnostic information related to the client device (N) as well as the additional diagnostic information related to other devices connected to the smart network  to a service configured to enable troubleshooting of the client device (N) or smart network . In one embodiment, the diagnostic service may be hosted by a computer  connected to the smart network . In alternative embodiments, the diagnostic service may be hosted by a portal stored on a computer connected to the external network , such as a service accessible on the manufacturer of the client device's (N) website.","At step  and as shown in , a client device (N) may be configured to determine whether the firmware installed on the client device (N) is out of date. In one embodiment, the client device (N) may include a firmware upgrade module  configured to compare a version number associated with the firmware installed on the client device to a version number associated with new firmware available on a remote server of an external network. For example, a manufacturer may provide an applet (J) to the applet store  that is configured to periodically check a manufacturer's server to determine if a new firmware version is available. If a new firmware version is available, the applet (J), running on portal  on computer , may be configured to download the new firmware to a memory in the computer . The new firmware may include a version number that can be compared to a version number of firmware currently installed on the client device (N) by the firmware upgrade module .","If the firmware installed on the client device (N) is not out of date, then the method  proceeds to step  where the client device (N) may schedule a future time to re-determine whether the firmware installed on the client device (N) is out of date. For example, the firmware upgrade module  may be configured to query the portal  to determine if new firmware for the client device is available. If new firmware is not available, then the firmware upgrade module  may set a reminder to query the portal  every 5 days to check for the availability of new firmware. Returning now to step , if the firmware installed on the client device (N) is out of date, then the method  proceeds to step  where the client device (N) downloads the new firmware version and installs the new firmware version on the client device (N). In one embodiment, the firmware upgrade module  may be configured to download the new firmware version from the portal . In another embodiment, the firmware upgrade module  may be configured to download the new firmware version from a remote server located on the external network.","In sum, example embodiments of the invention provide systems and methods for connecting a client device to a wireless network.
