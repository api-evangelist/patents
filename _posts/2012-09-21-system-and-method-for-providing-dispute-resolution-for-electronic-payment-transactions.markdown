{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/104,907, filed May 10, 2011, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/343,195, filed Dec. 23, 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,941,352, each of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.","This invention generally relates to a method and system for providing dispute resolution for credit card or other electronic payment transactions, including but not limited to, debit card, ACH, eCheck, LEC transactions, etc. More specifically, the invention provides a method and system for allowing card issuers or other electronic payment providers to automatically remove cardholders or other purchasers from recurring payment programs and\/or to issue credits to cardholders for disputed credit card transactions, if appropriate transaction parameters are satisfied, and to decline such credit requests when the transaction parameters are not satisfied.","Credit cards and other payment instruments, such as debit cards and check cards, are widely used by holders to purchase goods and services in the marketplace. It is projected that at least 35% of all U.S. cardholder payments in 2007 will be made via \u201cplastic\u201d (i.e., a credit or debit card), and it is estimated that this rate will increase to at least 49% by 2010. The current annual value of these transactions exceeds 400 billion dollars. While credit card transactions are convenient for cardholders, they present a special set of problems for merchants and credit card issuers. One such problem occurs when a cardholder disputes a credit card transaction, necessitating the expenditure of substantial time and resources in investigating and resolving such disputes.","Cardholders and other purchasers using an electronic payment provider are increasingly going directly to their card issuer to resolve billing disputes rather than contacting the merchant directly. This trend toward chargebacks that are initiated without any prior contact with the merchant by the cardholder results in inefficient resolution of such disputes because when the merchant is not directly involved in the resolution process, the card issuer must undertake the resolution activities on behalf of the merchant, thus increasing the complexity, time and expense of the resolution process.","To understand the problem presented by credit card and other electronic payment provider transaction disputes, a brief overview of the electronic payment provider process is required. Credit cards are provided to a cardholder by an issuing bank. When a cardholder enters into a transaction with a merchant using the credit card, the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant at the time the transaction is verified.","Each month, the credit card user is sent a statement documenting the purchases made with the card, and the total balance owed. According to the Fair Credit Billing Act, the cardholder can dispute any charges on the statement that he or she thinks are incorrect. The cardholder mayor may not have contacted the merchant about remedying the situation before contacting the issuing bank.","The chargeback process varies somewhat from credit card company to credit card company, but generally follows the sequence shown in . At step , a credit card holder disputes a transaction with their issuing bank. At step , the issuing bank investigates to determine whether the chargeback request is valid, and if it is not, denies the chargeback. At step , a provisional credit representing the amount charged is placed back in the user's account. At step , the issuing bank initiates a chargeback process and obtains credit representing the chargeback purchase from the merchant's bank. At step , the merchant's bank investigates the chargeback request to determine if it is valid, and, if not, the chargeback is returned to the issuing bank. If the merchant's bank determines the chargeback is valid, at step , the chargeback amount is removed from the merchant's bank account, and the merchant's bank provides written notice to the merchant. At step , the merchant is given an opportunity to refute the chargeback, and, if its documentation is satisfactory, the chargeback is declined and the cardholder is once again charged for the sale. If the chargeback is not declined, the chargeback is successful and the process is completed.","The present invention provides a card issuer or other electronic payment provider with a system and method for obtaining a quick, favorable and efficient resolution to the customers' disputes with merchants, thus reducing operating expenses, while providing superior customer service. The present invention may also be used simultaneously with one or more of various types of electronic payments offered by card issuers or other electronic payment providers, such as credit card, debit card, ACH, eCheck, mobile payments, LEC, etc., transactions, and with one or more payment brands or networks within each type of electronic payment transactions, such as within credit card electronic payment transactions, providing simultaneous use with Visa, MC, Amex, Discover and JCB card transactions. The present invention thus provides multiple connectivity to a plurality of various types of electronic payment networks, such as credit card, debit card, ACH, eCheck, mobile payments, LEC, etc., and with one or more payment brands or networks within each type of electronic payment transactions.","The present invention allows issuers to obtain a quick turnaround in cardholder credit processing with minimal resource expenditure. For recurring payment program merchants, cardholders are removed from the recurring payment program, which prevents submission of future authorization requests, thus eliminating the potential for future disputes. The present invention thereby significantly reduces the time and cost required for the card issuer to resolve cardholder transaction disputes, while delivering a favorable resolution to the cardholder.","In one preferred embodiment, shown in , the system and method of the present invention are illustrated. The payment instrument holder initiates a notice of dispute to the card issuer and submits the necessary transaction information by internet, mail, fax, email, in-person, via SMS mobile text, mobile phone or by telephone, through the touchtone keypad of the phone, or by responding orally wherein the system utilizes voice recognition software (IVR) to convert voice data into computer readable data.","The card issuer or device associated with the card issuer terminal, such as a scanner or IVR system, inputs the transaction information into the card issuer terminal for processing by the card issuer processing system.","The card issuer processing system sends a queue of eligible transactions to the dispute resolution system server for processing. This request includes the transaction data that is required for adjudication of the dispute regarding the transaction, such as credit card number, transaction amount, transaction date and merchant identification. The dispute resolution system determines if the transaction qualifies for resolution under the system and, if so, directs the issuance of the credit to the cardholder for the transaction, cancels the transaction, and sends reports of the results of the dispute resolution to the card issuer and the originating merchant. The present invention may be used with multiple card types, card issuers, merchants and payment types, such as ACH, mobile payments, LEC billing, etc.","In further related aspects, described herein is a merchant or partner-based method and device for resolving inquiries or disputes between a customer and an electronic payment provider concerning a transaction between the customer and a merchant that is affiliated with a partner\/aggregator platform. In one approach, the method may involve receiving, at the partner entity\/platform, an inquiry\/dispute event notification. The method may involve obtaining data points about the transaction and locating the transaction based on the data points. The method may involve refunding the transaction, cancelling the transaction, and\/or blocking future\/recurring charges. In related aspects, an electronic device (e.g., a partner\/aggregator server or component(s) thereof) may be configured to execute the above-described methodology.","Reference is now made to the figures in which like reference numerals refer to like elements. In the following description, certain specific details of programming, software modules, user selections, network transactions, database queries, database structures, etc., are provided for a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In some cases, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail in order to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention. Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","In one preferred embodiment, shown in , the system and method of the present invention are illustrated. As shown in , the system of the present invention preferably includes a dispute resolution server , which is linked to a card issuer's computer processing system  by an application programming interface on the card issuer's computer system. The interface obtains transaction details necessary to implement the dispute resolution process, including credit card number, credit card expiration date, cardholder name and address, transaction amount and merchant identification, such as merchant name, phone number, URL, or merchant acquirer bank identification.","The interface is connected to the dispute resolution server  by a data transmission link, such as the Internet, or other electronic file transfer protocols such as FTP, SFTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, TELNET, SSH, XML, REST, or JSON as examples.","The interface preferably is connected to the dispute resolution server  by data transmission link, such as the Internet, telephone line or network cable. The interface may transfer transaction data to the server in batch files or by single transaction record using electronic file transfer protocols such as FTP, SFTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, TELNET, SSH, XML, REST, or JSON as examples. Either \u201cnighttime\u201d batch file transfer or real time transfer by application programming interface (API) may be used for these files.","Alternatively, the system of the present invention may be operated on the card issuer's computer  which is connected via the Internet or other communication network to the dispute resolution program server . In the alternative, or in addition, the techniques described herein may be operated on one or more entities in the system, such as, for example, a merchant entity (e.g., merchant's processing device  in  or merchant platform  in ), a partner entity (e.g., partner platform  in ), or the like, or combinations thereof.","As shown in , the cardholder initiating the dispute may submit the relevant information to the card issuer by telephone , fax , or by mail, SMS, online or other electronic medium using a computer  or mobile device , such as cellular telephone, standard landline, PDA, or pager. The cardholder may alternatively submit the dispute information via in-person communication or the like.","The card issuer and\/or the cardholder may be equipped with or otherwise be in communication with a processing device , such as a PC or laptop, which may be programmed to receive and process data related to disputed transactions. The dispute data may be input into appropriate electronic format manually by the card issuer's employee using an input device, such as a keyboard or mouse, or it may be converted directly from the cardholder's input by IVR in the case of a telephone notice, by OCR in the case of a mail or fax notice, or directly from electronic input in the case of on-line submissions.","For example, the card issuer processing device  may transmit a batch file containing one or more dispute items to the dispute resolution system server  via one of the previously described data transmission links and electronic file transfer protocols. In related aspects, API and BATCH based communication methods between the issuer device  and the dispute resolution server  may be supported. The dispute resolution system may process the requests and return a response back to the card issuer processing device  via the same link.","The dispute resolution system may also generate a response concerning the disputed transaction to the originating merchant's processing device  via previously described data transmission links and electronic file transfer protocols. For example, the dispute resolution system server  may also serve as the payment processing system for the merchant. Thus, in the capacity of payment processing system for the merchant, the dispute resolution system server  receives transactions from the merchant, forwards received transactions to acquirers , and stores transaction data. As is known in the art, acquirer  is a merchant's acquiring bank which is a banking or financial institution which provides the merchant with a merchant processing account for the processing of electronic transactions originating from the merchant's customers. The acquirer  sends transaction information to the payment networks, such as Visa, MC, Amex, Discover and JCB which connect the Issuer and the Acquirer, and provide a clearing and settlement service to transfer payment information between the Issuer and the Acquirer. Because the dispute resolution system server  also serves as the payment processing system for the merchant, the present example offers the advantage of immediately declining future transactions from the merchant for the disputing consumer, including terminating ongoing recurring transactions. This prevents the recurrence of such disputed transactions while the dispute relating to the current disputed transaction is resolved. In another example, the dispute resolution server  may not serve as the payment processing system for the merchant. In yet another example, the dispute resolution service or technique may be implemented via a network entity other than a dispute resolution server  (e.g., partner platform  and\/or merchant platform  in ), wherein the network entity does not serve as the payment processing system for the merchant. For example, the network entity may be a partner platform or the like that communicates with the merchant (e.g., merchant  in  or merchant platform  in ), wherein the merchant handles the payment process directly with the acquirer\/payment network to perform the dispute resolution. The merchant may provide the network entity with the data\/results related to the processing performed to resolve the dispute or inquiry.","As shown in , the process begins at step  with the cardholder initiating the dispute by providing notice of the dispute to the card issuer. The cardholder may submit the dispute to the issuer by telephone, mail, fax, e-mail or online On-line submissions may be facilitated by the card issuer in the provision of a link in an on-line statement provided to the cardholder of a pop-up-form. This link may connect the cardholder to the card issuer's processing system, or alternatively directly to the merchant with whom the transaction was initiated. This latter alternative allows the cardholder to mediate the dispute directly with the merchant.","Once the chargeback dispute template is completed by the cardholder, they can select the submit button and the system will use the template to generate a standard charge dispute form, which includes all the necessary information to dispute a charge.","This information may be submitted by the cardholder with the following statement:\n\n","At step , the card issuer inputs the data relating to the notice of dispute received from the card issuer. The dispute data includes such information regarding the transaction, such as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Name:"]},{"entry":[{},"Date: (mm-dd-yy)"]},{"entry":[{},"Account #: - - -"]},{"entry":[{},"Amount of Dispute: $"]},{"entry":[{},"Reference #:"]},{"entry":[{},"Merchant:"]},{"entry":[{},"Reason for dispute:"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"At step , upon receipt of the dispute notification, the Issuer processor  determines whether the dispute or inquiry is eligible for processing by the Dispute Resolution System by matching or comparing the disputed transaction details extracted by the Issuer from interchange data against a table of identifiers for participating merchants provided by the Dispute Resolution System. The table may be periodically updated by a data transmission, preferably by secure batch file transmission such as FTPS (FTP over SSL), although other types of file transmission may be used, such as e-mail of Excel spreadsheet files or physical transfer of electronic storage media, including DVD or CD\/ROM. In another example, an online portal or the like may be used by the issuer(s)  to check whether the dispute or inquiry is eligible for processing by the dispute resolution system. The issuer may key in the merchant descriptor, phone number, or the like to determine if the dispute\/inquiry case is eligible for processing or participation in the dispute resolution system or network.","Preferably, at steps , and , the card issuer system also screens disputes for ineligible transactions based on the predetermined transaction-level eligibility requirements such as whether the transaction was previously refunded or refunded by the merchant and\/or the dispute resolution system provider at step , whether the transaction has a Central Processing Date (CPO) greater than a predetermined interval, such as 120 days from the date of the dispute resolution system dispute request, at step , and whether the transaction originated with a merchant who receives chargeback protection, as chargeback rights do not exist for the card Issuer against the merchant in such case in step . As may be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the eligibility criteria which are tested at steps ,  and  may vary for different card issuers, depending upon their specific preferences. For example, eligibility criteria may also be determined according to the identity of the originating merchant, depending upon the Card Issuer's preference. Further, whether the transaction has a Central Processing Date (CPO) greater than a predetermined maximum interval, such as 120 days from the date of the dispute resolution system dispute request, may also be used to determine eligibility. As may be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art, the 120 day maximum interval from the date of the transaction to the date of the dispute resolution system dispute request is offered only as an example, and this interval may be adjusted as desired by the Card Issuer.","At step  disputes which return a match when referencing the merchant eligibility table (and\/or manual eligibility verification), and which do not violate the transaction-level criteria are flagged as Dispute Resolution System eligible and sorted into a separate queue within the Issuer's system prior to processing by the Dispute Resolution System. The Dispute Resolution System request file may be generated and supplied by the Issuer as specified below and transmitted via internet for Dispute Resolution System processing. In another example, the Issuer may transmit the case to the Dispute Resolution System via an API transmission or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Field Name","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Issuer ID","Predefined Issuer identification value provided by system"]},{"entry":[{},"to identify the Issuer submitting the dispute request file"]},{"entry":["Transaction Description","Merchant DBA\/payment billing descriptor"]},{"entry":["Billing Descriptor Phone","Billing descriptor merchant phone number parsed from"]},{"entry":[{},"Transaction Description or City Name field"]},{"entry":"Acquiring Institution"},{"entry":"Identification Code"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Identification Code"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor Terminal"},{"entry":"Identification"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Name\/Location -"},{"entry":"Merchant Name"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Name\/Location -"},{"entry":"City Name"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Name\/Location -"},{"entry":"Country Code"},{"entry":"Merchant Type\/MCC"},{"entry":"POS Entry Mode"},{"entry":"POS Condition Mode"},{"entry":["First Name","Cardholder first name"]},{"entry":["Last Name","Cardholder last name"]},{"entry":["Billing Street Address 1","Cardholder billing street address 1"]},{"entry":["Billing Street Address 2","Cardholder billing street address 2"]},{"entry":["Billing City","Cardholder billing city"]},{"entry":["Billing State","Cardholder billing state"]},{"entry":["Billing Zip","Cardholder billing zip"]},{"entry":["Payment Type","\u201cvisa\u201d, \u201cmastercard\u201d, \u201camex\u201d, \u201cdiscover\u201d, \u201cjcb\u201d, or \u201cdiners\u201d"]},{"entry":["Account Number","Full or Hashed CC Number.

In another example, the card issuer system may transmit the dispute item(s) via API or the like. At step , the dispute resolution system will then pick up the file, remove the file from the FTPS system and load the file into the dispute resolution system. In another example, the dispute resolution system may return a response back to the Issuer via an API or the like. In the subsequent steps, the dispute resolution system will process the file and return a response back to a location on the FTPS system.","At step , the dispute resolution system processor  confirms whether the dispute is eligible for processing by the Dispute Resolution System transactions by matching the merchant identification descriptor from the disputed transaction against the table of identifiers for participating merchants.","At step , the dispute resolution system processor  determines whether the transaction is eligible for the dispute resolution system processing. For example, this eligibility may be determined by attempting to match the dispute request transaction details against the records in the sales transaction database. In another example, eligibility may be determined by sending the dispute data to partner (e.g., partner platform ) to perform such checks with a database or the like, wherein data regarding the sale transactions are not stored within the Dispute Resolution System. This sales transaction database represents transactions initiated with the participating merchants, so that, if appropriate, a refund may be issued to the cardholder from the merchant. As illustrated at step  in , the sales transaction database may be populated with data relating to transactions from participating merchants, which transactions were originally processed through the dispute resolution system processor . In one example, only those transactions which were processed through the dispute resolution system processor  transaction gateway are eligible for the dispute resolution system processing and are selected in step . Optionally, the sales transaction database can be populated with bulk file transfers of data representing transactions initiated with the participating merchants.

For example, the merchant(s) or the merchant service provider's system(s) may be responsible for refunding a disputed transaction and\/or declining future transactions from the merchant(s) for the disputing customer(s), thereby shifting such responsibility away from the dispute resolution server  or the like.","With reference to , there is shown an example dispute resolution system  that includes numerous network entities, including merchant entities , partner entities , dispute resolution entities , issuer entities . The participating merchant(s)  may participate in the dispute resolution process via a dispute resolution partner platform . The partner platform  may be in operative communication with one or more merchant(s) , and may be an electronic commerce (e-commerce) platform with separate retail or merchant websites. The partner platform  may be in operative communication with a dispute resolution server or platform , which in turn may in communication with one or more participating card issuers . It is noted that the dispute resolution platform  may interface with the partner platform  via a partner API , and\/or may interface with the participating card issuer(s)  via the issuer API . The partner API  may follow a RESTful API implementation, wherein the partner API  may enable synchronous and asynchronous processing of requests leveraging the HTTP Status Codes to indicate how the system is handling the request.","For example, a user or consumer  may make a purchase at a participating merchant . The consumer  may make an inquiry regarding the purchase and\/or dispute the purchase\/transaction with the card issuer . The card issuer  may submit the case regarding the inquiry and\/or dispute to the dispute resolution platform , which in turn may submit a dispute event notification to the partner platform . The partner platform  may obtain case details from the dispute resolution platform  and\/or another platform in operative communication with the dispute resolution platform . The partner platform  may processes the case, and notify the dispute resolution platform  that the case has been resolved. The partner platform  may notify the merchant  regarding the case and any associated refund and\/or cancellation of charges. The dispute resolution platform  may notify the card issuer  of the case resolution.","In related aspects, the dispute resolution system  may leverage a notification scheme to notify partner(s)  of case events. Events may signify the creation of an inquiry or dispute case for an associated merchant  that is registered with the partner platform  and participates in the system . The notification scheme may allow the partner  to handle the case request and resolve the dispute within their platform.","In further related aspects, after the notification is sent and accepted by the partner , calls to the dispute resolution API may be initiated by the partner  to obtain additional case details, process the case resolution, and update the network with the transaction details after the case has been resolved.","Event Types:","In one embodiment, the event types may originate from the dispute resolution platform . The requests may be processed by a partner  based at least in part on the event type in accordance with the dispute resolution program running on one or more network entities of the dispute resolution system . Examples event types may include: Dispute; Cancel; or Revoke.","A DISPUTE event identifies a Cardholder Dispute received for the indicated merchant. Resolution of the request may involve having the referenced transaction to be refunded, and any subsequent billings for that cardholder for that product to be blocked or suspended. Typically this involves having the Account number added to a negative list managed by the partner  or the merchant .","A CANCEL event notification may involve any subsequent billing for the noted account number to be blocked or suspended. Typically this involves having the Account number added to a negative list managed by the partner  and\/or the merchant .","The REVOKE event notification may be in reference to a case previously submitted by the dispute resolution platform  to the partner  for processing. In certain scenarios, a case may have been processed in error and this event type enables the case to be revoked from DISPUTE or CANCEL processing. The partner  may receive these notifications when a case is in the status of PROCESSING, but has not yet been RESOLVED or DECLINED.","Event Notification:","With reference to the call flow diagram  of , the merchant  (not shown) or partner  may implement a Notification URL endpoint that will be available to receive event notifications from the dispute resolution platform . The notification may identify an inquiry\/dispute case that is ready for processing.","It is expected that the partner  will acknowledge the DISPUTE and CANCEL notifications by initiating a Case Update request to set the status to PROCESSING. REVOKE notifications may be acknowledged by setting the case status to CANCELLED.","If an event is not acknowledged, and remains in the pending status following a notification, the notification may be re-submitted. The notification may be re-attempted until an acknowledgement, identified by the case status, changes from PENDING or is RESOLVED by the partner .","With continued reference to , the card issuer  may send a dispute resolution request to the dispute resolution platform , which in turn may send an event notification to the partner platform . The event notification may include one more of the following information: (a) case ID (e.g., a unique identifier the case across the dispute resolution platform  or the dispute resolution system  generally); (b) merchant ID (e.g., a merchant identifier that represents the Merchant Account the dispute is requested against); (c) event type (e.g., DISPUTE, CANCEL, or REVOKE); (d) notification ID (e.g., reference to the specific notification message); or variations thereof.","The partner  may acknowledge the Case Notification by updating the Case Status to PROCESSING, and sending such information back to the dispute resolution platform . At the dispute resolution platform , if the Case Status is not updated to PROCESSING or to a case resolution status by the next Notification Interval, then another notification may be sent to the partner .","For example, the partner platform may perform one or more of the following: (a) make a GET call to obtain the full case details from the dispute resolution platform ; (b) locate the disputed sale by a global unique transaction identifier, such as, for example, an ARN or the like; (c) refund the disputed sale up to a the dispute resolution case amount if the already refunded; (d) cancel future cardholder charges for associated recurring charges; (e) update the case status to Resolved to indicate that the requirements have been satisfied. Once the case is Resolved, the Case outcome may be communicated to the issuer  via a dispute resolution response message or the like. With respect to (b), in one example, the referenced sale may be located by an ARN or the like. In another example, the transaction and case data attributes may be used to search for the referenced sale, wherein such data points may include the BIN, last four digits of the account number, date of the transaction, transaction amount, etc.","With respect to handling a DISPUTE event, the event notification may instruct the partner  to refund the disputed transaction by the amount indicated on the dispute resolution request; or if a refund has already been applied to the disputed transaction, resolve the case by providing the details of the refund fully or partially (which may optionally involve an additional partial refund to be processed). In further related aspects, the event notification may instruct the partner  to cancel any recurring billing for that account holder for the product\/service being disputed.","With respect to handling a CANCEL event, the event notification may instruct the partner  to cancel any recurring or future billing for that account holder related to the product transaction referenced by the case.","With respect to handling a REVOKE event, the event notification may allow the partner  to stop any current processing related to the handling of the DISPUTE or CANCEL case. For example, the event notification may instruct the partner  to suspend any transactions related to the refunding of the original transaction or cancellation of recurring billing for the account number.","Cases:","With reference once again to , the dispute resolution cases may represent the dispute created by the consumer when the card issuer  was contacted. The dispute may be received by the dispute network or system , and may be pending resolution by the partner . The partner  may be able to use the HTTP methods to retrieve and resolve the case. Example HTTP methods may include GET (i.e., access and read the details of a single case by referencing the case ID or the like); PUT (i.e., update the case status and associated transaction data that may be maintained by the partner  or another network entity of the system ); and\/or combinations\/variations thereof.","With respect to the case status life cycle, the cases may flow through a status life cycle as they are handled and processed by the partner  and by the dispute resolution platform .  provides illustrates an example case status life cycle. Once a case notification is sent to a partner  for processing, the partner  may be expected to resolve the case; however, a case can be revoked by the issuer  prior to being resolved. When this occurs a REVOKE notification may be sent to the partner , changing the case status to REVOKED. Both the DISPUTE and CANCEL case types can be involved in a REVOKE notification.
