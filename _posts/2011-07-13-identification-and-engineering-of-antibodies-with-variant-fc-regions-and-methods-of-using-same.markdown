title: Identification and engineering of antibodies with variant FC regions and methods of using same
abstract: The present invention relates to molecules, particularly polypeptides, more particularly immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies), comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc region, which variant Fc region binds FcγRIIIA and/or FcγRIIA with a greater affinity, relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild-type Fc region. The molecules of the invention are particularly useful in preventing, treating, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection. The molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of a disease or disorder where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by FcγR is desired, e.g., cancer, infectious disease, and in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic antibodies the effect of which is mediated by ADCC.

The molecules of the invention are particularly useful in preventing, treating, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection. The molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of a disease or disorder where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by Fc\u03b3R is desired, e.g., cancer, infectious disease, and in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic antibodies the effect of which is mediated by ADCC.","The interaction of antibody-antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses, ranging from effector functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, mast cell degranulation, and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally related ligand binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.","The Fc receptors, members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of proteins, are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the a chain of the Fc receptor. Fc receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fc receptors for IgG are referred to as Fc\u03b3R, for IgE as F\u03b5R, and for IgA as Fc\u03b1R. Different accessory cells bear Fc receptors for antibodies of different isotype, and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response (reviewed by Ravetch J. V. et al. 19919: 457-92; Gerber J. S. et al. 2001 3: 131-139; Billadeau D. D. et al. 20022(109): 161-1681; Ravetch J. V. et al. 2000290: 84-89; Ravetch J. V. et al., 2001 19:275-90; Ravetch J. V. 199478(4): 553-60). The different Fc receptors, the cells that express them, and their isotype specificity is summarized in Table 1 (adapted from 4ed. 1999, Elsevier Science Ltd\/Garland Publishing, New York).","Fc\u03b3 Receptors","Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein, possessing extracellular domains related to a C2-set of immunoglobulin-related domains, a single membrane spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length. There are three known Fc\u03b3Rs, designated Fc\u03b3RI(CD64), Fc\u03b3RII(CD32), and Fc\u03b3RIII(CD16). The three receptors are encoded by distinct genes; however, the extensive homology between the three family members suggest they arose from a common progenitor perhaps by gene duplication.","Fc\u03b3RII(CD32)","Fc\u03b3RII proteins are 40 KDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig (10M). This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc\u03b3R, present on all hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and platelets. Fc\u03b3RII has only two immunoglobulin-like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc\u03b3RI. There are three human Fc\u03b3RII genes (Fc\u03b3RII-A, Fc\u03b3RII-B, Fc\u03b3RII-C), all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes.","Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc\u03b3RII-A and Fc\u03b3RII-B create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The fundamental difference is that the A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the B isoform initiates inhibitory signals, e.g., inhibiting B-cell activation.","Signaling Through Fc\u03b3Rs","Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc\u03b3Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs (ITAMs) or immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIMS) account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the Fc\u03b3R-mediated cellular responses. ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R complexes include Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, whereas ITIM-containing complexes only include Fc\u03b3RIIB.","Human neutrophils express the Fc\u03b3RIIA gene. Fc\u03b3RIIA clustering via immune complexes or specific antibody cross-linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor-associated kinases which facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinase, activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates (e.g., PIK). Cellular activation leads to release of proinflammatory mediators.","The Fc\u03b3RIIB gene is expressed on B lymphocytes; its extracellular domain is 96% identical to Fc\u03b3RIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner. The presence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB defines this inhibitory subclass of Fc\u03b3R. Recently the molecular basis of this inhibition was established. When colligated along with an activating Fc\u03b3R, the ITIM in Fc\u03b3RIIB becomes phosphorylated and attracts the SH2 domain of the inosital polyphosphate 5\u2032-phosphatase (SHIP), which hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R-mediated tyrosine kinase activation, consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca. Thus crosslinking of Fc\u03b3RIIB dampens the activating response to Fc\u03b3R ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness. B cell activation, B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is thus aborted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"350pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Receptors for the Fc Regions of Immunoglobulin Isotypes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Fc\u03b3RI","Fc\u03b3RII-A","Fc\u03b3RII-B2","Fc\u03b3RII-B1","Fc\u03b3RIII",{},"Fc\u03b1RI"]},{"entry":["Receptor","(CD64)","(CD32)","(CD32)","(CD32)","(CD16)","Fc\u03b5RI","(CD89)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Binding","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgE","IgA1, IgA2"]},{"entry":[{},"10M","2 \u00d7 10M","2 \u00d7 10M","2 \u00d7 10M","5 \u00d7 10M","1010 M","10M"]},{"entry":["Cell Type","Macrophages","Macrophages","Macrophages","B cells","NK cells","Mast cells","Macrophages"]},{"entry":[{},"Neutrophils","Neutrophils","Neutrophils","Mast cells","Eosinophil","Eosinophil","Neutrophils"]},{"entry":[{},"Eosinophils","Eosinophils","Eosinophils",{},"Macrophages","Basophils","Eosinophils"]},{"entry":[{},"Dendritic cells","Dendritic cells",{},{},"Neutrophils"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Platelets",{},{},"Mast Cells"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Langerhan cells"]},{"entry":["Effect of","Uptake","Uptake","Uptake","No uptake","Induction of","Secretion of","Uptake"]},{"entry":["Ligation","Stimulation","Granule release","Inhibition of","Inhibition of","Killing","granules","Induction of"]},{"entry":[{},"Activation of",{},"Stimulation","Stimulation",{},{},"killing"]},{"entry":[{},"respiratory burst"]},{"entry":[{},"Induction of"]},{"entry":[{},"killing"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"2.2.1 Cancer","A neoplasm, or tumor, is a neoplastic mass resulting from abnormal uncontrolled cell growth which can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors generally remain localized. Malignant tumors are collectively termed cancers. The term \u201cmalignant\u201d generally means that the tumor can invade and destroy neighboring body structures and spread to distant sites to cause death (for review, see Robbins and Angell, 19762d Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. 68-122). Cancer can arise in many sites of the body and behave differently depending upon its origin. Cancerous cells destroy the part of the body in which they originate and then spread to other part(s) of the body where they start new growth and cause more destruction.","More than 1.2 million Americans develop cancer each year. Cancer is the second leading case of death in the United States and if current trends continue, cancer is expected to be the leading cause of the death by the year 2010. Lung and prostate cancer are the top cancer killers for men in the United States. Lung and breast cancer are the top cancer killers for women in the United States. One in two men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during his lifetime. One in three women in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during her lifetime.","A cure for cancer has yet to be found. Current treatment options, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment, are oftentimes either ineffective or present serious side effects.","Cancer Therapy","Currently, cancer therapy may involve surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and\/or radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic cells in a patient (See, for example, Stockdale, 1998, \u201cPrinciples of Cancer Patient Management\u201d, in , vol. 3, Rubenstein and Federman, eds., Chapter 12, Section IV). Recently, cancer therapy could also involve biological therapy or immunotherapy. All of these approaches pose significant drawbacks for the patient. Surgery, for example, may be contraindicated due to the health of the patient or may be unacceptable to the patient. Additionally, surgery may not completely remove the neoplastic tissue. Radiation therapy is only effective when the neoplastic tissue exhibits a higher sensitivity to radiation than normal tissue, and radiation therapy can also often elicit serious side effects. Hormonal therapy is rarely given as a single agent and although can be effective, is often used to prevent or delay recurrence of cancer after other treatments have removed the majority of the cancer cells. Biological therapies\/immunotherapies are limited in number and may produce side effects such as rashes or swellings, flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and fatigue, digestive tract problems or allergic reactions.","With respect to chemotherapy, there are a variety of chemotherapeutic agents available for treatment of cancer. A significant majority of cancer chemotherapeutics act by inhibiting DNA synthesis, either directly, or indirectly by inhibiting the biosynthesis of the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate precursors, to prevent DNA replication and concomitant cell division (See, for example, Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's: , Eighth Ed. (Pergamom Press, New York, 1990)). These agents, which include alkylating agents, such as nitrosourea, anti-metabolites, such as methotrexate and hydroxyurea, and other agents, such as etoposides, campathecins, bleomycin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, etc., although not necessarily cell cycle specific, kill cells during S phase because of their effect on DNA replication. Other agents, specifically colchicine and the vinca alkaloids, such as vinblastine and vincristine, interfere with microtubule assembly resulting in mitotic arrest. Chemotherapy protocols generally involve administration of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents to increase the efficacy of treatment.","Despite the availability of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, chemotherapy has many drawbacks (See, for example, Stockdale, 1998, \u201cPrinciples Of Cancer Patient Management\u201d in , vol. 3, Rubenstein and Federman, eds., ch. 12, sect. 10). Almost all chemotherapeutic agents are toxic, and chemotherapy causes significant, and often dangerous, side effects, including severe nausea, bone marrow depression, immunosuppression, etc. Additionally, even with administration of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, many tumor cells are resistant or develop resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. In fact, those cells resistant to the particular chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment protocol often prove to be resistant to other drugs, even those agents that act by mechanisms different from the mechanisms of action of the drugs used in the specific treatment; this phenomenon is termed pleiotropic drug or multidrug resistance. Thus, because of drug resistance, many cancers prove refractory to standard chemotherapeutic treatment protocols.","There is a significant need for alternative cancer treatments, particularly for treatment of cancer that has proved refractory to standard cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. A promising alternative is immunotherapy, in which cancer cells are specifically targeted by cancer antigen-specific antibodies. Major efforts have been directed at harnessing the specificity of the immune response, for example, hybridoma technology has enabled the development of tumor selective monoclonal antibodies (See Green M. C. et al., 2000 26: 269-286; Weiner L M, 1999 26(suppl. 14):43-51), and in the past few years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first MAbs for cancer therapy: Rituxin (anti-CD20) for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Herceptin [anti-(c-erb-2\/HER-2)] for metastatic breast cancer (Suzanne A. Eccles, 20013: 86-90). However, the potency of antibody effector function, e.g., to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (\u201cADCC\u201d) is an obstacle to such treatment. Methods to improve the efficacy of such immunotherapy are thus needed.","2.2.2 Inflammatory Diseases and Autoimmune Diseases","Inflammation is a process by which the body's white blood cells and chemicals protect our bodies from infection by foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It is usually characterized by pain, swelling, warmth and redness of the affected area. Chemicals known as cytokines and prostaglandins control this process, and are released in an ordered and self-limiting cascade into the blood or affected tissues. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in the redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. These changes, when occurring for a limited period in the relevant area, work to the benefit of the body.","In autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disorders, the immune system triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign substances to fight and the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues by mistakenly attacking self. There are many different autoimmune disorders which affect the body in different ways. For example, the brain is affected in individuals with multiple sclerosis, the gut is affected in individuals with Crohn's disease, and the synovium, bone and cartilage of various joints are affected in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. As autoimmune disorders progress destruction of one or more types of body tissues, abnormal growth of an organ, or changes in organ function may result. The autoimmune disorder may affect only one organ or tissue type or may affect multiple organs and tissues. Organs and tissues commonly affected by autoimmune disorders include red blood cells, blood vessels, connective tissues, endocrine glands (e.g., the thyroid or pancreas), muscles, joints, and skin. Examples of autoimmune disorders include, but are not limited to, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune inner ear disease myasthenia gravis, Reiter's syndrome, Graves disease, autoimmune hepatitis, familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis are types of inflammatory arthritis. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in joints. Some, but not all, types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Besides rheumatoid arthritis, other types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following: psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis arthritis, and gouty arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a type of chronic arthritis that occurs in joints on both sides of the body (such as both hands, wrists or knees). This symmetry helps distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from other types of arthritis. In addition to affecting the joints, rheumatoid arthritis may occasionally affect the skin, eyes, lungs, heart, blood or nerves.","Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1% of the world's population and is potentially disabling. There are approximately 2.9 million incidences of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. Two to three times more women are affected than men. The typical age that rheumatoid arthritis occurs is between 25 and 50. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis affects 71,000 young Americans (aged eighteen and under), affecting six times as many girls as boys.","Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system improperly identifies the synovial membranes that secrete the lubricating fluid in the joints as foreign. Inflammation results, and the cartilage and tissues in and around the joints are damaged or destroyed. In severe cases, this inflammation extends to other joint tissues and surrounding cartilage, where it may erode or destroy bone and cartilage and lead to joint deformities. The body replaces damaged tissue with scar tissue, causing the normal spaces within the joints to become narrow and the bones to fuse together. Rheumatoid arthritis creates stiffness, swelling, fatigue, anemia, weight loss, fever, and often, crippling pain. Some common symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include joint stiffness upon awakening that lasts an hour or longer; swelling in a specific finger or wrist joints; swelling in the soft tissue around the joints; and swelling on both sides of the joint. Swelling can occur with or without pain, and can worsen progressively or remain the same for years before progressing.","The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is based on a combination of factors, including: the specific location and symmetry of painful joints, the presence of joint stiffness in the morning, the presence of bumps and nodules under the skin (rheumatoid nodules), results of X-ray tests that suggest rheumatoid arthritis, and\/or positive results of a blood test called the rheumatoid factor. Many, but not all, people with rheumatoid arthritis have the rheumatoid-factor antibody in their blood. The rheumatoid factor may be present in people who do not have rheumatoid arthritis. Other diseases can also cause the rheumatoid factor to be produced in the blood. That is why the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is based on a combination of several factors and not just the presence of the rheumatoid factor in the blood.","The typical course of the disease is one of persistent but fluctuating joint symptoms, and after about 10 years, 90% of sufferers will show structural damage to bone and cartilage. A small percentage will have a short illness that clears up completely, and another small percentage will have very severe disease with many joint deformities, and occasionally other manifestations of the disease. The inflammatory process causes erosion or destruction of bone and cartilage in the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, there is an autoimmune cycle of persistent antigen presentation, T-cell stimulation, cytokine secretion, synovial cell activation, and joint destruction. The disease has a major impact on both the individual and society, causing significant pain, impaired function and disability, as well as costing millions of dollars in healthcare expenses and lost wages. (See, for example, the NIH website and the NIAID website).","Currently available therapy for arthritis focuses on reducing inflammation of the joints with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications. The first line of treatment of any arthritis is usually anti-inflammatories, such as aspirin, ibuprofen and Cox-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib and rofecoxib. \u201cSecond line drugs\u201d include gold, methotrexate and steroids. Although these are well-established treatments for arthritis, very few patients remit on these lines of treatment alone. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis have led to the use of methotrexate in combination with antibodies to cytokines or recombinant soluble receptors. For example, recombinant soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 have been used in combination with methotrexate in the treatment of arthritis. However, only about 50% of the patients treated with a combination of methotrexate and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents such as recombinant soluble receptors for TNF-\u03b1 show clinically significant improvement. Many patients remain refractory despite treatment. Difficult treatment issues still remain for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Many current treatments have a high incidence of side effects or cannot completely prevent disease progression. So far, no treatment is ideal, and there is no cure. Novel therapeutics are needed that more effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders.","2.2.3 Infectious Diseases","Infectious agents that cause disease fall into five groups: viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths (worms). The remarkable variety of these pathogens has caused the natural selection of two crucial features of adaptive immunity. First, the advantage of being able to recognize a wide range of different pathogens has driven the development of receptors on B and T cells of equal or greater diversity. Second, the distinct habitats and life cycles of pathogens have to be countered by a range of distinct effector mechanisms. The characteristic features of each pathogen are its mode of transmission, its mechanism of replication, its pathogenesis or the means by which it causes disease, and the response it elicits.","The record of human suffering and death caused by smallpox, cholera, typhus, dysentery, malaria, etc. establishes the eminence of the infectious diseases. Despite the outstanding successes in control afforded by improved sanitation, immunization, and antimicrobial therapy, the infectious diseases continue to be a common and significant problem of modern medicine. The most common disease of mankind, the common cold, is an infectious disease, as is the feared modern disease AIDS. Some chronic neurological diseases that were thought formerly to be degenerative diseases have proven to be infectious. There is little doubt that the future will continue to reveal the infectious diseases as major medical problems.","An enormous number of human and animal diseases result from virulent and opportunistic infections from any of the above mentioned infectious agents (see Belshe (Ed.) 1984 , PSG Publishing, Littleton, Mass.).","One category of infectious diseases are viral infections for example. Viral diseases of a wide array of tissues, including the respiratory tract, CNS, skin, genitourinary tract, eyes, ears, immune system, gastrointestinal tract, and musculoskeletal system, affect a vast number of humans of all ages (see Table 328-2 In: Wyngaarden and Smith, 198818Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. 1750-1753). Although considerable effort has been invested in the design of effective anti-viral therapies, viral infections continue to threaten the lives of millions of people worldwide. In general, attempts to develop anti-viral drugs have focused on several stages of viral life cycle (See e.g., Mitsuya et al., 19915:2369-2381, discussing HIV). However, a common drawback associated with using of many current anti-viral drugs is their deleterious side effects, such as toxicity to the host or resistance by certain viral strains.","The present invention is based, in part, on the identification of mutant human IgG1 heavy chain Fc regions, with altered affinities for Fc\u03b3R receptors (e.g., activating Fc\u03b3Rs, inhibitory Fc\u03b3Rs), using a yeast display system. Accordingly, the invention relates to molecules, preferably polypeptides, and more preferably immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies), comprising a variant Fc region, having one or more amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, but also including insertions or deletions) in one or more regions, which modifications alter, e.g., increase or decrease, the affinity of the variant Fc region for an Fc\u03b3R. Preferably, said one or more amino acid modification increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In a preferred embodiment, the molecules of the invention further specifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIB (via the Fc region) with a lower affinity than a comparable molecule (i.e., having the same amino acid sequence as the molecule of the invention except for the one or more amino acid modifications in the Fc region) comprising the wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules with variant Fc regions, having one or more amino acid modifications, which modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to a comparable molecule with a wild type Fc region. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules with variant Fc regions, having one or more amino acid modifications, which modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA but do not alter the affinity of the variant Fc regions for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to a comparable molecule with a wild type Fc region.","The invention encompasses molecules that are homodimers or heterodimers of Fc regions. Heterodimers comprising Fc regions refer to molecules where the two Fc chains have the same or different sequences. In some embodiments, in the heterodimeric molecules comprising variant Fc regions, each chain has one or more different modifications from the other chain. In other embodiments, in the heterodimeric molecules comprising variant Fc regions, one chain contains the wild-type Fc region and the other chains comprises one or more modifications. Methods of engineering heterodimeric Fc containing molecules are known in the art and encompassed within the invention.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region does not bind any Fc\u03b3R or binds with a reduced affinity, relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild-type Fc region, as determined by standard assays (e.g., in vitro assays) known to one skilled in the art. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3IIIA. In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIA.

Preferably, the antibodies of the invention with one or more glycosylation sites and\/or one or more modifications in the Fc region have an enhanced antibody mediated effector function, e.g., enhanced ADCC activity. In some embodiments, the invention further comprises antibodies comprising one or more modifications of amino acids that are directly or indirectly known to interact with a carbohydrate moiety of the antibody, including but not limited to amino acids at positions 241, 243, 244, 245, 245, 249, 256, 258, 260, 262, 264, 265, 296, 299, and 301. Amino acids that directly or indirectly interact with a carbohydrate moiety of an antibody are known in the art, see, e.g., Jefferis et al., 1995 44: 111-7, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention encompasses antibodies that have been modified by introducing one or more glycosylation sites into one or more sites of the antibodies, preferably without altering the functionality of the antibody, e.g., binding activity to Fc\u03b3R. Glycosylation sites may be introduced into the variable and\/or constant region of the antibodies of the invention. As used herein, \u201cglycosylation sites\u201d include any specific amino acid sequence in an antibody to which an oligosaccharide (i.e., carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together) will specifically and covalently attach. Oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of an antibody via either N- or O-linkages. N-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to a hydroxyamino acid, e.g., serine, threonine. The antibodies of the invention may comprise one or more glycosylation sites, including N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites. Any glycosylation site for N-linked or O-linked glycosylation known in the art may be used in accordance with the instant invention. An exemplary N-linked glycosylation site that is useful in accordance with the methods of the present invention, is the amino acid sequence: Asn-X-Thr\/Ser, wherein X may be any amino acid and Thr\/Ser indicates a threonine or a serine.

antibodies) with variant Fc regions, having one or more amino acid modifications, which one or more amino acid modifications increase the affinity of the molecule for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. Such immunoglobulins include IgG molecules that naturally contain Fc\u03b3R binding regions (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIB binding region), or immunoglobulin derivatives that have been engineered to contain an Fc\u03b3R binding region (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIB binding region). The modified immunoglobulins of the invention include any immunoglobulin molecule that binds, preferably, immunospecifically, i.e., competes off non-specific binding as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antigen-antibody binding, an antigen and contains an Fc\u03b3R binding region (e.g., a Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIB binding region). Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, bi-specific, multi-specific, human, humanized, chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032)fragments, disulfide-linked Fvs, and fragments containing either a VL or VH domain or even a complementary determining region (CDR) that specifically binds an antigen, in certain cases, engineered to contain or fused to an Fc\u03b3R binding region.","In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprise portions of an Fc region. As used herein the term \u201cportion of an Fc region\u201d refers to fragments of the Fc region, preferably a portion with effector activity and\/or FcgR binding activity (or a comparable region of a mutant lacking such activity). The fragment of an Fc region may range in size from 5 amino acids to the entire Fc region minus one amino acids. The portion of an Fc region may be missing up to 10, up to 20, up to 30 amino acids from the N-terminus or C-terminus.","The IgG molecules of the invention are preferably IgG1 subclass of IgGs, but may also be any other IgG subclasses of given animals. For example, in humans, the IgG class includes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4; and mouse IgG includes IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c and IgG3.","The immunoglobulins (and other polypeptides used herein) may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are human, rodent (e.g., mouse and rat), donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken. As used herein, \u201chuman\u201d antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described infra and, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598 by Kucherlapati et al.","The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide or may be specific for heterologous epitopes, such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 93\/17715; WO 92\/08802; WO 91\/00360; WO 92\/05793; Tutt, et al., 147:60-69, 1991; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,474,893; 4,714,681; 4,925,648; 5,573,920; 5,601,819; Kostelny et al., 148:1547-1553, 1992.","The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are otherwise modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding antigen and\/or generating an anti-idiotypic response. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.","For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a constant region derived from a human immunoglobulin. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, 229:1202, 1985; Oi et al., 4:214 1986; Gillies et al., 125:191-202, 1989; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions and constant domains from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., 332:323, 1988, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101 and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, 28(4\/5):489-498, 1991; Studnicka et al., 7(6):805-814, 1994; Roguska et al., 91:969-973, 1994), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645; WO 98\/50433; WO 98\/24893; WO 98\/16654; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; and WO 91\/10741, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, 13:65-93, 1995. For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98\/24893; WO 92\/01047; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Pat.

In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.), Medarex (NJ) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope (Jespers et al., 12:899-903, 1988).","The invention encompasses engineering human or humanized therapeutic antibodies (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies) in the Fc region, by modification (e.g., substitution, insertion, deletion) of at least one amino acid residue, which modification increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another embodiment, the invention relates to engineering human or humanized therapeutic antibodies (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies) in the Fc region, by modification of at least one amino acid residue, which modification increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and further decreases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB. The engineered therapeutic antibodies may further have an enhanced effector function, e.g., enhanced ADCC activity, phagocytosis activity, etc., as determined by standard assays known to those skilled in the art.","In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses engineering a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for Her2\/neu protooncogene (e.g., Ab4D5 humanized antibody as disclosed in Carter et al., 199289:4285-9) by modification (e.g., substitution, insertion, deletion) of at least one amino acid residue which modification increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another specific embodiment, modification of the humanized Her2\/neu monoclonal antibody may also further decrease the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB. In yet another specific embodiment, the engineered humanized monoclonal antibodies specific for Her2\/neu may further have an enhanced effector function as determined by standard assays known in the art and disclosed and exemplified herein.","In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses engineering a mouse human chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, 2H7 by modification (e.g., substitution, insertion, deletion) of at least one amino acid residue which modification increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another specific embodiment, modification of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, 2H7 may also further decrease the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB.

In some embodiments, screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities (e.g., enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIIA affinity) are done using the yeast display technology as described herein in combination with one or more functional based assays, preferably in a high throughput manner. The functional based assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more Fc\u03b3R mediated effector cell functions such as those described herein in Section 5.2.6. Non-limiting examples of effector cell functions that can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, cell binding, rosetting, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.

The one or more functional assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more Fc\u03b3R mediated effector cell function as known to one skilled in the art or described herein. In specific embodiments, the immunoglobulins comprising the variant Fc regions are assayed in an ELISA assay for binding to one or more Fc\u03b3Rs, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA; followed by one or more ADCC assays. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulins comprising the variant Fc regions are assayed further using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay, e.g., BIAcore. Surface plasmon resonance-based assays are well known in the art, and are further discussed in Section 5.2.7, and exemplified herein in Example 6.8.","An exemplary high throughput assay for characterizing immunoglobulins comprising variant Fc regions may comprise: introducing a variant Fc region of the invention, e.g., by standard recombinant DNA technology methods, in a 4-4-20 antibody; characterizing the specific binding of the 4-4-20 antibody comprising the variant Fc region to an Fc\u03b3R (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB) in an ELISA assay; characterizing the 4-4-20 antibody comprising the variant Fc region in an ADCC assay (using methods disclosed herein) wherein the target cells are opsonized with the 4-4-20 antibody comprising the variant Fc region; the variant Fc region may then be cloned into a second immunoglobulin, e.g., 4D5, 2H7, and that second immunoglobulin characterized in an ADCC assay, wherein the target cells are opsonized with the second antibody comprising the variant Fc region. The second antibody comprising the variant Fc region is then further analyzed using an ELISA-based assay to confirm the specific binding to an Fc\u03b3R.","Preferably, a variant Fc region of the invention binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a higher affinity than a wild type Fc region as determined in an ELISA assay. Most preferably, a variant Fc region of the invention binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a higher affinity and binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than a wild type Fc region as determined in an ELISA assay. In some embodiments, the variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with at least 2-fold higher, at least 4-fold higher, more preferably at least 6-fold higher, most preferably at least 8 to 10-fold higher affinity than a wild type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with at least 2-fold lower, at least 4-fold lower, more preferably at least 6-fold lower, most preferably at least 8 to 10-fold lower affinity than a wild type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB as determined in an ELISA assay.","The immunoglobulin comprising the variant Fc regions may be analyzed at any point using a surface plasmon based resonance based assay, e.g., BIAcore, for defining the kinetic parameters of the Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction, using methods disclosed herein and known to those of skill in the art. Preferably, the Kd of a variant Fc region of the invention for binding to a monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA as determined by BIAcore analysis is about 100 nM, preferably about 70 nM, most preferably about 40 nM; and the Kd of the variant Fc region of the invention for binding a dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB is about 80 nM, about 100 nM, more preferably about 200 nM.","In most preferred embodiments, the immunoglobulin comprising the variant Fc regions is further characterized in an animal model for interaction with an Fc\u03b3R. Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for example, transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,397, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIA; nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; nude knockout Fc\u03b3RIIIA mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIA.","5.2.1 Fc\u03b3R-Fc Binding Assay","An Fc\u03b3R-Fc binding assay was developed for determining the binding of the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions to Fc\u03b3R, which allowed detection and quantitation of the interaction, despite the inherently weak affinity of the receptor for its ligand, e.g., in the micromolar range for Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA. The method involves the formation of an Fc\u03b3R complex that has an improved avidity for an Fc region, relative to an uncomplexed Fc\u03b3R. According to the invention, the preferred molecular complex is a tetrameric immune complex, comprising: (a) the soluble region of Fc\u03b3R (e.g., the soluble region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB); (b) a biotinylated 15 amino acid AVITAG sequence (AVITAG) operably linked to the C-terminus of the soluble region of Fc\u03b3R (e.g., the soluble region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB); and (c) streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE); in a molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complex (preferably in a 5:1 molar ratio). According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fusion protein is biotinylated enzymatically, using for example, the Bir A enzyme, a biotin ligase which specifically biotinylates a lysine residue in the 15 amino acid AVITAG sequence. In a specific embodiment of the invention, 85% of the fusion protein is biotinylated, as determined by standard methods known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to streptavidin shift assay. According to preferred embodiments of the invention, the biotinylated soluble Fc\u03b3R proteins are mixed with SA-PE in a 1\u00d7SA-PE:5\u00d7 biotinylated soluble Fc\u03b3R molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complex.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, polypeptides comprising Fc regions bind the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes, formed according to the methods of the invention, with at least an 8-fold higher affinity than the monomeric uncomplexed Fc\u03b3R. The binding of polypeptides comprising Fc regions to the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes may be determined using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as for example, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), radioimmunoassays, ELISA assays, etc.","The invention encompasses the use of the immune complexes formed according to the methods described above, for determining the functionality of molecules comprising an Fc region in cell-based or cell-free assays.","As a matter of convenience, the reagents may be provided in an assay kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents for assaying the ability of molecules comprising variant Fc regions to bind Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes. Other forms of molecular complexes for use in determining Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions are also contemplated for use in the methods of the invention, e.g., fusion proteins formed as described in U.S. Provisional Application 60\/439,709, filed on Jan. 13, 2003; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","5.2.2 Mutagenesis and Construction of Yeast Display Libraries","An initial library of molecules comprising variant Fc regions is produced using any random based mutagenesis techniques known in the art. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that amino acid sequence variants of Fc regions may be obtained by any mutagenesis technique known to those skilled in the art. Some of these techniques are briefly described herein, however, it will be recognized that alternative procedures may produce an equivalent result. In a preferred embodiment molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions are prepared by error-prone PCR as exemplified in Example 6, infra (See Leung et al., 19891:11). It is especially preferred to have error rates of 2-3 bp\/Kb for use in the methods of the invention. In one embodiment, using error prone PCR a mutation frequency of 2-3 mutations\/kb is obtained.","Mutagenesis may be performed in accordance with any of the techniques known in the art including, but not limited to, synthesizing an oligonucleotide having one or more modifications within the sequence of the Fc region of an antibody or a polypeptide comprising an Fc region (e.g., the CH2 or CH3 domain) to be modified. Site-specific mutagenesis allows the production of mutants through the use of specific oligonucleotide sequences which encode the DNA sequence of the desired mutation, as well as a sufficient number of adjacent nucleotides, to provide a primer sequence of sufficient size and sequence complexity to form a stable duplex on both sides of the deletion junction being traversed. Typically, a primer of about 30 to about 45 nucleotides or more in length is preferred, with about 10 to about 25 or more residues on both sides of the junction of the sequence being altered. A number of such primers introducing a variety of different mutations at one or more positions may be used to generate a library of mutants.","The technique of site-specific mutagenesis is well known in the art, as exemplified by various publications (see, e.g., Kunkel et al., 154:367-82, 1987, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In general, site-directed mutagenesis is performed by first obtaining a single-stranded vector or melting apart of two strands of a double stranded vector which includes within its sequence a DNA sequence which encodes the desired peptide. An oligonucleotide primer bearing the desired mutated sequence is prepared, generally synthetically. This primer is then annealed with the single-stranded vector, and subjected to DNA polymerizing enzymes such as T7 DNA polymerase, in order to complete the synthesis of the mutation-bearing strand. Thus, a heteroduplex is formed wherein one strand encodes the original non-mutated sequence and the second strand bears the desired mutation. This heteroduplex vector is then used to transform or transfect appropriate cells, such as cells, and clones are selected which include recombinant vectors bearing the mutated sequence arrangement. As will be appreciated, the technique typically employs a phage vector which exists in both a single stranded and double stranded form. Typical vectors useful in site-directed mutagenesis include vectors such as the M13 phage. These phage are readily commercially available and their use is generally well known to those skilled in the art. Double stranded plasmids are also routinely employed in site directed mutagenesis which eliminates the step of transferring the gene of interest from a plasmid to a phage.","Alternatively, the use of PCR\u2122 with commercially available thermostable enzymes such as Taq DNA polymerase may be used to incorporate a mutagenic oligonucleotide primer into an amplified DNA fragment that can then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression vector. See, e.g., Tomic et al., 18(6):1656, 1987, and Upender et al., 18(1):29-30, 32, 1995, for PCR\u2122-mediated mutagenesis procedures, which are hereby incorporated in their entireties. PCR\u2122 employing a thermostable ligase in addition to a thermostable polymerase may also be used to incorporate a phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide into an amplified DNA fragment that may then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression vector (see e.g., Michael, 16(3):410-2, 1994, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)","Another method for preparing variants for use in the invention, is cassette mutagenesis based on the technique described by Wells et al. (198534: 315). The starting material is the plasmid comprising the desired DNA encoding the protein to be mutated (e.g., the DNA encoding a polypeptide comprising an Fc region). The codon(s) in the DNA sequence to be mutated are identified; there must be a unique restriction endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutations site(s). If no such restriction site exits, it may be generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis. After the restriction sites have been introduced into the plasmid, the plasmid is cut at these sites and linearized. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between the restriction sites but containing the mutation is synthesized using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. The double stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to have 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends that are compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid, such that it can be directly ligated to the plasmid.","Other methods known to those of skill in the art for producing sequence variants of the Fc region of an antibody or polypeptides comprising an Fc region can be used. For example, recombinant vectors encoding the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of an antibody or a fragment thereof may be treated with mutagenic agents, such as hydroxylamine, to obtain sequence variants.","Once a mutant library is produced according to the methods described, the mutagenized library is transformed into a yeast strain, preferably EBY100 (Invitrogen), MATa ura3-52 trpl leu2\u0394l his3\u0394200 pep4::HIS3 prb1\u03941.6R can1 GAL::GAL-AGA1 using a standard lithium acetate transformation protocol known to those skilled in the art (ref).","It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, that once molecules of the invention with desired binding properties (e.g., molecules with variant Fc regions with at least one amino acid modification, which modification enhances the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA relative to a comparable molecule, comprising a wild-type Fc region) have been identified (See Section 5.1 and Table 2) according to the methods of the invention, other molecules (i.e, therapeutic antibodies) may be engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques and any known mutagenesis techniques, as described in this section to produce engineered molecules carrying the identified mutation sites.","5.2.3 Yeast Surface Display","The preferred method for screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities (i.e., enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIIA affinity and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA) is yeast surface display technology (for review see Boder and Wittrup, 2000328: 430-444, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) which addresses the deficiency in the prior art for screening binding interactions of extracellular post-translationally modified proteins. Specifically, the yeast surface display is a genetic method whereby polypeptides comprising Fc mutants are expressed on the yeast cell wall in a form accessible for interacting with Fc\u03b3R. Yeast surface display of the mutant Fc containing polypeptides of the invention may be performed in accordance with any of the techniques known to those skilled in the art. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,423,538; 6,114,147; and 6,300,065, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. See Boder et al., 1997 15:553-7; Boder et al., 1998 14:55-62; Boder et al., 2000 328:430-44; Boder et al., 2000 2000, 97:10701-5; Shusta et al., 1998 1998, 16:773-7; Shusta et al., 1999 292:949-56; Shusta et al., 1999 10:117-22; Shusta et al., 2000 18:754-9; Wittrup et al., 1994 745:321-30; Wittrup et al., 1994 16:206-13; Wittrup, 1995 6:203-8; Wittrup, 1999 17:423-4; Wittrup, 2000 18:1039-40; Wittrup, 2001 12:395-9.","The invention provides methods for constructing an Fc mutant library in yeast for displaying molecules comprising Fc regions, which have been mutated as described in Section 5.2.2. Preferably, the Fc mutant libraries for use in the methods of the invention contain at least 10cells, up to 10cells. One exemplary method for constructing a Fc library for use in the methods of the invention comprises the following: nucleic acids encoding molecules comprising Fc regions are cloned into the multiple cloning site of a vector derived from a yeast replicating vector, e.g., pCT302; such that the Fc encoding nucleic acids are expressed under the control of the GAL1 galactose-inducible promoter and in-frame with a nucleotide sequence encoding Aga2p, the mating agglutinin cell wall protein. In a preferred embodiment, nucleic acids encoding molecules comprising Fc regions are cloned C-terminal to the Aga2p coding region, such that a Fc-region Aga2p fusion protein is encoded. A fusion protein comprising the Aga2p protein and polypeptides comprising Fc regions will be secreted extracellularly and displayed on the cell wall via disulfide linkage to the Aga1p protein, an integral cell wall protein, using the preferred construct of the invention. In an alternative embodiment, the constructs may further comprise nucleotide sequences encoding epitope tags. Any epitope tag nucleotide coding sequence known to those skilled in the art can be used in accordance with the invention, including, but not limited to nucleotide sequences encoding hemagglutinin (HA), c-myc Xpress TAG, His-TAG, or V5TAG. The presence of the fusion protein on the yeast cell surface may be detected using FACS analysis, confocal fluorescence microscopy or standard immunostaining methods, all of which are known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the presence of the Fc fusion proteins of the invention on the yeast cell surface are detected using Fc-specific monoclonal antibodies (CH3 specific), including but not limited to IgG1 Fc-specific monoclonal antibody, HP6017 (Sigma), JL512 (Immunotech), and any antibody disclosed in Partridge et al., 198623 (12): 1365-72, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In another embodiment, the presence of the Fc fusion proteins of the invention are detected by immunofluorescent labeling of epitope tags using techniques known to those skilled in the art. It is particularly useful in the methods of the invention, to use nucleotide sequences encoding epitope tags to flank the nucleic acids encoding the Fc fusion proteins, as an internal control, to detect if the fusion proteins are displayed on the cell wall in a partially proteolyzed form.","5.2.4 Screening of Yeast Display Libraries","The invention encompasses screening the yeast display libraries using immunological based assays including but not limited to cell based assays, solution based assays, and solid phase based assays.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses identification of Fc mutants with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities using affinity maturation methods which are known to those skilled in the art and encompassed herein. Briefly, affinity maturation creates novel alleles by randomly recombining individual mutations present in a mutant library, see, e.g., Hawkins et al., 1992226: 889-896; Stemmer et al., 1994 370: 389-91; both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. It has been used successfully to increase the affinity of antibodies, T cell receptors and other proteins. The invention encompasses using mutations that show increased Fc\u03b3R binding as a baseline to construct new mutant libraries with enhanced phenotypes. Using the methods of the invention, a population of IgG1 Fc mutants enriched by yeast surface display for increased binding to an Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, may be selected. Following DNA preparation, Fc regions can be amplified by PCR using flanking primers that selectively amplify the mutated region of the Fc, which is about \u02dc700 bp using methods known to one skilled in the art and exemplified or disclosed herein. Novel mutants can thus be constructed by reshuffling of mutations in the Fc region for example via DNAseI treatment of the amplified DNA and isolation of fragments using methods such as those disclosed by Stemmer et al., 1994 91: 10747-51, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fragments can then be religated, PCR amplified with nested primers and cloned into the yeast display vector, e.g., pYD1 using methods known to one skilled in the art. The recombined library can then be reselected in the yeast Fc display screen. As the Kdecreases, below 10 nM, conditions can be established to allow for further increases in affinity based on the reduction of the off rate of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA ligand from the Fc receptor using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in Boder et al., 199814: 55-62, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The invention encompasses a kinetic screen of the yeast library. A kinetic screen may be established by labeling of the Fc displaying cells to saturation with a labeled ligand, e.g., a fluorescent ligand followed by incubation with an excess of non-labeled ligand for a predetermined period. After termination of the reaction by the addition of excess buffer (e.g., 1\u00d7PBS, 0.5 mg\/ml BSA) cells will be analyzed by FACS and sort gates set for selection. After each round of enrichment individual mutants can be tested for fold increases in affinity and sequenced for diversity. The in vitro recombination process can be repeated. In some embodiments, the in vitro is repeated at least 3 times.","Selection of the Fc variants of the invention may be done using any Fc\u03b3R including but not limited to polymorphic variants of Fc\u03b3R. In some embodiments, selection of the Fc variants is done using a polymorphic variant of Fc\u03b3RIIIA which contains a phenylalanine at position 158. In other embodiments, selection of the Fc variants is done using a polymorphic variant of Fc\u03b3RIIIA which contains a valine at position 158. Fc\u03b3RIIIA 158V displays a higher affinity for IgG1 than 158F and an increased ADCC activity (see, e.g., Koene et al., 199790:1109-14; Wu et al., 1997100: 1059-70, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties); this residue in fact directly interacts with the lower hinge region of IgG1 as recently shown by IgG1-Fc\u03b3RIIIA co-crystallization studies, see, e.g., Sonderman et al., 2000100: 1059-70, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Studies have shown that in some cases therapeutic antibodies have improved efficacy in Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158V homozygous patients. For example, humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab was therapeutically more effective in Fc\u03b3RIIIA158V homozygous patients compared to Fc\u03b3RIIIA 158F homozygous patients (See, e.g., Cartron et al., 2002 99(3): 754-8). Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, selection of Fc variants of the invention with Fc\u03b3RIIIA 158F allotype may provide for variants that once engineered into therapeutic antibodies will be clinically more efficacious for Fc\u03b3RIIIA 158F homozygous patients.","The invention encompasses screening yeast libraries based on Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion and Fc\u03b3RIIIA selection so that Fc mutants are selected that not only have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA but also have a reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB. Yeast libraries may be enriched for clones that have a reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB by sequential depletion methods, for example, by incubating the yeast library with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion is preferably carried out sequentially so that the library is enriched in clones that have a reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB. In some embodiments, the Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion step results in a population of cells so that only 30%, preferably only 10%, more preferably only 5%, most preferably less than 1% bind Fc\u03b3RIIB. In some embodiments, Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion is carried out in at least 3 cycles, at least 4 cycles, at least 6 cycles. The Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion step is preferably combined with an Fc\u03b3RIIIA selection step, for example using FACS sorting so that Fc variants with an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA are selected.","5.2.4.1 FACS Assays; Solid Phased Assays and Immunological Based Assays","The invention encompasses characterization of the mutant Fc fusion proteins that are displayed on the yeast surface cell wall, according to the methods described in Section 5.2.3. One aspect of the invention provides a method for selecting mutant Fc fusion proteins with a desirable binding property, specifically, the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for selecting mutant Fc fusion proteins with a desirable binding property, specifically, the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, and further the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, that the methods of the invention can be used for identifying and screening any mutations in the Fc regions of molecules, with any desired binding characteristic.","Yeast cells displaying the mutant Fc fusion proteins can be screened and characterized by any biochemical or immunological based assays known to those skilled in the art for assessing binding interactions.","Preferably, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), using any of the techniques known to those skilled in the art, is used for screening the mutant Fc fusion proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface for binding Fc\u03b3RIIIA, preferably the Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex, or optionally Fc\u03b3RIIB. Flow sorters are capable of rapidly examining a large number of individual cells that contain library inserts (e.g., 10-100 million cells per hour) (Shapiro et al., 1995). Additionally, specific parameters used for optimization including, but not limited to, ligand concentration (i.e., Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex), kinetic competition time, or FACS stringency may be varied in order to select for the cells which display Fc fusion proteins with specific binding properties, e.g., higher affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA compared to a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region. Flow cytometers for sorting and examining biological cells are well known in the art. Known flow cytometers are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,347,935; 5,464,581; 5,483,469; 5,602,039; 5,643,796; and 6,211,477; the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Other known flow cytometers are the FACS Vantage\u2122 system manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company, and the COPAS\u2122 system manufactured by Union Biometrica.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, yeast cells are analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). In most preferred embodiments, the FACS analysis of the yeast cells is done in an iterative manner, at least twice, at least three times, or at least 5 times. Between each round of selection cells are regrown and induced so the Fc regions are displayed on the maximum number of yeast cell surfaces. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mode of action, this iterative process helps enrich the population of the cells with a particular phenotype, e.g., high binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA.","In preferred embodiments, screening for Fc variants of the invention comprises a selection process that has multiple rounds of screening, e.g., at least two rounds of screening. In one embodiment, screening for Fc variants that have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA may comprise the following steps: in the first round of screening, a library of yeast cells, e.g., a na\u00efve library of 10cells is enriched by FACS, preferably in an iterative manner, using for example labeled tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to select for Fc variants that have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA; the variant Fc region that is selected with the desired phenotype, e.g., enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, is then introduced into an antibody, e.g., a 4-4-20 antibody, and the engineered antibody is assayed using a secondary screen, e.g., ELISA for binding to an Fc\u03b3R. In the second round of screening, a single mutation library may be generated based on the first screen so that the Fc region harbors the variant displaying the enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA; and enriched by FACS using for example labeled monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA in both the presence and absence of unlabeled receptor; and the variant Fc region is then introduced into an antibody, e.g., a 4-4-20 antibody, and the engineered antibody is assayed using a secondary screen, e.g., ELISA for binding to an Fc\u03b3R. In some embodiments, the secondary screen may further comprise characterizing the antibodies comprising Fc variants in an ADCC or BIAcore based assay using methods disclosed herein","The invention encompasses FACS screening of the mutant yeast library under equilibrium or kinetic conditions. When the screening is performed under equilibrium conditions, an excess of the yeast library carrying Fc mutants is incubated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA, preferably labeled Fc\u03b3RIIIA at a concentration 5-10 fold below the Kd, for at least one hour to allow binding of Fc mutants to Fc\u03b3RIIIA under equilibrium conditions. When the screening is performed under kinetic conditions, the mutant yeast library is incubated with labeled Fc\u03b3RIIIA; the cells are then incubated with equimolar unlabeled Fc\u03b3RIIIA for a pre-selected time, bound Fc\u03b3RIIIA is then monitored.","One exemplary method of analyzing the yeast cells expressing mutant Fc fusion proteins with FACS is costaining the cells with Fc\u03b3RIIIA-tetrameric complex which has been labeled with a fluorescent label such as, PE and an anti-Fc antibody, such as F(ab)anti-Fc which has been fluorescently labeled. Fluorescence measurements of a yeast library produced according to the methods of the invention preferably involves comparisons with controls; for example, yeast cells that lack the insert encoding molecules comprising an Fc region (negative control). The flow sorter has the ability not only to measure fluorescence signals in cells at a rapid rate, but also to collect cells that have specified fluorescent properties. This feature may be employed in a preferred embodiment of the invention to enrich the initial library population for cells expressing Fc fusion proteins with specific binding characteristics, e.g., higher affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA compared to a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, yeast cells are analyzed by FACS and sort gates established to select for cells that show the highest affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA relative to the amount of Fc expression on the yeast cell surface. According to a preferred embodiment, four consecutive sorts are established, wherein the gates for each successive sort is 5.5%, 1%, 0.2%, and 0.1%. It is preferred that the yeast display library formed according to the methods of the invention be over-sampled by at least 10-fold to improve the probability of isolating rare clones (e.g., analyze \u02dc10cells from a library of 10clones). Alternatively, 2-5 sorts are established to select for cells of the desired phenotype. Sort gates can be established empirically by one skilled in the art.","In other preferred embodiments, mutant Fc fusion proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface are screened using solid phase based assays, for example assays using magnetic beads, e.g., supplied by Dynal, preferably in a high through put manner for binding to an Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA. In one embodiment, magnetic bead assays may be used to identify mutants with enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB. An exemplary assay to identify mutants with enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB may comprise selecting mutants by a sequential solid phase depletion using magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB followed by selection with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA. For example one assay may comprise the following steps: incubating the library of yeast cells generated in accordance with the methods of the invention with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB; separating yeast cells bound to beads from the non bound fraction by placing the mixture in a magnetic field, removing the non-bound yeast cells and placing them in a fresh media; binding the yeast cells to beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA, separating yeast cells bound to beads from the non bound fraction by placing the mixture in a magnetic field, removing the non-bound yeast cells; removing the bound cells by rigorous vortexing; growing the recovered cells in glucose containing media; re-inducing in selective media containing galactose. The selection process is repeated at least once. Inserts containing the Fc domain are then amplified using common methodologies known in the art, e.g., PCR, and introduced into an antibody by methods already described for further characterization.","In an alternative embodiment, a non-yeast based system is used to characterize the binding properties of the molecules of the invention. One exemplary system for characterizing the molecules of the invention comprises a mammalian expression vector containing the heavy chain of the anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody 4-4-20, into which the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions are cloned. The resulting recombinant clone is expressed in a mammalian host cell line (i.e., human kidney cell line 293H), and the resulting recombinant immunoglobulin is analyzed for binding to Fc\u03b3R using any standard assay known to those in the art, including but not limited to ELISA and FACS.","Molecules of the present invention (e.g., antibodies, fusion proteins, conjugated molecules) may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular, molecules of the invention comprising modified Fc regions may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to a ligand, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex. Such an assay may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten, 13:412-421, 1992), on beads (Lam, 354:82-84, 1991, on chips (Fodor, 364:555-556, 1993), on bacteria (U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on spores (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), on plasmids (Cull et al., 89:1865-1869, 1992) or on phage (Scott and Smith, 249:386-390, 1990; Devlin, 249:404-406, 1990; Cwirla et al., 87:6378-6382, 1990; and Felici, 222:301-310, 1991) (each of these references is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Molecules that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to an ligand, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for the ligand.","Molecules of the invention that have been engineered to comprise modified Fc regions (e.g., therapeutic antibodies) or have been identified in the yeast display system to have the desired phenotype (see Section 5.1) may be assayed for immunospecific binding to an antigen (e.g., cancer antigen and cross-reactivity with other antigens (e.g., Fc\u03b3R) by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding and cross-reactivity include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","The binding affinity of the molecules of the present invention comprising modified Fc regions to a ligand, e.g., Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complex and the off-rate of the interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled ligand, such as tetrameric Fc\u03b3R (e.g., H or I) with a molecule of interest (e.g., molecules of the present invention comprising modified Fc regions) in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ligand, such as tetrameric Fc\u03b3R, and the detection of the molecule bound to the labeled ligand. The affinity of the molecule of the present invention for the ligand and the binding off-rates can be determined from the saturation data by scatchard analysis.","In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of molecules of the present invention to a ligand such as Fc\u03b3R. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of a ligand from chips with immobilized molecules (e.g., molecules comprising modified Fc regions) on their surface.","5.2.5 Sequencing of Mutants","Any of a variety of sequencing reactions known in the art can be used to directly sequence the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions. Examples of sequencing reactions include those based on techniques developed by Maxim and Gilbert (74:560, 1977) or Sanger (74:5463, 1977). It is also contemplated that any of a variety of automated sequencing procedures can be utilized (19:448, 1995), including sequencing by mass spectrometry (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 94\/16101, Cohen et al., 36:127-162, 1996, and Griffin et al., 38:147-159, 1993).","5.2.6 Functional Assays of Molecules with Variant Fc Regions","The invention encompasses characterization of the molecules of the invention (e.g., an antibody comprising a variant Fc region identified by the yeast display technology described supra; or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention) using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effector cell function of the molecules. In particular, the invention encompasses characterizing the molecules of the invention for Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector cell function. Examples of effector cell functions that can be assayed in accordance with the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Any cell-based or cell free assay known to those skilled in the art for determining effector cell function activity can be used (For effector cell assays, see Perussia et al., 2000121: 179-92; Baggiolini et al., 1998 44(10): 841-8; Lehmann et al., 2000 243(1-2): 229-42; Brown E J. 199445: 147-64; Munn et al., 1990 172: 231-237, Abdul-Majid et al., 2002 55: 70-81; Ding et al., 19988:403-411, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes. Alternatively, the Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention may be assayed in other phagocytes, e.g., neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes; PMN); human peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, which can be obtained using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art (e.g., see Brown E J. 199445: 147-164). In one embodiment, the function of the molecules of the invention is characterized by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described (Tridandapani et al., 2000275: 20480-7). For example, an exemplary assay for measuring phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions with enhanced affinities for Fc\u03b3RIIIA, comprises of: treating THP-1 cells with a molecule of the invention or with a control antibody that does not bind to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, comparing the activity levels of said cells, wherein a difference in the activities of the cells (e.g., rosetting activity (the number of THP-1 cells binding IgG-coated SRBC), adherence activity (the total number of SRBC bound to THP-1 cells), and phagocytic rate) would indicate the functionality of the molecule of the invention. It can be appreciated by one skilled in the art that this exemplary assay can be used to assay any of the molecules identified by the methods of the invention.","Another exemplary assay for determining the phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention is an antibody-dependent opsonophagocytosis assay (ADCP) which can comprise the following: coating a target bioparticle such as -labeled FITC (Molecular Probes) or -FITC with (i) wild-type 4-4-20 antibody, an antibody to fluorescein (See Bedzyk et al., 1989264(3): 1565-1569, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), as the control antibody for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP; or (ii) 4-4-20 antibody harboring the D265A mutation that knocks out binding to Fc\u03b3RIII, as a background control for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP (iii) 4-4-20 antibody carrying variant Fc regions identified by the methods of the invention and produced as exemplified in Example 6.6; and forming the opsonized particle; adding any of the osponized particles described (i-iii) to THP-1 effector cells (a monocytic cell line available from ATCC) in a 60:1 ratio to allow Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis to occur; preferably incubating the cells and -FITC\/antibody at 37\u00b0 C. for 1.5 hour; adding trypan blue after incubation (preferably at room temperature for 2-3 min.) to the cells to quench the fluorescence of the bacteria that are adhered to the outside of the cell surface without being internalized; transferring cells into a FACS buffer (e.g., 0.1%, BSA in PBS, 0.1%, sodium azide), analyzing the fluorescence of the THP1 cells using FACS (e.g., BD FACS Calibur). Preferably, the THP-1 cells used in the assay are analyzed by FACS for expression of Fc\u03b3R on the cell surface. THP-1 cells express both CD32A and CD64. CD64 is a high affinity Fc\u03b3R that is blocked in conducting the ADCP assay in accordance with the methods of the invention. The THP-1 cells are preferably blocked with 100 \u03bcg\/mL soluble IgG1 or 10% human serum. To analyze the extent of ADCP, the gate is preferably set on THP-1 cells and median fluorescence intensity is measured. The ADCP activity for individual mutants is calculated and reported as a normalized value to the wild type chMab 4-4-20 obtained. The opsonized particles are added to THP-1 cells such that the ratio of the opsonized particles to THP-1 cells is 30:1 or 60:1. In most preferred embodiments, the ADCP assay is conducted with controls, such as -FITC in medium, -FITC and THP-1 cells (to serve as Fc\u03b3R-independent ADCP activity), -FITC, THP-1 cells and wild-type 4-4-20 antibody (to serve as Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP activity), -FITC, THP-1 cells, 4-4-20 D265A (to serve as the background control for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP activity).","In another embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc\u03b3R-mediated ADCC activity in effector cells, e.g., natural killer cells, using any of the standard methods known to those skilled in the art (See e.g., Perussia et al., 2000121: 179-92). An exemplary assay for determining ADCC activity of the molecules of the invention is based on a Cr release assay comprising of: labeling target cells with [Cr]NaCrO(this cell-membrane permeable molecule is commonly used for labeling since it binds cytoplasmic proteins and although spontaneously released from the cells with slow kinetics, it is released massively following target cell necrosis); osponizing the target cells with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions; combining the opsonized radiolabeled target cells with effector cells in a microtitre plate at an appropriate ratio of target cells to effector cells; incubating the mixture of cells for 16-18 hours at 37\u00b0 C.; collecting supernatants; and analyzing radioactivity. The cytotoxicity of the molecules of the invention can then be determined, for example using the following formula: % lysis=(experimental cpm\u2212target leak cpm)\/(detergent lysis cpm\u2212target leak cpm)\u00d7100%. Alternatively, % lysis=(ADCC\u2212AICC)\/(maximum release\u2212spontaneous release). Specific lysis can be calculated using the formula: specific lysis=% lysis with the molecules of the invention\u2212% lysis in the absence of the molecules of the invention. A graph can be generated by varying either the target:effector cell ratio or antibody concentration.","In yet another embodiment, the molecules of the invention are characterized for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) see, e.g., Ding et al., 1998, 8:403-11; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Preferably, the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention are peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that are preferably purified from normal human blood, using standard methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g., using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Preferred effector cells for use in the methods of the invention express different Fc\u03b3R activating receptors. The invention encompasses, effector cells, THP-1, expressing Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, and monocyte derived primary macrophages derived from whole human blood expressing both Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, to determine if Fc antibody mutants show increased ADCC activity and phagocytosis relative to wild type IgG1 antibodies.","The human monocyte cell line, THP-1, activates phagocytosis through expression of the high affinity receptor Fc\u03b3RI and the low affinity receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA (Fleit et al., 1991, J. Leuk. Biol. 49: 556). THP-1 cells do not constitutively express Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB. Stimulation of these cells with cytokines effects the FcR expression pattern (Pricop et al., 2000 J. Immunol. 166: 531-7). Growth of THP-1 cells in the presence of the cytokine IL4 induces Fc\u03b3RIIB expression and causes a reduction in Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RI expression. Fc\u03b3RIIB expression can also be enhanced by increased cell density (Tridandapani et al., 2002277: 5082-9). In contrast, it has been reported that IFN\u03b3 can lead to expression of Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Pearse et al., 1993 90: 4314-8). The presence or absence of receptors on the cell surface can be determined by FACS using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Cytokine induced expression of Fc\u03b3R on the cell surface provides a system to test both activation and inhibition in the presence of Fc\u03b3RIIB. If THP-1 cells are unable to express the Fc\u03b3RIIB the invention also encompasses another human monocyte cell line, U937. These cells have been shown to terminally differentiate into macrophages in the presence of IFN\u03b3 and TNF (Koren et al., 1979279: 328-331).","Fc\u03b3R dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models (Clynes et al., 199895: 652-656). The invention encompasses the use of elutriated monocytes from donors as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in both phagocytosis and ADCC assays. Expression patterns of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIIB are affected by different growth conditions. Fc\u03b3R expression from frozen elutriated monocytes, fresh elutriated monocytes, monocytes maintained in 10% FBS, and monocytes cultured in FBS+GM-CSF and or in human serum may be determined using common methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, cells can be stained with Fc\u03b3R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine FcR profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc\u03b3R expression is then used for the methods of the invention.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of mouse cells especially when human cells with the right Fc\u03b3R profiles are unable to be obtained. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7(ATCC) which can be transfected with human Fc\u03b3RIIIA and stable transfectants isolated using methods known in the art, see, e.g., Ralph et al., 119: 950-4). Transfectants can be quantitated for Fc\u03b3RIIIA expression by FACS analysis using routine experimentation and high expressors can be used in the ADCC assays of the invention. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses isolation of spleen peritoneal macrophage expressing human Fc\u03b3R from knockout transgenic mice such as those disclosed herein.","Lymphocytes may be harvested from peripheral blood of donors (PBM) using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Within the isolated mononuclear population of cells the majority of the ADCC activity occurs via the natural killer cells (NK) containing Fc\u03b3RIIIA but not Fc\u03b3RIIB on their surface. Results with these cells indicate the efficacy of the mutants on triggering NK cell ADCC and establish the reagents to test with elutriated monocytes.","Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include, but are not limited to, breast cancer cell lines, e.g., SK-BR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-30 (see, e.g., Tremp et al., 197633-41); B-lymphocytes; cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma, e.g., Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL-86 (see, e.g., Epstein et al., 196534: 231-240), and Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL-213 (see, e.g., Klein et al., 196828: 1300-10). The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the immunoglobulin to be assayed.","The ADCC assay is based on the ability of NK cells to mediate cell death via an apoptotic pathway. NK cells mediate cell death in part by Fc\u03b3RIIIA's recognition of IgG bound to an antigen on a cell surface. The ADCC assays used in accordance with the methods of the invention may be radioactive based assays or fluorescence based assays. The ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises labeling target cells, e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji, Daudi cells, opsonizing target cells with an antibody that recognizes a cell surface receptor on the target cell via its antigen binding site; combining the labeled opsonized target cells and the effector cells at an appropriate ratio, which can be determined by routine experimentation; harvesting the cells; detecting the label in the supernatant of the lysed target cells, using an appropriate detection scheme based on the label used. The target cells may be labeled either with a radioactive label or a fluorescent label, using standard methods known in the art. For example the labels include, but are not limited to, [Cr]NaCrO; and the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (TDA).","In a specific preferred embodiment, a time resolved fluorimetric assay is used for measuring ADCC activity against target cells that have been labeled with the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (TDA). Such fluorimetric assays are known in the art, e.g., see, Blomberg et al., 1996193: 199-206; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, target cells are labeled with the membrane permeable acetoxymethyl diester of TDA (bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate, (BATDA), which rapidly diffuses across the cell membrane of viable cells. Intracellular esterases split off the ester groups and the regenerated membrane impermeable TDA molecule is trapped inside the cell. After incubation of effector and target cells, e.g., for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% CO, the TDA released from the lysed target cells is chelated with Eu3+ and the fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac).","In another specific embodiment, the ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises the following steps: Preferably 4\u22125\u00d710target cells (e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji cells) are labeled with bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-t-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (DELFIA BATDA Reagent, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). For optimal labeling efficiency, the number of target cells used in the ADCC assay should preferably not exceed 5\u00d710. BATDA reagent is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. preferably under 5% CO, for at least 30 minutes. The cells are then washed with a physiological buffer, e.g., PBS with 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole, and media containing 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole. The labeled target cells are then opsonized (coated) with a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region, i.e., an immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region of the invention, including, but not limited to, a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody, a bispecific antibody, a multi-specific antibody, a humanized antibody, or a chimeric antibody. In preferred embodiments, the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is specific for a cell surface receptor, a tumor antigen, or a cancer antigen. The immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may specifically bind any cancer or tumor antigen, such as those listed in section 5.4. Additionally, the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may be any therapeutic antibody specific for a cancer antigen, such as those listed in section 5.4. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is an anti-fluoresceine monoclonal antibody, 4-4-20 (Kranz et al., 1982 257(12): 6987-6995) a mouse-human chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody 2H7 (Liu et al., 1987139: 3521-6); or a humanized antibody (Ab4D5) against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (p185 HER2) (Carter et al. (199289: 4285-9). The target cells in the ADCC assay are chosen according to the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention has been introduced so that the immunoglobulin binds a cell surface receptor of the target cell specifically. Preferably, the ADCC assays of the invention are performed using more than one engineered antibody, e.g., anti Her2\/neu, 4-4-20, 2B6, Rituxan, and 2H7, harboring the Fc variants of the invention. In a most preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the invention are introduced into at least 3 antibodies and their ADCC activities is tested. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, examining at least 3 antibodies in these functional assays will diminish the chance of eliminating a viable Fc mutation erroneously.","Opsonized target cells are added to effector cells, e.g., PBMC, to produce effector:target ratios of approximately 50:1, 75:1, or 100:1. In a specific embodiment, when the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region has the variable domain of 4-4-20, the effector:target is 75:1. The effector and target cells are incubated for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% CO. Cell supernatants are harvested and added to an acidic europium solution (e.g., DELFIA Europium Solution, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). The fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). Maximal release (MR) and spontaneous release (SR) are determined by incubation of target cells with 1% TX-100 and media alone, respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity (AICC) is measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of antibody. Each assay is preferably performed in triplicate. The mean percentage specific lysis is calculated as: Experimental release (ADCC)\u2212AICC)\/(MR\u2212SR)\u00d7100.","5.2.7 Other Assays","The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions may also be assayed using any surface plasmon resonance based assays known in the art for characterizing the kinetic parameters of Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction binding. Any SPR instrument commercially available including, but not limited to, BIAcore Instruments, available from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden); IAsys instruments available from Affinity Sensors (Franklin, Mass.); IBIS system available from Windsor Scientific Limited (Berks, UK), SPR-CELLIA systems available from Nippon Laser and Electronics Lab (Hokkaido, Japan), and SPR Detector Spreeta available from Texas Instruments (Dallas, Tex.) can be used in the instant invention. For a review of SPR-based technology see Mullet et al., 200022: 77-91; Dong et al., 200282: 303-23; Fivash et al., 19989: 97-101; Rich et al., 200011: 54-61; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Additionally, any of the SPR instruments and SPR based methods for measuring protein-protein interactions described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,373,577; 6,289,286; 5,322,798; 5,341,215; 6,268,125 are contemplated in the methods of the invention, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Briefly, SPR based assays involve immobilizing a member of a binding pair on a surface, and monitoring its interaction with the other member of the binding pair in solution in real time. SPR is based on measuring the change in refractive index of the solvent near the surface that occurs upon complex formation or dissociation. The surface onto which the immobilization occur is the sensor chip, which is at the heart of the SPR technology; it consists of a glass surface coated with a thin layer of gold and forms the basis for a range of specialized surfaces designed to optimize the binding of a molecule to the surface. A variety of sensor chips are commercially available especially from the companies listed supra, all of which may be used in the methods of the invention. Examples of sensor chips include those available from BIAcore AB, Inc., e.g., Sensor Chip CM5, SA, NTA, and HPA. A molecule of the invention may be immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip using any of the immobilization methods and chemistries known in the art, including but not limited to, direct covalent coupling via amine groups, direct covalent coupling via sulfhydryl groups, biotin attachment to avidin coated surface, aldehyde coupling to carbohydrate groups, and attachment through the histidine tag with NTA chips.","In some embodiments, the kinetic parameters of the binding of molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions, e.g., immunoglobulins comprising variant Fc region, to an Fc\u03b3R may be determined using a BIAcore instrument (e.g., BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). Any Fc\u03b3R can be used to assess the interaction with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions. In a specific embodiment the Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIIA, preferably a soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA. For example, in one embodiment, the soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA is the extracellular region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA joined to the linker-AVITAG sequence (see, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/439,498, filed on Jan. 9, 2003 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/456,041 filed on Mar. 19, 2003, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). In another specific embodiment, the Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIB, preferably a soluble dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB. For example in one embodiment, the soluble dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB protein is prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional application No. 60\/439,709 filed on Jan. 13, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An exemplary assay for determining the kinetic parameters of a molecule comprising a variant Fc region, wherein the molecule is the 4-4-20 antibody, to an Fc\u03b3R using a BIAcore instrument comprises the following: BSA-FITC is immobilized on one of the four flow cells of a sensor chip surface, preferably through amine coupling chemistry such that about 5000 response units (RU) of BSA-FITC is immobilized on the surface. Once a suitable surface is prepared, 4-4-20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations are passed over the surface, preferably by one minute injections of a 20 \u03bcg\/mL solution at a 5 \u03bcL\/mL flow rate. The level of 4-4-20 antibodies bound to the surface ranges between 400 and 700 RU. Next, dilution series of the receptor (Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein) in HBS-P buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) are injected onto the surface at 100 \u03bcL\/min Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions is carried out preferably by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4; 3M NaCl. Any regeneration technique known in the art is contemplated in the method of the invention.","Once an entire data set is collected, the resulting binding curves are globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the SPR instrument manufacturer, e.g., BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). These algorithms calculate both the Kand K, from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants (i.e., K\/K). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluation Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). The analysis of the generated data may be done using any method known in the art. For a review of the various methods of interpretation of the kinetic data generated see Myszka, 19978: 50-7; Fisher et al., 19945: 389-95; O'Shannessy, 19945:65-71; Chaiken et al., 1992201: 197-210; Morton et al., 1995227: 176-85; O'Shannessy et al., 1996236: 275-83; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","In preferred embodiments, the kinetic parameters determined using an SPR analysis, e.g., BIAcore, may be used as a predictive measure of how a molecule of the invention will function in a functional assay, e.g., ADCC. An exemplary method for predicting the efficacy of a molecule of the invention based on kinetic parameters obtained from an SPR analysis may comprise the following: determining the Kvalues for binding of a molecule of the invention to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB; plotting (1) K(wt)\/K(mut) for Fc\u03b3RIIIA; (2) K(mut)\/K(wt) for Fc\u03b3RIIB against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to wild type; and possess and enhanced ADCC function.","5.3 Methods of Recombinantly Producing Molecules of the Invention","5.3.1 Polynucleotides Encoding Molecules of the Invention","The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the molecules, including the polypeptides and antibodies, of the invention identified by the methods of the invention. The polynucleotides encoding the molecules of the invention may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence of the molecules (e.g., antibodies) that are identified by the methods of the invention is determined, the nucleotide sequence may be manipulated using methods well known in the art, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 20013rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate, for example, antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example by generating amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, when the nucleic acids encode antibodies, one or more of the CDRs are inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., 1998278: 457-479 for a listing of human framework regions).","In another embodiment, human libraries or any other libraries available in the art, can be screened by standard techniques known in the art, to clone the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention.","5.3.2 Recombinant Expression of Molecules of the Invention","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies) has been obtained, the vector for the production of the molecules may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequences for the molecules of the invention and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. (See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 19902d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds., 1998, John Wiley & Sons, NY).","An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of a molecule identified by the methods of the invention (i.e., an antibody) can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation) and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the molecules of the invention. In specific embodiments, the expression of the molecules of the invention is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible or a tissue, specific promoter.","The host cells used to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention may be either bacterial cells such as , or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Foecking et al., 199845:101; Cockett et al., 19908:2).","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the molecules of the invention may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express the molecules of the invention in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., and ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 293T, 3T3 cells, lymphotic cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715), Per C.6 cells (human retinal cells developed by Crucell) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 19832:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, 198513:3101-3109; Van Heeke & Schuster, 198924:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free gluta-thione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (e.g., the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (e.g., the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, 198481:355-359). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., 1987153:51-544).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibodies of the invention.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., 197711: 223), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 199248: 202), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., 198022: 817) genes can be employed in tk\u2212, hgprt\u2212 or aprt\u2212 cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., 198077:357; O'Hare et al., 198178: 1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 198178: 2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 12: 488-505; Wu and Wu, 1991, 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 199332:573-596; Mulligan, 1993260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson, 199362:191-217; May, 199311(5):155-215). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), 1993, John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, Stockton Press, NY; and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colberre-Garapin et al., 1981150:1; and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., 198430:147).","The expression levels of an antibody of the invention can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, , Vol. 3 (Academic Press, New York, 1987). When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., 19833:257).","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, 1986322:52; Kohler, 198077:2197). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once a molecule of the invention (i.e., antibodies) has been recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of polypeptides or antibodies, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of polypeptides or antibodies.","5.4 Prophylactic and Therapeutic Methods","The present invention encompasses administering one or more of the molecules of the invention (e.g., antibodies) to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, for preventing, treating, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection. The molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of a disease or disorder where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by Fc\u03b3R is desired. The methods and compositions of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of primary or metastatic neoplastic disease (i.e., cancer), and infectious diseases. Molecules of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein. As detailed below, the molecules of the invention can be used in methods of treating or preventing cancer (particularly in passive immunotherapy), autoimmune disease, inflammatory disorders or infectious diseases.","The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with other therapeutic agents known in the art for the treatment or prevention of a cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammatory disorders or infectious diseases. In a specific embodiment, molecules of the invention may be used in combination with monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, lymphokines, or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), which, for example, serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the molecules and, increase immune response. The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with one or more drugs used to treat a disease, disorder, or infection such as, for example anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents or anti-viral agents, e.g., as detailed in sections 5.4.1.2 and 5.4.2.1 below.","5.4.1 Cancers","The invention encompasses methods and composition for treatment or prevention of cancer or metastasis in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region.","Molecules of the invention (i.e., polypeptides, antibodies) comprising variant Fc regions can be used to prevent, inhibit or reduce the growth of primary tumors or metastasis of cancerous cells. In one embodiment, the molecule of the invention comprises a variant Fc that binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, and\/or said variant Fc region has an enhanced effector function, e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc. Such molecules can be used alone to treat or prevent cancer. In another embodiment, the molecule of the invention comprises a variant Fc region that binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, and further binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB, and\/or said variant Fc region has an enhanced effector function, e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc. Such molecules can also be used alone to treat or prevent cancer.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject with Fc\u03b3R polymorphisms such as those homozygous for the F\u03b3RIIIA-158V or Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158F alleles. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies, e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the low affinity allele of Fc\u03b3RIIIA (158F). In other embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies, e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the high affinity allele of Fc\u03b3RIIIA (158V).","In some embodiments, the engineered antibodies of the invention are particularly effective in treating and\/or preventing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The engineered antibodies of the invention are therapeutically more effective than current therapeutic regimens for NHL, including but not limited to chemotherapy, and immunotherapy using anti-CD20 mAb, Rituximab. The efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies however depends on the Fc\u03b3R polymorphism of the subject (Carton et al., 2002 99: 754-8; Weng et al., 2003 21(21):3940-7 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). These receptors are expressed on the surface of the effector cells and mediate ADCC. High affinity alleles, of the low affinity activating receptors, improve the effector cells' ability to mediate ADCC. The methods of the invention allow engineering anti-CD20 antibodies harboring Fc mutations to enhance their affinity to Fc\u03b3R on effector cells via their altered Fc domains. The engineered antibodies of the invention provide better immunotherapy reagents for patients regardless of their Fc\u03b3R polymorphism.","An exemplary method for determining the efficacy of the engineered anti-CD20 antibodies in a subject may include the following: Plasmids harboring chimeric anti-HER2\/neu heavy chain genes with Fc mutations that show substantially increased killing in ADCC can be used as a backbone to transfer in the variable domain from the Rituximab heavy chain gene. The variable region from the anti-HER2\/neu Fc variant is replaced with the variable region from Rituximab. Plasmids containing wild type Fc domains or a D265A mutation to abrogate FcR binding, or the anti-CD20 Fc variants are transiently cotransfected with the Rituximab light chain gene into 293H cells, conditioned media and the antibody is purified over a protein G column using routine methods.","Anti-CD20 mAbs harboring the Fc variants are tested by ADCC using a cultured B cell line to determine the ability of the Fc mutations to enhance ADCC. Standard ADCC is performed using methods disclosed herein. Lymphocytes are harvested from peripheral blood using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Target Daudi cells, a B-cell line expressing CD20, are loaded with Europium (PerkinElmer) and incubated with effectors for 4 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. Released Europium is detected using a fluorescent plate reader (Wallac). The resulting ADCC data indicates the efficacy of the Fc variants to trigger NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and establish which anti-CD20 Fc variants can be tested with both patient samples and elutriated monocytes. Fc variants showing the greatest potential for enhancing the efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody are then tested in an ADCC assay using PBMCs from patients. PBMC from healthy donors are used as effector cells. In vitro ADCC assays using anti-CD20 variants and Rituximab are performed in primary lymphoma cells from patients with follicular lymphoma. The specific Fc\u03b3R polymorphism of the donors is determined and cataloged using methods known in the art. ADCC assay is performed by effector cells from patients with different Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA genotypes.","According to an aspect of the invention, molecules (e.g., antibodies) of the invention comprising variant Fc regions enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy by increasing the potency of the antibody effector function relative to a molecule containing the wild-type Fc region, e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc. In a specific embodiment, antibody dependent cellular toxicity and\/or phagocytosis of tumor cells is enhanced using the molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions. Molecules of the invention may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy cancer treatment by enhancing at least one antibody-mediated effector function. In one particular embodiment, a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing the complement dependent cascade. In another embodiment of the invention, the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing the phagocytosis and\/or opsonization of the targeted tumor cells. In another embodiment of the invention, the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of treatment by enhancing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (\u201cADCC\u201d) in destruction of the targeted tumor cells.","The invention further contemplates engineering therapeutic antibodies (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies) for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic antibody, for example, by enhancing the effector function of the therapeutic antibody (e.g., ADCC). Preferably the therapeutic antibody is a cytotoxic and\/or opsonizing antibody. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, that once molecules of the invention with desired binding properties (e.g., molecules with variant Fc regions with at least one amino acid modification, which modification enhances the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA relative to a comparable molecule, comprising a wild-type Fc region) have been identified (See Section 5.2 and Table 5) according to the methods of the invention, therapeutic antibodies may be engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques and any known mutagenesis techniques, as described in Section 5.2.2 to produce engineered therapeutic carrying the identified mutation sites with the desired binding properties. Any of the therapeutic antibodies listed in Table 6 that have demonstrated therapeutic utility in cancer treatment, may be engineered according to the methods of the invention, for example, by modifying the Fc region to have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA compared to a therapeutic antibody having a wild-type Fc region, and used for the treatment and or prevention of a cancer characterized by a cancer antigen.","The invention also encompasses engineering any other polypeptide comprising an Fc region which has therapeutic utility, including but not limited to ENBREL, according to the methods of the invention, in order to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of such polypeptides, for example, by enhancing the effector function of the polypeptide comprising an Fc region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0316","num":"0315"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODIES THAT CAN BE ENGINEERED"},{"entry":"ACCORDING TO THE METHODS OF THE INVENTION"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Company","Product","Disease","Target"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Abgenix","ABX-EGF\u2009\u2122","Cancer","EGF receptor"]},{"entry":[{},"anti-EGF",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Receptor Antibody",{},{}]},{"entry":["AltaRex","OvaRex\u2009\u2122 anti-CA125","ovarian cancer","tumor antigen CA125"]},{"entry":[{},"Antibody",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"BravaRex\u2009\u2122 anti-","metastatic","tumor antigen MUC1"]},{"entry":[{},"MUC1 Antibody","cancers",{}]},{"entry":["Antisoma","Theragyn","ovarian cancer","PEM antigen"]},{"entry":[{},"(pemtumomabytrrium-",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"90)",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Therex","breast cancer","PEM antigen"]},{"entry":["Boehringer","Blvatuzumab","head & neck","CD44"]},{"entry":["Ingelheim",{},"cancer",{}]},{"entry":["Centocor\/J&J","Panorex\u2009\u2122 anti-17-1A","Colorectal","17-1A"]},{"entry":[{},"Antibody","cancer",{}]},{"entry":[{},"ReoPro\u2009\u00ae","PTCA","gp IIIb\/IIIa"]},{"entry":[{},"ReoPro\u2009\u00ae","Acute MI","gp IIIb\/IIIa"]},{"entry":[{},"ReoPro\u2009\u00ae","Ischemic stroke","gp IIIb\/IIIa"]},{"entry":["Corixa","Bexocar","NHL","CD20"]},{"entry":["CRC","MAb, idiotypic 105AD7","colorectal cancer","gp72"]},{"entry":["Technology",{},"vaccine",{}]},{"entry":["Crucell","Anti-EpCAM","cancer","Ep-CAM"]},{"entry":["Cytoclonal","MAb, lung cancer","non-small cell","NA"]},{"entry":[{},{},"lung cancer",{}]},{"entry":["Genentech","Herceptin\u2009\u2122 anti-Her-2","metastatic breast","HER-2"]},{"entry":[{},"Antibody","cancer",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Herceptin\u2009\u2122 anti-Her-2","early stage","HER-2"]},{"entry":[{},"Antibody","breast cancer",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Rituxan\u2009\u2122 anti-CD20","Relapsed\/refractory","CD20"]},{"entry":[{},"Antibody","low-grade or",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"follicular NHL",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Rituxan\u2009\u2122 anti-CD20","intermediate &","CD20"]},{"entry":[{},"Antibody","high-grade NHL",{}]},{"entry":[{},"MAb-VEGF","NSCLC,","VEGF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"metastatic",{}]},{"entry":[{},"MAb-VEGF","Colorectal","VEGF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"cancer,",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"metastatic",{}]},{"entry":[{},"AMD Fab","age-related","CD18"]},{"entry":[{},{},"macular",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"degeneration",{}]},{"entry":[{},"E-26 (2gen.

In other specific embodiments, sarcoma, melanoma, or leukemia is treated or prevented by the methods and compositions of the invention.","In a specific embodiment, a molecule of the invention (e.g., an antibody comprising a variant Fc region, or a therapeutic monoclonal antibody engineered according to the methods of the invention) inhibits or reduces the growth of primary tumor or metastasis of cancerous cells by at least 99%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to the growth of primary tumor or metastasis in the absence of said molecule of the invention.","5.4.1.1 Combination Therapy","The invention further encompasses administering the molecules of the invention in combination with other therapies known to those skilled in the art for the treatment or prevention of cancer, including but not limited to, current standard and experimental chemotherapies, hormonal therapies, biological therapies, immunotherapies, radiation therapies, or surgery. In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more anti-cancer agents, therapeutic antibodies (e.g., antibodies listed in Table 3), or other agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer (See Section 5.4.1.2).","In certain embodiments, one or more molecule of the invention is administered to a mammal, preferably a human, concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer. The term \u201cconcurrently\u201d is not limited to the administration of prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same time, but rather it is meant that a molecule of the invention and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the molecule of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each prophylactic or therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy or biological therapy) may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. In various embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered less than 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In preferred embodiments, two or more components are administered within the same patient visit.","In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered at about 2 to 4 days apart, at about 4 to 6 days apart, at about 1 week part, at about 1 to 2 weeks apart, or more than 2 weeks apart. In preferred embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a time frame where both agents are still active. One skilled in the art would be able to determine such a time frame by determining the half life of the administered agents.","In certain embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second agent and\/or third agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and\/or improves the efficacy of the treatment.","In certain embodiments, prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a cycle of less than about 3 weeks, about once every two weeks, about once every 10 days or about once every week. One cycle can comprise the administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent by infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle, about 1 hour every cycle, about 45 minutes every cycle. Each cycle can comprise at least 1 week of rest, at least 2 weeks of rest, at least 3 weeks of rest. The number of cycles administered is from about 1 to about 12 cycles, more typically from about 2 to about 10 cycles, and more typically from about 2 to about 8 cycles.","In yet other embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents of the invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimens, either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration can involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically the therapeutic agents, in particular cytotoxic agents, are used at lower doses. Such dosing regimens encompass the chronic daily administration of relatively low doses for extended periods of time. In preferred embodiments, the use of lower doses can minimize toxic side effects and eliminate rest periods. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents are delivered by chronic low-dose or continuous infusion ranging from about 24 hours to about 2 days, to about 1 week, to about 2 weeks, to about 3 weeks to about 1 month to about 2 months, to about 3 months, to about 4 months, to about 5 months, to about 6 months. The scheduling of such dose regimens can be optimized by the skilled oncologist.","In other embodiments, courses of treatment are administered concurrently to a mammal, i.e., individual doses of the therapeutics are administered separately yet within a time interval such that molecules of the invention can work together with the other agent or agents. For example, one component may be administered one time per week in combination with the other components that may be administered one time every two weeks or one time every three weeks. In other words, the dosing regimens for the therapeutics are carried out concurrently even if the therapeutics are not administered simultaneously or within the same patient visit.","When used in combination with other prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents, the molecules of the invention and the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In one embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more therapeutic agents in the same pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents in separate pharmaceutical compositions. In still another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another prophylactic or therapeutic agent. The invention contemplates administration of a molecule of the invention in combination with other prophylactic or therapeutic agents by the same or different routes of administration, e.g., oral and parenteral. In certain embodiments, when a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with another prophylactic or therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including, but not limited to, toxicity, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent can advantageously be administered at a dose that falls below the threshold that the adverse side effect is elicited.","The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered, the severity and type of cancer, the route of administration, as well as age, body weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient.

Molecules of the invention with such binding characteristics are useful in regulating the immune response, e.g., in inhibiting the immune response in connection with autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of action, molecules of the invention with an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA may lead to dampening of the activating response to Fc\u03b3R and inhibition of cellular responsiveness.","In some embodiments, a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region is not an immunoglobulin, and comprises at least one amino acid modification which modification increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to a molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region. In other embodiments, said molecule further comprises one or more amino acid modifications, which modifications decreases the affinity of the molecule for an activating Fc\u03b3R. In some embodiments, the molecule is a soluble (i.e., not membrane bound) Fc region. The invention contemplates other amino acid modifications within the soluble Fc region which modulate its affinity for various Fc receptors, including those known to one skilled in the art as described herein. In other embodiments, the molecule (e.g., the Fc region comprising at least one or more amino acid modification) is modified using techniques known to one skilled in the art and as described herein to increase the in vivo half life of the Fc region. Such molecules have therapeutic utility in treating and\/or preventing an autoimmune disorder. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of actions, such molecules with enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB will lead to a dampening of the activating receptors and thus a dampening of the immune response and have therapeutic efficacy for treating and\/or preventing an autoimmune disorder.","In certain embodiments, the one or more amino acid modifications, which increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decrease the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 246 with threonine and at position 396 with histidine; or a substitution at position 268 with aspartic acid and at position 318 with aspartic acid; or a substitution at position 217 with serine, at position 378 with valine, and at position 408 with arginine; or a substitution at position 375 with cysteine and at position 396 with leucine; or a substitution at position 246 with isoleucine and at position 334 with asparagine. In one embodiment, the one or more amino acid modifications, which increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decrease the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 247 with leucine. In another embodiment, the one or more amino acid modification, which increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decreases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 372 with tyrosine. In yet another embodiment, the one or more amino acid modification, which increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decreases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 326 with glutamic acid. In one embodiment, the one or more amino acid modification, which increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decreases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 224 with leucine.","The variant Fc regions that have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region, may be used to treat or prevent autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. The present invention provides methods of preventing, treating, or managing one or more symptoms associated with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder in a subject, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions that have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and or Fc\u03b3RIIA relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region.","The invention also provides methods for preventing, treating, or managing one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory disorder in a subject further comprising, administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more anti-inflammatory agents. The invention also provides methods for preventing, treating, or managing one or more symptoms associated with an autoimmune disease further comprising, administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more immunomodulatory agents.

As described herein in Section 2.2.2, some autoimmune disorders are associated with an inflammatory condition. Thus, there is overlap between what is considered an autoimmune disorder and an inflammatory disorder. Therefore, some autoimmune disorders may also be characterized as inflammatory disorders. Examples of inflammatory disorders which can be prevented, treated or managed in accordance with the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, asthma, encephilitis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic disorders, septic shock, pulmonary fibrosis, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, undifferentiated arthropathy, arthritis, inflammatory osteolysis, and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacteria infections.","Molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions that have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region can also be used to reduce the inflammation experienced by animals, particularly mammals, with inflammatory disorders.

Infectious diseases that can be treated or prevented by the molecules of the invention are caused by infectious agents including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozae, and viruses.","Viral diseases that can be treated or prevented using the molecules of the invention in conjunction with the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, those caused by hepatitis type A, hepatitis type B, hepatitis type C, influenza, varicella, adenovirus, herpes simplex type I (HSV-I), herpes simplex type II (HSV-II), rinderpest, rhinovirus, echovirus, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, papilloma virus, papova virus, cytomegalovirus, echinovirus, arbovirus, huntavirus, coxsackie virus, mumps virus, measles virus, rubella virus, polio virus, small pox, Epstein Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I), human immunodeficiency virus type II (HIV-II), and agents of viral diseases such as viral meningitis, encephalitis, dengue or small pox.","Bacterial diseases that can be treated or prevented using the molecules of the invention in conjunction with the methods of the present invention, that are caused by bacteria include, but are not limited to, mycobacteria rickettsia, mycoplasma, neisseria, (Lyme disease), (anthrax), tetanus, , mycobacterium, tetanus, pertissus, cholera, plague, diphtheria, chlamydia, and legionella.","Protozoal diseases that can be treated or prevented using the molecules of the invention in conjunction with the methods of the present invention, that are caused by protozoa include, but are not limited to, leishmania, kokzidioa, trypanosoma or malaria.","Parasitic diseases that can be treated or prevented using the molecules of the invention in conjunction with the methods of the present invention, that are caused by parasites include, but are not limited to, chlamydia and rickettsia.","According to one aspect of the invention, molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions have an enhanced antibody effector function towards an infectious agent, e.g., a pathogenic protein, relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region. In a specific embodiment, molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of treatment of an infectious disease by enhancing phagocytosis and\/or opsonization of the infectious agent causing the infectious disease. In another specific embodiment, molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of treatment of an infectious disease by enhancing ADCC of infected cells causing the infectious disease.","In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or additional therapeutic agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of an infectious disease.

The vaccine compositions of the invention comprise one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents to which an immune response is desired, wherein the one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents is coated with a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, coating an antigenic or immunogenic agent with a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, enhances the immune response to the desired antigenic or immunogenic agent by inducing humoral and cell-mediated responses. The vaccine compositions of the invention are particularly effective in eliciting an immune response, preferably a protective immune response against the antigenic or immunogenic agent.","In some embodiments, the antigenic or immunogenic agent in the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a virus against which an immune response is desired. The viruses may be recombinant or chimeric, and are preferably attenuated. Production of recombinant, chimeric, and attenuated viruses may be performed using standard methods known to one skilled in the art. The invention encompasses a live recombinant viral vaccine or an inactivated recombinant viral vaccine to be formulated in accordance with the invention. A live vaccine may be preferred because multiplication in the host leads to a prolonged stimulus of similar kind and magnitude to that occurring in natural infections, and therefore, confers substantial, long-lasting immunity. Production of such live recombinant virus vaccine formulations may be accomplished using conventional methods involving propagation of the virus in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo followed by purification.","In a specific embodiment, the recombinant virus is non-pathogenic to the subject to which it is administered. In this regard, the use of genetically engineered viruses for vaccine purposes may require the presence of attenuation characteristics in these strains. The introduction of appropriate mutations (e.g., deletions) into the templates used for transfection may provide the novel viruses with attenuation characteristics. For example, specific missense mutations which are associated with temperature sensitivity or cold adaption can be made into deletion mutations. These mutations should be more stable than the point mutations associated with cold or temperature sensitive mutants and reversion frequencies should be extremely low. Recombinant DNA technologies for engineering recombinant viruses are known in the art and encompassed in the invention. For example, techniques for modifying negative strand RNA viruses are known in the art, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,057, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Alternatively, chimeric viruses with \u201csuicide\u201d characteristics may be constructed for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. Such viruses would go through only one or a few rounds of replication within the host. When used as a vaccine, the recombinant virus would go through limited replication cycle(s) and induce a sufficient level of immune response but it would not go further in the human host and cause disease. Alternatively, inactivated (killed) virus may be formulated in accordance with the invention. Inactivated vaccine formulations may be prepared using conventional techniques to \u201ckill\u201d the chimeric viruses. Inactivated vaccines are \u201cdead\u201d in the sense that their infectivity has been destroyed. Ideally, the infectivity of the virus is destroyed without affecting its immunogenicity. In order to prepare inactivated vaccines, the chimeric virus may be grown in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo, purified by zonal ultracentrifugation, inactivated by formaldehyde or \u03b2-propiolactone, and pooled.","In certain embodiments, completely foreign epitopes, including antigens derived from other viral or non-viral pathogens can be engineered into the virus for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. For example, antigens of non-related viruses such as HIV (gp160, gp120, gp41) parasite antigens (e.g., malaria), bacterial or fungal antigens or tumor antigens can be engineered into the attenuated strain.","Virtually any heterologous gene sequence may be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations. Preferably, heterologous gene sequences are moieties and peptides that act as biological response modifiers. Preferably, epitopes that induce a protective immune response to any of a variety of pathogens, or antigens that bind neutralizing antibodies may be expressed by or as part of the chimeric viruses. For example, heterologous gene sequences that can be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention include, but are not limited to, influenza and parainfluenza hemagglutinin neuraminidase and fusion glycoproteins such as the HN and F genes of human PIV3. In yet another embodiment, heterologous gene sequences that can be engineered into the chimeric viruses include those that encode proteins with immuno-modulating activities. Examples of immuno-modulating proteins include, but are not limited to, cytokines, interferon type 1, gamma interferon, colony stimulating factors, interleukin-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -12, and antagonists of these agents.","In yet other embodiments, the invention encompasses pathogenic cells or viruses, preferably attenuated viruses, which express the variant antibody on their surface.","In alternative embodiments, the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a fusion polypeptide wherein an antigenic or immunogenic agent is operatively linked to a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Engineering fusion polypeptides for use in the vaccine compositions of the invention is performed using routine recombinant DNA technology methods and is within the level of ordinary skill.","The invention further encompasses methods to induce tolerance in a subject by administering a composition of the invention. Preferably a composition suitable for inducing tolerance in a subject, comprises an antigenic or immunogenic agent coated with a variant antibody of the invention, wherein the variant antibody has a higher affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIB. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, such compositions are effective in inducing tolerance by activating the Fc\u03b3RIIB meditated inhibitory pathway.","5.6 Compositions and Methods of Administering","The invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions comprising molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides) comprising variant Fc regions. The invention also provides methods of treatment, prophylaxis, and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention. In a preferred aspect, an antibody, a fusion protein, or a conjugated molecule, is substantially purified (i.e., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). In a specific embodiment, the subject is an animal, preferably a mammal such as non-primate (e.g., cows, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, rats etc.) and a primate (e.g., monkey such as, a cynomolgous monkey and a human). In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. In yet another preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is from the same species as the subject.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a composition comprising molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides), comprising variant Fc regions, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or fusion protein, receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987262:4429-4432), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of administering a molecule of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural, and mucosal (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In a specific embodiment, the molecules of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92\/19244; WO 97\/32572; WO 97\/44013; WO 98\/31346; and WO 99\/66903, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention also provides that the molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides) comprising variant Fc regions, are packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of antibody. In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g., with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized molecules of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8\u00b0 C. in their original container and the molecules should be administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, molecules of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the molecule, fusion protein, or conjugated molecule. Preferably, the liquid form of the molecules of the invention are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg\/ml, more preferably at least 2.5 mg\/ml, at least 5 mg\/ml, at least 8 mg\/ml, at least 10 mg\/ml, at least 15 mg\/kg, at least 25 mg\/ml, at least 50 mg\/ml, at least 100 mg\/ml, at least 150 mg\/ml, at least 200 mg\/ml of the molecules.","The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.75 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg to 0.25 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg\/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg\/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","In one embodiment, the dosage of the molecules of the invention administered to a patient are 0.01 mg to 1000 mg\/day, when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the molecules of the invention are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a molecule of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the molecule does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (See Langer, 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in , Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 3 17-327; see generally ibid.).","In yet another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more molecules of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; PCT publication WO 91\/05548; PCT publication WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996, \u201cIntratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel,\u201d & 39:179-189, Song et al., 1995, \u201cAntibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long-Circulating Emulsions,\u201d & 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 1997, \u201cBiodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application,\u201d 24:853-854; and Lam et al., 1997, \u201cMicroencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery,\u201d 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, a pump may be used in a controlled release system (See Langer, supra; Sefton, 198714:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; and Saudek et al., 1989321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled release of antibodies (see e.g., , Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J., 23:61; See also Levy et al., 1985228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 19897 1:105); U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,377; U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,597; U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,015; U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,463; U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99\/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99\/20253). Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target (e.g., the lungs), thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). In another embodiment, polymeric compositions useful as controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,155). This particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another embodiment, a non-polymeric sustained delivery system is used, whereby a non-polymeric implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in the body, the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate, disperse, or leach from the composition into surrounding tissue fluid, and the non-polymeric material will gradually coagulate or precipitate to form a solid, microporous matrix (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,533).","Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; International Publication Nos. WO 91\/05548 and WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996& 39:179-189; Song et al., 1995& 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 199724:853-854; and Lam et al., 199724:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In a specific embodiment where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding an antibody, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded antibody, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (See e.g., Joliot et al., 199188:1864-1868), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.","For antibodies, the therapeutically or prophylactically effective dosage administered to a subject is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 200 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a subject is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight and more preferably the dosage administered to a subject is between 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. The dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced also by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the lung) of the antibodies or fusion proteins by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","Treatment of a subject with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of molecules of the invention can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with molecules of the invention in the range of between about 0.1 to 30 mg\/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered once a week, twice a week, once every two weeks, once a month, once every six weeks, once every two months, twice a year or once per year. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of the molecules used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment.","5.6.1 Pharmaceutical Compositions","The compositions of the invention include bulk drug compositions useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., impure or non-sterile compositions) and pharmaceutical compositions (i.e., compositions that are suitable for administration to a subject or patient) which can be used in the preparation of unit dosage forms. Such compositions comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agent disclosed herein or a combination of those agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, compositions of the invention comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In one particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and\/or said variant Fc region mediates an effector function at least 2-fold more effectively than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and said variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB, and\/or said variant Fc region mediates an effector function at least 2-fold more effectively than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, said pharmaceutical compositions further comprise one or more anti-cancer agents.","The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic antibody (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibody) that is specific for a particular cancer antigen, comprising one or more amino acid modifications in the Fc region as determined in accordance with the instant invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant (e.g., Freund's adjuvant (complete and incomplete), excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.","Generally, the ingredients of compositions of the invention are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","5.6.2 Gene Therapy","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding molecules of the invention, are administered to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection, by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or fusion protein that mediates a therapeutic or prophylactic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., 199312:488-505; Wu and Wu, 19913:87-95; Tolstoshev, 199332:573-596; Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, 199362:191-217; May, 199311(5):155-215. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), , John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, , Stockton Press, NY (1990).","In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding an antibody, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, 198986:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al., 1989342:435-438).","In another preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding a fusion protein, said nucleic acids being a part of an expression vector that expresses the fusion protein in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the coding region of a fusion protein, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the coding sequence of the fusion protein and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the fusion protein.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a subject may be either direct, in which case the subject is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the subject. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987262:4429-4432) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (See, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; WO92\/20316; WO93\/14188; WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, 198986:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al., 1989342:435-438).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding a molecule of the invention (e.g., an antibody or a fusion protein) are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (See Miller et al., 1993217:581-599). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody or a fusion protein to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the nucleotide sequence into a subject. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., (19946:291-302), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., 199493:644-651; Klein et al., 199483:1467-1473; Salmons and Gunzberg, 1993, 4:129-141; and Grossman and Wilson, 19933:110-114.","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson (3:499-503, 1993, present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., (5:3-10, 1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., 1991252:431-434; Rosenfeld et al., 199268:143-155; Mastrangeli et al., 199391:225-234; PCT Publication WO94\/12649; and Wang et al., 19952:775-783. In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (see, e.g., Walsh et al., 1993204:289-300 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a subject.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to, transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector, containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell mediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (See, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, 1993217:599-618, Cohen et al., 1993217:618-644; and 29:69-92, 1985) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a subject by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the subject.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or a fusion protein are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (See e.g., PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, 19927 1:973-985; Rheinwald, 198021A:229; and Pittelkow and Scott, 198661:771).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","5.6.3 Kits","The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with the molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions). Additionally, one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included in the pharmaceutical pack or kit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises one or more molecules of the invention. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer, in one or more containers. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more cytotoxic antibodies that bind one or more cancer antigens associated with cancer. In certain embodiments, the other prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic. In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a biological or hormonal therapeutic.","5.7 Characterization and Demonstration of Therapeutic Utility","Several aspects of the pharmaceutical compositions, prophylactic, or therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, in a cell culture system, and in an animal model organism, such as a rodent animal model system, for the desired therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example, assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is desired, include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, and the effect of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule(s) for each individual patient. In various specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., T cells), to determine if a pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.","Combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include, but are not limited to, rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, pigs, dogs, rabbits, etc. Any animal system well-known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention, combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well-known to the skilled artisan. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be administered repeatedly. Several aspects of the procedure may vary. Said aspects include the temporal regime of administering the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents, and whether such agents are administered separately or as an admixture.","Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for example, transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs on mouse effector cells, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,396 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) can be used in the present invention. Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIA.","Preferably, mutations showing the highest levels of activity in the functional assays described above will be tested for use in animal model studies prior to use in humans. Antibodies harboring the Fc mutants identified using the methods of the invention and tested in ADCC assays, including ch4D5 and ch520C9, two anti-Erb-B2 antibodies, and chCC49, an anti-TAG72 antibody, are preferred for use in animal models since they have been used previously in xenograft mouse model (Hudsiak et al., 19899: 1165-72; Lewis et al., 199337: 255-63; Bergman et al., 2001 7: 2050-6; Johnson et al., 19951387-93). Sufficient quantities of antibodies may be prepared for use in animal models using methods described supra, for example using mammalian expression systems and IgG purification methods disclosed and exemplified herein. A typical experiment requires at least about 5.4 mg of mutant antibody. This calculation is based on average quantities of wild type antibody required to protect 8-10 30 g mice following a loading dose of 4 \u03bcg\/g and a weekly maintenance dose, 2 \u03bcg\/g, for ten weeks. invention encompasse tumor cell lines as a source for xenograft tumors, such as SK\u2212 BR-3, BT474 and HT29 cells which are derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both Erb-B2 and the prolactin receptors on their surface. The SK-BR-3 cells have been used successfully in both ADCC and xenograft tumor models. In other assays OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma may be used. These cells express the antigen TAG72 on the cell surface and can be used in conjunction with the chCC49 antibody. The use of different antibodies and multiple tumor models will circumvent loss of any specific mutations due to an antibody specific Fc mutant incompatibility.","Mouse xenograft models may be used for examining efficacy of mouse antibodies generated against a tumor specific target based on the affinity and specificity of the CDR regions of the antibody molecule and the ability of the Fc region of the antibody to elicit an immune response (Wu et al., 2001, Trends Cell Biol. 11: 52-9). Transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs on mouse effector cells are unique and are tailor-made animal models to test the efficacy of human Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions. Pairs of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mouse lines generated in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch (Through a licensing agreement with Rockefeller U. and Sloan Kettering Cancer center) can be used such as those listed in the Table below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0419","num":"0418"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Mice Strains"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Strain Background","Human FcR"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","none"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3RIIIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3R IIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3R IIA and IIIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD32B KO","none"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD32B KO","Fc\u03b3R IIB"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Preferably Fc mutants showing both enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB, increased activity in ADCC and phagocytosis assays are tested in animal model experiments. The animal model experiments examine the increase in efficacy of Fc mutant bearing antibodies in Fc\u03b3RIIIA transgenic, nude mCD16A knockout mice compared to a control which has been administered native antibody. Preferably, groups of 8-10 mice are examined using a standard protocol. An exemplary animal model experiment may comprise the following steps: in a breast cancer model, \u02dc2\u00d710SK-BR-3 cells are injected subcutaneously on day 1 with 0.1 mL PBS mixed with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). Initially a wild type chimeric antibody and isotype control are administered to establish a curve for the predetermined therapeutic dose, intravenous injection of 4D5 on day 1 with an initial dose of 4 \u03bcg\/g followed by weekly injections of 2 \u03bcg\/g. Tumor volume is monitored for 6-8 weeks to measure progress of the disease. Tumor volume should increase linearly with time in animals injected with the isotype control. In contrast very little tumor growth should occur in the group injected with 4D5. Results from the standard dose study are used to set an upper limit for experiments testing the Fc mutants. These studies are done using subtherapeutic doses of the Fc mutant containing antibodies. A one tenth dose was used on xenograft models in experiments done in Fc\u03b3RIIB knockout mice, see, Clynes et al., 20006: 443-6, with a resultant block in tumor cell growth. Since the mutants of the invention preferrably show an increase in Fc\u03b3RIIIA activation and reduction in Fc\u03b3RIIB binding the mutants are examined at one tenth therapeutic dose. Examination of tumor size at different intervals indicates the efficacy of the antibodies at the lower dose. Statistical analysis of the data using t test provides a way of determining if the data is significant. Fc mutants that show increased efficacy are tested at incrementally lower doses to determine the smallest possible dose as a measure of their efficacy.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be determined by using various experimental animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L., \u201cArthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals\u201d, in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993). Experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases can also be used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention. The following are some assays provided as examples, and not by limitation.","The principle animal models for arthritis or inflammatory disease known in the art and widely used include: adjuvant-induced arthritis rat models, collagen-induced arthritis rat and mouse models and antigen-induced arthritis rat, rabbit and hamster models, all described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L., \u201cArthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals\u201d, in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be assessed using a carrageenan-induced arthritis rat model. Carrageenan-induced arthritis has also been used in rabbit, dog and pig in studies of chronic arthritis or inflammation. Quantitative histomorphometric assessment is used to determine therapeutic efficacy. The methods for using such a carrageenan-induced arthritis model is described in Hansra P. et al., \u201cCarrageenan-Induced Arthritis in the Rat,\u201d 24(2): 141-155, (2000). Also commonly used are zymosan-induced inflammation animal models as known and described in the art.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can also be assessed by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema in the rat, using a modification of the method described in Winter C. A. et al., \u201cCarrageenan-Induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti-inflammatory Drugs\u201d 111, 544-547, (1962). This assay has been used as a primary in vivo screen for the anti-inflammatory activity of most NSAIDs, and is considered predictive of human efficacy. The anti-inflammatory activity of the test prophylactic or therapeutic agents is expressed as the percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weight of the test group relative to the vehicle dosed control group.","Additionally, animal models for inflammatory bowel disease can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention (Kim et al., 1992, Scand. 27:529-537; Strober, 198530(12 Suppl):3S-10S). Ulcerative cholitis and Crohn's disease are human inflammatory bowel diseases that can be induced in animals. Sulfated polysaccharides including, but not limited to amylopectin, carrageen, amylopectin sulfate, and dextran sulfate or chemical irritants including but not limited to trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) and acetic acid can be administered to animals orally to induce inflammatory bowel diseases.","Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. Animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid autoimmunity, systemic lupus erythematosus, and glomerulonephritis have been developed (Flanders et al., 199929:235-246; Krogh et al., 199981:511-515; Foster, 199919:12-24).","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for autoimmune and\/or inflammatory diseases.","Toxicity and efficacy of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic protocols of the instant invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","The anti-cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model or transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts, animal models, such as hamsters, rabbits, etc. known in the art and described in (1999, eds. Fiebig and Burger); (1999, Karger); (1991, eds. Boven and Winograd); and (1997 ed. Teicher), herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Preferred animal models for determining the therapeutic efficacy of the molecules of the invention are mouse xenograft models. Tumor cell lines that can be used as a source for xenograft tumors include but are not limited to, SKBR3 and MCF7 cells, which can be derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both erbB2 and prolactin receptors. SKBR3 cells have been used routinely in the art as ADCC and xenograft tumor models. Alternatively, OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma can be used as a source for xenograft tumors.","The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. Therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and\/or growth; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H-thymidine incorporation, by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers; cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining, differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology, decreased growth and\/or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation, etc.","Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in humans, including but not limited to in rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits, hamsters, etc., for example, the animal models described above. The compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for treatment or prevention of cancer, inflammatory disorder, or autoimmune disease.","Using a yeast display system, mutant human IgG1 heavy chain Fc regions were screened for modified affinity to different Fc receptors. In particular, a mutant Fc library was generated by error prone PCR (Genemorph, Stratagene), and then the mutant Fc proteins were fused to the Aga2p cell wall protein, which allowed the fusion protein to be secreted extracellularly and displayed on the yeast cell wall.","Soluble forms of the human receptors (Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB) were cloned. Detection of the IgG1 Fc domains on the yeast cell surface, however, is hindered due to the low affinity of Fc\u03b3R for its ligand. In order to circumvent this limitation, soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes were formed using an AVITAG sequence which could be enzymatically biotinylated and subsequently reacted with streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin (SA-PE; Molecular Probes) to form soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes. ELISA assays confirmed that the soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes had a higher avidity for human IgG1 relative to the monomeric Fc\u03b3R. Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface also bound the soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes as assessed by FACS analysis.","The differential binding of the Fc fusion proteins expressed on the yeast cell surface to soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes was monitored by a FACS analysis. Fc fusion proteins with altered affinities for one or more soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes were thus identified and were then incorporated into a complete immunoglobulin and expressed in mammalian cells. The mammalian expressed product was used in ELISA assays to confirm the results obtained in the yeast surface display system. Finally, the mutant Fc regions were sequenced to confirm the altered residue(s).","6.1 Cloning, Expression and Purification of Fc\u03b3RIIIA","Materials and Methods","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA were cloned as follows. The cDNA clones for the human Fc\u03b3R genes (Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA) were obtained (gift from Ravetch lab). Soluble region of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA gene (amino acids 7-203) was amplified by PCR (Table 5), digested with BamHI\/HindIII and ligated into the pET25vector (Novagen). This vector was digested with Sall\/Notl and a 370 bp fragment was gel isolated. The vector hu3A, (gift from J. Ravetch) was digested with BamHI\/Sall and a 270 by fragment containing the N-terminus of Fc\u03b3RIIIA was isolated. Both fragments were coligated into pcDNA3.1 cut with BamH\/NotI to create pcDNA3-Fc\u03b3RIIIA (amino acids 1-203). The soluble region of Fc\u03b3RIIB (amino acids 33-180) was amplified by PCR (Table 5), digested with BglII\/HindIII and ligated into pET25b(+) (Novagen). This vector was digested with BamHI\/NotI and a 140 bp fragment was gel isolated. The vector huRIIb1 (gift from J. Ravetch) was digested with BamHI\/EcoRI and a 440 bp N-terminal Fc\u03b3RIIB fragment was isolated. Both of these fragments were coligated into pcDNA3.1 cut with BamHI\/NotI to create pcDNA3-Fc\u03b3RIIB (amino acids 1-180). Recombinant clones were transfected into 293H cells, supernatants were collected from cell cultures, and soluble recombinant Fc\u03b3R (rFc\u03b3R) proteins were purified on an IgG sepharose column.","Results","Recombinant Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA (rFc\u03b3RIIIA) and Recombinant Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIB (rFc\u03b3RIIB) were Purified to Homogeneity","Subsequent to expression and purification of the recombinant soluble Fc\u03b3R proteins on an IgG sepharose column, the purity and apparent molecular weight of the recombinant purified soluble receptor proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE. As shown in , soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA (, lane 1) had the expected apparent molecular weight of \u02dc35 KDa and soluble rFc\u03b3RIIB (, lane 4) had the expected apparent molecular weight of \u02dc20 KDa. As shown in , soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA migrates as a diffuse \u201cfuzzy\u201d band which has been attributed to the high degree of glycosylation normally found on Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Jefferis, et al., 1995 44, 111-117).","6.1.1 Characterization of Purified Recombinant Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA","Materials and Methods","Purified soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA, which was obtained as described above, was analyzed for direct binding against human monomeric or aggregated IgG using an ELISA assay. The plate is coated with 10 ng of soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA overnight in 1\u00d7PBS. Subsequent to coating, the plate is washed three times in 1\u00d7PBS\/0.1% Tween 20. Human IgG, either biotinylated monomeric IgG or biotinylated aggregated IgG, is added to the wells at a concentration ranging from 0.03 mg\/mL to 2 mg\/mL, and allowed to bind to the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA. The reaction is carried out for one hour at 37\u00b0 C. The plate is washed again three times with 1\u00d7PBS\/0.1% Tween 20. The binding of human IgG to soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA is detected with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate by monitoring the absorbance at 650 nm. The absorbance at 650 nm is proportional to the bound aggregated IgG.","In a blocking ELISA experiment, the ability of an Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody, 3G8, a mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody (Pharmingen), to block the binding of the receptor to aggregated IgG is monitored. The washing and incubation conditions were the same as described above, except that prior to IgG addition, a 5-fold molar excess of 3G8 was added and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C.","Results","Purified, Recombinant Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA Binds Aggregated IgG Specifically","The direct binding of purified recombinant soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA to aggregated and monomeric IgG was tested using an ELISA assay (). At an IgG concentration of 2 \u03bcg\/ml, strong binding to the aggregated IgG was observed. However, at a similar concentration, no binding was detected to the monomeric IgG. The binding to aggregated IgG was blocked by 3G8, a mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody that blocks the ligand binding site, indicating that the aggregated IgG binding is via that of the normal Fc\u03b3RIIIA ligand binding site (). Soluble rFc\u03b3RIIB was also characterized and shown to bind to IgG with similar characteristics as the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA (data not shown).","6.2 Formation of Soluble Fc\u03b3R Tetrameric Complexes","Materials and Methods","Construction of Plasmids for Expression of Soluble FcR\u03b3IIIA and FcR\u03b3IIB Fused to the AVITAG Peptide.","To generate soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes, the soluble region of the human FcRgIIIA gene (amino acids 7-203) was amplified by PCR (Table 1), digested with BamHI\/HindIII and ligated into the pET25b(+) (Novagen). This vector was digested with SalI\/Not1, and a 370 bp fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The vector hu3A, (gift from J. Ravetch) was digested with BamHI\/SalI, and a 270 bp fragment containing the N-terminus of FcR\u03b3IIIA was isolated. Both fragments were coligated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), which had been digested with BamH\/NotI to create pcDNA3-FcRgIIIA (amino acids 1-203).","The soluble region of FcR\u03b3IIB (amino acids 33-180) was amplified by PCR (Table I), digested with BglII\/HindIII and ligated into pET25b(+) (Novagen). This vector was digested with BamHI\/NotI, and a 140 bp fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The vector huRIIb(gift from J. Ravetch) was digested with BamHI\/EcoRI, and a 440 by FcR\u03b3IIB N-terminal fragment was isolated. Both of these fragments were co-ligated into pcDNA3.1, which had been digested with BamHI\/Notl to create pcDNA3-FcR\u03b3IIB (amino acids 1-180). Subsequently, the linker-AVITAG sequence was fused to the C-terminus of both Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB. To generate the Fc\u03b3RIIIA-linker-avitag and Fc\u03b3RIIB-linker-avitag constructs, the pcDNA3.1 Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB constructs were digested with Not I and XbaI (both cut in the vector sequence) and a 86 base pair double stranded oligonucleotide consisting of NotI site at the 5\u2032 end and XbaI at the 3\u2032 end was ligated into the vector. This 86 bp fragment was generated by annealing two 5\u2032 phosphorylated reverse complement oligonucleotides (shown in Table 8 as 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 linker.avitag primers) with the restrictions sites for NotI and XbaI already pre-designed. Equal volumes of each primer at 100 ng per ul were mixed and the DNA heated to 90\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes and cooled at room temperature for an hour to anneal. This created a double-stranded DNA fragment ready to be ligated to the pcDNA3.1-Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB constructs digested with the respective enzymes.

J., 199311:1138-1143) at the C-terminus of the protein cloned into pcDNA3.1 were generated by transiently transfecting 293H cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, CA). Supernatants were collected from the cultures and soluble FcR proteins were purified by passing the supernatants over an IgG sepharose column. Concentration of the soluble FcR-AVITAG fusion protein was quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm. The AVITAG present on the soluble FcR proteins was biotinylated according to the manufacturer's protocol (Avidity, CO) with the BirA enzyme, a biotin ligase. A 1:100 final dilution of a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma catalog #P8849) and 1 mg\/ml final concentration of Leupeptin (Sigma L-8511) were added to the mixture to prevent degradation of the proteins. The BirA reaction was incubated at room temperature overnight, following which the solution was concentrated using a Biomax 10K-ultrafiltration device (Millipore) by centrifugation at 3500 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. The protein was loaded onto an FPLC Superdex 200 HR 10\/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech) in Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl to separate the labeled soluble Fc\u03b3R from free biotin.","Determination of the Extent of Biotinylation by Streptavidin Shift Assay","Approximately 80-85% of the protein was biotinylated by the BirA enzyme (Avidity, CO). The streptavidin-shift assay was used to determine the extent of biotinylation of the protein. Biotinylated protein was incubated with streptavidin (MW 60,000 Daltons) in different ratios. Unbiotinylated protein alone and streptavidin alone are included as controls to determine the extent of biotinylation. The incubation is carried out either on ice for 2 hours or overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Samples are analyzed on a 4-12% SDS-PAGE Bis-Tris (Invitrogen, CA) with reducing agent and without boiling of the samples. Streptavidin bound biotinylated protein migrates as a high molecular weight band. The extent of biotinylation is estimated by the amount of monomeric protein left in the sample. Absence of monomeric low molecular weight species and presence of a complex with molecular weight greater than streptavidin alone indicates a high degree of biotinylation.","Formation of Fc\u03b3R Tetrameric Complexes","Formation of Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes was performed according to previously established methodologies for MHC class I tetramers (See Busch, D. H. et al., 1998 8:353-362; Altman, J. D. et al., 1996274: 94-96). The concentration of the biotinylated monomeric Fc\u03b3R was calculated based on absorbance at 280 nm. One molecule of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) (Molecular Probes, OR) has the capacity to bind 4 molecules of biotin. A 5:1 molar ratio of monomeric biotinylated Fc\u03b3R to SA-PE (5\u00d7 monomeric biotinylated Fc\u03b3R: 1\u00d7SA-PE) was used to ensure an excess of biotinylated protein. The calculated molecular weight of SA-PE is 300,000 Daltons, therefore 303 mL of a 1 mg\/mL solution of streptavidin-PE has 1 nmole of SA-PE, which was added to 5 nmole of protein. Efficient formation of tetrameric protein requires SA-PE to be added in step-wise increments. Half the amount of SA-PE was added upfront, and the remaining SA-PE was added in small aliquots every 20-30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. in the dark. The intervals for the addition of the remaining SA-PE is flexible. After the addition of SA-PE was complete, the solution was concentrated and loaded over an FPLC size exclusion column as above in phosphate buffered saline, at pH 7.4. The fraction that eluted in the void volume with a molecular weight greater than SA-PE alone was collected. Protease inhibitors were replenished to prevent protein degradation. The solution was concentrated and additional protease inhibitors were added to the final complex for storage. The final concentration of the soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complex was calculated based on the starting concentration of the biotinylated monomeric protein. For example, if 500 \u03bcg of biotinylated protein was used to make the tetrameric complex and the final concentrated tetramers were in a volume of 500 \u03bcL the concentration is estimated to be approximately 1 mg\/mL (The losses incurred during concentration are not taken into account as it is difficult to accurately determine how much is lost during each step of the formation of the tetramers. It is also not possible to take an absorbance at 280 nm to measure the concentration due to interference from the PE). Soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes were dispensed in small aliquots at \u221280\u00b0 C. for long term storage with protease inhibitors. Sodium azide was not added to these preparations as the tetramers were used for screening a yeast display library. On thawing an aliquot, the tetramers were stored at 4\u00b0 C. for up to 1 week.","ELISA Assay for Characterizing the Tetrameric Fc\u03b3R Complexes","An ELISA was used to characterize the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes. Maxisorb F96 well plate (Nunc) was coated with 25 ng of human IgG in PBS buffer, and incuvated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The plates were washed with PBS\/0.5% BSA\/0.1% Tween 20 (wash and diluent buffer) before adding the combination of Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers and test antibodies to determine blocking with 3G8, a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody as described below: The blocking step was performed as follows: soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers at a fixed 0.5 mg\/ml final concentration were pre-incubated with antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in buffer, PBS\/0.5% BSA\/0.1% Tween 20. The final concentrations of the antibodies ranged from 60 mg\/mL to 0.25 mg\/mL. 3G8 is a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody, and for the purpose of this experiment, a chimeric version was used, i.e., the variable region of the antibody is a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA and the constant region of the heavy and light chains is from the IgG1 human region. A chimeric 4.4.20. D265A was also used in this experiment, which is an anti-fluorescein antibody, such that the Fc region contains a mutation at position 265, where an aspartic acid is substituted with alanine in the human IgG1, which results in a reduced binding to Fc\u03b3R. This antibody has been characterized previously (See Clynes et al., 20006: 443-446; Shields et al., 2001276: 6591-6604). This antibody was used as negative isotype control.","The antibodies were allowed to bind to Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers, by pre-incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the IgG on the washed plate and incubated for and additional hour at room temperature. The plate was washed with buffer and DJ130c (a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody available from DAKO, Denmark; its epitope is distinct from that of the 3G8 antibody) at 1:5000 dilution was added and allowed to incubate for 1 hr. at room temperature in order to detect the bound Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers. Unbound antibodies were washed out with buffer and the bound DJ130c was detected with goat anti-mouse peroxidase (Jackson laboratories). This reagent will not detect the human Fc. After washing out the unbound peroxidase-conjugated antibody, the substrate, TMB reagent (BioFx), was added to detect the extent of blocking with 3G8 versus the isotype control and the developed color was read at 650 nm.","For direct binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to IgG by ELISA, maxisorb plates were coated with 25 ng IgG as described above. The soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA were added from 20 mg\/mL to 0.1 mg\/mL and the biotinylated monomeric soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA were added at concentrations ranging from 20 mg\/mL to 0.16 mg\/mL. Detection was the same as above with DJ130c, followed by goat anti-mouse-peroxidase antibody. Color developed with the TMB reagent and the plate was read at 650 nm.","Results","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA Tetrameric Complex Binds Monomeric Human IgG Via its Normal Ligand Binding Site","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA-AVITAG fusion proteins were generated, isolated, and analyzed as described in the Material and Methods section using an ELISA assay and were shown to have similar properties as the non-AVITAG soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA protein (data not shown). The fusion proteins were biotinylated, and the tetrameric complexes were generated as described above.","The soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complex was then assessed for binding its ligand, monomeric human IgG, using an ELISA assay. Analysis by ELISA showed the soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes bind monomeric human IgG specifically. As shown in , binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to monomeric human IgG is blocked by 3G8, a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3IIIA monoclonal antibody, as monitored by the absorbance at 650 nm. On the other hand, the 4-4-20 monoclonal antibody harboring the D265A mutation was not able to block the binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to monomeric human IgG (). This experiment thus confirms that binding of the soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA complex occurs through the native ligand binding site.","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA Tetrameric Complex Binds Monomeric Human IgG with a Greater Avidity than Monomeric Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA","The direct binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to aggregated human IgG was assessed using an ELISA assay and compared to the direct binding of soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to monometic human IgG. As shown in , soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA binds human IgG with a higher avidity (8-10 fold) than the soluble monomeric receptor, as monitored by the absorbance at 450 nm.","The binding of soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was also assayed using magnetic beads coated with Fc Fragment purified from IgG1 (). Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex binds to the IgG1 Fc-coated beads, under conditions in which monomer binding is not detected. Specificity of binding was shown by pre-incubating the receptor complex, with an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody, LNK16, which blocks Fc binding. This assay further confirms that soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex binds monomeric IgG through its normal ligand binding site, and the avidity of the receptor is increased due to multiple binding sites within the complex.","6.3 Construction of Yeast Strain for Display of Mutant IgG1 Fc Domains","Materials and Methods","The pYD1 vector (Invitrogen) is derived directly from a yeast replicating vector, pCT302 (Shusta, et al., 2000 18: 754-759, that has been successfully used to display T-cell receptors and a number of scFVs. This plasmid is centromeric and harbors the TRP1 gene enabling a relatively constant copy number of 1-2 plasmids per cell in a trpl yeast strain. Directional cloning into the polylinker places the gene of interest under the control of the GAL1 promoter and in-frame with AGA2. Fusion of the IgG Fc domain to the yeast Aga2p results in the extracellular secretion of the Aga2-Fc fusion protein and subsequent display of the Fc protein on the cell wall via disulfide bonding to the yeast Aga 1p protein, which is an integral cell wall protein.","In order to optimize the display levels, different fragments from the IgG1 heavy chain were amplified by PCR and cloned into pYD1. Specifically, the Fc region of the IgG1 heavy chain (allotype IG1m(a); amino acids 206-447) was amplified by PCR (Table 1) from the IMAGE clone 182740, digested with EcoRI\/SaII and ligated into the pYD1 vector (Invitrogen). The initial clone from IMAGE contained a deletion of a single nucleotide at position 319 which was corrected by in vitro site directed mutagenesis to construct pYD-GIF206 (Quickchange, Stratagene).","The CH1-CH3 fragment (amino acids 118-447) was amplified from the heavy chain clone of the MAb B6.2 in the pCINEO vector using a 5\u2032 oligo (mcr025; chl(f)) and a 3\u2032 oligo (H021) (See Table 8). The fragment was digested with BamHI\/NotI and ligated into the pYD1 vector to construct pYD-CH1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0479","num":"0478"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"J. Immunol. Meth. "},"6.4 Immunolocalization and Characterization of Fc Domains on the Yeast Cell Wall","Materials and Methods","Constructs containing the Aga2p-Fc fusion proteins and a control vector, pYDI, lacking any insert, were transformed into the yeast strain EBY100 (Invitrogen), MATa ura3-52 trpl leu2\u0394l his3\u0394200 pep4::HIS3 prb1\u03941.6R can1 GAL:: GAL-AGA1, using a standard lithium acetate yeast transformation protocol (Gietz et al., 1992 20: 1425) Subsequently, tryptophan prototrophs were selected on defined media. Amplification of independent cell populations and induction of Aga1p and the Aga2p-Fc fusion proteins were accomplished by growth in glucose, followed by growth in media containing galactose as the primary carbon source for 24-48 hrs at 20\u00b0 C. Growth in galactose induces expression of the Aga2-Fc fusion proteins via the GAL1 promoter, which subsequently leads to the display of the Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface.","Results","FACS Analysis of Fc Fusion Proteins Expression of Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface was analyzed by immunostaining using a PE-conjugated polyclonal F(ab)goat anti-human Fc\u03b3R and HP6017 (Sigma) antibody (Jackson Immununoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Fluorescence microscopy shows peripheral staining for the three Fc fusion proteins. The control strain, harboring vector alone, shows little or no staining (data not shown). FACS analysis was used to quantitate the staining (). The yeast strain containing the CH1-CH3 fusion demonstrated the highest percentage of cells stained with both antibodies ( and F). The GIF227 construct showed the greatest mean fluorescence intensity (, panels C and G).","Characterization of the Binding of Fc Fusion Proteins Expressed on the Yeast Cell Surface","The natural context of the Fc and Fc\u03b3R proteins places the receptor on the cell surface and the Fc as the soluble ligand; however, the yeast Fc surface display reverses the geometry of the natural interaction. Detection of the IgG1 Fc proteins on the surface of the yeast cell wall is complicated by both the low affinity of the Fc\u03b3R for its ligand and the reverse geometry inherent in the display system. Although the latter point cannot be altered, the avidity of the ligand was improved as explained above by forming soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes, which allows detection of Fc\u03b3R binding to the Fc fusion proteins expressed on the surface yeast cell wall.","To characterize the binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes to the surface displayed Fc fusion proteins, yeast cells expressing different Fc constructs were incubated with the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex and analyzed by FACS. Yeast cells harboring pYD-CH1, displaying the wild type CH1-CH3 construct were bound by the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex as shown by FACS analysis. The GIF206 and GIF227 strains, however, showed little or no binding to the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex as shown by FACS analysis (data not shown).","Mutations in the Fc region that block binding to the Fc\u03b3Rs have been identified (Shields et al., 2001276: 6591-6604). One of these mutations, D265A, was incorporated into pYD-CH1 and this mutant was expressed on the yeast cell surface. These cells were incubated with the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex using a high concentration of ligand (0.15 mM of Fc; 7.5 mM of D265A) FACS analysis indicated that soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex bound to wild type Fc () but soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex did not bind to the D265A-Fc mutant indicating that Fc\u03b3R is interacting with the normal FcR binding site in the lower hinge-CH2 region ().","Antibodies against the Fc\u03b3RIIIA ligand binding site blocked binding of the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex to the wild type Fc protein displayed on the yeast cell surface wall, as analyzed by FACS (). The binding of soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was blocked by the 3G8 antibody, as well as the LNK16 antibody, another anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody (Advanced Immunological) (Tam et al., 1996 157: 1576-1581) and was not blocked by an irrelevant isotype control. Therefore, binding of soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex to the Fc proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface occurs through the normal ligand binding site. The limited binding of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex indicates that a subpopulation of cells have a correctly folded Fc that is accessible to Fc\u03b3R. There are numerous reasons why only a subpopulation of cells may be able to bind the ligand, for example, they may be at different stages of cell cycle or the fusion proteins may not have been exported.","In order to determine the dissociation constant of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA-tetramer binding to the Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface, the binding of a range of Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was analyzed using FACS. Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was titrated at concentrations of 1.4 \u03bcM to 0.0006 \u03bcM. Using the mean fluorescence intensity as a measure of binding affinity and nonlinear regression analysis, the Kwas determined to be 0.006 \u03bcM (+\/\u22120.001) (data not shown).","6.5 Construction of Fc Mutant Library","A mutant Fc library was constructed using primers flanking the Fc fragment in the Fc-CH1 construct and error-prone PCR (Genemorph, Stratagene). The CH1-CH3 insert in vector pYD-CHI was amplified using a mutagenic PCR (Genemorph, Stratagene). Five reactions were carried out using the pYD-upstream and pYD-downstream primers (Invitrogen). The resultant amplified fragment was digested with XHOI\/BamHI and ligated into pYD1. The ligation reaction was then transformed into XL10 ultracompetent cells (Stratagene), which resulted in \u02dc1\u00d710transformants, with 80% of the transformants containing inserts.","Sequence analysis of 28 random plasmids from the library indicated a mutation frequency \u02dc2-3 mutations\/kb with a breakdown of 40% conserved nucleotide changes and 60% of the mutations resulting in amino acid changes.","The library was transformed into the yeast strain EBY100, MAT\u03b1 ura3-52 trp l leu2\u03941 his3\u0394200 pep4::HIS3 prb1\u03941.6R can l GAL GAL-AGA 1::URA3 to a high efficiency, \u02dc3.3\u00d710transformants\/ug, in 30 independent transformation reactions to create a total of \u02dc10yeast transformants (Gietz, et al., 199220: 1425). The library was pooled and amplified by growth in glucose.","6.6 Selection and Analysis of Fc Mutants","Materials and Methods","ELISA Assay for Screening Fc Mutants","ELISA plates (Nunc F96 MaxiSorp Immunoplate) were coated with 50 ml\/well of 0.5 mg\/ml BSA-FITC in carbonate buffer at 4\u00b0 C., and allowed to incubate overnight. Plates were washed with 1\u00d7PBS\/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) 3 times. 200 ml\/well of PBST\/0.5% BSA was added and the plates were incubated for 30 mins at room temperature. Plates were washed three additional times with PBST. 50 ml\/well of 1:4 diluted 4-4-20 antibody (approximately 3 mg\/mL which would lead to a final concentration of 0.7-0.8 mg\/well) either wild type or containing an Fc mutant, was added from conditional medium in PBST\/0.5% BSA and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. Purified, biotinylated monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA at 3 mg\/ml (in PBST\/0.5% BSA) was added (50 \u03bcl\/well) to the plates and allowed to incubate for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. 50 ml\/well of a 1:5000 dilution of Streptavidin-HRP (Pharmacia, RPN 123v) in PBST\/0.5% BSA was added and the plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. 80 ml\/well of TMB reagent (BioFX) was then added to the plates, and allowed to incubate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature in a dark place. The reactions were finally stopped by adding 40 ml\/well of stop solution (0.18 M sulfuric acid). Plates were then monitored for absorbance at 450 nm. After the first screen, the interesting candidates were further confirmed by serial titration of 4-4-20-Fc mutants in the immuno-complex based binding ELISA. A few modifications were made in this ELISA. For coating the plates, 2 mg\/ml BSA-FITC was used. Based on IgG quantitation results, diluted 4-4-20Fc (wild type or mutants) from conditional medium was added to a final concentration of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.063, and 0 mg\/ml in PBST\u2212\/0.5% BSA.","FACS Screen for the Cell Surface Displayed Fc Proteins","Cells were grown in at least 10 mls of HSM-Trp-Ura pH 5.5 with glucose for 16-24 hrs or until ODwas greater than 2.0. Cells were spun down at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in an equal volume of HSM-Trp-Ura, pH 7.0 with galactose. In a 125 ml flask, 36 mls of galactose media was added, and inoculated with 9 mls of culture, which was incubated at 20\u00b0 C. with shaking for 24-48 hrs. Growth was monitored by measuring ODat 8-16 hr intervals. Cells were harvested at 2K rpm for 5 minutes, and resuspended in an equal volume of 1\u00d7PBS, pH 7.4.","Equilibrium Screen:","An appropriate amount of cells was incubated while maintaining an excess of ligand. For example, it is preferred to start with a number of cells needed to ensure 10-fold coverage of the library. For the first sort with a library containing 10transformants, 10cells should be used. In fact it is best to start with 10cells to compensate for loss during the staining protocol.","Incubation was typically done in a 1.5 mL tube in volumes of 20-100 mls for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. in the dark on a rotator (incubation buffer: 1\u00d7PBS pH7.4; 1 mg\/ml BSA).

Cells were analyzed by FACS and sort gates were used to select the cells that showed the highest affinity for the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex relative to the amount of Fc expression on the cell surface (). For example, a cell containing a mutant Fc that binds better to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex may express fewer Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface, and this cell will be in the lower left hand corner of the sort gate.","Four consecutive sorts were done to enrich for those mutants that showed the highest affinity for the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex. The gates for each successive sort were 5.5%, 1%, 0.2% and 0.1%. After the last sort, cells were plated onto selective media and individual colonies were isolated. Each individual colony represented a clonal population of cells harboring a single Fc mutant within the Aga2-Fc fusion protein. Initially 32 independent colonies were picked and tested by FACS for binding to soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex (). Eighteen mutants showed an increase in binding intensity as measured by the percentage of cells bound by soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex and the mean fluorescence intensity of the bound cells.","Mutations showing an increase in binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA were also tested for binding to soluble Fc\u03b3RIIB tetrameric complex (). Most mutations that lead to an increase in binding to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex also resulted in detection of Fc\u03b3RIIB tetrameric complex staining (). Based on both previous physical and genetic data, some mutations that increase binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, are expected to also increase binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB (Shields et al., 2001276: 6591-6604; Sondermann et al., 2000406: 267-273).","Analysis of Mutants in a 4-4-20 MAb Produced in a Human Cell Line.","Isolation and analysis of mutations in the yeast system allows for fast identification of novel mutant alleles. The use of a heterologous system to isolate mutations could result in the identification of mutations that enhance binding through an alteration that results in misfolding or alteration in glycosylation that is specific to yeast. To analyze the Fc mutations in an immunoglobulin molecule that is produced in human cells, the mutants were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, containing the heavy chain of the anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody, 4-4-20 (Kranz et al., 1982 257(12): 6987-6995). The mutant 4-4-20 heavy chains were transiently coexpressed with the light chain clones in the human kidney cell line (293H). Supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA ().","According to the ELISA assay, the majority of the mutants that were identified as having an enhanced affinity for the soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA complex, in the secondary FACS analysis, also showed an increase in binding to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex when present in the Fc region of the 4-4-20 monoclonal antibody produced in the human cell line (). Two mutants, number 16 and number 19, however, showed a decrease in binding to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA monomeric complex.","Table 10, summarizes the mutations that have been identified and their corresponding binding characteristics to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, as determined by both yeast display based assays and ELISA.

Fc Mutants","Kinetic parameters of the binding of ch4-4-20 antibodies harboring Fc mutants to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB were analyzed using a BIAcore assay (BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). The Fc\u03b3RIIIA used in this assay was a soluble monomeric protein, the extracellular region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA joined to the linker-AVITAG sequence as described in Section 6.2 supra. The Fc\u03b3RIIB used in this assay was a soluble dimeric protein prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/439,709 filed on Jan. 13, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the Fc\u03b3RIIB used was the extracellular domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB fused to the hinge-CH2-CH3 domain of human IgG2.","BSA-FITC (36 \u03bcg\/mL in 10 mM Acetate Buffer at pH 5.0) was immobilized on one of the four flow cells (flow cell 2) of a sensor chip surface through amine coupling chemistry (by modification of carboxymethyl groups with mixture of NHS\/EDC) such that about 5000 response units (RU) of BSA-FITC was immobilized on the surface. Following this, the unreacted active esters were \u201ccapped off\u201d with an injection of 1M Et-NH2. Once a suitable surface was prepared, ch 4-4-20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations were passed over the surface by one minute injections of a 20 \u03bcg\/mL solution at a 5 \u03bcL\/mL flow rate. The level of ch-4-4-20 antibodies bound to the surface ranged between 400 and 700 RU. Next, dilution series of the receptor (Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein) in HBS-P buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Surfactant P20, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) were injected onto the surface at 100 \u03bcL\/min Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions was carried out by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4; 3M NaCl.","The same dilutions of the receptor were also injected over a BSA-FITC surface without any ch-4-4-20 antibody at the beginning and at the end of the assay as reference injections.","Once an entire data set was collected, the resulting binding curves were globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the manufacturer, BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). These algorithms calculate both the Kand K, from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants (i.e., K\/K). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluation Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.).","Binding curves for two different concentrations (200 nM and 800 nM for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and 200 nM and 400 nM for Fc\u03b3RIIB fusion protein) were aligned and responses adjusted to the same level of captured antibodies, and the reference curves were subtracted from the experimental curves. Association and dissociation phases were fitted separately. Dissociation rate constant was obtained for interval 32-34 sec of the dissociation phase; association phase fit was obtained by a 1:1 Langmuir model and base fit was selected on the basis Rand chicriteria.","Results",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0541","num":"0540"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 15","FIG. 16","FIG. 17","FIG. 18"],"sub":["off ","D ","off ","off ","D ","off "]},"The kinetic parameters (Kand K) that were determined from the BIAcore analysis correlated with the binding characteristic of the mutants as determined by an ELISA assay and the functional activity of the mutants as determined in an ADCC assay. Specifically, as seen in Table 13, mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild-type protein, and had an enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA as determined by an ELISA assay had an improved Kfor Fc\u03b3RIIIA (i.e., a lower K). Therefore, a lower Kvalue for Fc\u03b3RIIIA for a mutant Fc protein relative to a wild type protein may be likely to have an enhanced ADCC function. On the other hand, as seen in Table 14, mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild-type protein, and had a reduced binding for Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein as determined by an ELISA assay had a higher Kfor Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein.","Thus, the Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB can be used as predictive measures of how a mutant will behave in a functional assay such as an ADCC assay. In fact, ratios of Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein of the mutants to the wild type protein were plotted against ADCC data (). Specifically, in the case of Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIIA, the ratio of K(wt)\/K(mutant) was plotted against the ADCC data; and in the case of Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIB, the ratio of K(mut)\/K(wt) was plotted against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one (1) show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc relative to wild type. Mutants that fall within the indicated box have a lower off rate for Fc\u03b3RIIIA binding and a higher off-rate for Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc binding, and possess an enhanced ADCC function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0544","num":"0543"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 13"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Kinetic parameters of FcRIIIa binding to ch4-4-20Ab obtained by"},{"entry":"\u201cseparate fit\u201d of 200 nM and 800 nM binding curves"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"92.79mm","wi":"73.49mm","file":"US09028815-20150512-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0545","num":"0544"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00016","num":"00016"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 14"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Kinetic parameters of FcRIIB-Fc binding to wild type and mutant ch4-4-20Ab "},{"entry":"obtained by \u201cseparate fit\u201d of 200 nM and 800 nM binding curves."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"97.62mm","wi":"73.07mm","file":"US09028815-20150512-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"6.9 Screening for Fc Mutants Using Multiple Rounds of Enrichment Using a Solid Phase Assay","The following mutant screens were aimed at identifying additional sets of mutants that show improved binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB.

Therefore, the data suggested that sequential depletion and selection using magnetic beads (solid phase) under the established conditions did not efficiently select for differential binding of Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB. Therefore, in order to screen more effectively for mutants that bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA, while having reduced or no binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB, the solid phase Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion step was combined with Fc\u03b3RIIIA selection by FACs sort. This combination identified Fc variants that bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA with greater or equal affinity than wild-type Fc.","A 10-fold excess of the na\u00efve library (\u02dc10) was incubated with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the non-bound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Those yeast cells that were not bound to the beads were removed and placed in fresh media and subsequently reinduced in media containing galactose. The Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion by magnetic beads was repeated 5 times. The resulting yeast population was analyzed and found to show greater than 50% cell staining with goat anti-human Fc and a very small percentage of cells were stained with Fc\u03b3RIIIA. These cells were then selected twice by a FACS sort using 0.1 \u03bcM biotinylated Fc\u03b3RIIIA linker-avitag (data not shown). The Fc\u03b3RIIIA was the 158V allotype. Yeast cells were analyzed for both Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB binding after each sort and compared to binding by wild-type Fc domain ().","The selected yeast cells from the second sort were then grown under selective conditions in glucose.
