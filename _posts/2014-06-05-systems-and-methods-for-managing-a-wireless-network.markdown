{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/831,471, titled \u201cFramework for Management Plane Functionality and Interfaces,\u201d filed on Jun. 5, 2013, which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to wireless network architecture and, in particular embodiments, to a system and method for managing a wireless network.","Driven largely by smart phones, tablets, and video streaming, the amount of wireless data handled by wireless networks has risen markedly and is expected to continue to rise by orders of magnitude over the next ten years. In addition to the sheer volume of data, the number of devices is expected to continue to grow exponentially, possibly reaching into the billions of devices, along with radically higher data rates. Different applications will place different requirements on the performance of future wireless networks. Future wireless networks are expected to be highly flexible, highly efficient, open, and customizable for customers and consumers.","An embodiment method of managing a wireless network includes managing an infrastructure topology for the wireless network. The wireless network includes a plurality of network nodes. The method further includes managing a connection of a user equipment (UE) to the wireless network. The method further includes managing a customer service provided to the UE over the connection.

It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that may be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.","The advent of cloud-based networking has complicated the ability of future wireless networks to satisfy expected demands for higher throughput, lower latencies, lower energy, lower costs, and drastically more numerous connections. Cloud-based networking fundamentally redefines the endpoints and the time frame for which network services are provisioned. It requires the network be much more nimble, flexible, and scalable. Thus, technologies such as network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) have become increasingly important in building future wireless networks. NFV enables network functions that are traditionally tied to hardware to run on a cloud computing infrastructure in a data center. Although the separation of the data plane, the control plane, and the management plane may not be feasible in the commercial cloud, the separation of those network functions from the hardware infrastructure will be a cornerstone of future wireless network architectures. One benefit is the ability to elastically support network functional demands. SDN is an architectural framework for creating intelligent programmable networks, where the control planes and the data planes are decoupled, network intelligence and state are logically centralized, and the underlying network infrastructure is abstracted from the application.","It is realized herein that a framework is needed for future wireless network operation that comprehends the prevalence of virtual networks and centralized control of resources. A virtual network (VN) is a collection of resources virtualized for a given service. It is realized herein that a framework of management plane functionality is needed to guide design and implementation of future wireless networks. It is further realized herein the framework can identify management plane functionality, include management plane interfaces, and include operation procedures. Management plane functionality can include infrastructure management, device connectivity management, customer service management, and status analysis management, among other functionality.","Infrastructure management functionality provides management capability for infrastructure topology adaptation according to network congestion and traffic load. Infrastructure management functionality allows integration of wireless networks of multiple providers. It also provides for spectrum management of a radio access network (RAN) and spectrum sharing among various co-located wireless networks. Infrastructure management also includes access (MAP) management and air interface management.","Device connectivity management functionality provides management capability for per-device attachment to the wireless network, including media access control (MAC) status, location tracking, and paging. Device connectivity management functionality includes defining customized and scenario-aware location tracking schemes. Device connectivity management functionality also provides for a software-defined and virtual per-mobile-user geographic location tracking entity and a triggering of user-specific data plane topology updates. Device connectivity management functionality also provides user-specific virtual network migration and location tracking as a service (LTaaS). A UE's location is relative to the network or, more specifically, relative to a set of potential network nodes that could provide network access to the UE. LTaaS provides UE location tracking and location information to the UE's home operator or a global UE location information management center, which is generally managed by a third party. The information can then be accessed and used by other operators, VN operators, and others.","Customer service management functionality provides management capability for customers' private information, authorization of device access, device security, and negotiation of service quality of experience (QoE). Customer service management functionality includes per-service QoE management as well as charging services. Customer service management functionality also provides customer specific context for connections and services. This includes QoE monitoring, charging, and billing.","Status analysis management functionality provides management capability for on-demand network status analysis and QoE assurance. More specifically, status analysis management functionality provides for management of on-demand network status analytics, management of on-demand service QoE status analytics, and data analytics as a service (DAaaS).","It is further realized herein the management plane functionality required in a wireless network can vary among devices and can depend on a device's state. The various devices in a wireless network include customer devices, i.e., user equipment (UE), and operator nodes, i.e., base stations or radio nodes. It is realized herein that a customer device can be powered on or off, and, while on, can be active or idle, all of which is referred to as the customer device's state. It is also realized herein that an operator node can also be powered on or off and, while on, can be active, idle, or inactive. Furthermore, an operator node's state can vary among its respective subsystems. For example, an operator node's access subsystem may be active, idle, or inactive while powered on, while the operator node's backhaul subsystem may be active or inactive. Similarly, the operator node's sensor subsystem may be active or inactive while powered on.","While in an active state, a UE continuously searches and monitors for feedback channel quality indicators (CQI). A continuous process is one that is carried out at every transmission interval. For example, if the transmission interval is 1 millisecond, then the UE searches and monitors periodically, where the period is 1 millisecond. The UE also continuously sends signals enabling uplink (UL) CQI estimation. On the network side, while the UE is active, a VN\u2014active is established. The configuration of the VN\u2014active depends on the UE's mobility, required QoE, and network status. Also, while the UE is active, the network maintains contexts above and below layer-2, including automatic repeat request (ARQ) and hybrid ARQ (HARQ) below; and flow\/service ID mapping to ID defined in the access link (AL), location, states, authentication keys, sessions, and QoE above.","While in an idle state, the UE has an idle state ID and remains attached to the network. The UE continuously searches and monitors the network for measurement purposes and location updates. The UE may also perform mobility monitoring\/tracking and location synchronization with the network. In certain embodiments, the UE carries out network monitoring conditionally. The UE also transmits and receives short data bursts without going back to active state. On the network side, while the UE is idle, a VN\u2014idle is established. The configuration of the VN\u2014idle depends on the UEs mobility, required QoE, and network status. The VN\u2014idle can have no dedicated physical network resources or can have partially dedicated physical network resources, for example, between a user-specific virtual serving gateway (v-u-SGW) and other gateways (GWs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","110","120","130","130","120","110","120","122","140","1","140","120"]},"Architecture  also includes various databases that are occasionally accessed by management plane  in carrying out its functionalities.

In the idle state, the access subsystem carries out no DL RF transmissions, but continuously carries out UL receiving and monitoring. While inactive, the access subsystem shuts down RF activity, including DL and UL.","A backhaul subsystem, in the active state, carries out RF transmissions and continuously receives and monitors RF transmissions.
