abstract: The present invention relates to methods for synthesizing energetic compounds and intermediates thereof. Specifically, the present invention relates to methods for synthesizing adamantanes and intermediates that are useful in such synthesis. Synthesized intermediates are useful in the synthesis of bicyclic and tricyclic substituted adamantanes. Examples of various intermediates are: acyclic 2-nitromalonaldehyde intermediates, 2,6,9-tri-substituted-4,8-dinitro-2,6,9-triazabicyclo[3.3.1]nona-3,7-dienes and 2,6-dinitro-4,8,9,10-tetra-aza-4,8,9,10-tetra-substituted adamantanes. Intermediates synthesized according to the methods of the present invention are useful toward the synthesis of tetraaza-adamantanes, which can serve as precursors to potentially superior new high-energy-density compounds (HEDCs).

Adamantane was first synthesized in 1941 by V. Prelog from Meerwein's ester. Adamantanes have highly rigid skeletons with cores that exhibit very little strain and thus exhibit high thermal stability. However, steric considerations have hampered the synthesis of stable, more energetic substituted adamantanes.","Accordingly, there is a need for intermediates and synthetic methods for making substituted adamantanes. Specifically, synthetic methods that enable substitution of some of the framework carbon atoms by nitrogen atoms are important because adjusting the carbon and nitrogen atom counts may be desirable for attaining optimum explosive properties.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter.

Analysis of the crude reaction mixture by HRMS detected the intended product ion (M+H) 591.30675 (A \u02dc2.3K); calcd for CHNO(M+H) 591.27198. Expansion showed an ion (M+1)H 592.34379 and ion (M+2)H 593.36871. The major component of the reaction products mixture was unreacted BC1 which was confirmed by HRMS, calcd for CHNO(M+H) 484.1985, obsd 484.19637 (A \u02dc72K); and H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d) was consistent with structure for BC1 (25H).","Finally, any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations (for example, by using the term \u201cabout\u201d) that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
