The United States Government has certain rights in the present invention.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates to radiation-hardened circuits in general, and in particular to a single-event upset hardened ring oscillator.","2. Description of Related Art","When a high-energy particle impinges upon an integrated circuit (IC) device, the high-energy particle ionizes the regions of the IC device through which it travels. This ionization creates mobile charges in the vicinity of the high-energy particle's travel path, thereby generating a transient pulse, and the transient pulse may produce a Single Event Upset (SEU) within the IC device. An SEU may change critical data and\/or alter the processing state of an IC device. Depending upon severity, an affected circuit or device may require a power reset in order to recover from an SEU.","Conventional ring oscillators are vulnerable to SEUs. An SEU is less likely to occur if the magnitude of its associated transient pulse is significantly less than the magnitude of regular signals within an IC device. Thus, one way to minimize SEU susceptibility is by using large-area devices that generally operate using larger magnitude signals. However, large-area devices consume more power and necessitate higher manufacturing costs.","Consequently, it would be desirable to provide an SEU hardened ring oscillator with minimal circuit redundancy, which can be manufactured by using conventional IC fabrication techniques.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a ring oscillator includes a first tri-path inverter, a second tri-path inverter and a third tri-path inverter. The second tri-path inverter is connected to the first tri-path inverter. The third tri-path inverter is connected to the first and second tri-path inverters to provide feedback for oscillations.","All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.","Referring now to the drawings and in particular to , there is illustrated a circuit diagram of a conventional single-event upset (SEU) hardened ring oscillator. As shown, a ring oscillator  includes a first dual-path inverter , a second dual-path inverter  and a third dual-path inverter . Each of first, second and third dual-path inverters , ,  includes a first inverter  having a PMOS transistor P and a NMOS transistor N along with a second inverter  having a PMOS transistor P and a NMOS transistor N. First dual-path inverter  includes a first output  and a second output , which are provided by first inventer  and second inverter , respectively. Similarly, second dual-path inverter  includes first and second outputs , ; third dual-path inverter  includes first and second outputs , . Third dual-path inverter's first and second outputs ,  also serve as first output O and second output O for ring oscillator .","Any given dual-path inverter's first output , ,  is coupled to PMOS transistor P and NMOS transistor N of a subsequent dual-path inverter. Similarly, any given dual-path inverter's second output , ,  is coupled to NMOS transistor N and PMOS transistor P of a subsequent dual-path inverter.","PMOS transistors P, P within inverters ,  are coupled to a positive power supply node. NMOS transistor N within inverter  is coupled to a first low-reference voltage VS. Similarly, NMOS transistor N within inverter  is coupled to a second low-reference voltage VS.","Ring oscillator  provides SEU immunity by ensuring that each of dual-path inverter - within ring oscillator  holds the correct logical state when its input values are different. In particular, if the input values to a dual-path inverter agree before an SEU event, the output values of the dual-path inverter will be the inverse logical equivalent of the input values. When an SEU event changes one of the input values of a dual-path inverter such that they no longer agree, one of the output values of the dual-path inverter still holds the correct logical state.","As an example, assume that the values at the inputs (i.e., nodes  and ) of dual-path inverter  are both equal to a logic \u201c0\u201d before an SEU event, which means that both output values of dual-path inverter  equal to a logic \u201c1\u201d before an SEU event. When an SEU event occurs at node , it leads to a temporary value transition from a logic \u201c0\u201d to a logic \u201c1.\u201d This results in a high impedance state equal to a logic \u201c1\u201d at node (output) , and a short circuit state between transistors P and N. In this manner, the correct logic state is maintained at node .","Ring oscillator  provides excellent SEU immunity as long as all SEU events occur between rising and\/or falling transitions on the input nodes to all dual-path inverters - within ring oscillator . Ring oscillator  fails to provide SEU immunity when an SEU event occurs on one of the input nodes during a rising and\/or falling transition. When this occurs, ring oscillator  stops oscillating until noise restarts ring oscillator , and this leads to a large multi-bit (or multi-cycle) SEU.","With reference now to , there is depicted a circuit diagram of a SEU hardened ring oscillator, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown, a ring oscillator  includes a first tri-path inverter , a second tri-path inverter  and a third tri-path inverter . First tri-path inverter  includes a self-voting inverter , a self-voting inverter  and a self-voting inverter . Second tri-path inverter  includes a self-voting inverter , a self-voting inverter  and a self-voting inverter . Third tri-path inverter  includes a self-voting inverter , a self-voting inverter  and a self-voting inverter .","The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to first inputs of self-voting inverters , , . The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to second inputs of self-voting inverters , , . The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to third inputs of self-voting inverters , , .","The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to first inputs of self-voting inverters , , . The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to second inputs of self-voting inverters , , . The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to third inputs of self-voting inverters , , .","The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to first inputs of self-voting inverters , , . The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to second inputs, of self-voting inverters , , . The output of self-voting inverter  is connected to third inputs of self-voting inverters , , . In addition, the output of self-voting inverter  serves as a first output Top_out for ring oscillator , the output of self-voting inverter  serves as a second output Mid_out for ring oscillator , and the output of self-voting inverter  serves as a third output Bot_out for ring oscillator . The couplings between first and third tri-path inverters ,  provide feedback for oscillations in a manner that is well-known to those skilled in the art.","Each of self-voting inverters , ,  is coupled to a first reference voltage VS. Each of self-voting inverters , ,  is coupled to a second reference voltage VS. Each of self-voting inverters , ,  is coupled to a third reference voltage VS. If ring oscillator  is being implemented as a current starved voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), then first reference voltage VS, second reference voltage VS and third reference voltage VS will be replaced by corresponding current mirrors.","Ring oscillator  provides SEU immunity by ensuring that each of tri-path inverters - within ring oscillator  holds the correct logical state when at least two of its three inputs agree with each other. In particular, if the input values to a tri-path inverter agree before an SEU event, the output values of the tri-path inverter will be the inverse logical equivalent of the input values. When an SEU event changes one of the input values to the tri-path inverter such that one of the three input values disagrees with the other two input values, then all three output values will still hold the correct logical state.","Each of tri-path inverters - provides the above-mentioned functionality by utilizing three self-voting inverters that use the same three inputs for each self-voting inverter in a given tri-path inverter, and use three separate outputs. Each self-voting inverter has the logical function of three two-input AND gates connected to a three-input NOR gate, as shown in .
