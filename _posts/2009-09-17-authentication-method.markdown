{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","First Embodiment","Second Embodiment"],"p":["This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-257751, filed on Oct. 2, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","A certain aspect of the embodiments discussed herein is related to an authentication method.","Information processing apparatuses such as personal computers or mobile terminals have a fingerprint authentication function. A user who uses such an information processing apparatus registers the user's own fingerprint data beforehand. With such an arrangement, the user presses his\/her finger into contact with a fingerprint sensor arranged at a predetermined position before the user operates the information processing apparatus. The information processing apparatus receives a fingerprint image of the finger thus pressed into contact therewith by the user, and verifies the fingerprint image thus received against the fingerprint data registered beforehand.","Such an information processing apparatus is required to perform authentication processing with high precision so as to prevent the occurrence of false authentication. In order to solve such a problem, for example, a vein authentication apparatus is known which registers multiple registration data acquired at different image-acquisition positions, thereby providing high-precision authentication even if the user's finger pressed into contact with the fingerprint sensor shifts position.","Furthermore, for example, a fingerprint verification apparatus is known which extracts the wrinkles and scars on the user's finger from the fingerprint image when the fingerprint data is registered, and the information with respect to the features related to the wrinkles and scars thus extracted is stored as the fingerprint data, in addition to the information with respect to the features of the fingerprint ridges, thereby providing high-precision fingerprint verification, even if the surface of the finger is rough or even if the quality of the fingerprint data is poor due to a great number of scars.","A kind of finger which the user can easily press into contact with the fingerprint sensor differs depending upon the position at which the fingerprint sensor is mounted on the information processing apparatus or the direction in which the user moves his\/her finger on the fingerprint sensor. Specifically, in a case in which the fingerprint sensor has been mounted in the vicinity of the keyboard on a notebook personal computer (which will also be referred to as a \u201claptop personal computer\u201d), the user can easily presses his\/her second finger into contact therewith, as compared with his\/her thumb. On the other hand, in a case in which the fingerprint sensor has been mounted in the vicinity of the display such that the user can press his\/her finger sideways into contact therewith, the user can easily press his\/her thumb as compared with his\/her second finger.","Furthermore, some desktop personal computers, laptop personal computers, tablet PCs, and so forth have a function of allowing the display to be turned. In such an information processing apparatus, the position of the fingerprint sensor is also moved as the display is moved. That is to say, the kind of finger which the user can easily press into contact with the fingerprint sensor differs depending upon the position at which the fingerprint sensor is arranged and the position of the display.","However, the aforementioned techniques have been made without giving consideration to which kind of finger the user can easily press into contact with the fingerprint sensor. In some cases, this leads to a problem in that high-precision authentication processing cannot be provided depending upon the position at which the fingerprint sensor is arranged. For example, in a case in which the user has selected a kind of finger which cannot easily be pressed into contact with the fingerprint sensor when the user's fingerprint data is registered, in some cases, there is a gap between the user's finger and the fingerprint sensor, or the user's finger shakes. This leads to a problem of poor-quality fingerprint data being registered, leading to a problem in that the information processing apparatus cannot perform authentication processing with high precision.","Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2007-206991 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2005-352712 have been proposed.","According to an aspect of an embodiment, a method of controlling an apparatus including a display and a sensor for obtaining biometric data of a user, the sensor being movable to take a plurality of angular positions with respect to the apparatus, includes storing a plurality of sets of reference information in association with the positions of the sensor, respectively, determining which one of the angular positions which the sensor is currently taking, displaying on the display a direction as to which one of bodily parts is to be used in accordance with the current angular position of the sensor to urge a user to input biometric data of the one of the bodily parts by the sensor, and carrying out authentication of the user by comparing the inputted biometric data with one of the sets of reference information corresponding to the current angular position of the sensor.","The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","Detailed description will be made below with reference to the drawings regarding embodiments of the authentication method, the authentication program, and the information processing apparatus disclosed in the present specification. It can be noted that such embodiments are by no means intended to restrict the authentication method, the authentication program, and the information processing apparatus disclosed in the present specification.","First, an outline description will be made regarding an information processing apparatus  according to an embodiment 1.  is a diagram for describing, in outline, the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 1. It can be noted that, in the embodiment 1, the information processing apparatus  is a laptop personal computer having a function of allowing the display such as a liquid crystal display to be turned and to be folded up.","As illustrated in the top view in , the information processing apparatus  includes an input unit  such as a keyboard, a mouse, etc., a fingerprint sensor , and a hinge .","The fingerprint sensor  is mounted on a frame of the display unit , and acquires a fingerprint image of the user's finger. Specifically, as illustrated in the top view in , when the fingerprint is input along the direction D, the fingerprint sensor  receives the fingerprint image. That is to say, when the user inputs the user's fingerprint to the information processing apparatus , the user presses his\/her finger into contact with the fingerprint sensor , and moves his\/her finger thus pressed into contact therewith along the direction D.","The hinge  allows the user to turn the display unit  and to tilt the display unit  along the front-back direction when the user manually moves the display unit . In such an example illustrated in , the information processing apparatus  is folded such that the display unit  overlaps the input unit  (Step S) after the display unit  is turned by 180 degrees by the user (Step S). Then, the information processing apparatus  is operated by the user in the state in which the fingerprint sensor  is positioned on the lower side (Step S). In this case, as illustrated in the bottom view in , the fingerprint sensor  receives a fingerprint image when the fingerprint is input along the direction D.","In a case in which the information processing apparatus  is in the state illustrated in the top view in , in general, the kind of finger which the user can easily press into contact with the fingerprint sensor  is thought to be the thumb of the right hand. On the other hand, in a case in which the information processing apparatus  is in the state illustrated in the bottom view in , in general, the kind of finger which the user can easily press into contact with the fingerprint sensor  is thought to be the second finger of the right hand. That is to say, the kind of finger which the user can easily press into contact with the fingerprint sensor  differs depending upon the state in which the information processing apparatus  is operated.","With such an arrangement, the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 1 stores the kinds of fingers which the user can easily press into contact with the fingerprint sensor  in increments of states in which the information processing apparatus  is operated. The information thus stored is set beforehand by the manufacturer (the developer of the information processing apparatus  or the like). When fingerprint data is registered, the information processing apparatus  determines the kind of finger which can be easily input by the user according to the state in which the information processing apparatus  is operated. Then, the information processing apparatus  prompts the user to register the fingerprint data for the user's finger thus determined to be the finger which can be easily input. Thus, the information processing apparatus  allows the user to register fingerprint data which can be easily input, thereby storing high quality fingerprint data. It can be noted that the state in which the information processing apparatus  is operated by the user will be referred to as the \u201coperating state\u201d hereafter.","With such an arrangement, the information processing apparatus  stores fingerprint data for each operating state. That is to say, for example, the information processing apparatus  is capable of storing fingerprint data for all ten fingers in the operating state A. At the same time, the information processing apparatus  is capable of storing fingerprint data for all ten fingers in the operating state B. Furthermore, in a case in which fingerprint data has been registered with respect to multiple kinds of the user's fingers for the same operating state, the information processing apparatus  allows the user to select the finger to be used for authentication. For example, in a case in which fingerprint data for five of the user's fingers has been registered for the operating state A, the information processing apparatus  allows the user to register beforehand which finger is to be used for authentication. It can be noted that, in general, in many cases, the information processing apparatus  allows fingerprint data for two or more fingers to be registered. The reason is that authentication cannot been performed based upon only the data for a single finger in a case in which that single finger has been injured. The apparatus has a display and a sensor for obtaining biometric data of a user, the sensor being movable to take a plurality of angular positions with respect to the apparatus.","Description will be made regarding the aforementioned outline with reference to an example illustrated in . For example, in a case in which the information processing apparatus  has received an instruction from the user to register fingerprint data in a case in which the operating state is that illustrated in the top view in , the information processing apparatus  performs a control operation so as to display a registration screen on the display unit , which allows the user to select the kind of finger which is used to register fingerprint data. In this stage, the information processing apparatus  performs the control operation so as to display character strings, symbols, etc., on the registration screen thus displayed, which indicate that the fingerprint data for the thumb of the right hand can be most easily input. Thus, the information processing apparatus  is capable of prompting the user to register the fingerprint data for the thumb of the right hand.","Moreover, in a case in which the information processing apparatus  has received an instruction from the user to register fingerprint data in a case in which the operating state is that illustrated in the bottom view in , the information processing apparatus  performs the control operation so as to display character strings, symbols, etc., on the registration screen, which indicate that the fingerprint data for the second finger of the right hand can be most easily input. Thus, the information processing apparatus  is capable of prompting the user to register the fingerprint data for the second finger of the right hand.","Then, the information processing apparatus  displays an authentication screen on the display unit  when it is started up or when a predetermined application is started up. Subsequently, the information processing apparatus  receives fingerprint data from the user via the fingerprint sensor . Subsequently, the information processing apparatus  verifies the fingerprint data (which will be referred to as the \u201creference fingerprint data\u201d hereafter) thus received against the fingerprint data registered beforehand (which will be referred to as the \u201cregistered fingerprint data\u201d hereafter).","In this step, the information processing apparatus  selects, from among the multiple registered fingerprint data thus stored, the registered fingerprint data which satisfies the following two conditions. The first condition is satisfied in a case in which the kind of finger which was used to input the registered fingerprint data matches the kind of finger selected by the user as the finger to be used for authentication. The second condition is satisfied in a case in which the operating state of the information processing apparatus  when the registered fingerprint data was input matches the operating state of the information processing apparatus  when the reference fingerprint data was input. In such a way, the information processing apparatus  verifies the reference fingerprint data against the registered fingerprint data thus selected.","It can be noted that, in a case in which the information processing apparatus  stores no registered fingerprint data that satisfies the aforementioned two conditions, the information processing apparatus  verifies the reference fingerprint data against different registered fingerprint data. Such verification processing will be described later.","As described above, the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 1 selects the kind of finger which can be easily used to input fingerprint data according to the operating state when the fingerprint data is registered, and prompts the user to register the fingerprint data for the kind of finger which can be easily input. Thus, the information processing apparatus  allows the user to perform registration for a finger which can be easily input, according to the operating state. As a result, the information processing apparatus  prevents registration of fingerprint data in a state in which there is a gap between the finger and the fingerprint sensor, or in a state in which the finger shakes. Thus, the information processing apparatus  holds high-quality fingerprint data, thereby enabling authentication processing to be performed with high precision.","Next, description will be made regarding the configuration of the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 1.  is a diagram which illustrates the configuration of the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 1. As illustrated in , the information processing apparatus  includes the input unit , the display unit , the fingerprint sensor , a storage unit , and a control unit . The storage stores a plurality of sets of reference information in association with the positions of the sensors, respectively. The controller determines which one of the angular positions the sensor is currently taking, displays on the display a direction as to which one of bodily parts is to be used in accordance with the current angular position of the sensor to urge a user to input biometric data of the one of the bodily parts by the sensor, and carries out authentication of the user by comparing the inputted biometric data with one of the sets of reference information corresponding to the current angular position of the sensor.","The input unit  is an input device for inputting various kinds of information and various kinds of instructions, and is a keyboard or mouse, for example. The input unit  allows the user to perform an operation for registering fingerprint data and to input the user ID. The display unit  is a display device which displays various kinds of information, and is a liquid crystal display, for example. Such a display unit  displays a registration screen which allows the user to select the kind of finger used for the registration of fingerprint data, a selection screen which allows the user to select the finger used for authentication, etc. The fingerprint sensor  is a device which acquires a fingerprint image of the finger of the user.","The storage unit  is a storage device which stores various kinds of information, and includes a recommended information storage unit , a fingerprint data storage unit , and an authentication log . The recommended information storage unit  includes an operating state storage unit , a recommended registration pattern storage unit , and a recommended registration policy storage unit .","The operating state storage unit  stores the operating states which the information processing apparatus  can adopt.  illustrate examples of the operating state storage unit .

The term \u201cturn angle\u201d represents the angle by which the display unit  has been turned. For example, with the turn angle of the information processing apparatus  illustrated in the top view in  as 0 degrees, the turn angle of the information processing apparatus  illustrated in the bottom view in  is 180 degrees.","The term \u201cscreen orientation\u201d represents the orientation of the display unit  when it is operated by the user.

For example, with the resolution of the display unit  as \u201c640\u00d7480\u201d, in a case in which the horizontal resolution of the display unit  is \u201c640\u201d, the screen orientation is defined as \u201chorizontal\u201d. In this case, in a case in which the vertical resolution of the display unit  is \u201c640\u201d, the screen orientation is defined as \u201cvertical\u201d.","It can be noted that, in the present specification, the operating state of the information processing apparatus  illustrated in the top view in  is defined as the standard operating state. Specifically, the standard operating state is defined as the state in which the turn angle of the information processing apparatus  is \u201c0\u201d degrees, and the screen orientation is \u201chorizontal\u201d. With such a state as the standard operating state, in the state of the information processing apparatus  illustrated in the bottom view in , the turn angle is 180 degrees, and the screen orientation is \u201cvertical\u201d.","That is to say, in the first row in the operating state storage unit  illustrated in , the turn angle is set to \u201c0\u201d degrees and the screen orientation is set to \u201chorizontal\u201d, and accordingly, it indicates the operating state of the information processing apparatus  illustrated in the top view in .

It can be noted that the information processing apparatus  includes a recommended registration pattern storage unit  for each pattern of the combination of the kind of finger and the priority level.

Specific description will be made regarding such identification processing. First, the recommended information managing unit  identifies the operating state numbers \u201c001\u201d and \u201c003\u201d in which the screen orientation is set to the same orientation as that in the operating state number \u201c004\u201d, i.e., \u201chorizontal\u201d. Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  selects the operating state number which exhibits the smallest difference in the turn angle from the turn angle \u201c90\u201d degrees in the operating state number \u201c004\u201d. In this case, the difference in the turn angle between the operating state numbers \u201c004\u201d and \u201c001\u201d is \u201c90\u201d degrees. Moreover, the difference in the turn angle between the operating state numbers \u201c004\u201d and \u201c003\u201d is also \u201c90\u201d degrees. Accordingly, the recommended information managing unit  selects \u201c001\u201d, which is the smallest operating state number, as the operating state number which represents the operating state that exhibits the best similarity to the operating state represented by the operating state number \u201c004\u201d.","Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  acquires, from the recommended registration policy storage unit , the recommended registration pattern \u201c1\u201d which is stored in a form associated with the operating state number \u201c001\u201d thus identified as described above. Subsequently, as indicated by the hatched region illustrated in , the recommended information managing unit  instructs the recommended registration policy storage unit  to store a combination of the operating state number \u201c004\u201d and the recommended registration pattern \u201c1\u201d.","The display control unit  controls the display unit  so as to display various kinds of information. Specifically, in a case in which the user has performed an operation so as to register or update the fingerprint data, the display control unit  displays a registration screen on the display unit , which allows the user to select the kind of finger which is used to perform the registration operation or the update operation. In this stage, the display control unit  displays the kinds of fingers and priority levels input from the recommended information managing unit  in a mutually associated manner.  is a diagram which illustrates an example of the registration screen thus displayed under the control of the display control unit . In the example illustrated in , the display control unit  performs the display control operation assuming that the combinations of the kind of finger and priority level are input from the recommended information managing unit  as illustrated in .","As illustrated in , the display control unit  performs the display control operation for the registration screen displaying the kinds of fingers and the priority level with which the registration operation is to be recommended. The registration screen illustrated in  recommends to the user the kind of finger to be used for the registration operation in priority ranking order from \u201cthumb of right hand\u201d, to \u201csecond finger of right hand\u201d, \u201cmiddle finger of right hand\u201d, . . . , \u201clittle finger of left hand\u201d. The user selects the finger to be used for the fingerprint data registration via such a registration screen. Then, the user presses the finger thus selected into contact with the fingerprint sensor , and moves the finger thus selected on the fingerprint sensor , thereby registering the fingerprint data in the information processing apparatus .","It can be noted that the display control unit  does not need to display the information with respect to all the kinds of fingers on the registration screen. Specifically, the display control unit  does not need to display the kinds of fingers which exhibit priority levels which are equal to or lower than a predetermined priority level. For example, the display control unit  does not need to display, on the registration screen, the information with respect to the five fingers of the left hand, which have priority levels equal to or lower than 6. This allows the information processing apparatus  to prevent registration of fingerprint data for fingers when is predicted that it would result in poor quality registered fingerprint data. As a result, the information processing apparatus  holds only high-quality fingerprint data, thereby providing high-precision authentication processing.","Furthermore, in a case in which fingerprint data has been registered for multiple kinds of fingers in the same operating state, the display control unit  performs a display control operation for a selection screen which allows the user to select the finger to be used in the authentication operation. The information processing apparatus  holds the information with respect to the kinds of fingers thus selected via the selection screen thus displayed, in increments of operating states.","Furthermore, when the authentication processing is performed for the user, the display control unit  controls the display unit  so as to display an authentication screen. The authentication screen thus displayed is a screen which allows the user to input a user ID.","The feature value extraction unit  extracts the feature values of a fingerprint image. Specifically, in a case in which the user has performed an operation so as to register or update the fingerprint data, the feature extraction unit  corrects the fingerprint image acquired by the fingerprint sensor , and calculates the feature values of the fingerprint image thus corrected. Then, the feature value extraction unit  outputs the feature values thus calculated to the fingerprint data registration unit . In this step, the feature value extraction unit  outputs, to the fingerprint data registration unit , the operating state number which represents the operating state in the registration step, which is identified by the operating state acquisition unit , and the registration quality such as the degree of block distortion in the fingerprint image, the cumulative edge value for the fingerprint image, etc.","Furthermore, when the authentication processing is performed for the user, the feature value extraction unit  corrects the fingerprint image acquired by the fingerprint sensor , and calculates the feature values of the fingerprint image thus corrected, in the same way as described above. Then, the feature value extraction unit  outputs, to the authentication unit , the feature values of the fingerprint image thus calculated as the reference fingerprint data.","It can be noted that description will be made regarding an example in which the feature values extracted from the fingerprint image are used as the fingerprint data. Also, the fingerprint data may be the fingerprint image itself. In this case, the feature value extraction unit  corrects the fingerprint data acquired by the fingerprint sensor , and does not extract the feature values from the fingerprint image. The feature value extraction unit  outputs the fingerprint image thus corrected to the fingerprint data registration unit  or the authentication unit .","The fingerprint registration unit  registers, in the fingerprint data storage unit , the fingerprint data thus input from the feature value extraction unit . Specifically, the fingerprint data registration unit  instructs the fingerprint data storage unit  to store, as the fingerprint data, the feature values of the fingerprint image thus input from the feature value extraction unit . In this step, the fingerprint data registration unit  instructs the fingerprint data storage unit  to store the user ID input by the user in the registration operation, the operating state number which represents the operating state when the registration was performed, the kind of finger selected by the user via the registration screen, the registration quality of the fingerprint image calculated by the feature value extraction unit , and the date and time at which the registration was performed.","The authentication unit  performs the authentication processing by verifying the reference fingerprint data against the registered fingerprint data. Specifically, in a case in which the reference fingerprint data has been input from the feature value extraction unit , the authentication unit  selects the registered fingerprint data to be used to verify the reference fingerprint data, from among the multiple fingerprint data stored in the fingerprint data storage unit , and verifies the reference fingerprint data against the registered fingerprint data thus selected. Specific description will be made below regarding the registered fingerprint data selection processing performed by the authentication unit .","First, the authentication unit  narrows down the multiple records stored in the fingerprint data storage unit  into records that have the same user ID as that input via the authentication screen. Subsequently, the authentication unit  further narrows down the records thus narrowed down into records for which the kind of finger matches that selected via the selection screen.","Furthermore, in a case in which there are multiple records thus narrowed down, the authentication unit  selects the record for which the operating state number which represents the operating state matches that which has been acquired by the operating state acquisition unit  in the authentication operation. It can be noted that the operating state acquired by the operating state acquisition unit  in the authentication operation will be referred to as the \u201ccurrent operating state\u201d hereafter. Also, the operating state number which represents the current operating state will be referred to as the \u201ccurrent operating state number\u201d hereafter.","In a case in which the fingerprint data storage unit  does not store the current operating state number, the authentication unit  further narrows down the multiple records thus narrowed down to the record with the operating state that is most similar to the current operating state.","The authentication unit  uses the fingerprint data stored in the record thus narrowed down as the registered fingerprint data. Then, the authentication unit  verifies the reference fingerprint data against the registered fingerprint data thus obtained. In a case in which the degree of similarity therebetween is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value, the authentication unit  judges that the user's identity has been confirmed. On the other hand, in a case in which the degree of similarity therebetween is smaller than the predetermined threshold, the authentication unit  selects the record for which the operating state is second-most similar to the current operating state, from among the records thus narrowed down based upon the user ID and the kind of finger, and verifies the reference fingerprint data against the registered fingerprint data stored in the record thus selected.","In the same way, until the verification succeeds, the authentication unit  selects the registered fingerprint data in order of similarity between the registered operating state and the current operating state, and verifies the reference fingerprint data against the registered fingerprint data thus selected. Then, in a case in which verification of the reference fingerprint data does not succeed with respect to all the fingerprint data stored in the records thus narrowed down based upon the user ID and the kind of finger, the authentication unit  verifies the reference fingerprint data against the registered fingerprint data for different kinds of fingers. In a case in which the verification does not succeed for all the different kinds of fingers, the authentication unit  judges that the user's identity has not been confirmed. Then, after the completion of the authentication processing, the authentication unit  instructs the authentication log  to store various kinds of information.","It can be noted that, in a case in which the fingerprint data storage unit  does not store the current operating state number, the authentication unit  instructs the recommended information managing unit  to update various kinds of information stored in the recommended information storage unit . Upon receiving such an instruction, the recommended information managing unit  updates various kinds of information stored in the recommended information storage unit  in the same way as in the update processing in the fingerprint data registration operation. Specifically, the recommended information managing unit  instructs the operating state storage unit  to store the current operating state (the turn angle of the display unit  and the orientation of the display unit ). In this step, the recommended information managing unit  instructs the operating state storage unit  to store, as the recommended state number, a number that differs from the operating state numbers which have been already assigned.","Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  selects, from the operating state storage unit , the operating state which is most similar to the current operating state. Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  acquires the recommended registration pattern that corresponds to the operating state number thus identified as described above. Then, the recommended information managing unit  instructs the recommended registration policy storage unit  to store a combination of the operating state number thus additionally stored in the operating state storage unit  and the pattern number of the recommended registration pattern thus acquired.","Next, description will be made regarding the procedure for the fingerprint data registration processing performed by the information processing unit  according to the embodiment 1.  is a flowchart which illustrates the fingerprint data registration processing procedure performed by the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 1. As illustrated in , in a case in which the user has performed an operation so as to register or update the fingerprint data (in a case of \u201cYES\u201d in Step S), the operating state acquisition unit  included in the information processing apparatus  acquires the operating state of the information processing apparatus  (Step S).","Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  acquires, from the operating state storage unit , the operating state number that corresponds to the turn angle of the display unit  and the orientation of the display unit  acquired by the operating state acquisition unit  (Step S).

Such an arrangement allows the recommended information managing unit  to maintain the priority ranking order stored in the recommended registration pattern storage unit  in a state matching the descending order of the registration quality in a sure manner.","Next, description will be made regarding the procedure for the priority ranking order update processing performed by the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 2.  is a flowchart which illustrates the priority ranking order update processing procedure performed by the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 2. As illustrated in , at a predetermined timing (in a case of \u201cYES\u201d in Step S), the recommended information managing unit  acquires the combinations of the \u201ckind of finger\u201d and the \u201cregistration quality\u201d stored in the fingerprint data storage unit  in increments of the operating state numbers (Step S).","Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  acquires various kinds of information stored in the recommended registration policy storage unit  (Step S). Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  sets a predetermined operating state number for the processing-target operating state number, and judges whether or not the priority ranking order stored in the recommended registration pattern storage unit  that corresponds to the processing-target operating state number thus set matches the descending order of the \u201cregistration quality\u201d (Step S).","In a case in which the priority ranking order stored in the recommended registration pattern storage unit  does not match the descending order of the \u201cregistration quality\u201d (in a case of \u201cNO\u201d in Step S), the recommended information managing unit  acquires the recommended registration pattern stored in the recommended registration policy storage unit  in a form associated with the processing-target operating state number. Then, the recommended information managing unit  duplicates the recommended registration pattern storage unit  indicated by the pattern number thus acquired, and changes the pattern number of the recommended registration pattern storage unit  thus duplicated to a different number (Step S).","Subsequently, the recommended information managing unit  updates the priority ranking order stored in the recommended registration pattern storage unit  thus duplicated such that it matches the descending order of the registration quality acquired from the fingerprint data storage unit  (Step S).","The recommended information managing unit  performs the processing procedure illustrated in the aforementioned Steps S through S for all the operating state numbers stored in the fingerprint data storage unit . In a case in which the processing has been completed for all the operating state numbers (in a case of \u201cYES\u201d in Step S), the recommended information managing unit  ends the processing.","As described above, the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 2 automatically updates the priority ranking order assigned in increments of the kinds of fingers in descending order of the registration quality of the fingerprint image, thereby suggesting each user to use the finger of the kind which the user can easily input. For example, in some cases, there is a difference in the kind of finger which the user can easily input the fingerprint data between the users even if the same operating state is employed. Accordingly, in some cases there is a difference in the quality of the fingerprint image between the users even if the same operating state is employed. With the information processing apparatus  according to the embodiment 2, the priority ranking order is automatically updated based upon the registration quality, thereby allowing the user to register the fingerprint data with respect to the finger of the kind suitable for himself\/herself.","It can be noted that description has been made in the aforementioned embodiment 2 regarding an arrangement in which the priority ranking order is automatically updated based upon the registration quality. Also, the information processing apparatus  may automatically update the priority ranking order based upon the verification score or the verification results stored in the authentication log . Specifically, the information processing apparatus  may update the priority ranking order in descending order of the verification score stored in the authentication log . Also, the information processing apparatus  may update the priority ranking order in descending order of the success rate based upon the verification results stored in the authentication log . In such a case, in the same way as in the priority ranking order update processing illustrated in , after the information processing apparatus  duplicates the recommended registration pattern storage unit , the information processing apparatus  updates the priority ranking order stored in the recommended registration pattern storage unit  thus duplicated, and updates the recommended registration pattern stored in the recommended registration policy storage unit .","Also, description has been made in the aforementioned embodiments 1 and 2 regarding an arrangement which employs one-to-one authentication in which authentication is performed after the user is identified. Also, the information processing apparatus  or  may be applied to one-to-N authentication in which authentication is performed without receiving the input of the user ID. With such an arrangement, when the fingerprint data is registered, the information processing apparatus  instructs the user to register his\/her fingerprint data after the user inputs the user ID, in the same way as in the above-described embodiment 1. On the other hand, when the authentication is performed for the user, the information processing apparatus  receives the fingerprint image without a request to input the user ID. Then, the information processing apparatus  narrows down the records stored in the fingerprint data storage unit  into the records matching the finger of the kind selected via the selection screen. Furthermore, in a case in which there are multiple records thus narrowed down, the information processing apparatus  selects the record matching the current operating state number acquires by the operating state acquisition unit  in the authentication step. Here, in a case in which the fingerprint data storage unit  does not store the current operating state number, the information processing apparatus  further narrows down the multiple records thus narrowed down into the records most similar to the operating state acquired in the authentication step. The information processing apparatus  verifies the reference fingerprint data against the fingerprint data stored in the record thus narrowed down. With such an arrangement, the records are not narrowed down based upon the user ID, and accordingly, there can be multiple records thus narrowed down. Accordingly, of the registered fingerprint data stored in the records thus narrowed down, in a case in which there are multiple registered fingerprint data with the similarity to the reference fingerprint data being equal to or greater than a threshold value, the information processing apparatus  selects the registered fingerprint data with the highest similarity, and performs verification processing using the registered fingerprint data thus identified.","Also, in the above-described embodiments 1 and 2, the information processing apparatuses  and  may operate as an authentication server. Specifically, upon receiving a fingerprint data registration request from a client terminal, the information processing apparatus  performs the fingerprint data registration processing. Furthermore, upon receiving an authentication request, the information processing apparatus  performs the authentication processing.","More specific description will be made regarding such an arrangement. In the information processing apparatus , each of the operating state storage unit , the fingerprint data storage unit , and the authentication log  holds an item \u201cterminal information\u201d for identifying the client terminal. With such an arrangement, upon receiving a fingerprint data registration request including the fingerprint data, the terminal information, etc., from the client terminal, the information processing apparatus  registers the fingerprint data, the terminal information, etc., in the fingerprint data storage unit . Furthermore, upon receiving an authentication request including the fingerprint data, the user ID, the terminal information, etc., from the client terminal, the information processing apparatus  performs authentication processing after narrowing down the fingerprint data stored in the fingerprint data storage unit  based upon the user ID, the terminal information, etc., thus received.","Also, description has been made in the aforementioned embodiments 1 and 2 regarding an arrangement in which the recommended registration policy storage unit  handles common information for all the user IDs. Also, such information may be managed for each user ID. Specifically, the recommended registration policy storage unit  further provides an item \u201cuser ID\u201d. With such an arrangement, the recommended registration policy storage unit  stores the recommended registration pattern in a form associated with a combination of the operating state number and the user ID. Accordingly, such an arrangement enables a control operation to be performed such that, in a case in which the operating state number matches \u201c001\u201d, for the user A, the information processing apparatus  displays a registration screen based upon the recommended registration pattern storage unit  that corresponds to the pattern number \u201c1\u201d. Furthermore, for the user B, the information processing apparatus  displays a registration screen based upon the recommended registration pattern storage unit  that corresponds to the pattern number \u201c2\u201d.","Also, description has been made in the aforementioned embodiments 1 and 2 with reference to an arrangement which performs fingerprint authentication. Also, the information processing apparatuses  and  may be applied to authentication employing other biometric information that differs from the fingerprint. For example, the information processing apparatuses  and  may be applied to vein authentication in which the shape of veins in the user's finger is acquired.","Also, all or a part of the processing automatically performed as described in the above-described embodiments 1 and 2 may be performed manually. Also, all or a part of the processing manually performed as described in the above-described embodiments 1 and 2 may be performed automatically using a known method.
