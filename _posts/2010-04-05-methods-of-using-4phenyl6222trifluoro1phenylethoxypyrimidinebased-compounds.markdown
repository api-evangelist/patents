No. 7,553,840 issued on Jun. 30, 2009, which claims priority to U.S. provisional application No. 60\/874,596, filed Dec. 12, 2006, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to 4-phenyl-6-(2,2,2-trifluoro-1-phenylethoxy)pyrimidine-based compounds, compositions comprising them, and their use in the treatment, prevention and management of diseases and disorders.","The neurotransmitter serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] is involved in multiple central nervous facets of mood control and in regulating sleep, anxiety, alcoholism, drug abuse, food intake, and sexual behavior. In peripheral tissues, serotonin is reportedly implicated in the regulation of vascular tone, gut motility, primary hemostasis, and cell-mediated immune responses. Walther, D. J., et al., 299:76 (2003).","The enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) catalyzes the rate limiting step of the biosynthesis of serotonin. Two isoforms of TPH have been reported: TPH1, which is expressed in the periphery, primarily in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; and TPH2, which is expressed in the serotonergic neurons. Id. The isoform TPH1 is encoded by the tph1 gene; TPH2 is encoded by the tph2 gene. Id.","Mice genetically deficient for the tph1 gene (\u201cknockout mice\u201d) have been reported. In one case, the mice reportedly expressed normal amounts of serotonin in classical serotonergic brain regions, but largely lacked serotonin in the periphery. Id. In another, the knockout mice exhibited abnormal cardiac activity, which was attributed to a lack of peripheral serotonin. C\u00f4t\u00e9, F., et al., 100(23):13525-13530 (2003).","Because serotonin is involved in so many biochemical processes, drugs that affect serotonin receptors are often attended by adverse effects. Thus, a need exists for new ways of treating diseases and disorders that are affected by, mediated by, or associated with serotonin.","This invention is directed, in part, to compounds of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"35.56mm","wi":"75.61mm","file":"US07968559-20110628-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","1 ","A","A","B","C","2","A","2 ","A","A","B","C","2","A","3 ","A","A","4 ","A ","B ","C "]},"Particular compounds inhibit TPH (e.g., TPH1) activity.","This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions and to methods of treating, preventing and managing a variety of diseases and disorders.","This invention is based, in part, on the discovery that knocking out the tph1 gene in mice significantly reduces levels of GI serotonin, yet causes little, if any, measurable effect on the central nervous system (CNS).","This invention is also based on the discovery of compounds that inhibit TPH (e.g., TPH1). When administered to mammals, preferred compounds of the invention reduce serotonin levels, have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that enable their practical use for the treatment, prevention and management of diseases and disorders, and have a broad safety margin between pharmacological effect and toxicity or unfavorable side reactions.","Unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201calkenyl\u201d means a straight chain, branched and\/or cyclic hydrocarbon having from 2 to 20 (e.g., 2 to 10 or 2 to 6) carbon atoms, and including at least one carbon-carbon double bond.

A therapeutically effective amount of a compound is an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of the disease or condition. The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of a disease or condition, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent.","Unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201cTPH1_IC\u201d is the ICof a compound for TPH1 as determined using the in vitro inhibition assay described in the Examples, below.","Unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201cTPH2_IC\u201d is the ICof a compound for TPH2 as determined using the in vitro inhibition assay described in the Examples, below.","Unless otherwise indicated, the terms \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreating\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d contemplate an action that occurs while a patient is suffering from the specified disease or disorder, which reduces the severity of the disease or disorder, or one or more of its symptoms, or retards or slows the progression of the disease or disorder.","Unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201cinclude\u201d has the same meaning as \u201cinclude\u201d and the term \u201cincludes\u201d has the same meaning as \u201cincludes, but is not limited to.\u201d Similarly, the term \u201csuch as\u201d has the same meaning as the term \u201csuch as, but not limited to.\u201d","Unless otherwise indicated, one or more adjectives immediately preceding a series of nouns is to be construed as applying to each of the nouns. For example, the phrase \u201coptionally substituted alky, aryl, or heteroaryl\u201d has the same meaning as \u201coptionally substituted alky, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl.\u201d","It should be noted that a chemical moiety that forms part of a larger compound may be described herein using a name commonly accorded it when it exists as a single molecule or a name commonly accorded its radical. For example, the terms \u201cpyridine\u201d and \u201cpyridyl\u201d are accorded the same meaning when used to describe a moiety attached to other chemical moieties. Thus, the two phrases \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridyl\u201d and \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridine\u201d are accorded the same meaning, and encompass the compounds pyridin-2-ol, pyridin-3-ol and pyridin-4-ol.","It should also be noted that if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or the portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. Similarly, names of compounds having one or more chiral centers that do not specify the stereochemistry of those centers encompass pure stereoisomers and mixtures thereof Moreover, any atom shown in a drawing with unsatisfied valences is assumed to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valences. In addition, chemical bonds depicted with one solid line parallel to one dashed line encompass both single and double (e.g., aromatic) bonds, if valences permit.","This invention encompasses, inter alia, compounds of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0056"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"35.56mm","wi":"75.61mm","file":"US07968559-20110628-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","1 ","A","A","B","C","2","A","2 ","A","A","B","C","2","A","3 ","A","A","4 ","A ","B ","C "]},"In one embodiment, the compound is of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0058"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"30.48mm","wi":"74.59mm","file":"US07968559-20110628-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In another, it is of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0060"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"157.40mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US07968559-20110628-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["5 ","A","A","B","C","2","A"]},"In another, it is of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0062"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"62.65mm","wi":"74.93mm","file":"US07968559-20110628-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["5 ","A","A","B","C","2","A"]},"In another, it is of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0064"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"63.16mm","wi":"74.76mm","file":"US07968559-20110628-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["5 ","A","A","B","C","2","A"]},"In another, it is of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0066"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"144.27mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US07968559-20110628-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["5 ","A","A","B","C","2","A"]},"With regard to the various formulae disclosed herein, in particular compounds of the invention, Ais aromatic.

Examples of such adverse effects include agitation, anxiety disorders, depression, and sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia and sleep disturbance).","This invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of the invention. Certain pharmaceutical compositions are single unit dosage forms suitable for oral, mucosal (e.g., nasal, sublingual, vaginal, buccal, or rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or intraarterial), or transdermal administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.","The formulation should suit the mode of administration. For example, the oral administration of a compound susceptible to degradation in the stomach may be achieved using an enteric coating. Similarly, a formulation may contain ingredients that facilitate delivery of the active ingredient(s) to the site of action. For example, compounds may be administered in liposomal formulations in order to protect them from degradative enzymes, facilitate transport in circulatory system, and effect their delivery across cell membranes.","Similarly, poorly soluble compounds may be incorporated into liquid dosage forms (and dosage forms suitable for reconstitution) with the aid of solubilizing agents, emulsifiers and surfactants such as, but not limited to, cyclodextrins (e.g., \u03b1-cyclodextrin, \u03b2-cyclodextrin, Captisol\u00ae, and Encapsin\u2122 (see, e.g., Davis and Brewster, 3:1023-1034 (2004)), Labrasol\u00ae, Labrafil\u00ae, Labrafac\u00ae, cremafor, and non-aqueous solvents, such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), biocompatible oils (e.g., cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof (e.g., DMSO:cornoil).","Poorly soluble compounds may also be incorporated into suspensions using other techniques known in the art. For example, nanoparticles of a compound may be suspended in a liquid to provide a nanosuspension (see, e.g., Rabinow, 3:785-796 (2004)). Nanoparticle forms of compounds described herein may be prepared by the methods described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004-0164194, 2004-0195413, 2004-0251332, 2005-0042177 A1, 2005-0031691 A1, and U.S. Pat.

In one embodiment, the nanoparticle form comprises particles having an average particle size of less than about 2000 nm, less than about 1000 nm, or less than about 500 nm.","The composition, shape, and type of a dosage form will typically vary depending with use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. How to account for such differences will be apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., 18ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, 18ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).","Typical oral dosage forms are prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration.","Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by conventional methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary. Disintegrants may be incorporated in solid dosage forms to facility rapid dissolution. Lubricants may also be incorporated to facilitate the manufacture of dosage forms (e.g., tablets).","Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are specifically sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.","Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","Exon 3 of the murine TPH1 gene was removed by gene targeting essentially as described by Wattler et al., 26(6):1150-6 (1999). The resulting knockout animals displayed normal TPH activity in the brain but drastically reduced TPH expression in the gut.","Mice homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) for the disruption of tph1 were studied in conjunction with mice heterozygous (+\/\u2212) for the disruption of the gene, along with wild-type (+\/+) litter mates. During this analysis, the mice were subject to a medical work-up using an integrated suite of medical diagnostic procedures designed to assess the function of the major organ systems in a mammalian subject. By studying the homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) knockout mice in the described numbers and in conjunction with heterozygous(+\/\u2212) and wild-type (+\/+) litter mates, more reliable and repeatable data was obtained.","Disruption of tph1 gene primarily affected the GI tract isoform of TPH (TPH1), and had little or no effect on the brain isoform of TPH (TPH2). Disruption of the gene caused no measurable adverse effects on the central nervous system. This was confirmed by serotonin immunochemistry, which showed that serotonin was greatly reduced or absent in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon, while serotonin levels were unaffected in raphe neurons.","Some mice homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) for the disruption of the tph1 gene exhibited a decrease in thrombosis without a significant increase in bleeding or other adverse indications.","In some of the following synthetic examples, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention times are provided.

A large portion of the cell lysate was treated by mixing with equal volume of 1M TCA and then filtered through glass fiber. The filtrates were loaded on reverse phase HPLC for analyzing 5HT concentrations. A small portion of the cell lysate was also taken to measure protein concentration of the cells that reflects the cytotoxicity of the compounds at the concentration used. The protein concentration was measured by using BCA method.","The average of 5HT level in cells without compound treated was used as the maximum value in the ICderivation according to the equation provided above. The minimum value of 5HT is either set at 0 or from cells that treated with the highest concentration of compound if a compound is not cytotoxic at that concentration.","BON CBA: Cells were grown in equal volume of DMEM and F12K with 5% bovine serum for 3-4 hours (20K cell\/well) and compound was added at a concentration range of 0.07 \u03bcM to 50 \u03bcM.
