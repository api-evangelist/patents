title: Ultrasonic flaw detector and ultrasonic flaw detection method
abstract: An ultrasonic probe issues an ultrasonic wave to an object, receives a reflected wave from an object, and is provided with multiple piezoelectric elements. A three-dimensional display section displays three-dimensional flaw detection data superimposed on three-dimensional shape data of an object. The computer acquires a reflected ultrasonic wave signal from a reference object (reference). Based on the acquired signal, the computer corrects a reflected ultrasonic wave signal acquired from another object having the same material and shape as the reference. The computer allows the three-dimensional display section to display three-dimensional flaw detection data generated from a reflected ultrasonic wave signal resulting from a difference between a reference and an object.

More specifically, the present invention relates to an ultrasonic flaw detector and an ultrasonic flaw detection method using an ultrasonic array probe.","Recently, in a field of the ultrasonic flaw detection method for inspecting various structural materials, there are developed flaw detection techniques capable of visualizing an internal structure of an object to be inspected, in a short time with high precision, thereby to inspect the internal structure thereof, as typified by a phased array technique, an aperture synthesis and the like (e.g., see Non-patent document 1: Norimasa Kondou, Yoshimasa Oohashi, and Akio Jitsumori; \u201cDigital signal processing in measurement and sensors\u201d of Vol. 12 of Digital Signal Processing Series; SHOKODO CO., LTD., 1993, pp. 143-186).","The phased array technique uses a so-called ultrasonic array probe comprising an array of piezoelectric elements (piezoelectric transducers). The phased array technique is based on the following principle: respective piezoelectric elements issue ultrasonic waves, thereby, wavefronts of these ultrasonic waves interfere with each other to form a synthetic wavefront, and then synthetice wavefront travel with propagation. Therefore, provided that ultrasonic issue timings of the respective piezoelectric elements are shifted from each other by making delay control for each ultrasonic issue timing, it possible to control an incidence angle of each ultrasonic wave and focus the respective ultrasonic waves.","Even on a receiving side of the ultrasonic wave, provided that reflected ultrasonic waves received by the respective piezoelectric elements are shifted from each other and then added, similarly to the issue side of the ultrasonic wave, it is possible to control each received incidence angle of the ultrasonic wave and receive a focused ultrasonic wave.","The phased array technique is generally known as a linear scan technique and a sector scan technique. The linear scan technique linearly scans piezoelectric elements of a one-dimensional array probe. The sector scan technique varies issue and reception directions of the ultrasonic wave in sector -like fashion. When using a two-dimensional array probe comprising piezoelectric elements arranged in a lattice-like formation, it makes possible to focus on any position three-dimensionally and provide a scan technique capable of suiting to any object to be inspected. Any of these techniques can realize fast scan of ultrasonic waves without moving an ultrasonic probe or control any incidence angles or focus depths of the ultrasonic wave without replacing the ultrasonic probe.","The phased array technique is capable of fast and high-precision inspections.","The aperture synthesis is based on the following principle. When issuing an ultrasonic wave so as to widely diffuses within an object and receiving its reflected ultrasonic wave signal, a defect position corresponds to a sound source of the received reflected ultrasonic wave, and is located along an arc whose center is a piezoelectric element used to issue and receive the ultrasonic wave and which has a radius equivalent to the propagation distance of the reflected ultrasonic wave. Therefore, provided that the ultrasonic wave is issued and received while sequentially changing a position of the piezoelectric element, and a received waveform at each position of the piezoelectric element is spread in an arc by calculation of a computer, intersection points of the arcs concentrate on the defect position as a source of reflecting the ultrasonic wave, thereby making it possible to identify the defect position. Contents of the calculation processes of the computer are explained in Non-patent Document 1.","These methods using the probe comprised of multiple piezoelectric elements and are capable of three-dimensionally receiving a reflected ultrasonic wave signal for the defect without moving the probe. The reflected ultrasonic wave signal is used to identify a three-dimensional reflection position. The reflection position may be estimated by displaying two-dimensional images representing multiple reflection intensity distributions at different spatial positions or converting the reflection intensity into three-dimensional data and then stereoscopically displaying an image. For example, the linear scan technique or the sector scan technique as the phased array technique can generate multiple two-dimensional reflection intensity images corresponding to known scanning pitches. Images can be sequentially changed on a screen to identify a direction along which the reflected wave appears. However, the phased array technique indicates limitations on any three-dimensional scans other than the above.","In such case, a known method interpolates reflected ultrasonic wave signals from multiple directions to make three-dimensional lattice data, and displays an image for the data based on volume rendering or surface rendering. A three-dimensional lattice data structure called as voxel, which multiple cubes are three-dimensionally arranged, is most widely used because it can be easily processed. The voxel is also referred to as a structured lattice. An alternative to the voxel is a lattice that is irregularly positioned as a spatial array and is less easily displayed than the voxel. Such lattice is also referred to as an unstructured lattice. Typical unstructured lattices include a hexahedron lattice, a tetrahedron lattice, a triangular prism lattice, and a four-sided pyramid lattice. Another method displays reflected ultrasonic wave signals as a group of three-dimensional dots without conversion into lattice data. These types of data are maintained as three-dimensional flaw detection data. An observer can confirm the three-dimensional flaw detection data from any direction after measurement (e.g., see Non-patent Document 2: Potts, A.; McNab, A.; Reilly, D.; Toft, M., \u201cPresentation and analysis enhancements of the NDT Workbench a software package for ultrasonic NDT data\u201d, REVIEW OF PROGRESS IN QUANTITATIVE NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION: Volume 19. AIP Conference Proceedings, Volume 509, pp. 741-748 (2000)) .","However, it is difficult to determine whether the reflection intensity distribution peak results from reflection on an end face or a boundary surface of an object or from reflection on a defect only based on the three-dimensional flaw detection data. Another technology which concurrently displays three-dimensional shape data with three-dimensional flaw detection data for the object has been developed, and which superimpose and compares the two types of data. The technology facilitates distinction between a reflected ultrasonic wave signal (shape echo) dependent on a shape and a reflected ultrasonic wave signal (defect echo) from a defect. In many cases, the technology uses three-dimensional shape data that is generated and read with an additional general-purpose CAD (Computer Aided Design) system (e.g., see Non-patent Document 2).","Non-patent Document 1: Norimasa Kondou, Yoshimasa Oohashi, and Akio Jitsumori.; \u201cDigital signal processing in measurement and sensors\u201d. Vol. 12 of Digital Signal Processing Series; SHOKODO CO., LTD., 1993, pp. 143-186.","Non-patent Document 2: Potts, A.; McNab, A.; Reilly, D.; Toft, M., \u201cPresentation and analysis enhancements of the NDT Workbench a software package for ultrasonic NDT data\u201d, REVIEW OF PROGRESS IN QUANTITATIVE NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION: Volume 19. AIP Conference Proceedings, Volume 509, pp. 741-748 (2000)","When the object is shaped complexly, however, the ultrasonic wave multiply reflects inside the object, causing many shape echoes to appear. In such a case, it is difficult to distinguish between a shape echo and a defect echo even though a flaw detection result is superimposed on the shape data. In an actual flaw detection process, the defect determination evaluation requires only a defect echo and a restricted shape echo for identifying positional relation with the three-dimensional shape data. Depending on viewing directions for the three-dimensional display, the echoes needed for the evaluation may overlap with the other unnecessary echoes (false echoes) to be displayed. A false echo may hinder the evaluation.","The present invention is to provide an ultrasonic flaw detector and an ultrasonic flaw detection method capable of eliminating a false echo from a three-dimensional display as a flaw detection result and displaying only a defect echo and a shape echo needed for evaluation.","(1) An ultrasonic flaw detector of the invention is comprised of: an ultrasonic probe including a plurality of piezoelectric elements each of which issues an ultrasonic wave to an object of interest and detects its reflected ultrasonic wave signal occurring from the object; a pulser for supplying a driving signal to each piezoelectric element of the ultrasonic probe; a receiver for receiving a reception signal from each piezoelectric element of the ultrasonic probe; a delay time control section for assigning a different delay time to the driving signal and the reception signal for each of the piezoelectric elements; a data recording section for recording waveforms of the reflected ultrasonic wave signals received by the ultrasonic probe; an image processing computer for generating three-dimensional flaw detection data from the waveforms of the reflected waves recorded in the data recording section; and a three-dimensional display section for displaying the three-dimensional flaw detection data superimposed on three-dimensional shape data of the object.

The ultrasonic array probe  is placed on a surface of the object  to be inspected. Each piezoelectric element of the ultrasonic array probe  generates an ultrasonic wave  in accordance with a driving signal supplied from the sending\/receiving section . The ultrasonic array probe  propagates the ultrasonic wave inside the object , detects a reflected wave of the ultrasonic wave, and supplies a corresponding reception signal to the sending\/receiving section .","The sending\/receiving section  issues (sends) an ultrasonic wave to the object  of interest and receives its reflected wave signal from the object with the ultrasonic array probe . The sending\/receiving section  includes a computer A, a delay time control section B, a pulser C, a receiver D, and a data recording section E. In the sending\/receiving section , the pulser C supplies a driving signal to the ultrasonic array probe . The receiver D processes a reception signal supplied from the ultrasonic array probe .","Basically, the computer A comprises a CPU A, a RAM A, a ROM A, and an external memory A. The ROM A is provided with a program for controlling the CPU A. The CPU A performs arithmetic operations while reading necessary external data from the data recording section E in accordance with the program or sending and receiving data between the RAM A and the external memory A. The CPU A outputs processed data to the data recording section E as needed.","The CPU A controls the delay time control section B, the pulser C, and the receiver D for necessary operations. The delay time control section B controls timing of a drive signal output from the pulser C and input timing of a reception signal from the receiver D. In this manner, the delay time control section B ensures operations of the ultrasonic array probe  in accordance with the phased array technique.","Operations of the ultrasonic array probe  in accordance with the phased array technique include controlling a focus depth and an incidence angle  of the ultrasonic wave  and sending and receiving the ultrasonic wave. Accordingly, the receiver D supplies a reception signal to the data recording section E. The data recording section E processes the supplied reception signal, stores the reception signal as recording data, and sends the data to the computer A. The computer A synthesizes waveforms acquired by the piezoelectric elements in accordance with delay times and interpolates waveforms having incidence angles of the ultrasonic waves respectively. Thereby, the computer A makes two-dimensional flaw detection data with a two-dimensional square lattice as a unit (the two-dimensional square lattice typified by pixel form), or makes three-dimensional flaw detection data with a three-dimensional cubic lattice as a unit (the three-dimensional cubic lattice typified by voxel form). The computer A images the data and displays it on the display section .","The display section  comprises a two-dimensional display screen B for displaying two-dimensional flaw detection data, a three-dimensional display screen C for displaying three-dimensional flaw detection data, and a waveform display screen A for displaying waveform signals from piezoelectric elements. While  shows the display section  only, the waveform display screen A, the two-dimensional display screen B, and the three-dimensional display screen C may be displayed on multiple display sections separately.","With reference to , the following describes an example of the three-dimensional display screen C in the ultrasonic flaw detector according to the embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As shown in , the display screen C on the display section  displays three-dimensional flaw detection data . The data can be displayed in any display sizes in accordance with input from a mouse F or a keyboard G connected to the computer A. Using the keyboard G, an inspector can input a numeric value as a scale to change the display size. Display colors and degrees of transparency are provided in units of voxel lattices respectively and may be changed in accordance with input from the mouse F and the keyboard G. There are provided multiple display colorpatterns so that an inspector can choose therefrom.","Three-dimensional drawing algorithms are implemented in an OpenGL (registered trademark of Silicon Graphics, Inc.) or DirectX (registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation) library as an industry-standard graphics application programming interface (graphics API) for graphics applications. Using the graphics APIs, a program may be given necessary information such as a shape, observing point, and display position of an object to be displayed. The program can then easily draw a three-dimensional shape in any color, degree of transparency, and size at a given position of the display.","The three-dimensional display screen C displays three-dimensional shape data  representing the shape of the object  together with the three-dimensional flaw detection data . The three-dimensional shape data  is read from outside the computer A. When CAD data for the object  is available, it is possible to read and display the three-dimensional shape data . Formats of the CAD data is data formats capable of input and output by using commercial available CAD software. For example, the CAD data uses the STL (STereoLithography) format as data formats capable of input or output from many types of CAD software. The STL format represents a surface of the object with a set of many triangles. An STL file contains plane-normal vectors and coordinate values corresponding to three vertexes of each triangle. A graphics API can easily display the three-dimensional shape data  from an STL file by drawing multiple straight lines and triangles. As shown in , the three-dimensional shape data may be displayed as an outline only. Further, the three-dimensional shape data may be displayed translucently or opaquely by filling external plane of the three-dimensional shape data. These display modes can be easily selected by changing a value as to the degree of transparency (the value is given to a drawing function provided for the graphics API) at the time of drawing triangles. Thus, the display data may be easy to view for an inspector even though the three-dimensional shape data  and the three-dimensional flaw detection data  overlap with each other. The three-dimensional shape data  may or may not be displayed as needed.","Though not shown in drawing, multiple three-dimensional shape data  may be simultaneously displayed on the three-dimensional display screen C.","The selected three-dimensional shape data  can be displayed at any observing point, position, and size independently of the three-dimensional flaw detection data  in accordance with input from the mouse F or the keyboard  connected to the computer A.","The followings are explained as to evaluation of the position and size measurement of defects inside the object by using a three-dimensional flaw detection image generated by the phased array technique. In General, the flaw detection image displays a shape echo based on reflection of the ultrasonic wave and a defect echo based on reflection from a defect inside the object. When the ultrasonic wave reflects from the object, reflected wave occurs mode conversion, and thereby the shape echo may contain an ultrasonic wave in oscillation mode different from an incident ultrasonic wave. Such ultrasonic wave is converted from a vertical wave into a horizontal wave, or vice versa. In addition to the defect echo and the shape echo, a grating lobe may be displayed depending on measurement conditions. The grating lobe is an echo (false echo) resulting from a false signal specific to array probes. The defect echo needs to be clearly displayed on the screen for the evaluation. The shape echo and the false echo may overlap with the defect echo in a depth direction, and thereby it may be difficult to visually identify the defect echo. The overlap may be solved by changing the eye direction of the three-dimensional display. However, there is no guarantee the defect echo can be easily visibly displayed at a desired angle without any overlap. This problem is particularly serious when an object is shaped complexly. Because the object, when shaped complexly, causes multi-reflection inside, the defect echo is surrounded by many shape echoes due to the multi-reflection.","By the way, when doing an actual flaw detection process, what are required for the evaluation of defect determination are only the defect echo and a restricted shape echo for identifying positional relation with the three-dimensional shape data. When the object is shaped complexly, the ultrasonic wave multiply reflects inside the object, causing many shape echoes to occur. These shape echoes are assumed to be false echoes unneeded for the evaluation.","With reference to , the following describes an example of the three-dimensional display screen C on a conventional ultrasonic flaw detector when the object is complexly shaped.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["103","301","302"]},"The echoes shown in  include the defect echo , the shape echo  resulting from normal reflection, and multiple shape echoes other than the echoes  and . The other shape echoes result from multi-reflection is shown as ovals in the drawing. Echoes other than the defect echo  are of shape echoes. As shown in , the shape echoes of the multi-reflection are displayed together with the shape echo  based on the normal reflection. Depending on an eye direction, the defect echo  may overlap with surrounding shape echoes and may not be identified.","In this example, the evaluation requires the defect echo  and the shape echo  as evaluation echoes. Since the shape echo  always appears due to reflection at corners of the object, it is useful for identifying correct relative positions of the three-dimensional shape data  and the three-dimensional flaw detection data .","The following evaluation echo extraction method according to the embodiment is capable of displaying only the shape echo and the defect echo or only the defect echo needed for the evaluation. The method greatly facilitates works of examining the presence or absence of a defect or identifying a defect position.","With reference to , the following describes the evaluation echo extraction method using the ultrasonic flaw detector according to the embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"]},"The evaluation echo extraction method is available when an inspector limits a display area using the mouse.","At Step S, the inspector uses the mouse F to adjust the eye direction for the object so that a defect echo and a false echo to be hidden do not overlap with the shape echo  and the defect echo  as evaluation echoes on the three-dimensional display screen C.","At Step S, a hidden area containing the defect echo and the false echo to be hidden on the three-dimensional display screen C is specified by the inspector's mouse F-control. Specifically, for example, when two points on the three-dimensional display screen C is specified by control of the mouse F, a rectangular or square two-dimensional area  () whose diagonal corresponds to a straight line connecting the two points is decided. When the two-dimensional area  is decided, the computer A () generates a three-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped area as a hidden area that is generated by cutting off the two-dimensional area  in a depth direction of the three-dimensional shape of the object along the eye direction. The three-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped area as a hidden area is needed to have an enough depth so as to include the position of the three-dimensional flaw detection data . The measure of the depth may be easily found because the size and the coordinate of the three-dimensional flaw detection data  are given previously. Coordinates of the two points specified on the three-dimensional display screen C with the mouse F-control can be easily found by a built-in function of the graphics API such as OpenGL. The hidden area is not limited to a rectangular parallelepiped. For example, the two-dimensional area  to be displayed first on the three-dimensional display screen C may be a circle, oval, or any polygon comprised of multiple straight lines. In this case, cutting off the two-dimensional area  is done as with the above-mentioned three-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped area.","At Step S, the computer A displays the two-dimensional area  specified at Step S on the three-dimensional display screen C before finalizing the hidden area. The display of two-dimensional area  is done by surrounding the area  with straight lines, broken lines, or dotted lines. Step S may precede the process of cutting the two-dimensional area  in the depth direction at Step S.","At Step S, the two-dimensional area  displayed at Step S is determined by the inspector whether or not the area  is located at a desired position on the three-dimensional display screen C. When the two-dimensional area  is located at the displayed position, the inspector proceeds to the next step by clicking an OK button on the screen using the mouse F or pressing a return key on the keyboard G. Otherwise, the inspector returns to Step S by clicking an NG button on the screen using the mouse F or pressing any keys for reentry on the keyboard G; the inspector re-specifies the two-dimensional area  and repeats these steps until the two-dimensional area  is located at the desired position.","When the two-dimensional area  is located at the desired position on the three-dimensional display screen C at Step S, process goes to Step S, the computer A finalizes the hidden area.","At Step S, the computer A determines whether or not the hidden area contains voxels configuring the three-dimensional flaw detection data . This can be easily determined by checking the relation between each voxel coordinate value and a spatial area that specifies the hidden area. The computer A performs the determination on all the voxels. For example, a determination result is set to 1 when the hidden area contains a voxel. The determination result is set to 0 otherwise. The determination result is recorded in the RAM A or the external memory A.","At Step S, the computer A redraws the three-dimensional flaw detection data  (namely redraws only voxel including three-dimensional flaw detection data) on the three-dimensional display screen C based on the result of Step S. In advance of redrawing, a voxel or voxels assumed to be included in the hidden area at Step S are made into transparent at Step S. This can be easily fulfilled because the graphics API such as OpenGL is capable of assigning the degree of transparency for each voxel.","At Step S, when the inspector further wants to hide other area on the three-dimensional display screen C as well as the hidden area decided at Step S, process is returned to Step S by clicking on an addition button on the three-dimensional display screen C using the mouse F or entering an addition instruction from the keyboard G. The inspector then repeats the process from Step S to Step S. When there is no further area to be hidden, the process is finished by clicking on a finish button on the three-dimensional display screen C using the mouse F or entering a finish instruction from the keyboard G.","As shown in , the above-mentioned process is capable of displaying only the shape echo  and the defect echo  on the three-dimensional display screen. The process does not affect drawing of the three-dimensional shape data .","According to the above-mentioned embodiment, since redrawing only voxel including three-dimensional flaw detection data on the three-dimensional display after hiding the three-dimensional area specified on the three-dimensional display section, when the object contains a defect, the embodiment can display any shape echo representing feature points of the echo and shape due to the defect. It is possible to fast determine the presence or absence of a defect or analyze the defect.","Next, with reference to , the following explains the configuration and operations of the ultrasonic flaw detector according to another embodiment of the invention. The configuration of the ultrasonic flaw detector according to the embodiment is almost equivalent to that shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 7 through 9","FIG. 10"]},"The evaluation echo extraction method according to the embodiment uses two of an object of interest and a reference object used for comparing with the object of interest. The reference object is a normal object without defect. The object of interest has the same shape as that of the reference object but is unknown as to presence or absence of defect. The method is configured to compare flaw detection data of the object of interest with that of the reference object, and extracts only a defect echo when there is a difference between the two of the reference object and the object of interest).","In the description below, if not otherwise specified, the term \u201creference\u201d is used to denote the reference object, and the term \u201cobject\u201d is used to denote the object of interest.","Ideally, if the reference and the object may be identical shape with each other, and the ultrasonic array probe  may be placed under completely the same condition for the reference and the object, the defect echo of the object can be found by a simple process of difference between the two of the reference and the object because only a defect echo is basically detected as a difference between both signals. In General, however, both shapes slightly since differ from each other due to manufacturing errors, and the probe installation positions may differ slightly from each other, shape echoes of the two (reference and object) may be displayed at slightly different positions or may be indicated slightly with different intensities. Accordingly, it is difficult to completely eliminate a shape echo using a simple difference process. The evaluation echo extraction method according to the embodiment can completely eliminate a shape echo independently of these effects, as follows.","At Step S in , the computer A uses the reference to acquire a reference waveform signal corresponding to a reflected ultrasonic wave for each path length.","With reference to , the following describes a path length  of the ultrasonic wave that is issued or received three-dimensionally. As shown in , the ultrasonic array probe  issues the ultrasonic wave into the object . Path lengths  of the ultrasonic wave are radially issued from an incident point .

To do this, the computer A brings signal intensity values to zero in the waveform signal for the interval  in  and an interval whose absolute signal intensity value is smaller than or equal to a threshold value It. The interval  almost depends on characteristics of the ultrasonic array probe  and may be equally provided for the path lengths. The inspector can assign appropriate values to the interval  and the threshold value It with reference to the waveform display screen A. The same threshold value It may be provided for all the path lengths. It should be noted that too large a value for the threshold value It may remove even a signal for the necessary shape echo. The resulting waveform has zero value in the signal intensity except for the shape echo as shown in , for example.","At Step S, the computer A applies a low-pass filter used for general signal processing to the waveform signals. The computer A removes a small oscillation due to noise and provides a smooth waveform signal. This step may be omissible when an influence due to noise is negligible originally. As a result, the process generates a waveform shown in .","At Step S, the computer A differentiates each waveform signal to acquire a differential waveform signal as shown in . The differentiation may use a general algorithm that differentiates discrete numeric data. Representative algorithms include the Euler method and the Runge-Kutta method.","At Step S, the computer A searches the differential signal acquired at Step S corresponding to each path length for a position \u03b1pi as a signal point that has the value zero and is placed between non-zero values as shown in . The computer A stores the position \u03b1pi into the ROM A or the external memory A. The position \u03b1pi denotes a number \u201ci\u201d resulting of being sequentially counted from one end of the waveform signal in the pth path length. The position \u03b1pi also represents an ith peak position of the waveform signal before the differentiation.","Next, at Step S, the computer A acquires a reflected ultrasonic wave signal of the object (interest). When acquiring the reflected ultrasonic wave signal of the object, the computer A uses the same flaw detection conditions such as the probe installation position, path length, and data acquisition frequency as that of the reference. Therefore, between the two, what is different from each other is of only object. When each ultrasonic wave is issued or received three-dimensionally, its path length can be shown as with in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIGS. 8E-8G","FIG. 8E","FIG. 8A"],"b":["903","901","101","801","902","902","802"]},"Next, at Step S, as with Step S, the computer A removes an oscillation close to the incident point  and a small oscillation due to noise in the reflected ultrasonic waveform signal. To do this, the computer A brings signal intensity values to zero in the waveform signal for the interval  in  and an interval whose absolute signal intensity value is smaller than or equal to a threshold value It. The interval  is assumed to be identical to the interval . The threshold value It is assumed to be the same as that used for Step S. As a result, the process generates a waveform shown in .","At Step S, the computer A compares each reflected ultrasonic waveform signal of the reference with that of the object for each same path length. As shown in , the reflected ultrasonic waveform signal of the object is similar to that of the reference of  except for the defect echo signal, and ditto with the differential value thereof. For example, in the differential value (not shown in drawing) of the reflected ultrasonic waveform signal of the object, a signal of \u03b1pi-th and \u03b4 pieces of signals before-and-after \u03b1pi-th, namely signal values such as signal strength at the same position as an extremum of the reference reflected ultrasonic wave signal acquired from the reference and in the same area as a specific before-and-after area of the extremum, are set so as to be zero and sufficiently smaller than the maximum signal intensity of the defect echo from the object, respectively. The value \u03b4 is predetermined by using the mouse F or the keyboard G. That is, the specific interval including \u03b1pi-th and \u03b4 is predetermined. The area of \u03b4 is set to be greater than a difference between peak positions of tolerances resulting from slightly different shapes of the reference and the object due to manufacturing errors or from a slight difference between probe installation positions. The value \u03b4 is determined depending on the object, and in most cases, there are no need to be changed after once determined until the object is changed. By taking a difference between each reflected ultrasonic waveform signal of the object and that of the reference, the resulting waveform signal contains only the defect echo from the object. Such processes generate a waveform shown in , for example.","At Step S, the computer A generates the three-dimensional flaw detection data  using the waveform signals acquired at Step S. This process is the same as the conventional one.","Finally at Step S, the computer A allows the three-dimensional display screen C to display the generated three-dimensional flaw detection data  superimposed on the three-dimensional shape data .","According to the above-mentioned embodiment, when there is any defect inside the object, the process displays only the defect echo  on the three-dimensional display screen C as shown in . When no defect exists, only the three-dimensional shape data  is displayed. It is possible to easily check the presence or absence of a defect, remarkably improving the inspection efficiency.","As mentioned above, the embodiment acquires the reference reflected ultrasonic waveform from the reference, and can correct the reflected ultrasonic waveform acquired from the object (interest) that has the same material and shape as the reference, based on the reference reflected ultrasonic waveform; and then the three-dimensional display section displays three-dimensional flaw detection data generated from the reflection signal resulting from a difference between the reference object (reference reflected ultrasonic waveform) and the object (reflected ultrasonic waveform of interest); and when the object contains any defect, only an echo resulting from the defect is displayed. It is possible to fast determine the presence or absence of a defect or analyze the defect.","Furthermore, since the three-dimensional display section can display the three-dimensional shape data superimposed on the three-dimensional flaw detection data generated from an ultrasonic wave reflection signal resulting from a difference between the reference and the object, when the object contains a defect, only an echo resulting from the defect is displayed. It is possible to fast determine the presence or absence of a defect or analyze the defect.","With reference to , the following describes another configuration of the ultrasonic flaw detector used for the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"The ultrasonic flaw detector in  provides three-dimensional flaw detection data in accordance with the phased array technique.
