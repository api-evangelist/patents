The bottom plate  is provided so as to face the bottom of the toner storage container . The side plates  and  are provided on both sides with respect to the mounting direction of the toner storage container . The front plate  supports the front portion of the toner storage container . Accordingly, the toner storage container  is supported at a predetermined position, and the developing device  may be supplied with a toner.","As shown in , a toner supply port  and the stoppers  are provided at the bottom plate . The toner discharged from the toner storage container  is input to the toner supply port  and supplied to the developing device . When the toner storage container  is mounted so that the toner may be discharged, the stoppers  limit the movement of the shutter .","When the toner storage container  is mounted on the mounting unit  at a predetermined position, the toner supply port  is positioned at a position facing the toner discharge port . Further, the developing device  is supplied with the toner input to the toner supply port  via a toner conveying path (not shown).","In this exemplary embodiment, the toner supply port  is formed in the shape of an askew rectangular opening, that is, in a shape close to a parallelogram. However, as long as a supplementary toner can be input from the toner storage container , the toner supply port may be formed in any shape and be positioned at any position.","A pair of stoppers  is provided on both sides of a mounting position of the toner storage container . The stoppers mainly include two rod-like members  and  that are disposed parallel to each other on the bottom plate in the mounting direction of the toner storage container , first and second rear restricting portions  and  that are connected to the rear ends of the rod-like members  and , respectively, and first and second wall-like portions  and  that are erected on the upper surfaces of the rear restricting portions  and , respectively.

If an external force is applied to increase the gap between the rear portions of the two rod-like members  and  disposed parallel to each other, the rod-like members  and  are elastically bent outward. Accordingly, if an external force for widening the gap is applied to the rear restricting portions  and  and the wall-like portions  and  that are integrally formed with the rod-like members  and , the rear restricting portions  and  and the wall-like portions  and  are deformed outward. If the external force is removed, the rear restricting portions  and  and the wall-like portions  and  return to the original positions.","The front restricting member  connects the rod-like members  and  in the width direction.

An upper portion of the side plate  is formed evenly and the slide plate  of the toner storage container  is laid on the upper portion of the side plate, so that the downward movement of the toner storage container  is regulated. Therefore, the attachment and detachment of the toner storage container to the mounting unit  is guided.","Further, a guide for guiding the slide plate  of the toner storage container  is formed at the front portion of the second side plate , and the upward movement of the toner storage container  is also regulated in this area. Accordingly, while the downward movement of the slide plate  of the toner storage container , which is to be inserted along the second sideplate , is regulated, the toner storage container begins to be inserted. As the toner storage container continues to be inserted, the upward and downward movement of the toner storage container is regulated.","Meanwhile, a portion, of which the height is slightly larger than the height of the toner storage container , is formed only at the rear portion of the first side plate  in the mounting direction, and the height of the front portion of the first side plate  is smaller than that of the toner storage container .

Further, the forward movement of the shutter  is restricted at the position where the end of the shutter  bumps against the front restricting member  formed at the mounting unit . A force, which is applied to the rear restricting portions  and  by the shutter , is cancelled at this time, and the rear restricting portions  and  return to the original positions, that is, the positions where the shutter  does not come in contact with the rear restricting portions. Accordingly, the first and second rear restricting portions  and  restrict the rear portion of the shutter , so that the rearward movement of the shutter  is also regulated.","If the container body  is further inserted after the forward movement of the shutter  is restricted, the slide plate  formed at the side portion of the toner storage container  comes in contact with the guide formed at the second side wall  of the mounting unit . Accordingly, the upward and downward movement of the toner storage container is regulated and the toner storage container is guided forward. Further, while the upward and downward movement of the protruding portions  formed at both sides of the guide frame  is also regulated by the first and second regulation plates  and  that are formed at the mounting unit , the protruding portions are guided by the first and second regulation plates. Furthermore, when the container body  is mounted at a predetermined mounting position as shown in , the opened toner discharge port  faces the toner supply port  that is formed at the mounting unit . Accordingly, the developing device  is supplied with the toner discharged from the toner discharge port  through the toner supply port .","When the developing device is completely supplied with the toner stored in the toner storage container , the toner storage container  is pulled out of the mounting unit  and replaced with a new toner storage container.  is a schematic plan view showing that the toner storage container is pulled out of the mounting unit in order to replace the toner storage container.","If the container body  begins to recede when the movement of the shutter  is restricted by the rear restricting portions  and  as shown in , the shutter  is moved relative to the container body  to the front side where the toner discharge port  is formed and the toner discharge port  is gradually closed. Further, when the toner storage container  recedes to the position where the shutter  completely closes the toner discharge port , the second protrusion , which protrudes laterally from the container body , bumps against the second wall-like portion  as shown in  and is moved along the surface of the second wall-like portion  while pushing the second wall-like portion  to the outside. Accordingly, the second rear restricting portion  is moved laterally, so that the restriction of the rear portion of the shutter  performed by the second rear restricting portion  is released.","Meanwhile, since the rear end of the first protrusion  is positioned ahead of the second protrusion , the first protrusion  comes in contact with the first wall-like portion  after the second protrusion  comes in contact with the second wall-like portion . Further, while the first wall-like portion  is pushed to the outside, the restriction of the rear portion of the shutter  that is performed by the first rear restricting portion  is released, so that the shutter  may recede.","Meanwhile, the shutter  begins to recede after the second protrusion  releases the restriction of the second rear restricting portion . At this time, the first rear restricting portion , which begins to recede behind the second rear restricting portion , does not recede to the position where the restriction of the shutter  is completely released. However, since the notch  is formed at the rear end of the shutter , there is no trouble in making the toner storage container  recede.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"50"},"If the rear portion of the shutter  is released from the rear restricting portions  and  as shown in , the shutter  may recede.

For this reason, the vertical position of the toner storage container  is not fixed at a position along the first side plate , and the toner storage container may be inserted in an unstable state. Accordingly, the first protrusion  may ride on the first wall-like portion  during the mounting of the toner storage container. However, the length of the first protrusion  in the mounting direction is set to be small.

Further, when the shutter reaches a predetermined position, the end of the shutter  bumps against a front restricting member  provided at the mounting unit , so that the shutter  is stopped. After that, only a container body  continues to advance and is mounted on the mounting unit  at a predetermined position. At this time, the rearward movement of the shutter  is regulated by the rear restricting portion .","When the toner storage container  is pulled out, only the container body  recedes while the movement of the shutter  is regulated by the rear restricting portion  at an early stage after the toner storage container begins to be pulled out. Further, when the toner storage container recedes up to the position where a toner discharge port  is closed by the shutter , the second protrusion  bumps against a second wall-like portion  and makes the second rear restricting portion  recede outward. After that, the first protrusion  comes in contact with a first wall-like portion  and the first wall-like portion  is pushed to the outside.

Accordingly, resistance is reduced.","Furthermore, the first rear restricting portion  and the first wall-like portion  are disposed behind the second rear restricting portion  and the second wall-like portion . Accordingly, since the first protrusion  may ride on the first wall-like portion , a riding-on state is easily released. Therefore, it may be possible to avoid the difficulty in mounting the toner storage container that is caused by the deviation of the toner storage container from a previously supposed position during the mounting of the toner storage container .
