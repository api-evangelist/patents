The disclosure of each of the above applications is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under grant number RO1 CA95687 awarded by the National Cancer Institute and National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to reagents and methods for enhancing efficacy of prodrugs. Specifically, the invention relates to targeted delivery of enzymes, in particular specifically engineered enzymes, to cells in need thereof, particularly for converting prodrugs to chemotherapeutically active drugs. The invention is particularly directed to targeted delivery of said enzymes to cancer cells of specific tumor types. Specifically, the invention provides genetically-engineered modified human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) with enhanced activity towards nucleoside analogs used in cancer chemotherapy.","2. Background of the Related Art","Many currently-used chemotherapeutic agents are members of a class of drugs referred to as anti-metabolites. One type of such anti-metabolite are molecules that block or subvert one or more of the metabolic pathways involved in DNA synthesis by mimicking naturally-occurring nucleic acid building blocks. Many of this type of anti-metabolite are nucleoside analogs (NAs). These NAs themselves usually do not possess any therapeutic activity (and thus are properly termed prodrugs) and rely on their conversion, for the most part to the triphosphorylated form, to become active (prodrug-to-drug metabolism).","The efficiency of conversion from the administered nucleoside to the active triphosphorylated form determines the efficacy of these types of prodrugs. The serial phosphorylation of NAs to their triphosphorylated metabolite, via monophosphate and diphosphate intermediates, is catalyzed by human cellular kinases, with deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) playing a major role. dCK transfers a phosphoryl group from ATP (or other triphosphorylated nucleotides) to deoxycytidine (dC). Native dCK has been shown to localize in the cytoplasm, though over-expression of dCK from a transfected construct may result in nuclear localization of dCK (Hatzis et al., 1998, 273:30239-30243). dCK is required for the phosphorylation of numerous NAs used in chemotherapy, including AraC (1-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine; Cytarabine), dFdC (2\u2032,2\u2032-difluorodeoxycytidine; Gemcitabine), FaraA (2-fluoro-9-\u03b2-D-arabinosyladenine; Fludarabine) and 2CdA (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, Cladribine) (Van Rompay et al., 2000, 87:189-98). Therefore, the activity of dCK is one of the factors that determine the sensitivity of cancer (including leukemias and certain solid tumors) to deoxynucleoside toxicity and hence, therapy (Stegmann et al., 1995, Blood 85:1188-94; Lotfi et al., 1999, 5:2438-44; Kakihara et al., 1998, 31:405-9; Bergman et al., 1999, 57:397-406; Goan et al, 1999, 59:4204-7).","There is a direct correlation between dCK enzymatic activity in tumor cell lines and the sensitivity of those cells to the toxicity of nucleoside analog chemotherapeutic prodrugs (Hapke et al., 1996, 56:2343-7). Cells lacking dCK activity are resistant to a variety of drugs, including ara-C, cladribine, fludarabine and gemcitabine (Owens et al., 1992, 52:2389-93; Ruiz van Haperen et al., 1994, 54:4138-43) and drug sensitivity to ara-C can be restored by expressing functional dCK protein in cells that do not express this enzyme natively or in which only mutationally-inactivated forms thereof are expressed (Stegmann et al., 1995, 85:1188-94). Moreover, in vivo studies conducted on animal tumors using gemcitabine showed that increased dCK activity, mediated by dCK gene transfer, resulted in enhanced accumulation and prolonged elimination kinetics of gemcitabine triphosphate, and ultimately, to a better tumor response to the prodrug (Blackstock et al., 2001, 7:3263-8).","More efficient prodrug-to-chemotherapeutic drug conversion, i.e. from NA to NA-triphosphate, would greatly increase the potency of such prodrugs and reduce undesired side effects common in chemotherapeutic treatments (due at least in part to higher concentrations of the drug needed to achieve a therapeutic result, with concomitant toxicity to normal cells and tissues). Higher concentrations of the active metabolites of nucleoside analog prodrugs, particularly in the cancer cells themselves, would result in a better therapeutic index for these prodrugs. In addition, some tumor cells develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents that are administered as prodrugs and activated by enzymes expressed in target tumor cells, by reducing or eliminating expression of the gene(s) encoding the enzymatic activity. Resistance arising from such down-regulation of cellular gene expression could be overcome by targeted delivery of the enzyme directly to the tumor cell. Additionally, targeted delivery into cancer cells of a modified enzyme that has acquired additional substrate specificity as compared to the wild type enzyme allows the use of additional NAs to treat the targeted cancer cells. Thus, there is a need for more efficient enzymes and enzymes that utilize a wider variety of substrate NAs, especially NAs that are not normally phosphorylated by wild-type cellular enzymes, and for methods of using these enzymes to treat cancer cells.","The invention provides reagents and methods for targeted delivery of enzymes, in particular specifically engineered human enzymes capable of converting prodrugs to chemotherapeutically-active or activated forms of said prodrugs, to cells in need thereof. The invention in particular embodiments provides said reagents and methods for targeted delivery to cells, most preferably cancer cells, of modified deoxycytidine kinases (dCK), most preferably human dCK, with improved catalytic efficiency or extended or additional substrate specificity compared with wild type dCK, to produce or increase therapeutic effectiveness of nucleoside prodrugs in said cells.","In one aspect, the invention provides a modified human dCK of the invention that has amino acid substitutions at positions 104 and 133 wherein the amino acid positions are numbered according to the wild type dCK sequence (as shown in , SEQ ID NO:1).

The invention is advantageous in increasing chemotherapeutic sensitivity of tumor cells to a NA, especially in tumor cells that are natively resistant to the nucleoside analog-based therapies or that have acquired or developed said resistance, because the enzyme activity responsible for converting a nucleoside prodrug such as Ara-C to the triphosphate form is absent or expressed at much reduced levels in said cells. The invention is also advantageous in sensitizing cells to a NA to which the cells normally are not sensitive. The invention is further advantageous because it permits specific accumulation of said nucleoside analogs in targeted cells, wherein embodiments comprising antibody-enzyme conjugates direct the enzyme to cells, most preferably tumor cells, expressing a cell-surface marker recognized by the antibody. In these embodiments, said specifically-targeted cells, preferably tumor cells, exhibit differentially greater enzyme activity than non-targeted, preferably non-tumor, cells. Phosphorylated nucleoside analogs specifically accumulate in said targeted cells as the result of enzyme activity, wherein the triphosphate form of the analog cannot freely exit the cell through the plasma membrane. Thus, the invention advantageously provides a way to target, localize and accumulate chemotherapeutic drugs to the most desired target cells, i.e. tumor cells.","Suitable embodiments of the present invention will become evident from the following more detailed description of certain advantageous embodiments and the claims.","This invention provides reagents that are isolated dCK enzymes, preferably human dCK enzymes and more preferably human dCK enzymes comprising genetically-engineered or naturally-occurring mutant species thereof having an increased enzymatic activity and\/or additional substrate specificity for converting a prodrug, most preferably an anticancer prodrug into a drug species having a biological, most preferably an anticancer cell effect. Advantageously, the reagents comprise antibody-enzyme conjugates. In particular embodiments, the antibody is capable of being internalized into the interior of the cell expressing the cell surface marker for which the antibody is immunologically specific.","The invention provides reagents comprising dCK variants with altered preferably improved activity and methods of suing such reagents for targeted delivery of an enzyme that can convert a prodrug to a chemotherapeutically-active species thereof in a target cell. Human dCK plays an essential role in the activation of medicinally relevant nucleoside analogs (NAs), such as AraC and gemcitabine, which are extensively used for the treatment of hematological malignancies and some types of solid tumors. In certain specific embodiments, the wild type human dCK comprises the sequence as identified in SEQ ID NO:1; and the modified dCK of the invention comprises specific substitutions at amino acid positions 104, 133 and\/or 74 and 100 as described herein. Modified dCKs with conservative amino acid substitutions at positions other than 74, 100, 104 and 133 while retaining dCK activity are also encompassed by the invention.","In one embodiment, a modified dCK of the invention can be used to increase the efficacy of nucleoside analogs, such as AraC or cladribine. Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides a modified, more efficient deoxycytidiune kinase (dCK) that improves and augments the accumulated levels of phosphorylated NAs, such as AraC, in the cells.  shows a schematic diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In , dCKis an engineered form of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). dCKwas designed, as described herein, to phosphorylate nucleoside analog drugs, such as AraC and gemcitabine, more efficiently, e.g., at lower extracellular concentrations, or with a greater enzymatic activity. As provided herein, the enzyme is conjugated, most advantageously covalently linked, to an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody or immunologically-specific fragment thereof, and in particular embodiments a human or humanized antibody immunologically specific for a cell surface antigen expressed on the cell surface of a eukaryotic cell, specifically a human cell and in particular a human tumor cell. In certain particularly advantageous embodiments, the antibody is capable of being internalized into the interior of the cell expressing the cell surface marker for which the antibody is immunologically specific. Alternatively, the modified dCK can be introduced into target cells by introducing into the cells polynucleotides encoding the modified dCK of the invention using gene delivery techniques known in the art or described herein.","Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides methods for sensitizing tumor cells that are non-responsive to particular drugs by generating an antibody-conjugated enzyme that will deliver the enzyme to the tumor cells, thereby expressing the enzyme that can activate the particular drug in the cells. A non-responsive cell can be, for example, a cell that normally does not express or expresses an insufficient amount of the necessary enzyme, a cell that expresses a defective or inefficient enzyme, and\/or a cell that has acquired resistance to a particular drug (i.e. continues to grow in the presence of a drug that previously diminished or inhibited growth of the cell).","As used herein, a modified dCK having \u201cadditional substrate specificity,\u201d \u201cextended substrate specificity,\u201d \u201cbroader substrate specificity,\u201d or \u201ca broader spectrum of substrate specificity\u201d refers to a modified dCK that is able to phosphorylate nucleoside analogs or other prodrugs that the wild type dCK is unable to phosphorylate. In one embodiment of the invention, the modified human dCK acquired additional substrate specificity for thymidine and thymidine analogs, such as BVdU. Delivery into tumor cells of such modified human dCK sensitizes the cells to the growth inhibitory effect of thymidine analog prodrugs such as BVdU.","Disclosed herein are particular embodiments of modified human dCK species having increased kinase activity. Those with skill in the art will appreciate that other modified species having increased kinase activity can be produced using the methods disclosed herein, and fall within the scope of the instant disclosure. Included within said modified species are preferably species genetically engineered to have increased activity, but naturally-occurring variants of human dCK are explicitly considered to fall within the scope of the instant disclosure.","The invention provides methods of using such genetically-engineered or naturally-occurring mutant species of human dCK enzymes. In the practice of these methods of this invention, a nucleoside analog prodrug such as AraC is administered to a patient concomitantly with antibody-enzyme conjugate administration. AraC is among the most active agents in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Estey 2000, 96:1670-3). The cytotoxic activity of AraC, however, is dependent on its intracellular conversion to its active metabolite AraCTP. Sampling of blood during and after AraC therapy in patients with AML has illustrated that AraCTP levels are highly relevant to prognosis and response to therapy (Estey et al., 1987, 1:580-3; Iacoboni et al., 1986, 4:1079-88). Statistically significant correlations have been reported between response to AraC, and the rate of AraCTP elimination and the area under the curve (AUC) of AraCTP accumulation (Plunkett et al., 1985, 12:20-30; Kantarjian et al., 1986, 81:387-94). This demonstrates the importance of AraCTP accumulation and retention in treatment outcome. Thus, augmentation of AraCTP levels in leukemia blasts is desirable (Gandhi et al, 1993, 11:116-24).","Delivery of the enzyme to the interior of the targeted cell provides increased enzymatic activity directly thereto, and accelerates conversion of the prodrug to its monophosphate form inside the cell. It is understood in the art that this monophosphorylation of the prodrug is the rate-limiting step, and that subsequent conversion of the monophosphate form to the triphosphate nucleotide is more efficient in comparison. Thus, the practice of the methods of the invention with these antibody-enzyme conjugates reduces a metabolic bottleneck in the prodrug's activation and facilitates the conversion of NA prodrugs to NA monophosphates, and the increased high concentration of nucleoside analogue NA-triphosphate in the targeted cell results in increased cytotoxicity in the cell.","In certain embodiments, an antibody suitable for use in the invention can be an antibody that is known to recognize antigens specific to a certain cell type including, but not limited to, antibodies described in Sandlie and Brekke (2003, 2:52-62). Alternatively, antibodies useful in the invention can be generated to recognize a desired antigen using techniques described herein. In certain aspects of these embodiments, the antibody can internalize or be internalized within the target cell (i.e. enter the target cell through the cell membrane) so that an enzyme conjugated to the antibody is active in the cytoplasm of the target cell. In other aspects, the antibody can bind to a target cell but not internalize, so that a conjugated enzyme is not internalized within the target cell but can activate prodrugs that will enter the target cell in an activated state. In still other aspects, the antibody can be engineered to comprise a Protein Transduction Domain (PTD), which is a short stretch of amino acid residues, mainly basic amino acids such as a polymeric arginine peptide that can carry a protein inside a cell (see, for example, Kabouridis, 2003, 21:498-503). All references cited in this application are expressly incorporated by reference herein for any purpose.","In certain embodiments, an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention can be used to target a specific tumor cell that is deficient or lacks an active enzyme necessary for efficient drug activity. For example, a modified species of dCK of the invention can be conjugated to an antibody (such as HERCEPTIN\u00ae) that specifically recognizes antigens on a breast tumor cell, which normally does not express dCK. Alternatively, the conjugate specifically targets the tumor cell to provide augmented activity in the cell that expresses normal levels of wild-type dCK. The breast tumor cell can then be contacted with a nucleoside analog, thereby providing an anti-tumor effect on said cell. In particular embodiments, antibody-conjugated enzymes of the invention can be designed to target a particular tumor cell type by choosing an antibody that specifically recognizes antigens on that tumor cell. For example, for prostate cancer, antibodies can be chosen that recognize STEAP (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate; Hubert et al., 1999, 7:4523-8).","In certain particular embodiments, the antibody is a humanized monoclonal antibody termed HuM195 (Protein Design Laboratories, Fremont, Calif.) that is immunologically specific for cell surface marker protein CD33. CD33 is primarily expressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, and not in normal or stem cells, thus providing targeting specificity to human tumor cells. Accordingly, said embodiments are particularly advantageous for delivering the modified dCK proteins of the invention to human leukemia cells. Importantly, this antibody has the ability to internalize into the cell.","Conventional techniques may be used for recombinant DNA preparation, oligonucleotide synthesis, and in vitro cell and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection).

Particularly useful polypeptide fragments include functional domains, including binding domains.","The term \u201cnaturally-occurring\u201d as used herein and applied to an object refers to the fact that the object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and that has not been intentionally modified by man is naturally-occurring.","The term \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the components to which the term is applied are in a relationship that allows them to carry out their inherent functions under suitable conditions. For example, a transcription control sequence \u201coperably linked\u201d to a protein coding sequence is covalently ligated thereto so that expression of the protein coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the transcriptional activity of the control sequences.","The term \u201ccontrol sequence\u201d as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences that can affect expression, processing or intracellular localization of coding sequences to which they are ligated.

Oligonucleotides may be single stranded or double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides of the invention may be sense or antisense oligonucleotides with reference to a protein-coding sequence.","Unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5\u2032 end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5\u2032 direction. The direction of 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5\u2032 to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA transcript are referred to as \u201cupstream sequences\u201d; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3\u2032 to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA transcript are referred to as \u201cdownstream sequences\u201d.","The term \u201cnaturally occurring nucleotides\u201d includes deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides.

Eckstein, Ed.), Oxford University Press, Oxford England; Stec et al., U.S. Pat.

An oligonucleotide can include a detectable label to enable detection of the oligonucleotide or hybridization thereof.","The term \u201cvector\u201d is used to refer to any molecule (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid, or virus) used to transfer coding information to a host cell.","The term \u201cexpression vector\u201d refers to a vector that is suitable for transformation of a host cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and\/or control expression of inserted heterologous nucleic acid sequences. Expression includes, but is not limited to, processes such as transcription, translation, and RNA splicing, if introns are present.","The term \u201crecombinant expression construct\u201d as used herein is a replicable DNA construct in which a DNA sequence encoding a protein or polypeptide according to the invention is operably linked to suitable control sequences capable of effecting the expression of the protein or polypeptide in a suitable host cell. The need for such control sequences will vary depending upon the host selected and the transformation method chosen. Generally, control sequences include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator or enhancer sequence to control or regulate transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences which control the termination of transcription and translation, and in mammalian cells, sequences that direct 5\u2032 terminal capping and 3\u2032 terminal polyadenylation of the primary transcript. Amplification vectors, on the other hand, do not require expression control domains. All that is needed is the ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants. See, Sambrook et al., 2001, (Cold Spring Harbor Press: New York).","The term \u201chost cell\u201d is used to refer to a cell into which has been introduced, or is capable of being introduced with a nucleic acid sequence and further expresses or is capable of expressing a selected gene of interest. The term includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not the progeny is identical in morphology or in genetic make-up to the original parent, so long as the selected gene is present.","The term \u201ctransduction\u201d is used to refer to the transfer of genes from one bacterium to another, usually by a phage. \u201cTransduction\u201d also refers to the acquisition and transfer of eukaryotic cellular sequences by retroviruses.","The term \u201ctransfection\u201d is used to refer to the uptake of foreign or exogenous DNA by a cell, and a cell has been \u201ctransfected\u201d when the exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed herein. See, e.g., Graham et al., 1973, 52:456; Sambrook et al., 2001, MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories; Davis et al., 1986, BASIC METHODS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Elsevier; and Chu et al., 1981, 13:197. Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.","The term \u201ctransformation\u201d as used herein refers to a change in a cell's genetic characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain a new DNA. For example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from its native state. Following transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA may recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell, or may be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being replicated, or may replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have been stably transformed when the DNA is replicated with the division of the cell.","The term \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d or \u201cnative\u201d when used in connection with biological materials such as nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, host cells, and the like, refers to materials which are found in nature and are not manipulated by man. Similarly, \u201cnon-naturally occurring\u201d or \u201cnon-native\u201d as used herein refers to a material that is not found in nature or that has been structurally modified or synthesized by man.","The term \u201cantigen\u201d refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antibody, and additionally capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to an epitope of that antigen. An antigen may have one or more epitopes.","The term \u201cepitope\u201d includes any determinant, preferably a polypeptide determinant, capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and\/or specific charge characteristics. In certain embodiments, an antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when it preferentially recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and\/or macromolecules. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the equilibrium dissociation constant is \u226610or 10M. In some embodiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant may be \u226610M or \u226610M.","The term \u201cidentity,\u201d as known in the art, refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by comparing the sequences thereof. In the art, \u201cidentity\u201d also means the degree of sequence relatedness between nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides, as the case may be, as determined by the match between strings of two or more nucleotide or two or more amino acid sequences. \u201cIdentity\u201d measures the percent of identical matches between the smaller of two or more sequences with gap alignments (if any) addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., \u201calgorithms\u201d).","The term \u201csimilarity\u201d is used in the art with regard to a related concept, but in contrast to \u201cidentity,\u201d \u201csimilarity\u201d refers to a measure of relatedness, which includes both identical matches and conservative substitution matches. If two polypeptide sequences have, for example, 10\/20 identical amino acids, and the remainder are all non-conservative substitutions, then the percent identity and similarity would both be 50%. If in the same example, there are five more positions where there are conservative substitutions, then the percent identity remains 50%, but the percent similarity would be 75% ( 15\/20). Therefore, in cases where there are conservative substitutions, the percent similarity between two polypeptides will be higher than the percent identity between those two polypeptides. Identity and similarity of related nucleic acids and polypeptides can be readily calculated by methods known in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, (Lesk, ed.), 1988, Oxford University Press, New York; BIOCOMPUTING: INFORMATICS AND GENOME PROJECTS, (Smith, D.

A full-length heavy chain includes a variable region domain, V, and three constant region domains, C1, C2, and C3. The Vdomain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide, and the C3 domain is at the carboxyl-terminus. A full-length light chain includes a variable region domain, V, and a constant region domain, C. Like the heavy chain, the variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide. The term \u201clight chain\u201d, as used herein, encompasses a full-length light chain and fragments thereof. An F(ab) fragment is comprised of one light chain and the C1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of an F(ab) molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule. An F(ab\u2032) fragment contains one light chain and one heavy chain that contains more of the constant region, between the C1 and C2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between two heavy chains to form an F(ab\u2032)molecule. The Fv region comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions. Single-chain antibodies are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain, which forms an antigen-binding region. Single chain antibodies are discussed in detail in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88\/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203. In certain embodiments, the invention provides conjugates of enzymes with F(ab), F(ab\u2032), F(ab\u2032), single-chain variable fragments, or other antibody fragments that specifically bind to the target antigens.","As used herein, the term \u201cfully human antibodies\u201d comprise amino acid sequences encoded only by polynucleotides that are ultimately of human origin or amino acid sequences that are identical to such sequences. For example, inter alia, antibodies encoded by human immunoglobulin-encoding DNA inserted into a mouse genome produced in a transgenic mouse are fully human antibodies since they are encoded by DNA that is ultimately of human origin. In this situation, human immunoglobulin-encoding DNA can be rearranged (to encode an antibody) within the mouse, and somatic mutations may also occur. Antibodies encoded by originally human DNA that has undergone such changes in a mouse are fully human antibodies as the term is used herein. The use of such transgenic mice makes it possible to select fully human antibodies against a human antigen. One of skill in the art will appreciate that fully human antibodies are advantageous for use as therapeutics, particularly to treat chronic diseases, since they are unlikely to precipitate an immune response against themselves. In contrast, many non-human antibodies are known to precipitate an immune response against themselves when used in humans, a situation that makes chronic use of such antibodies in humans inadvisable. Fully human antibodies thus solve a long-standing problem faced in using antibodies to treat chronic conditions, including human diseases. See e.g. Billiau, 1988, 9:37-40; Horneff et al., 1991, & 59:89-103; Tjandra et al., 1990, & 68:367-76.","In a humanized antibody, the entire antibody, except the CDRs, is encoded by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical to such an antibody except within its CDRs. The CDRs, which are encoded by nucleic acids originating in a non-human organism, are grafted into the \u03b2-sheet framework of a human antibody variable region to create an antibody, the specificity of which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation of such antibodies is described in, e.g., WO 92\/11018, Jones et al., 1986, 321:522-25, Verhoeyen et al., 1988, 239:1534-36. In contrast, a chimeric antibody comprises a human constant region (which is encoded by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical to such a human constant region) and a non-human variable region. The creation of such antibodies is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,722.","A bivalent antibody other than a \u201cmultispecific\u201d or \u201cmultifunctional\u201d antibody, in certain embodiments, is understood to comprise binding sites having identical antigenic specificity. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody typically is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy chain\/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of F(ab\u2032) fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, 1990, 79: 315-321; Kostelny et al., 1992, 148:1547-1553.","In additional embodiments, antibody variants can include antibodies comprising a modified Fc fragment or a modified heavy chain constant region. An Fc fragment or a heavy chain constant region can be modified by mutation to confer on an antibody altered characteristics. See, for example, Burton and Woof, 1992, 51: 1-84; Ravetch and Bolland, 2001, 19: 275-90; Shields et al., 2001, 276: 6591-6604; Telleman and Junghans, 2000, 100: 245-251; Medesan et al., 1998, 28: 2092-2100; all of which are incorporated herein by reference). Such mutations can include substitutions, additions, deletions, or any combination thereof, and are typically produced by site-directed mutagenesis using one or more mutagenic oligonucleotide(s) according to methods described herein, as well as according to methods known in the art (see, for example, Maniatis et al., MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL, 3rd Ed., 2001, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Berger and Kimmel, METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY, Volume 152, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, 1987, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif., which are incorporated herein by reference).","Additional antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine variants may be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.","Antibodies can be matured in vitro to produce antibodies with altered properties, such as a higher affinity for an antigen or a lower dissociation constant. Variation of only residues within the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), particularly the CDR3s, can result in altered antibodies that bind to the same antigen, but with greater affinity. See e.g. Schier et al., 1996, 263:551-67; Yang et al., 1995, 254:392-403. The invention encompasses antibodies created by a variety of in vitro selection schemes, such as affinity maturation and\/or chain shuffling (Kang et al., 1991, 88:11120-23), or DNA shuffling (Stemmer, 1994, 370:389-391), by which antibodies may be selected to have advantageous properties. In many schemes, a known antibody is randomized at certain positions, often within the CDRs, in vitro and subjected to a selection process whereby antibodies with desired properties, such as increased affinity for a certain antigen, can be isolated. See e.g. van den Beucken et al., 2001, 310:591-601; Desiderio et al., 2001, 310:603-15; Yang et al., 1995, 254:392-403; Schier et al., 1996, 263:551-67. Typically, such mutated antibodies may comprise several altered residues in one or more CDRs, depending on the design of the mutagenesis and selection steps. See e.g. van den Beucken et al., supra.","Preferred antibodies of the invention are specific for antigens present on the cell surface of target cells, most preferably tumor cells. Most preferred embodiments of said antibodies are not immunogenic, and are capable of being internalized within the target tumor cells. The antibodies chosen for conjugation to a particular enzyme will depend on the type of cancer cell that is to be targeted. Said antibodies are preferably conjugated to an enzyme that catalyzes production of a biologically-active drug from a prodrug having reduced or little activity compare with the active drug. In certain embodiments of this invention, the antibodies are conjugated to deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), more preferably human dCK and most preferably modified human deoxycytidine kinase as disclosed herein. Antibodies used in such conjugates most preferably are effectively internalized within a targeted cell. Such antibodies are known, such as HuM195 used in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) therapy and BL22 used in therapy of B-cell malignancies (Caron et al., 1992, 52:6761-7; Appelbaum, 1999, 36:2-8). Alternatively, such antibodies can be designed to identify specific cells.","In a particular embodiment, the invention provides covalent conjugates of a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, which can be used to target leukemia blast cells, most preferably acute myelogenous leukaemia blast cells. In additional embodiments, the invention provides antibody-conjugated enzymes that can target any tumor cell by choosing an antibody that will bind to antigens on that tumor cell. For example, in addition to anti-CD33 antibodies for leukaemia cells, anti-CD20 (such as RITUXAN\u00ae) antibodies can be used to target tumor cells of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, HERCEPTIN\u00ae antibodies can be used to target breast tumor cells, and anti-CC49 antibodies (such as B72.3) can be used to target colorectal, ovarian, and breast tumor cells. Non-limiting examples of these and additional antibodies useful for designing antibody-conjugated enzymes of the invention are described in Sandlie and Brekke (2003, 2:52-62). In particularly advantageous embodiments, antibody-conjugated enzymes according to the invention are effectively delivered into a targeted cell.","Antibodies of the invention can be polyclonal or monoclonal and\/or may be recombinant antibodies. In certain embodiments, fully human antibodies of the invention are prepared, for example, by immunization of transgenic animals capable of producing human antibodies (see, for example, International Patent Application, Publication WO 93\/12227).","Antibodies of the invention can be prepared using transgenic mice that have a substantial portion of the human antibody producing locus inserted in antibody-producing cells of the mice, and that are further engineered to be deficient in producing endogenous, murine, antibodies. Such mice are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and do not produce or produce substantially reduced amounts of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving this result are disclosed in the patents, applications, and references disclosed in the specification herein. In certain embodiments, the skilled worker may employ methods as disclosed in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 98\/24893, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose. See also Mendez et al., 1997, 15:146-156, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose. The human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains yields high affinity antibodies against any antigens of interest, including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies with the desired specificity can be produced and selected.","The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the invention can be produced by a variety of techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology, e.g., the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein (1975, 256:495). Although somatic cell hybridization procedures are preferred, in principle, other techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies can be employed, e.g., viral or oncogenic transformation of B-lymphocytes. A conventional animal system useful for preparing hybridomas is the mouse. Hybridoma production in the mouse is very well established, and immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are well known in the art. Fusion partners (e.g., murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also known.","In certain embodiments, conservative modifications to the heavy chains and light chains of an antibody suitable for use in the invention (and corresponding modifications to the encoding nucleotides) can produce antibodies having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those of the wild type antibody. In contrast, substantial modifications in the functional and\/or chemical characteristics of an antibody may be accomplished by selecting substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a \u03b2 sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.","For example, a \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d may involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a nonnative residue such that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position.","Conjugation of an antibody to an enzyme can be accomplished using techniques as described in the Examples below.","The structures of human dCK in complex with dC-ADP, ara-C-ADP.Mg, and gemcitabine-ADP.Mg have been determined and are described herein. These structures were advantageously used to elucidate the structures of the human dCK enzyme and phosphorylation kinetics observed with various cytosine-analogs and suggested specific modifications to the current arsenal of prodrugs that may improve phosphorylation by dCK, thereby providing an improved therapeutic index. Further, the dCK complexes described herein provide a starting point for structure-based design of mutant dCK enzymes with enhanced activity or additional substrate specificity, which can be used, for example, in gene therapy applications.","In one aspect, the invention provides a dCK mutant having equal or greater catalytic activity than naturally-occurring wild type enzyme. In another aspect, the invention provides modified dCK that acquired substrate specificity, especially specificity for thymidine, that is absent in the naturally-occurring wild type dCK. In a further aspect, the invention provides methods for treating tumor cell comprising contacting the tumor cell with a thymidine analog and the modified dCK of the invention, preferably the antibody conjugated-modified dCK, that phosphorylates the thymidine analog once inside the cell.","Described in co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/791,155 (now issued U.S. Pat. No. 7,419,811) and Ser. No. 11\/760,399 (published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20070258968) are dCK mutants having R104M\/D133A substitutions or A100V\/R104M\/D133A substitutions. Both mutant dCKs exhibited additional substrate specificity for thymidine. The disclosures of U.S. Pat. No. 7,419,811 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20070258968 are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","It was unexpectedly discovered in the instant application that mutant dCK of the invention with substitutions at positions 104 and 133 with amino acids other than those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,419,811 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20070258968 also acquired enhanced activity towards nucleoside analogs as compared to wild type dCK. Particular embodiments of the modified dCK enzymes of the invention include mutants wherein the substitution at amino acid position 104 is glutamine, asparagine, valine, phenylalanine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, or histidine, more preferably glutamine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, or phenylalanine, and most preferably glutamine, leucine, or isoleucine, and wherein the substitution at amino acid position 133 is alanine, glycine, valine, methionine, threonine, serine, isoleucine, leucine, glutamine, asparagine, or histidine, more preferably alanine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, or glutamine, and most preferably alanine In further particular embodiments, the modified dCK of the invention comprises additional mutations at amino acid positions 74 and\/or 100, wherein the substitution at amino acid position 74 is preferably glutamic acid, and the substitution at amino acid position 100 is glycine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, threonine, or proline, more preferably valine, isoleucine, or leucine, and most preferably valine.","It was further surprisingly discovered that modified dCKs with substitutions other than methionine at position 104 exhibited unique characteristics. For example, while both dCK R104M\/D133A and dCK R104L\/D133A exhibited superior activity than wild-type dCK with D-dC or D-dT as the substrate, the R104L\/D133A variant showed higher activities than the R104M\/D133A variant with a purine substrate, such as D-dG and D-dA. Further, the R104L\/D133A variant showed higher efficiency (as defined by k\/K) than the R104M\/D133A variant with a thymidine substrate, such as D-dT and L-dT (see Table 9).","Modified human dCKs with conservative amino acid substitutions at positions other than 74, 100, 104, and 133 or other active sites of the enzyme while retaining dCK activity are also encompassed within the scope of the invention. What constitutes a conservative amino acid substitution is well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, and is further described in Table 1.","The structural information provided herein can be used to design additional dCK mutants with enhanced activity towards clinically important nucleoside analogs (NAs), which can be used in modulating conventional chemotherapy. Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays as disclosed herein can be used to examine the effect of such modified dCK mutants on the cytotoxicity of NAs such as AraC or BVdU.","Nucleic acid molecules (or polynucleotides) encoding the amino acid sequence of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) or a modified dCK that has a better catalytic efficiency and\/or a broader substrate specificity than wild type dCK are encompassed by the invention. Such polynucleotides can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector using conventional recombinant genetic techniques. The vector is typically selected to be functional in the particular host cell employed (i.e., the vector is compatible with the host cell machinery such that amplification of the gene and\/or expression of the gene can occur). For a review of expression vectors, see METH. ENZ. 185 (Goeddel, ed.), 1990, Academic Press.","The invention also provides expression vectors comprising polynucleotides encoding the modified dCK as described herein. Typically, recombinant expression constructs comprising expression vectors used in any of the host cells will contain sequences for plasmid maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous nucleotide sequences. Such sequences, collectively referred to as \u201cflanking sequences\u201d in certain embodiments will typically include one or more of the following nucleotide sequences: a promoter, one or more enhancer sequences, an origin of replication, a transcriptional termination sequence, a complete intron sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice site, a sequence encoding a leader sequence for polypeptide secretion, a sequence encoding an epitope tag, a ribosome binding site, a polyadenylation sequence, a polylinker region for inserting the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide to be expressed, and a selectable marker element. Each of these sequences is discussed below.","Optionally, the construct may contain a \u201ctag\u201d-encoding sequence, i.e., an oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of a modified dCK polypeptide coding sequence; the oligonucleotide sequence encodes polyHis (such as hexaHis), or another \u201ctag\u201d such as FLAG, HA (hemaglutinin influenza virus), or myc, for which commercially available antibodies exist. This tag is typically fused to the polypeptide upon expression of the polypeptide, and can serve as a means for affinity purification or detection of the dCK or modified dCK of the invention from the host cell. Affinity purification can be accomplished, for example, by column chromatography using antibodies against the tag as an affinity matrix. Optionally, the tag can subsequently be removed from the purified dCK or modified dCK polypeptide by various means such as using certain peptidases for cleavage. For example, human dCK can be tagged with a His tag, which can be cleaved with thrombin.","Flanking sequences may be homologous (i.e., from the same species and\/or strain as the host cell), heterologous (i.e., from a species other than the host cell species or strain), hybrid (i.e., a combination of flanking sequences from more than one source), synthetic or native. As such, the source of a flanking sequence may be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism, any vertebrate or invertebrate organism, or any plant, provided that the flanking sequence is functional in, and can be activated by, the host cell machinery.","Flanking sequences useful in the constructs provided by the invention may be obtained by any of several methods well known in the art. Typically, flanking sequences useful herein will have been previously identified by mapping and\/or by restriction endonuclease digestion and can thus be isolated from the proper tissue source using the appropriate restriction endonucleases. In some cases, the full nucleotide sequence of a flanking sequence may be known. Here, the flanking sequence may be synthesized using the methods described herein for nucleic acid synthesis or cloning.","Whether all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known, it may be obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\/or by screening a genomic library with a suitable probe such as an oligonucleotide and\/or flanking sequence fragment from the same or another species. Where the flanking sequence is not known, a fragment of DNA containing a flanking sequence may be isolated from a larger piece of DNA that may contain, for example, a coding sequence or even another gene or genes. Isolation may be accomplished by restriction endonuclease digestion to produce the proper DNA fragment followed by isolation using agarose gel purification, Qiagen\u00ae column chromatography (Chatsworth, Calif.), or other methods known to the skilled artisan. The selection of suitable enzymes to accomplish this purpose will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","An origin of replication is typically a part of commercially-available prokaryotic expression vectors, and is useful for amplifying the vector in a host cell. If the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site, one may be chemically synthesized based on a known sequence, and ligated into the vector. For example, the origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) is suitable for most gram-negative bacteria, and various viral origins (e.g., SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, vesicular stomatitus virus (VSV), or papillomaviruses such as HPV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (for example, the SV40 origin is often used only because it also contains the virus early promoter).","A transcription termination sequence is typically located 3\u2032 to the end of a polypeptide coding region and serves to terminate transcription. Usually, a transcription termination sequence in prokaryotic cells is a G-C rich fragment followed by a poly-T sequence. While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or even purchased commercially as part of a vector, it can also be readily synthesized using methods for nucleic acid synthesis such as those described herein.","A selectable marker gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival and growth of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, tetracycline, or kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells; (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies of the cell; or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex or defined media. Preferred selectable markers are the kanamycin resistance gene, the ampicillin resistance gene, and the tetracycline resistance gene. Advantageously, a neomycin resistance gene may also be used for selection in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.","Other selectable genes may be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed. Amplification is the process wherein genes that are required for production of a protein critical for growth or cell survival are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells include dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and promoterless thymidine kinase genes. Mammalian cell transformants are placed under selection pressure wherein only the transformants are uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of the selectable gene present in the vector. Selection pressure is imposed by culturing the transformed cells under conditions in which the concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively increased, thereby leading to the amplification of both the selectable gene and the DNA that encodes another gene, such as dCK or a modified species of dCK polypeptide. As a result, increased quantities of a polypeptide such as dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide species are synthesized from the amplified DNA.","In some cases, such as where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell expression system, one may manipulate the various pre- or prosequences to improve glycosylation or yield. For example, one may alter the peptidase cleavage site of a particular signal peptide, or add pro-sequences, which also may affect glycosylation. The final protein product may have, in the \u22121 position (relative to the first amino acid of the mature protein) one or more additional amino acids incident to expression, which may not have been totally removed. For example, the final protein product may have one or two amino acid residues found in the peptidase cleavage site, attached to the amino-terminus. Alternatively, use of some enzyme cleavage sites may result in a slightly truncated form of the desired polypeptide, if the enzyme cuts at such area within the mature polypeptide.","Expression and cloning vectors comprising the recombinant expression constructs of the invention will typically contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to the molecule encoding dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide species. Promoters are untranscribed sequences located upstream (i.e., 5\u2032) to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control transcription of the structural gene. Promoters are conventionally grouped into one of two classes: inducible promoters and constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, such as the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters, on the other hand, uniformly transcribe genes to which they are operably linked, that is, with little or no control over regulation of gene expression. A large number of promoters, recognized by a variety of potential host cells, are well known. A suitable promoter is operably linked to the DNA encoding heavy chain or light chain comprising dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide of the invention by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the desired promoter sequence into the vector.","Suitable promoters for use with mammalian host cells are well known and include, but are not limited to, those obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Other suitable mammalian promoters include heterologous mammalian promoters, for example, heat-shock promoters and the actin promoter.","Additional promoters which may be of interest include, but are not limited to: SV40 early promoter (Benoist and Chambon, 1981, 290:304-10); CMV promoter (Thomsen et al., 1984, 81:659-663); the promoter contained in the 3\u2032 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto, et al., 1980, 22:787-97); herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al., 1981, 78:1444-45); promoter and regulatory sequences from the metallothionine gene (Brinster et al., 1982, 296:39-42); and prokaryotic promoters such as the beta-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff et al., 1978, 75:3727-31); or the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., 1983, 80:21-25). Also of interest are the following animal transcriptional control regions, which exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized in transgenic animals: the elastase I gene control region that is active in pancreatic acinar cells (Swift et al., 1984, 38:639-46; Ornitz et al., 1986, 50:399-409 (1986); MacDonald, 1987, 7:425-515); the insulin gene control region that is active in pancreatic beta cells (Hanahan, 1985, 315:115-22); the immunoglobulin gene control region that is active in lymphoid cells (Grosschedl et al., 1984, 38:647-58; Adames et al., 1985, 318:533-38; Alexander et al., 1987, 7:1436-44); the mouse mammary tumor virus control region that is active in testicular, breast, lymphoid and mast cells (Leder et al., 1986, 45:485-95); the albumin gene control region that is active in liver (Pinkert et al., 1987, 1:268-76); the alpha-feto-protein gene control region that is active in liver (Krumlauf et al., 1985, 5:1639-48; Hammer et al., 1987, 235:53-58); the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene control region that is active in liver (Kelsey et al., 1987, 1:161-71); the beta-globin gene control region that is active in myeloid cells (Mogram et al., 1985, 315:338-40; Kollias et al., 1986, 46:89-94); the myelin basic protein gene control region that is active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain (Readhead et al., 1987, 48:703-12); the myosin light chain-2 gene control region that is active in skeletal muscle (Sani, 1985, 314:283-86); and the gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control region that is active in the hypothalamus (Mason et al., 1986, 234:1372-78).","A ribosome-binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of mRNA and is characterized by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or a Kozak sequence (eukaryotes). The element is typically located 3\u2032 to the promoter and 5\u2032 to the coding sequence of the polypeptide to be expressed.","An enhancer sequence may be inserted into the vector to increase transcription of DNA encoding dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide of the invention by higher eukaryotes. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about 10-300 by in length, that act on the promoter to increase transcription. Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found at positions both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the transcription unit. Several enhancer sequences available from mammalian genes are known (e.g., globin, elastase, albumin, alpha-feto-protein and insulin). Typically, however, an enhancer from a virus is used. The SV40 enhancer, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer, and adenovirus enhancers known in the art are exemplary enhancing elements for the activation of eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer may be positioned in the vector either 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to a coding sequence, it is typically located at a site 5\u2032 from the promoter.","Recombinant expression constructs of the invention may be produced from a commercially available vector. Such vectors may or may not contain all of the desired flanking sequences. Where one or more of the flanking sequences described herein are not already present in the vector, they may be individually obtained and ligated into the vector. Methods used for obtaining each of the flanking sequences are well known to one skilled in the art.","In another aspect, the invention provides host cells that produce the modified dCKs. After the recombinant expression construct has been produced and a nucleic acid molecule encoding a dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide has been inserted into the proper site of the vector, the completed construct is advantageously inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and\/or polypeptide expression. The transformation of an expression vector for a dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide into a selected host cell may be accomplished by well known methods including transfection, infection, calcium phosphate co-precipitation, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, or other known techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the type of host cell to be used. These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the skilled artisan, and are set forth, for example, in Sambrook et al., supra.","A sequence encoding an appropriate native or heterologous signal sequence (leader sequence or signal peptide) can be incorporated into an expression vector, to promote extracellular secretion of the polypeptide. The choice of signal peptide or leader depends on the type of host cells in which the polypeptide is produced, and a heterologous signal sequence can replace the native signal sequence. Examples of signal peptides that are functional in mammalian host cells include the following: the signal sequence for interleukin-7 (IL-7) described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,195; the signal sequence for interleukin-2 receptor described in Cosman et al. (1984, 312: 768); the interleukin-4 receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0 367 566; the type I interleukin-1 receptor signal peptide described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,607; the type II interleukin-1 receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0 460 846.","A host cell, when cultured under appropriate conditions, will synthesize dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide that can subsequently be collected from the culture medium (if the host cell secretes it into the medium) or directly from the host cell producing it (if it is not secreted). The selection of an appropriate host cell will depend upon various factors, such as desired expression levels, polypeptide modifications that are desirable or necessary for activity (such as glycosylation or phosphorylation) and ease of folding into a biologically active molecule. In addition, dCK can be expressed in a bacterial expression system using, for example, BL21(DE3) competent cells.","Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), and a number of other cell lines. In certain embodiments, cell lines may be selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and constitutively produced a dCK or a modified dCK polypeptide. In another embodiment, a cell line from the B cell lineage that does not make its own antibody but has a capacity to make and secrete a heterologous antibody can be selected.","In some embodiments, the invention provides compositions comprising a modified dCK or an antibody-conjugated dCK. In certain particular embodiments, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or a plurality of the antibody-enzyme conjugates of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer, emulsifier, preservative, and\/or adjuvant. Preferably, acceptable formulation materials are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the composition, without affecting the enzymatic activity of the modified dCK. In such embodiments, suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-sulfite); buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates or other organic acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine); chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)); complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides; disaccharides; and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring, flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt-forming counterions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (such as sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides, preferably sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and\/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. See REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18Edition, (A. R. Gennaro, ed.), 1990, Mack Publishing Company.","In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example, REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra. In certain embodiments, such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the antibodies of the invention.","In certain embodiments, the primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. In particular embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, and may further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefor. In certain embodiments of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions, antibody-conjugated enzymes, and\/or modified enzymes of the invention, may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, in certain embodiments, dCK or modified dCK polypeptide or an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be selected for parenteral delivery. Alternatively, the compositions may be selected for inhalation or for delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. Preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.","The formulation components are present preferably in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain embodiments, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.","When parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for use in this invention may be provided in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired modified dCK polypeptide or an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which the modified dCK polypeptide or an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes, that may provide controlled or sustained release of the product which can be delivered via depot injection. In certain embodiments, hyaluronic acid may also be used, having the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug delivery devices may be used to introduce the desired antibody molecule.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated for inhalation. In these embodiments, modified dCK polypeptide or an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention are advantageously formulated as a dry, inhalable powder. In particular embodiments, modified dCK polypeptide or antibody-conjugated enzyme inhalation solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In certain embodiments, solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration and formulation methods therefore are further described in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US94\/001875, which is incorporated by reference and describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.","It is also contemplated that formulations can be administered orally. Modified dCK polypeptides or antibody-conjugated enzymes of the invention that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the modified dCK polypeptide or an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be employed.","A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is preferably provided to comprise an effective quantity of one or a plurality of modified dCK polypeptides or antibody-conjugated enzymes of the invention in a mixture with non-toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions may be prepared in unit-dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.","Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving modified dCK polypeptides or antibody-conjugated enzymes of the invention in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, International Patent Application No. PCT\/US93\/00829, which is incorporated by reference and describes controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Sustained-release preparations may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and European Patent Application Publication No. EP 058481, each of which is incorporated by reference), copolymers of -glutamic acid and gamma ethyl--glutamate (Sidman et al., 1983, 22:547-556), poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., 1981, 15:167-277 and Langer, 1982, 12:98-105), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or poly-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European Patent Application Publication No. EP 133,988). Sustained release compositions may also include liposomes that can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See e.g., Eppstein et al., 1985, 82:3688-3692; European Patent Application Publication Nos. EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP 143,949, incorporated by reference.","Pharmaceutical compositions used for in vivo administration are typically provided as sterile preparations. Sterilization can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. When the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. Compositions for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. Parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.","Once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, crystal, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration.","The invention also provides kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits of the invention may each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation, and optionally instructions for use. In certain embodiments of this invention, kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are provided.","The therapeutically effective amount of a modified dCK polypeptide- or an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention-containing pharmaceutical composition to be employed will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the modified dCK polypeptide or an antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and\/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg to up to about 30 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In particular embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg up to about 30 mg\/kg, optionally from 1 \u03bcg\/kg up to about 30 mg\/kg or from 10 \u03bcg\/kg up to about 5 mg\/kg.","It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the amount of drug required for therapeutic effect on administration will, of course, vary with the agent chosen, the nature and severity of the condition and the mammal undergoing treatment, and is ultimately at the discretion of the physician. It will also be appreciated that the optimal course of treatment and the number of doses given, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional course of treatment determination tests.","Dosing frequency will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the particular modified dCK polypeptide or antibody-conjugated enzyme of the invention in the formulation used. Typically, a clinician administers the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose or as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be administered to patients throughout an extended time period. Chronic administration of an antibody-modified dCK conjugate of the invention minimizes the adverse immune or allergic response commonly associated with antibodies that are raised against a human antigen in a non-human animal, for example, a non-fully human antibody or non-human antibody produced in a non-human species.","The route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.","The composition also may be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation device is used, the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.","It also may be desirable to use pharmaceutical compositions of the invention according to the invention ex vivo. In such instances, cells, tissues or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to pharmaceutical compositions of the invention after which the cells, tissues and\/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.","In particular, modified dCK polypeptides or antibody-conjugated enzymes of the invention can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptide. In certain embodiments, such cells may be animal or human cells, and may be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells may be immortalized. In other embodiments, in order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In further embodiments, the encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.","The Examples, which follow, are illustrative of specific embodiments of the invention, and various uses thereof. They are set forth for explanatory purposes only, and are not to be taken as limiting the invention.","Human dCK was amplified from a cDNA library (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and cloned into the pET14b vector as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,419,811 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20070258968, the disclosures of both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Primer oligonucleotides (forward primer SEQ ID NO:22, reverse primer SEQ ID NO:23) were designed based on the published DNA sequence, introducing suitable endonuclease restriction sites at either end to facilitate direct cloning into the pET14b bacterial expression vector (available from, for example, Novagen, San Diego, Calif.). Clone integrity was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The cDNA sequence of human dCK is shown in GenBank Accession No. NM000788.2 (SEQ ID NO:21). BL21(DE3) (available from, for example, Strategene, La Jolla, Calif.) carrying the recombinant plasmid coding for histidine-tagged dCK was grown in 2YT media at 37\u00b0 C., induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and harvested after 8 hours. The cell pellet was lysed by sonication, and loaded on a TALON Co-affinity column (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.). After washing and elution with imidazole, the His-tag was cleaved by thrombin. The protein was further purified on an ion-exchange column and a gel filtration column (S-200). Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced by following an established protocol (Doublie, 1997, 276:523-30).","Crystals of human dCK in complex with nucleosides and nucleotides (dC and ADP, ara-C and ADP, gemcitabine and ADP) were grown by the vapor diffusion method using either the sitting-drop or the hanging-drop geometry. Nucleotides were from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.) except for gemcitabine, which was a gift from Eli Lilly & Co (Indianapolis, Ind.). After formation of the respective complex by mixing dC (or ara-C or gemcitabine) together with ADP (final concentration of 5 mM each) and the dialyzed enzyme solution (12 mg mldCK, 5 mM MgCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, 100 \u03bcM dC\/ara-C\/gemcitabine), 2 \u03bcl of the premixed solution were added to 2 \u03bcl of the reservoir solution and left to equilibrate at 20\u00b0 C. against the reservoir. Tetragonal crystals were obtained from sitting-drops using a reservoir solution that contained 0.95-1.0 M citrate trisodium dihydrate and 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, or from hanging-drops using 20% (w\/v) PEG1K, 100 mM magnesium acetate, and 100 mM Tris, pH 9.0. At times, the citrate condition also gave orthogonal crystals. Typically, crystals grew within one week to dimensions of 200\u00d7100\u00d7100 \u03bcm.","Crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution that in the case of the citrate condition was made of mineral oil (Sigma) while for the crystals grown in PEG it was composed of the mother liquor and 10% (w\/v) xylitol-10% (w\/v) sucrose. Once the crystals were mounted in loops, they were frozen by directly immersing them in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source using the BioCARS beamlines BM-C and BM-D, and the SERCAT beamline ID-22. The data were indexed, scaled and merged using the programs XDS and XSCALE (Kabsch, 1993, 24:795-800) or Denzo and Scalepack (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997, 276:307-326).

the Multiwavelength Anomalous Dispersion (MAD) method (Hendrickson and Ogata, 1997, 276:494-523). Using data from the inflection, the peak, and the remote wavelengths, 4 selenium atoms were located using SOLVE (Terwilliger, 1999, . D55:1863-1871). The map calculated from the experimental phases enabled the generation of a model of dCK in O (Jones et al., 1991, . A47:110-119). Refinement was carried out using the programs CNS (Br\u00fcnger, 1993, --, Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn.) and REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997, . D53:240-255). Data for the MAD data set were collected to 2.3 \u212b resolution. A partially built model into the MAD electron density was used to solve the tetragonal crystals. The electron density for dCK extended to the last residue (Leu260), while the N-terminus (residues 1 to 19) was flexible and could not be modeled. Deoxycytidine and ADP were modeled in the electron density map after most of the protein main chain and side chain atoms were built and refined. The ligands were refined without conformational torsion-angle restraints in order to prevent bias towards a particular ring conformation for the sugars. The final model of the complex of dCK with dC and ADP was used as starting model for the refinement of the other structures in the tetragonal space group, and to solve the structure of dCK that crystallized in the orthorhombic space group using AMoRe molecular replacement (Navaza, 1994, . A50:157-163).","Data for the Ara-C-ADP.Mg and the gemcitabine-ADP.Mg complexes were collected to 1.6 \u212b and 1.9 \u212b resolution, respectively, on the crystals grown in PEG. Calculation of difference maps clearly showed the presence of substituents on the second position of the deoxyribose moiety of dC: an ara hydroxyl group in the case of ara-C, and two fluorine atoms in the case of gemcitabine. The ligands were modelled into the electron density maps after simulated annealing and refinement of the protein model. Water molecules were then automatically added using Arp\/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999, 6:458-63).","Analysis of Structural Information of Human dCK","The structural information of human dCK was useful in developing modified dCKs with enhanced activity. Human dCK () consists of 260 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 30.5 kDa. The structure was solved using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method (Hendrickson and Ogata, 1997, 276:494-523) on selenomethionine-containing protein. It is a homodimeric globular protein with a fold similar to that described for the nucleoside kinase (dNK) and human dGK (Johansson et al., 2001, 8:616-20). Each monomer has a five-stranded parallel \u03b2-sheet core surrounded by ten \u03b1 helices. Helix \u03b14 and \u03b17 from each monomer create a four-helix bundle dimer interface.","In humans, four spatially segregated enzymes accomplish the first step in the salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate synthesis. The mitochondrial kinases dGK and thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) supply the precursors for mitochondrial DNA synthesis, and dCK and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) do the same for nuclear DNA. Since ultimately dCK and TK1 must provide all four DNA triphosphates, it is not surprising that dCK, in addition to phosphorylating deoxycytidine (dC), also efficiently phosphorylates deoxyguanosine (dG) and deoxyadenosine (dA). In fact, apart from the thymidine-specific TK1, deoxyribonucleoside kinases are characterized by their ability to phosphorylate substrates of different base constituents. Notably, dNK, the only deoxyribonucleoside kinase in , phosphorylates all four physiological deoxyribonucleosides (Knecht et al., 2002, 21:1873-1880).","The ability of dCK to accommodate multiple substrates that are of opposite hydrogen bonding character was due to the conserved Gln97 (). The hydrogen bond donating and accepting moieties of the glutamine side chain rotated and positioned themselves according to the nature of the base bound. In the structures with cytosine nucleosides, the side chain of Gln97 acted as a hydrogen bond donor, via its amide group, to the cytosine N3 atom, and as a hydrogen bond acceptor, via the carbonyl group, to the cytosine amino group (). This cytosine amino group also interacted with the side chain of Asp133. Discrimination by dCK against the pyrimidines thymidine and deoxyuridine was achieved because of the inability of Asp133 to perform favourable hydrogen bonding interactions in the case of a thymine or uracil base.","Adding to the discrimination against thymidine (but not deoxyuridine) is a predicted steric clash between Arg104 and the thymine methyl group. Support of this interpretation comes from mutation experiments on dNK done by Knecht et al. (2002, 21:1873-1880) and from kinetic results with a dCK triple mutant designed. In this mutant, the discriminating residues Arg104 and Asp133 were changed to a methionine and an alanine, respectively. The dCK mutant gained the ability to phosphorylate thymidine or D-type or L-type thymidine analogs. Further interactions made between the cytosine base and dCK included a hydrophobic interaction to Phe137, and a hydrogen bond to a water molecule that bridged the base and Tyr86. The interaction with Tyr86 effected deoxyribose\u2014versus ribonucleosides discrimination.","While both dCK and dGK phosphorylate dA and dG, only dCK is capable of phosphorylating dC and its analogs such as Ara-C (Herrstrom et al., 1998, 53:270-273). The structures of dCK with dC revealed that in order to accommodate dC, Arg104 assumed a different conformation to that of Arg118 observed in the structure of dGK (, arrow 1). An aspartic acid residue in both the dCK and dGK structures interacted with the above-mentioned arginine (, arrow 2). However, only in dGK was a serine at position 114 able to participate in this network, adding to its stabilization. In contrast, in dCK at the position of the dGK-Ser114 was an alanine residue (, arrow 3). By having an alanine instead of a serine, the hydrogen-bonding network holding rigid the aspartic acid and arginine residues was weaker, allowing for a less extended conformation of Arg104 with a concomitant change in conformation for Asp133 upon dC binding. At the same time, upon purine binding to dCK, a change in the Arg104 to an extended conformation as observed in the dGK structure was still possible. The conserved tyrosine in position 155 supplied an important hydrogen bond to Asp133 in the conformation compatible with purine binding.","A common feature among the nucleoside kinases is the stabilization of the sugar 3\u2032-hydroxyl group by a conserved Tyr-Glu pair (dCK-YE; dGK-YE; dNK-YE) (Johansson et al., 2001, 8:616-20). Due to proximity of the tyrosine hydroxyl group to the 2\u2032-sugar position, this residue functions to favor deoxyribonucleosides over ribonucleosides. The isosteric substitutions of protons by fluorines at the 2\u2032-position in gemcitabine put one of these fluorines at an interacting distance to the tyrosine hydroxyl group. Even a slightly larger substituent at this position resulted in some steric repulsion, as evidenced by the high Kof cytidine in comparison to that of deoxycytidine (Table 2).","The structures of dCK with Ara-C-ADP.Mg and the one with gemcitabine-ADP.Mg () were both similar to the dC-ADP complex, with a root mean square deviation of 0.66 \u212b and 0.63 \u212b, respectively. Compared to the structure with dC bound in the active site, the hydroxyl group in the 2\u2032-position of the arabinofuranosyl sugar in Ara-C provided an additional 3.0 \u212b (d1, ) hydrogen bond to the conserved Arg128 of the ERS motif (). A similar interaction (2.9 \u212b) with Arg128 was formed by the fluorine atom (R) of gemcitabine, while the other fluorine (R) made a 2.7 \u212b hydrogen bond with Tyr86 (d2, ).","The proton from the sugar 5\u2032-hydroxyl could be accepted by a nearby base (either prior to the O5\u2032 nucleophilic attack on the ATP \u03b3-phosphate, or after the formation of the O\u2014P bond). The conserved Glu53 at hydrogen bonding distance to the sugar 5\u2032-hydroxyl group (2.6 \u212b via OE2) and to NH1 of Arg128 (3.0 \u212b via OE1) () was a very likely candidate for the fulfilment of this role as base. In the three complexes, the atomic positions of Glu53, Arg128 and the nucleosides or prodrugs were identical within experimental error, suggesting that the origin of the increased dCK activity towards the two cytosine analogs resulted from the interactions of Arg128 to R1 and of Tyr86 to R2.","Both Ara-C and gemcitabine possess the Arg128 to R1 interaction and the increase in enzymatic efficiency for the two prodrugs was similar demonstrating that this interaction plays a predominant role. Assuming that the observed steady-state kinetic rate reflected the phosphoryl transfer step, then the increased rate for Ara-C\/gemcitabine could be explained as follows: in the presence of dC, the interaction between Glu53 and Arg128 was not weakened by the substrate. However, a hydrogen-bond acceptor at the 2\u2032-arabinosyl position, as present in Ara-C and gemcitabine, competed with Glu53 for the Arg128 interaction. A weaker Glu53-Arg128 interaction would potentiate the proton accepting ability of the carboxylic acid group from the O5\u2032-hydroxyl. As a result, the nucleoside 5\u2032-hydroxyl group would become more nucleophilic and hence the kfor Ara-C and gemcitabine phosphorylation was increased.","The positive influence of hydrogen-bonding acceptor substituents at the 2\u2032-arabinosyl position on dCK activity was also supported by the recent discovery that the purine drug 2-chloro-2\u2032-arabino-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine, clofarabine, a new derivative of cladribine that is currently undergoing phase II clinical trial for pediatric leukemia, is \u02dc3-fold more efficient substrate for dCK than cladribine (Lotfi et al., 1999, 5:2438-44; Mansson et al., 2003, 65:237-247). On the basis of the structures presented here, this improvement was likely caused by the interaction of the 2\u2032-arabino-fluorine atom of clofarabine with Arg128, thus improving the ability of Glu53 to function as a base.","Another important interaction involved in the stabilization and positioning of the nucleoside sugar was made by the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group. The complexes with Ara-C and gemcitabine were crystallized under the same conditions as that of dC. However, with the antiviral drug 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-cytidine (ddC) no crystals were obtained. This may suggest that weak ddC binding (Kof 407 \u03bcM versus 6.2 \u03bcM for dC, Table 2) did not induce the same enzyme conformation necessary to promote crystal growth. A likely explanation for such behavior could be found in the lack of the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group in ddC. Indeed, in all the dC, ara-C and gemcitabine structures, the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group was held in place by Glu197 and Tyr86 (), which are strictly conserved residues within the deoxyribonucleoside kinases dCK, dGK, TK2 and dNK ().","Thus, modified prodrug molecules that include a hydrogen bond acceptor(s) at the 2\u2032-position (e.g. hydroxyl group or fluorine in the 2\u2032-arabinosyl position, or fluorines in both 2\u2032-positions) would counter the low phosphorylation efficiency of ddC, and hence increase its antiviral effect.","Improving dCK Catalytic Efficiency","dCK is an inefficient enzyme as a result of a very slow k(0.03 sec; Table 3). In contrast, dNK exhibits a 2,500-fold higher efficiency for dC phosphorylation resulting mainly from its faster k(16.5 sec) (Knecht et al., 2002, 21:1873-1880). With the goal of making dCK more active key active site residues in dCK were mutated to those found in dNK. First, the structures of human dCK and the dNK were overlaid. This permitted residues likely to be important for catalysis to be identified. It was expected that residues present in dNK but absent in dCK and identified in this manner would also identify residues involved in or responsible for dNK's higher enzymatic rate. Since Arg104 plays a role in the already mentioned active site hydrogen-bonding network, its mutation to the uncharged methionine was combined with the compensatory change of Asp133 to an alanine The amino acid sequence of the resulting mutant dCK with Arg104Met and Asp133Ala substitutions (dCK-R104M\/D133A) is shown in SEQ ID NO:6. In alternative embodiments, Ala100 was changed to a valine as is found in dNK. The amino acid sequence of the resulting mutant dCK with Ala100Val, Arg104Met and Asp133Ala substitutions (dCK-A\/100V\/R104M\/D133A) is shown in SEQ ID NO:5.","Steady-state kinetic assays were performed by determining deoxycytidine kinase activity using a colorimetric assay (Agarwal et al., 1978, 51:483-490) in 50 mM Tris\/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl, at 37\u00b0 C. The concentration of dCK was 0.4 \u03bcM, ATP.Mg 1 mM, while for the nucleosides and the nucleoside analogs a range of concentrations between 10 \u03bcM and 1 mM were used unless indicated otherwise. All experiments were performed in duplicates.","The steady-state kinetic experiments using Ara-C, gemcitabine and dC as substrates showed that there was a 10-fold increase in the kbut only a slight increase in Kfor the two prodrugs compared to dC (Table 3). Overall there was a \u02dc4-fold higher enzymatic efficiency for dCK with Ara-C and gemcitabine.","Table 3 demonstrates that the A100V\/R104M\/D133A human dCK mutant was more active than wild-type enzyme: efficiency towards dC increased by 50-fold, towards gemcitabine by 4-fold, with no significant change for Ara-C (Table 3).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0188"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Steady State Kinetic Data"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"k\/K"]},{"entry":[{},"Nucleoside","K(\u03bcM)","k(sec)","(Msec)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Wild Type dCK"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"dC","6.2","0.03","\u20034.8 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"ddC","406.8","0.18","\u20030.4 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"cytidine","382.7","0.74","\u20031.9 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"Ara-C","15.5","0.26","\u200216.8 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"gemcitabine","22.0","0.37","\u200216.8 \u00d7 10"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"A100V\/R104M\/D133A-dCK"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"dC","4","0.93","232.5 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"Ara-C","102","1.73","\u200217.0 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"gemcitabine","50","3.52","\u200270.4 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"It was discovered that dCK with the R104M and D133A substitutions, with or without the A100V substitution (as will be shown below), exhibited improved activity in phosphorylating cytidine or cytidine analogs.","Not only did the above mentioned mutation improve the activity of modified dCK in phosphorylating cytidine or cytidine analog, both dCK R104M\/D133A and dCK A100V\/R104M\/D133A acquire additional activity in phosphorylating thymidine and thymidine analogs. Thymidine analogs useful in the current invention include without limitation, 2\u2032-3\u2032-didehydro-2\u2032-3\u2032-dideoxythymidine (Stavudine), Azidothymidine (AZT), Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BVdU). As shown in the examples below, dCK mutants with the R104M and D133A mutations, are able to phosphorylate thymidine and thymidine analogs, such as BVdU, whereas wild type dCK cannot.","In conclusion, the high-resolution structures of dCK in complex with dC and two clinically used prodrugs revealed determinants of substrate specificity. Moreover, the structures are useful as starting point for the design of modified dCK that has enhanced enzymatic activity and\/or extended substrate specificity for additional nucleoside analogs.","In-vitro purified dCK was chemically conjugated to HuM195 (Protein Design Laboratories, Fremont, Calif.). A purification protocol was used to obtain only the conjugate, which was performed as follows. A Sepharose S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences), a column that separate macromolecules according to size was used, wherein the first peak to elute for the column was the HuM195-dCK conjugate. Only this peak was collected, and concentrated to \u02dc3 mg\/ml. The activity of the conjugate was verified using a colormetric spectrophotometric assay. As a proof of concept, a standard protein conjugation technique was used for the conjugation of wild type dCK with HuM195. Conjugation of enzymes to antibodies involves formation of a stable covalent linkage between an enzyme and an antigen specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody in which neither the antigen-combining site of the antibody nor the active site of the enzyme is functionally altered. Briefly, the enzyme dCK was dialyzed against 2 liters of 0.1 M phosphate buffer overnight at 4\u00b0 C. while stirring gently. Afterward, the phosphate buffer was replaced and dialysis was continued for 2 hours. Then M-maleimido benzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester in dimethyl formamide (MBS\/DMF) solution was added to the monoclonal antibody HuM195 (MBS\/antibody ratio 120:1) and the mixture was stirred gently at room temperature for 30 minutes. The solution was then filtered and loaded on the Hi Prep 26\/10 desalting column, which was pre-equilibrated with 100 ml phosphate buffer. The first peak was collected and concentrated into 1.5 ml; the second peak contained free MBS. The concentrated first peak was pooled with dialyzed enzyme (enzyme antibody weight ratio was 4:1) and stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. After 2 hours, the solution was filtered and injected into Superdex 200 gel filtration column. The first peak, which was the HuM195 TMPK conjugation product, was eluted and concentrated. A gel electrophoresis was then run and the conjugation product is confirmed. The same method can be used to generate antibody-conjugates of other in vitro purified dCK mutants or other antibodies described herein.","HuM195-dCK activity was determined using a colorimetric assay in 50 mM Tris\/HCl, pH7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5mM MgCl, at 37\u00b0 C. The concentrations used were: HuM195-dCK 0.4 \u03bcM, ATP Mg 1 mM, and the nucleosides and nucleoside analogs in a range of concentrations between 10 \u03bcM and 1 mM. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Kinetic data were evaluated using the program Sigma Plot 2000 and were best described by the Michaelis\u2014Menten equation v=Vmax\u00d7[S]\/(Km+[S]). Modified dCK of the current invention can be conjugated to an antibody following the same procedure.","The HuM195 antibody will only bind and internalize to cells expressing CD33. Thus, the HL60 cell line (derived from AML cells) and the NB4 cell line, which are CD33 positive, were used to test the activity of the HuM195-dCK system in live cells. The cells were treated with AraC, the HuM195-dCK conjugate, or the combination of HuM195-dCK and the AraC. Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to identify apoptotic cells. As shown in , cells alone as a control had about 10% cell death, AraC at 1 \u03bcM increased cell death as a function of time, with \u02dc50% cell death after 96 hours, the conjugate by itself was not toxic, and the conjugate in combination of AraC results in the most efficient cell death (\u02dc70% killing after 96 hours). The combination of AraC with the conjugate results in 20% more killing than AraC alone.","In addition, a trypan blue exclusion assay was performed on cells treated with AraC, the HuM195-dCK conjugate, or the combination of HuM195-dCK and the AraC (). In the trypan blue assay, a large number of positively stained cells correspond to a large number of dead cells. As expected, the cells treated with a combination of the conjugate and AraC showed the most effective cell killing.","The NB4 cells were also treated with AraC, the HuM195-dCK conjugate, or the combination of HuM195-dCK and the AraC, and an apoptosis assay was performed as above. The AraC dose used, however, was decreased from 1000 nM to 250 nM. The results were similar to those observed in the HL60 cells (). The conjugate with AraC (right bars) achieve \u02dc65% cell killing after 96 hours, whereas AraC alone was below 40%.","To verify that the HuM195-dCK conjugate was only delivered to CD33 positive cells, experiments were repeated with CD33 negative cells (293T cells). Flow cytometry () and a trypan blue exclusion assay () were used to determine AraC-mediated cell killing. In both assays, similar killing efficiency for AraC and for the combination of AraC and the conjugate was observed. Thus, the conjugate did not enter the 293T cells as expected.","To verify the activity of the HuM195-dCK conjugate in mammals, C.B-17-SCID\/SCID mice are used.

Hydrophobic amino acid substitutions other than methionine at position 104 were tested in the backbone of D133A substitution. Amino acids with small side chain were not considered because replacing an arginine residue with a small amino acid would likely result in destabilization of the structure of the protein. Instead, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine were considered. Additionally, glutamine substitution at position 104 was tested, as it is uncharged and large enough to substitute the arginine, but small enough to make space for the thymine base. Lastly, replacement of arginine by the more flexible lysine was also tested. Mutants were generated and purified in a single step by metal-affinity chromatography, yielding preparations of >95% purity. The N-terminal His-tag was not cleaved since previous experiments have shown that the tag does not influence the kinetic behavior of the protein (data not shown). In the following experiments, saturating concentration of ATP (1 mM) and a low nucleoside concentration of 200 \u03bcM were used for the purpose of screening for mutants that have relatively low nucleoside Kvalues.","a.

Modified dCK phosphorylates nucleoside dC or a nucleoside analog such as BVdU, and converts ATP to ADP. The enzyme PK converts ADP and PEP to ATP and pyruvate, respectively. Pyruvate thus produced becomes a substrate for LDH, which converts pyruvate to lactate and concomitantly NADH to NAD+. NADH absorbs at wavelength 340 nm, while NAD+ does not. Therefore, as the reaction proceeds, the concentration of NADH is reduced, and the absorbance at 340 nm is decreased. The reduction in absorbance indicates production of NAD, as a result of production of ADP, which is a marker for phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by dCK. The graph in  shows absorbance at 340 nm as a function of time, from which the kinetics of the phosphorylation reaction can be calculated.

The cells were then exposed to varying amount of BVdU for 96 hours. The ability of the antibody-mutant dCK to phosphorylate BVdU was reflected by the reduced levels of cell viability compared with untreated control cells. Cell viability was measured using the MTS cytotoxicity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). In short, the tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS) was added to the cells. MTS was reduced by cellular dehydrogenase into formazan, which is soluble in tissue culture medium. Measuring formazan absorbance at a wavelength of 492 nm reflected levels of dehydrogenase enzyme activity found in metabolically-active cells. Since the production of formazan is proportional to the number of living cells, the intensity of the produced color is a good indication of the viability of the cells.","As shown in , cells treated with HERCEPTIN\u00ae-dCK R104M\/D133A conjugate in conjunction with BVdU showed significantly reduced cell viability.

However, the combination of the HERCEPTIN\u00ae-dCK R104M\/D133A conjugate with BVdU resulted in decreased cell proliferation.

Additionally, while the wild type enzyme showed no detectable activity with thymidine or thymidine analog, the R104M\/D133A mutant dCK acquired the ability to phosphorylate thymidine: specifically, the R104M\/D133A dCK phosphorylated D-thymidine (D-dT) at a rate of 1.15 sec, L-thymidine (L-dT) at a rate of 1.95 sec, and L-deoxyuridine (L-dU) at a rate of 1.77 sec.","Additionally, in the background of the D133A substitution, modified human dCKs with other substitutions at position 104, such as a leucine, isoleucine, or glutamine substitution, not only showed higher activities for deoxycytidine than the wild type dCK, but also exhibited thymidine kinase activity that is absent in wild type dCK. The R104L\/D133A dCK mutant showed particular clinical importance since it exhibited differential activity for dT than dC as compared to dCK R104M\/D133A. A modified dCK with high thymidine kinase activities allows efficient phosphorylation of a clinically important thymidine analog such as BVdU, whereas the lower activities for the natural substrate dC minimize the perturbation of the nucleotide pool in the cell. Thus, a modified dCK with high selectively high activity for dT, such as dCK R104L\/D133A, is a particularly desirable enzyme for clinical purposes because it phosphorylates BVdU with fewer toxic side effects.","In conclusion, the data show that a methionine, a leucine, and to a lesser extent, a glutamine, or an isoleucine substitution at position 104 endowed dCK with thymidine kinase activity. In summary, the results demonstrated that several combinations of substitutions at positions 104 and 133 of human dCK generate mutants with improved and desirable activities. Such dCK mutants could play a role in the specific activation of nucleoside analogs to combat various diseases such as viral infection and cancers.","The above-described experiments identified the dCK mutants R104M\/D133A and R104L\/D133A as the most active ones among the mutants tested.

The specificity of R104M\/D133A to dC was a result of the much-increased Kvalues for both dA and dG (8 to 10-fold larger than the Kof wild type dCK for the same substrates). In contrast, while the Kof the R104L\/D133A mutant for dG was also dramatically increased as compared to the wild-type, the R104L\/D133A mutant's Kfor dA is comparable to wild type dCK.","The enhancement in phosphorylation efficiency (k\/K) for gemcitabine by R104M\/D133A and R104L\/D133A, a 2- and 2.5-fold increase, respectively, was due to a significant improvement in k, whereas Kcountered this by a moderate increase. Interestingly, the efficiency of AraC phosphorylation by either mutant is less than that of wild type dCK. This suggested that the phosphorylation efficiency of nucleoside analogs by R104M\/D133A and R104L\/D133A was affected by the substituents at the 2\u2032-position of the sugar ring.","Most interesting was the endowment of R104M\/D133A and R104L\/D133A with thymidine kinase activity. The Kfor D-dT was reduced from over 3 mM with wild type dCK (Iyidogan, et al., 2008, 47:4711-4720) to less than 150 \u03bcM with R104M\/D133A and below 25 \u03bcM with R104L\/D133A. The R104L\/D133A variant also had a lower Kvalue for the L-form of thymidine than R104M\/D133A, and it is primarily this fact that makes this double mutant the most efficient dCK variant for thymidine kinase activity. As a methionine is one atom longer than a leucine, it is possible that this residue is still too long to optimally accommodate the C5-methyl group of the thymine base. However, due to methionine being a non-branched amino acid, thymine can still bind with a reasonable Kvalue (as measured for R104M\/D133A). The mutant with a glutamine variant at position 104, R104Q\/D133A, demonstrated much lower activity than R104L\/D133A. Glutamine, apart from being a polar residue, has the same length as a methionine but is branched at the delta-position. This branching is the likely cause for R104Q\/D133A having lower thymidine kinase activity. The additional structural data of R104M\/D133A with L-dT (see below) aided this analysis, as the electron density for the tip of the methionine side chain was weak, which was consistent with high mobility\/disorder caused by proximity of the C5-methyl group of L-dT.","It was reported that dCK undergoes post-translational phosphorylation on Ser74 that increases its activity (Smal et al., 2006, 25, 1141-1146). Using the dCK S74E mutant to mimic this phosphorylated state, it was shown that this modification increased the rate of phosphorylation of dC by 11-fold, but had no effects on dA, dG, AraC or gemcitabine phosphorylation (McSorley et al., 2008, 582:720-724). The mechanism behind the selective rate enhancement of the S74E mutant is unclear, as the serine is a part of the region called the insert, which is not observed in most crystal structures of dCK. As shown above, the R104M\/D133A variant also selectively increased the rate of dC phosphorylation. A dCK mutant with the combination of the mutations of R104M, D133A and S74E resulted in a further increase in the rate of dC phosphorylation to \u02dc5 secas compared with the rate of wild-type 0.03 sec, R104M\/D133A 1.84 secand R104L\/D133A 0.27 (see Table 8). This suggested that the S74E mutant provides synergistic effects on the enzymatic activity of the modified dCK via mechanisms that are distinct from those for the R104M\/D133A and R104L\/D133A mutants.","Further, the effects on thymidine phosphorylation of a dCK variant with a serine substitution at amino acid position 74 in the background of dCK mutants described above were analyzed. Wild type dCK with a single S74E substitution did not phosphorylate thymidine or thymidine analogs; however, S74E in the background of R104M\/D133A double or A100V\/R104M\/D133A triple mutation rendered the modified dCK a more efficient thymidine kinase than either of the parent modified dCK enzymes. The kinetics of the modified dCK with a further S74E substitution was analyzed based on the method described above using the S74E\/R104M\/D133A mutant dCK as an example. In this experiment, the rate of phosphorylation of the thymidine analog BVdU by the dCK S74E\/R104M\/D133A mutant was 1.2 sec, three times better than that of dCK R104M\/D133A without the S74E substitution (0.43 sec).","Next, whether the dCK-S74E\/R104M\/D133A variant could inhibit cell growth in the presence of NAs including BVdU was tested. Human 293 cells were stably transfected with a recombinant expression construct encoding the dCK-S74E\/R104M\/D133A protein. The proliferative capacity of the stably transfected cell line was compared to the parental 293 cells after treating the cells with several nucleoside analogs such as AraC, gemcitabine, and BVdU. Since some of the nucleosides were first dissolved in the solvent DMSO, equal amounts of DMSO were used as control. As shown in , DMSO had no effect on proliferation of either the parent 293 cell line, or the 293 dCK variant cell line.","When tested using nucleoside analogs such as AraC and gemcitabine, approved prodrugs for the treatment of several types of cancers, AraC was found to have no inhibitory effect on proliferation of 293 cells at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM. In contrast, AraC at the same concentration inhibited the growth of 293 cells expressing the dCK S74E\/R104M\/D133A variant (). Gemcitabine at 1 \u03bcM inhibited growth of the parent 293 cell line by 75%, and further inhibited the growth of 293 cell line expressing the mutant dCK by about 90%. These results showed that expression of the dCK S74E\/R104M\/D133A variant in cells enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of AraC and gemcitabine.","The thymidine analog BVdU ((E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2\u2032-deoxyuridine), an approved anti-viral drug in Germany, is efficiently phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase, but is very poorly phosphorylated, if at all, by human enzymes. When tested as described above for AraC, the human dCK variant S74E\/R104M\/D133A efficiently phosphorylated BVdU, and activated BVdU selectively killed cells expressing this dCK mutant. As shown in , BVdU, even at the highest tested concentration of 50 \u03bcM, did not inhibit the growth of parent 293 cells; however, BVdU dramatically inhibited the growth of 293 cells expressing the mutant dCK. In other words, BVdU was only toxic to cells that expressed the mutant dCK. These results showed that the dCK S74E\/R104M\/D133A mutant sensitized cells to BVdU and selectively killed cells that expressed, by transfection or targeted delivery, the dCK S74E\/R104M\/D133A mutant. Similarly, 293 cells stably expressing S74E\/R104M\/D133A-dCK were also sensitive to L-dT or L-dU mediated cell killing (data not shown).","To understand how the R104M\/D133A and R104L\/D133A mutations improved dCK activities, crystal structure of R104M\/D133A mutant in complex with ADP at the phosphoryl donor site and the L-form of thymidine at the nucleoside acceptor site was solved with a 2.3 \u212b resolution.

The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) for these data between R104M\/D133A in complex with L-dT+ADP and wild-type dCK in complex with D-dC+ADP is 0.40 \u212b on 226 atoms (), and with wild-type dCK in complex with L-dC+ADP is 0.64 \u212b on 226 atoms (). The R104M\/D133A mutant largely maintained the overall structure of the wild type protein. The local structure of regions proximal to positions 104 and 133 were also nearly identical with that in wild type dCK. The few notable differences between the structures could be accounted by crystal contacts, and were not attributed to the mutations.","The electron density maps for the nucleotide ADP and the nucleoside L-dT is shown in . The thymine base was bound in the anti-conformation, thereby conserving the orientation seen with the dC (Sabin et al., 2003, 10:513-519). However, overlay of the R104M\/D133A complex with that of wild type dCK with either the L-form or D-form of dC revealed a surprising result: L-dT bound significantly deeper in the nucleoside binding site of dCK R104M\/D133A (). Presumably, the space generated by substituting the arginine side chain by the shorter methionine allowed the nucleoside to penetrate deeper into the pocket. Concomitantly, the ADP molecule shifted in the same direction, and hence the change of position of Glu127. shows the superposition of the R104M\/D133A complex with L-dT and the wild-type dCK complex with L-dC. The side chains of active site residues adjusted their position to preserve the same interactions with L-dT as seen with dC. For example, Tyr86 and Glu197 tracked the shift of the nucleoside and maintained their interactions with the sugar's 3\u2032-hydroxyl group.","The side chain of Gln97 also adjusted somewhat to the deeper orientation of L-dT versus that seen with L-dC. However, the definitive orientation of the side chain of Gln97, that acted both as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, could not be ascertained by the x-ray data at the resolution of the structure. In the complex with L-dC the Gln97 orientation was unambiguous: based on distance considerations, the side chain carbonyl group interacted with the amino moiety of the base, and the amino group with N3 of the base. In cytosine, N3 is deprotonated, allowing it to accept a hydrogen-bond donor from the Gln97 amino group. In contrast, in the complex with L-dT, the situation was vague, as both orientations\u2014interchanged by rotating the tip of the side chain by 180 degrees\u2014make chemical sense (). In one orientation, identical to that adopted with L-dC, the carbonyl group of the side chain would interact with N3; (this was a productive interaction as the thymine N3 was protonated) and the amino group with the carbonyl group at position 2. The alternative orientation, the one depicted in , also had the carbonyl group of the Gln97 side chain interacting with N3, but now the amino group interacted with the carbonyl group at position 4 ().","The deeper position of L-dT in the nucleoside-binding site of R104M\/D133A relative to that of L-dC in wild type dCK explained why thymidine was a very poor substrate of wild type dCK. If L-dT would bind in the same position as L-dC, its C5 methyl group (dashed line and ball, ) would clash with the side chains of Glu53 (2.8 \u212b) and Arg104 (2.6 \u212b). The replacement of Arg104 by a methionine created the space into which, following the shift of the L-dT molecule deeper into the active site, the C5 methyl group of thymidine could fit and avoid a steric clash with Glu53. Importantly, the new position adopted by L-dT still allowed the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group to maintain a nearly identical position as seen for L-dC. This is critical, since phosphoryl transfer occurred to this hydroxyl group.","The capability of human dCK to phosphorylate L-nucleosides is directly related to the active site architecture that permits binding mode flexibility. Previous studies have shown that residues flanking the sugar moiety accommodated both enantiomers in the active site, albeit the base moiety must undergo a tilt. The base moiety of L-nucleosides tilted by \u02dc10 degrees relative to the position of their D-counterpart; however, the interactions with the base were preserved. Regardless of the enantiomeric form, the sugar 5\u2032-hydroxyl group maintained close proximity to Glu53, the residue that functioned as the catalytic base. In the R104M\/D133A complex with L-dT, while the nucleoside bound deeper into the binding site, L-dT (the structure on the top as indicated in ) retained the same tilt as seen for L-dC (the structure on the bottom as indicated in ) when bound to wild type dCK. The base tilting of L-dT is apparent when compared to D-dC (the structure on the bottom as indicated in ) bound to wild type dCK. This suggests that base tilting of L-nucleosides was a consequence of the sugar's position in the active site\u2014without this tilting the sugar would clash with Leu82. The results showed that even when the nucleoside bound deeper into the nucleoside-binding site, the same restraints on the sugar position necessitated the base to tilt relative to its position in D-nucleosides.","It should be understood that the foregoing disclosure emphasizes certain specific embodiments of the invention and that all modifications or alternatives equivalent thereto are within the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLES","Example 1","Crystallization of Human Deoxycytidine Kinase (dCK)","Example 2","Conjugation of HuM195 to dCK","Example 3","Testing the HuM195-dCK Conjugate in CD33 Positive Cell Lines","Example 4","Verifying CD33-Positive Cell Specificity of HuM195-dCK","Example 5","Verifying HuM195-dCK Activity in Mouse Models of Leukemia","Example 6","Assays for Enzymatic Activities of Modified dCK with Substitutions at Amino Acid Position 104","Example 7","Enzymatic Activity of dCK R104M\/D133A in Phosphorylating Thymidine Analogs","Example 8","Capacity of Antibody-Conjugated dCK R104M\/D133A to Convert BVdU into a Toxic Metabolite in a Cell","Example 9","Modified Human dCK Mutant with R104Q\/D133A Substitutions Exhibited Enhanced Catalytic Activities and Substrate Specificity for Thymidine","Example 10","Kinetic Characterization of R104M\/D133A and R104L\/D133A","Example 11","dCK with S74E Substitution Exhibits Enhanced Activity in Phosphorylating Thymidine Analog","Example 12","Structural Analysis of the R104M\/D133A Mutant in Complex with L-dT and ADP"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","i":"Drosophila "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15","FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"i":["a ","b ","c ","d "]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
