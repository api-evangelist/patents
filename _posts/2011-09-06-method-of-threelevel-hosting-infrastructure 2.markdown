title: Method of three-level hosting infrastructure
abstract: A method of three-level hosting infrastructure provides a server computer accessible to users through hosts. The hosting infrastructure includes hosting resources used by the server computer for the benefit of at least a first host. The first host then uses the hosting resources of the server computer and also hosts one or more other hosts, who may use the hosting resources through the first host. The method enables one host to be included into another host. The method enables received content at the hosting infrastructure to be hosted by two or more hosts.

No. 12\/772,009 filed 30 Apr. 2010, which is a continuation-in-part of, and claims the benefit of, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/930,422, filed 31 Oct. 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,730,083, issued 1 Jun. 2010, which is a division of, and claims the benefit of, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/029,073, filed on 20 Dec. 2001, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","In the field of virtual networks of e-commerce e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites, a means is disclosed for creating and maintaining worldwide e-malls wherein each of these e-malls offers means for creating e-shops, e-distributors and web sites without the need of an e-commerce infrastructure or even a web server.","The Internet has a tremendous potential with its worldwide reach; also, there are a lot of challenges and opportunities. At the present, there are needs for easy and affordable worldwide e-commerce solutions where seller can have their goods and services sold without the expertise or the expenses that today's e-commerce requires.","Today's e-commerce web sites henceforth called e-shop(s) are of a dynamic type with products and\/or services that are available to a broad base of buyers. One good example of a dynamic e-shop is <Amazon.com>.","One other type of e-commerce setup is the e-shopping mall where dynamic e-shops are created and updated directly by a user and henceforth called e-mall(s). The four most popular are: <VStore.com>, <ViaWeb.com>, <Bcentral.com> and <BigStep.com>.","Stores in these e-malls are treated as independent dynamic e-shops with specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) addresses and their products\/services are only available within their closed environment. Thus, products\/services cannot be shared among other e-malls or e-shops even within their own network of dynamic e-shops at the e-mall.","Except <VStore.com> where all e-shop virtually sells products from distributors.","The dynamic e-mall setup does not enhance the shopping experience nor facilitates the interaction between buyer and seller. Since a buyer will have to move from e-shop to e-shop in the e-mall. Time is thus wasted and sales can be lost. Furthermore, the dynamic e-mall concept cannot be created without an elaborate and expensive e-commerce infrastructure that requires extensive knowledge and expertise.","Currently, dynamic e-mall will not allow the creation of specialized e-shops that can sell their products\/services in conjunction with similar products\/services from others e-shops.","Today's e-commerce requires solutions where seller can have their products\/services available to a broad base of buyers, also, virtually available to other e-shops, satellite e-malls and e-malls where they will be offered to a broader clientele base. For this to be possible, the process for creating and updating e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites must be on-line and easy to setup and use.","Buyers on the other hand, need a solution where they will have a broad selection without having to go to many different e-shops to find what they're looking for, and also be able to view web pages in their own native language.","It is the object of this invention to offer easy and affordable e-commerce solution worldwide with a single e-commerce and e-services resource infrastructure as to allow anyone anywhere in the world to provide e-commerce solution without the need of an e-commerce infrastructure or even an Internet server.","It is the object of this invention to demonstrate a virtual electronic shopping mall where on-line users can create and update e-malls which in turn offers others the ability to host e-shops and web sites offering products\/services. Also, an e-mall will have means for customizing a satellite e-mall and means for hosting pre-set ones. Moreover, this invention will allow creating and maintaining of the dynamic e-mall concept without the need of an e-commerce infrastructure or even the need of a web server.","It will further have the ability to exchange interfaces uploaded by a user or allow the user to select one provided by the virtual network (the host computer with the technology infrastructure).","Also, the ability to display interfaces in more than one foreign language for: e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites. All e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites are within a network where products and services can be shared among any e-mall, satellite e-malls, e-shop or web site by making them virtual.","For instance, an e-shop can sell its products dynamically, or have other e-malls; satellite e-malls and e-shops in the virtual network selling them virtually. The advantage of this virtual electronic network environment is to make products and services available to a broader base for both, sellers and buyers.","The virtual electronic network environment will enhance the way people shop electronically. Thus, making a wider selection of products and services available to any e-mall, satellite e-mall, e-shop and web site within the virtual network. It will offer means for the creation of specialized e-shops, satellite e-malls, e-malls and web sites, tailored uniquely to a specific market segment. Further, it will simplify buyers' decision by offering them a broad and specialized selection of products\/services.","It is also the intent of this invention to permit users to include e-commerce at web sites that are already in use. Thus, offering a new way to enhance them without the cost of providing the e-commerce infrastructure that is required, or even having to install and maintain a web server.","It will further permit the creation of virtual web sites, other than shopping. For instance, a web site may be virtual on-line schools, cities, etc. The use of this invention is without limits, and, as more goods\/services are offered, the more it will allow the creation of a virtual shopping and non-shopping web sites and a combination of both.","It will also integrate the world by allowing an e-shop in one country to sell in another country or to cross-sell products from a distributor or a manufacturer and having them delivered directly to the buyer, thus reducing storage, shipping and handling cost.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a method, a virtual network, or a computer program product. Accordingly, the present invention may take a form of an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware. Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code means embodied in the medium. Any computer readable medium may be utilized including hard disks, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, or magnetic devices.","As is understood by those skilled in the art of Web client\/server communications, a user access a server by establishing a TCP connection between client and server. Client and server communicate by using HTTP protocol over a TCP connection. Data transferred from servers to clients are HTTP objects (e.g. HTML objects).","Furthermore, any reference to names of a product or of a company is for the purpose of clarifying our discussion and they are registered to their respective owners.","Glossary of Used Terms","Before explaining this invention, let us first explain some of the terms that will be used throughout.","ASP stands for Active Server Page and it is used to dynamically create web pages on the server side and transmit them to a requesting client as HTML objects.","Back end means a computer system where users retrieve (content) from and view it at another computer (front end). In the case of the Internet a computer with a web server is the back end.","Cookie is a file kept by a web browser at the end user computer where the server or a script program running at the web browser send requests to the browser to save a value in the cookie file for later retrieval. It has a cookie name and the cookie's value and the date that it will expire.","Dynamic e-shop and dynamic web site is when products (also called goods) and services are part of the hosting e-shop or web site. That is, the e-shop or web site will do all the required maintenance. Each e-shop or web site is hosted within an e-mall.","E-services are services (also called contents) supplied to VNRI by a third party or part of VNRI. E-services are used in conjunction with VNRI's e-commerce. These e-services have means for associating with the e-commerce counterpart.","Front end means a computer system where users view information (also called content and used interchangeably) that is located at another computer system (back end). In the case of the Internet a computer with a web browser is the front end.","HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.","HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.","JavaScript is a commonly used language by clients and servers as well. On the client side it is used as means of interacting with HTML objects. On the server side it is used as a script language and it works in conjunction with the ASP and others technologies.","Satellite e-mall is a sub-set of an e-mall created by the virtual network system or by each individual e-mall (in the case of customized satellite e-mall). An e-mall has the option to include or to exclude services from a satellite e-mall.","Session Variable is a variable that the web server keeps in its memory for the duration of a web browser user visit to the web site or, in most cases, 20 minutes after the user access the last page from the web server. Any value can be assigned to a session variable. One good example is the use of session variables with the ASP technology.","SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is a text string used by a database server (a specialized software to manage databases) as to guide it in querying and retrieving database objects thereof.","TCP stands for Transfer Control Protocol.","URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and it is an Internet address used by a web browser to fetch a web page object from a web server.","WEB SERVER is a computer with specialized software to manage communication between a client's web browser and the server computer. Also, it communicates with others technologies that are within the server computer.","VNRI stands for Virtual Network Resource Infrastructure (also called virtual server and used here interchangeably) and it is the hosting environment hosting all e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites dynamically and virtually. Also, it is where the e-commerce infrastructure is hosted (hardware, software and the Internet gateway).","Virtual e-mall is when an e-mall place goods\/services from any e-shop or web site from the virtual network. An e-mall can have e-shops and web sites, but cannot have products\/services of its own (dynamically). Any products offered by an e-mall are virtual ones.","Virtual e-shop or virtual web site is used when an e-shop or web site offers products\/services from another e-shop or web site within the virtual network. Products\/services are called virtual products because they are available to an e-shop or web site other than the hosting one.","I) The Virtual Network","Let us further explore the virtual network. There will be many e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites in the virtual network. An e-mall may or may not have a dynamic e-shop or web site. Also, an e-shop or web site may or may not have products and\/or services. An e-mall can have an e-shop or web site that is empty (without products or services). Based on the previous situation, all products and\/or services offered by an empty e-shop or web site are virtual ones.","Let's further explore the interaction that goes between a client (user) computer and the virtual network server.","A user at a client web browser initiates communication with the virtual network server and register an e-mall. Other users will do the same. After an e-mall is registered it is ready to receive e-shops or web sites.","Let us say that, a user registers an e-shop and call it \u201cE-SHOP A\u201d. The user of E-SHOP A then adds products to it. Other registered e-shops at the network will place products in their e-shops as well. This process is called dynamic, since products are within each individual e-shop.","For the sake of our discussion, let's assume that, there are two e-shops: E-SHOP A and E-SHOP B. They both have products. Now the user of E-SHOP B accesses the virtual network server, receives a page with information about services, products, departments, categories, sub-categories, e-shops and web sites. This user now includes, products from E-SHOP A and a sub-category, then, sends it to the virtual network server. The network server receives and saves E-SHOP B selection (products from E-SHOP A and a sub-category) into a virtual database table.","Now, a user accessing E-SHOP B will have products from E-SHOP A and a sub-category with all of its products (virtually), also, all of E-SHOP B products (dynamically).","As we've said before, a client computer communicates with a server computer over the Internet or Intranet by a TCP connection. Moreover, a client sends HTTP requests to server. The server then process such requests and creates a web page (e.g. HTML objects), and sends it back to the client.","Furthermore, a client computer has a screen that is the means of interfacing with a user. It also has web browser software that runs in the client computer memory. The web browser is the client computer user's interface. And it presents a web page as objects (e. g. HTML objects) to the user. The objects can be text, audio, video, image, forms, links, etc. Also, the web browser communicates with a server computer.","Let's move on and discuss the Virtual Network Resource Infrastructure (henceforth called VNRI). The virtual network offers an infrastructure for worldwide e-commerce at a single location and available to anyone without any e-commerce infrastructure or even a server.","This VNRI infrastructure is located at a single location and it will be the back-end for worldwide front-ends accessing it. Also, this infrastructure will include software programs to manage all the VNRI associated e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-distributors and web sites. Further, it will include Internet, e-mail, credit cards gateways and all the necessary hardware.","The objective of this invention is to allow the creation of a plurality of e-malls and each e-mall will use VNRI's hosting and management means and offer e-shops, e-distributors and web site an e-commerce and e-service infrastructure (hosting and management) without having the infrastructure of their own. Each e-mall will be able to sell its e-shops products and e-shop's products located in other e-malls. Also, an e-shop will be able to sell its products and others e-shops' products. There will be only a single infrastructure for a worldwide use and it will be within VNRI. As it is now clear, e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-distributors and web sites, all use the VNRI for e-commerce and e-services. This process will give the idea that each one has an e-commerce and\/or e-service infrastructure of its own because each will offer an end-user means for using all the available resources within the VNRI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIGS. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Back to . It shows a method of using a single e-commerce resource infrastructure at a single location and providing e-commerce solution worldwide without each one having to replicate the e-commerce resource infrastructure at each location.","As it is shown, there is an e-commerce located in Brazil , USA , Mexico , France , Germany  and Canada . Although the e-commerce is spread worldwide, the e-commerce resource infrastructure is at a single location at VNRI .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"There are three layers of e-commerce within VNRI\u2014. E-distributors\/e-manufacturers  (henceforth called e-distributors). E-malls  and satellite e-malls (pre-set satellite e-mall  and customized satellite e-mall ).","Each will present e-commerce differently. Each e-distributors  has an e-commerce web site and will be able to sell its products directly (e-shop A ) or have other e-shops (e-shop B \u2014arrow line ) and e-malls (e-mall \u2014arrow line ) selling them virtually. In either case, end user\/shoppers (henceforth called end user) will be able to view each one independently. End user A  views e-shop A  and e-shop B ","E-malls, on the other hand, have the means to allow the creation of e-commerce e-shops or use the services of agents. Each e-shop will be able to sell its products directly or have them sold by the e-mall and its affiliated satellite e-malls. E-mall  has e-shop B  (arrow line ). As shown, e-shop B  has end user A  viewing its products and also end user B  is viewing them through e-mall , pre-set satellite e-mall  and customized satellite e-mall .","As presented, all products of an e-shop can be sold by the e-shop, by the e-mall where e-shop is dynamically located and by the e-mall's affiliated satellite e-malls. E-mall  has e-shop B  (arrow line ). E-mall  sells e-shop B  products (arrow line ). E-mall  makes all of its e-shops products available to each of its affiliated satellite e-malls. As shown, e-mall  has a pre-set satellite e-mall  and a customized satellite e-mall . And each one sells products from e-shop B  (arrow line ).","Also, an e-mall will have the means as to allow the use of agents' services. An e-mall can have one or more agents and each agent will be able to offer their expertise to e-shops in a one-to-one basis. An e-shop can be created directly to an e-mall or by an agent. Also, an agent can manage e-shops, e-distributors and web sites for one or more e-malls. E-mall  has agent  and it is the creator (arrow line ) of e-shop B . For sake of simplicity e-shop B  has e-mall  point to it (arrow line ) and Agent  (arrow ). In this case it means that Agent  created e-shop B  (arrow ) by using the e-mall  as the holder of e-shop B  (arrow ).","Before proceeding any further, let's explaining what an agent is. An agent is a person authorized to provide management services to the e-mall's e-shops. Also, an agent has log in and management rights to log in and manage e-shops for any e-mall in the virtual network resource infrastructure. An e-shop can be created and managed by its owner or have an agent to represent the e-shops within the e-mall.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","303","304","305","301","306","307","308","309"]},"As it will be understood by those skilled in the art. The virtual network resources will have all the required software and hardware that is needed to host e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites over the Internet or over a computer network.","As it can be seen at , an e-mall will be able to host e-shops as if they had their own e-commerce.

The client computer  represents the computer with a web browser where an end user views web sites. Server computer  is the VNRI hosting the e-commerce.","A user at client computer  enters requests through the user interface  (web browser). These requests are processed at the web browser  that is resident in the client computer memory. For instance, if a link to another page is selected by the end user. The web browser  will establish a communication link  with server computer  and transmit a request for the new web page. Server computer  receives the request through the communication link  and passes it to the resident web server software .","After the server computer  receives the request for a new web page, let's say that, the requested web page is an ASP page. The web server  connects with the ASP server . It in turns reads the web page template  and ASP programs . Next, the ASP server  will include the ASP programs  into the web page template , thus, forming a single file and executes it. There are cases that as the file is executed, the ASP program will need data from a database. In such cases, the ASP server  establishes a link  with the database  then reads\/writes to it, as needed.","After a line of programming code of the ASP program  is executed, its result (if any) is inserted into the web page template , thus, creating a final web page (more of it later). After all lines of the ASP program  are executed, the ASP server  will pass the final web page to the web server .

For example, a manufacturer uses VNRI and offer solutions to its supplier. The manufacturer is like an e-mall and its suppliers are like e-shops. In other words, the process involves three levels: first level is VNRI; second level is an e-mall and the third level is an e-shop. So, VNRI (first level) offers its solution to various locations (second level) and each location (second level) offers VNRI solution (first level) to at least one other location (third level).

They can be audio, video, images, links, forms, text, etc. We'll be discussing text object in particular. As we know, the virtual e-mall will be used worldwide. Furthermore, it must be able to display text objects in the user's own native language. Also, it should have means of translating database objects (products\/services), and also, e-shops and e-malls interfaces (text objects).","First, let's explore the on-line page interface translation (text objects); second, the translation of products\/services (database objects), and lastly, we'll show how they will enhance the user's virtual shopping experience.","The following are the steps for on-line interface translation: a user at a client selects a drop down or any other means for selecting a foreign language and the client sends this request to a server. A program in the server receives the user selected foreign language as encoded information and it represents the user selected foreign language. The program in the server has a function to translate text objects and it also has program code means for translating database text objects.","Let's first explore the text object translation. The function translating text objects receives two parameters: one is the encoded information (the user selected foreign language) and the other parameter is a code reference. The code reference is used to search a database table and retrieve a row with text objects in different foreign languages in each of its columns. The encoded information is used for retrieving a column which is a reference to the database table's row that was received in the previous step and it contains text object is in the user selected foreign language.","Now let's explore the translation of database text objects. The encoded information (selected foreign language) is combined with a SQL text string and it is a query expression. Once a program in the server computer executes the query expression, the query's result will only include database text object in the user selected foreign language.","We'll be using ASP (Active Server Page) technology along with JavaScript language for our explanation, since they are frequently used on the Internet.  shows a table (languageTable) with four columns: ID, Phrase_Code, ENG and POR.  shows two parts of a drop down form object and,  the actual HTML code for the drop down form object of .","Let's explore the drop down form object ().

The value at the action element of the form tag is \u201cnewlanguage.asp\u201d (line #). It will be the page that the web browser will request from the server once the form changelangue is submitted and pass its object (form objects) to it as well. The line \u201c<select name=language onChange=\u2018changeLanguage( )\u2019>\u201d (line #) indicates the start of a drop down object and \u201c<\/select>\u201d (line #) the end of it.

The second parameter, sChosenLanguage will be an encoded information and it is the user's selected language (the value \u201cPOR\u201d at the variable sLanguage). Now the function doTranslate( ) will open connections (database and record set) then perform a query at the languangeTable (). Next, it retrieves a value from column POR\u2014the user's selected language stored at the variable sLanguage. In our example the value at the Query variable is \u201cSELECT POR FROM languageTable WHERE Phrase_Code=\u2018ENGL\u2019\u201d (line # and line #).

SphraseCode receives the value \u201cENGL\u201d and sChosenLanguage receives the value \u201cPOR\u201d (user's selected language). Function doTranslate( ) searches the column Phrase_Code of the languageTable () for the value \u201cENGL\u201d (row # of the ID column), then, retrieves the value at the column POR (user selected language) and it is \u201cIngl\u00eas\u201d.","The function doTranslate( ) is very basic.

For example, there are eight products in English (rows ,,,,,, and  of the ID column) and four in Portuguese (rows ,, and  of the ID column).","III) Template Uploading Method","There are two ways that a front-end can be interfaced with VNRI's back end: first by selecting a pre-set interface that is within VNRI, second, by a user uploading a customized one. In either case, the interface is the front-end means for accessing the VNRI e-commerce back-end means.","In the case of a user-uploaded interface, it will have means for guiding a server in the inserting of program code and other pieces of information as well (include files). After the uploaded interface is received and processed by the server a new web site is created and as we've said before, it is the front-end means for a client accessing the server back-end means.","Customized user interface will allow a user at any time to change the front-end look without programming knowledge or knowledge of the server back-end structure. Also, a customized user interface will allow the inclusion of e-commerce in a web site without the expense or expertise that an e-commerce infrastructure requires.","For example, a customized interface is the same one that is in use by a web site. This new customized interface is now uploaded to a server with means for processing and creating a new interface. Now, a client is able to fetch both and present an interface with similar appearance to a user. The web site will present its services in the same way as it had done before and the server where the customized interface is located will present the e-commerce part, thus allowing, a web site without e-commerce means to include e-commerce easily and affordably.","We already know that, a client computer communicates with a server computer over a TCP Internet connection. A client sends requests to server then the server sends objects in the HTML format back to client. These objects are then displayed in the client computer as web pages.  shows this setup. Client  sends request  to server  than server  retrieves an ASP page and include files (files to be included into the ASP page) as needed .

After a link is selected, a new page with the products\/service information  (e.g. title, description, image, etc.) is received. Finally, before leaving the page, opened connection is released to free resources that are no longer needed .","As it was shown at . An ASP page has include files  and, it can be a program in any acceptable ASP language. First, these include files are inserted into the ASP page, then the server executes them.

All we need to do is: create a new template with a new look; insert the include files tags, next, a new web page is created based on the same set of include files. Changes can also be made directly to an include file without affecting the remaining ASP page.","Since we are creating virtual e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites, users will need means for exchanging interfaces without having physical access to the virtual server.

It is up to an e-mall to include or exclude a satellite e-mall.","Once an e-mall includes one, the e-mall inherits its e-services and its behaviors as well. An e-mall with a satellite e-mall will be able to present the satellite e-mall's e-services along with its e-shops products and most of the cases it will be specialized e-services. For example: an e-mall includes a satellite e-mall that is specialized in car sales. Every time users access the e-mall and the satellite e-mall's e-service that is part of it. The e-mall e-commerce part may only display products that are related to cars in general.","Also, the e-service from a satellite e-mall has guiding means for guiding the e-mall in the displaying of its products along with the e-service. The guiding means may be an encoded information in a hidden field of a form or it may be words within the e-service page.","There are other means for presenting e-services to a satellite e-mall as well. And it is using e-services located in a different server than a server within the VNRI. The server will make its e-services available to VNRI and VNRI will make them available to a satellite e-mall. E-malls at VNRI are able to incorporate the satellite e-mall and its e-services by incorporating the satellite e-mall containing them.","As we've mentioned before, HTML is displayed on a computer screen as objects. Each e-service is one or more object and they can be text, image, form, links etc., and at least one object in the page will have at least one encoded information and the encoded information will be the guiding means for guiding the server to include at least one other object in the page and transmit it to a client.","As it has been presented so far. The virtual network has e-malls and e-malls have e-shops and web sites.

They can be at a single or multiple URL addresses, folders, databases or database tables.","Let us explore this concept a little further. Let us say that that an e-mall has some e-shops selling sporting goods, some others selling cars accessories and still others selling music CD's (let us call it: e-mall A). Now let us say that a satellite e-mall in the virtual network is specialized in offering car services (let us call it: satellite e-mall Car Sales).

Every time a user access the satellite e-mall Car Sales he\/she will be able to view all information about cars and also view all car accessories products from the e-mall A along with car accessories products from distributors\/manufacturers.","The idea is to allow e-commerce and e-services to be displayed on a single web page although they come from two different locations. In the above example, the e-commerce comes from e-mall A and the e-services comes from the satellite e-mall Car Sales that is part of the virtual network and available to all e-malls in the virtual network system.

Also, these e-services can be made available directly to a server through the VNRI infrastructure instead of being incorporated in a satellite e-mall or be displayed directly to a client computer without the user of a sever. In the latter case, the e-services displayed at the client will be fetched from the VNRI. Furthermore, e-services\/contents can be retrieved from different server by another server (secondary server) and this secondary server will make any or all of these e-services available to one or more servers (tertiary servers) and each of the tertiary server will make these e-services available to a client.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0221","num":"0220"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["3220","3222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0222","num":"0221"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 32"],"b":["3320","3322","3328","3330","3332","3328","3330","3332","3322","3320"]},"Other means can be used as well, like, hidden form elements with department, category and sub-category codes encoded in them.

Also, an e-shop from one e-mall can sell virtually in another e-mall. As we see, a web browser user accessing an e-mall in the virtual network will come across web pages from different e-shops dynamically located at the e-mall, web pages from virtual e-shops (e-shops dynamically located at a different e-mall) and also from e-distributors\/e-manufacturers.","Let's say that the web browser user later return to the e-mall and want to find a product that he\/she saw on a previous visit. Let's also say that the product was from a virtual e-shop and it is no longer available virtually at the e-mall. The user will think that the item is no longer available because the e-shop is no longer virtually located at the e-mall. From this scenario it is clear that there is a need for a mechanism to track and keep the user surfing experience.","Each page of information supplied to each client have a surf code reference and it is used for automatically storing a reference for each information supplied to each client and it forms the surf user-list. Once the user requests his\/her surf user-list, the server will use each surf code reference and create the surf user-list and sent it to the user. A surf user-list will only include information that was previously viewed by the user.","Also, an end-user at a client with a login means and after logging on the server, he\/she will be able to request the server to save his\/her surf user-list for later review. The server will save the surf user-list based on the end-user ID that is part of the login information in the server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0231","num":"0230"},"figref":"FIG. 35","b":["3552","3553","3554","3554","3560","3556","3552","3552","3566","3554"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0232","num":"0231"},"figref":"FIG. 36","b":["3552","3552","3672","3552","123","456","3674","3676","789","3678","3680","145","3682","3684","100","102","3686","3688","3690"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0232"},"figref":"FIG. 37","b":["3552","3702","3554","3554","3722","3552","3552","3566","3706","3554","3554","3560","3726","3728","3552"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0233"},"figref":"FIG. 38","b":["3552","3560","3552","3810","3554","3554","3812","3552","3566","3552","3814","3554","3554","3560","3554","3560","3832","3560","3552","3816"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0235","num":"0234"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 38"],"b":["3950","3560","3952","3950","123","3951","3952","3958","3956","3954"]},"We've shown values stored in a session variable user_tracking_code  (). It can be stored in a database as well for the purposed of tracking and recording the user activity and always have his\/her surf list available.","VII) Customized Web Sites","Besides the user surfing tracking system, the virtual network will also have means for customizing web sites to each user. Once a user is registered, personal information and personal preferences will be used as to allow the virtual network to customize web sites to each user as to reflect the user's preferences and also the user's location.","There will be a plurality of information about a specific subject matter and upon a user access the server it will customize a web site. A customized web site will allow a server means for presenting different information about the same subject matter tailored uniquely to each user based on each user's pre-set information store in the server.","A user furnishes information to a server and once the same user returns to the server and log in, the server will only supply information to the user that is relevant to the user and based on the user pre-set information that is stored in the server.","Let's say that user has Soccer and Football for sports preferences and the local of residency is San Francisco, Calif., USA. Another one residing in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil has Soccer and Basketball for sports preferences. Now, both users will access the same web site at the same time and view sports. The user residing in San Francisco, Calif., USA will view information for Soccer and Football for leagues from San Francisco, Calif. and USA, while the second user will view sports information for leagues from Salvador, Bahia and Brazil.","The same method can be used to set user previous visited web pages or products page. For instance, a user visits a product page about fishing. Next time he\/she come to any web site within VNRI with e-services, fishing related information will be part of the web site along with fishing products (e-commerce part).","It is to be understood that all e-commerce (goods\/products) and e-services (articles\/services) within the virtual network are available to all e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites virtually. Also, means will be available as to allow each e-mall to make its customized e-service(s) available to others e-malls, satellite e-malls, e-shops, e-distributors and web sites at the virtual network.","Many more arrangements can be created and incorporated in this invention. While it has been fully described in connection with the illustrated embodiments, it will be appreciated and understood that modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. We've used the term e-malls and e-shops all along but instead of e-mall, it can be called e-portal and instead of e-shops, it can be a combination of e-shops and e-services.
