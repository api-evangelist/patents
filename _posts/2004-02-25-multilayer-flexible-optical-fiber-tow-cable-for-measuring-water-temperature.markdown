title: Multi-layer flexible optical fiber tow cable for measuring water temperature
abstract: A tow cable in which the temperature of the cable is measurable by the use of multiplexing capability intrinsic to optical fibers in which the optical fibers are positioned at the center of the tow cable and wound as part of two layers of surrounding strength wires. The optical fibers of the two layers intersect a vector extending radially from the optical fiber at the center to an outer surface of the tow cable. Light signals emitted from a multiplexer to positions along the optical fibers, in which the positions intersect the vector, return light signals from the positions to provide measurements that in conjunction with a data processor further provide temperature measurement of the outer boundary of the tow cable.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This continuation-in-part application claims the benefit of co-pending U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 09\/814,487 entitled \u201cInstrumented Fiber Optic Tow Cable\u201d filed on Mar. 20, 2001 by Anthony A. Ruffa who is the same and sole applicant of this application.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to arrays towed through the water by vessels and more particularly to an improved tow cable for the arrays in which the temperature at various radii of the tow cable is measurable thereby self-calibrating the tow cable to account for the heat-dissipation of the tow cable in order to measure the temperature of the water surrounding the tow cable.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","In naval operations, an array is towed behind a vessel for gathering information, such as the location of enemy vessels or the depth of the ocean. A typical array comprises an exterior hose wall fabricated from rugged, insulated material, and a plurality of information gathering wires communicating with acoustical sensors disposed within the protective hose wall. The conducting wires or optical fibers of the towed array transmit information via the tow cable to a microprocessor within the vessel for a readout of gathered data.","In addition to transmitting information, the tow cable also powers the array. Since the conducted power generates heat, the conducted power impacts the temperature of the cable and the water surrounding the cable. Further measurements that rely on the surrounding water temperature such as a sound velocity profile, can therefore be impacted by temperature variances along the length of the tow cable. Since no segment of the tow cable or only a minimal portion of the tow cable can be accessed on surface vessels, an accurate temperature measurement at different points along the length of the tow cable is difficult to discern after the tow cable is deployed or \u201clet out\u201d from the winch of the array handling system.","In the art, various methods and devices are employed to measure the temperature of the tow cable and the surrounding water column. In Seaman et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,147,931), an apparatus for providing a temperature profile of a towed sonar array is disclosed. In the cited reference, the tow cable for the array comprises a central cable and a protective outer jacket. Thermistors are disposed at spaced positions along the outer jacket and connect to conductors embedded in the outer jacket. The conductors terminate onboard ship to provide continuous signals representing temperatures at various ocean depths.","While thermistors can be positioned along the length of the tow cable to determine the temperature of the water, this use of thermistors is limited in its practical application. In a first example, using a high number of thermistors is impractical for a tow cable that can be as long as 8000 feet. Since each thermistor requires its own pair of conductors, the high number of thermistors can significantly increase the tow cable diameter over the length of the tow cable. In a second example, the technology of the cited reference is not easily transferable to the tow cable because of the strain encountered by the tow cable at the curvature of the cable to the winch of the towed array handling system. A separate protective band for the thermistor, as disclosed by the cited reference, is susceptible to detachment during repeated use of the tow cable such that the thermistor is easily exposed to these strains with the result of inaccurate information gathering if the thermistors are damaged.","In Yamaguchi et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,662), a measuring system measures temperature distribution in water using an optical fiber. In the cited reference, the optical fiber is positioned in a central pipe sealed by filler material. Although, the optical fiber positioned in this manner can determine the temperature of the proximate water column, the positioning of optical fibers as temperature sensors can be improved.","An improvement to the positioning of sensors for measuring temperature would be the ability to gather measurements at varying radii of the cable rather than only at the center of the cable. Gathering measurements at varying radii along a common vector from the center of the tow cable increases the accuracy of temperature measurements of the surrounding water column.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a tow cable in which temperature measurements at various radii of the tow cable are attainable thereby self-calibrating the tow cable to account and correct for the heat-flow in the radial direction in order to measure the temperature of the water surrounding the tow cable.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a tow cable in which temperature measurements at various radii of the tow cable and along a common vector extending from a center of the tow cable are attainable.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a tow cable which compensates for the strain encountered by the tow cable especially at the winch of the towed array handling system.","To attain the objects described, there is provided a tow cable in which the temperature of the tow cable is measured by the use of multiplexing capability intrinsic to optical fibers in which the optical fibers are positioned at the center of the tow cable and separately wound as part of two layers of surrounding strength wires. During measurement, light signals are emitted from a multiplexer aboard the towing vessel to positions along the optical fibers in which the positions are intersections of a vector extending radially from a longitudinal axis to an outer surface of the tow cable. The returning light signals from the positions provide measurements that in conjunction with a data processor further provide measurement of the outer boundary temperature of the tow cable. The outer boundary temperature of the tow cable is determinant of the surrounding water column temperature. Sound velocity profiles are easily derived from the water column temperature by methods known to those skilled in the art.","In the manufacture of the tow cable, a steel strength member wire is substituted in one armored layer of the tow cable and another steel strength member wire is substituted in another armored layer. The steel strength member wires are substituted with armored optical fibers or bendable stainless steel tubing encompassing an optical fiber. In an additional manufacturing step, an optical fiber is positioned within stainless steel tubing as the center of the tow cable.","The above and other features of the invention, including various and novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular devices embodying the invention are shown by way of illustration only and not as the limitations of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, one sees that  depicts an arrangement view including the tow cable  of the present invention let out from a winch  of a vessel  in which the tow cable tows an acoustic sensor array  through the ocean . The tow cable  powers the sensor array  and transmits measurement data from the sensor array to a multiplexer\/demultiplexer  with data processing capability or transmits measurement data to other data processors known to those skilled in the art.","As shown in the cross-sectional view of , the double-armored tow cable  includes a centrally located section , including at least one optical fiber  contained in a stainless steel tube surrounded by electrical conductors  (for transmitting power and signals). The optical fiber  preferably extends along a longitudinal axis of the tow cable ; however, the optical fiber may extend parallel and helical to the longitudinal axis of the tow cable.","Surrounding the central section  are two armored layers  and  of strength wires . An optical fiber  encompassed by another stainless steel tube  or an armored optical fiber  of  replaces one of the strength wires  helixed around the section  as the first armored layer . An optical fiber  of  encompassed by another stainless steel tube  or an armored optical fiber  of  replaces another of the strength wires  helixed around the first armored layer  as the second armored layer . The number of steel strength wires  are shown in  and  for comparison and illustrative purposes wherein the actual number would be much larger and arrangement of the steel strength wires would vary.","As shown in , each of the armored optical fibers  and  intersects a vector  extending from the optical fiber  of the central section . The vector  extends radially from a longitudinal axis  of the tow cable  such that the measurements derived from the group of optical fibers ,  and  are localized. The armored optical fibers  and  also intersect additional vectors extending similar to the vector  with the additional vectors at various lengths of the tow cable  such that the temperature of the water column at various points along the tow cable is measurable. Measurements are derived from the group of optical fibers ,  and  in a similar manner as the optical fibers of  with a similar positioning of the optical fibers ,  and  as the optical fibers of .","Furthermore, the armored optical fibers  and  replace strength wires  that are wound around the longitudinal axis  at a helical angle  depicted in . The optical fibers  and  are similarly wound around the longitudinal axis  as the optical fibers  and  shown in . The helical angle \u03b8 is approximately 20 degrees; however, the helical angle is based upon manufacturer's specifications (i.e.: the helical angle may decrease for larger tow cables). The placement of the armored optical fibers  and  at the helical angle \u03b8 to the longitudinal axis  is chosen to reduce the strain of the tow cable  at the large bending of the tow cable  encountered at the winch .","In a data-gathering operation during the towing of the array , the multiplexer\/demultiplexer  emits optical pulses of light through the optical fibers ,  and  of  as an example. The multiplexer\/demultiplexer  also receives backward scattered light from the optical fibers ,  and  resulting from the emitted optical pulses of light. The back-scattered light has a component not shifted in frequency (due to Rayleigh scattering) and a component shifted in frequency (due to Raman scattering).","In terms of the wavelength distribution, the back-scattered light includes Rayleigh scattered light having the same wavelength (\u03bb) and the Raman scattered light deviated 6\u0394\u03bb from the incident light. The Raman scattered light deviated +\u0394\u03bb from \u03bbis referred to as Stokes light while the Raman scattered light deviated \u2212\u0394\u03bb from \u03bbis referred to as anti-Stokes light.","The location of detection data is obtained from the tow cable  by denoting the relation between the time (t) elapsed from the incidence of optical pulses emitted and the intensity of light detected by the multiplexer\/demultiplexer . The data denoting the detected light intensity is inputted in a data processing portion of the multiplexer\/demultiplexer .","Since the velocity of light in optical fibers is known, the time (t) that elapsed from the incidence of the optical pulses to the detection of a signal represents the distance from the end of the optical fibers.","The Raman scattering effects can be used to derive the temperature (T); this is well-known to one skilled in the art. The time of arrival processing described above (and also well-known in the art) determines the location of each temperature on the optical fiber.","Since the distance of emitted light can be obtained as stated above, the vector  of  can also be established at a distance from the end of the tow cable . Because of the helixing of the optical fibers  and  along the-tow cable , the distances of emitted light for these optical fibers is slightly higher at the vector  and therefore the measurements based on these distances should be compressed multiplexer\/demultiplexer  with data processing capability and accounted for at the vector . For example, the distance of emitted light at the optical fiber  would be five hundred feet while the distances at the optical fibers  and  may be five hundred and twenty-five feet and five hundred and fifty feet respectively, depending on the helix angle.","Once a distance is established and a temperature is measurable at the optical fibers ,  and , the boundary condition of the tow cable  is measurable with a substantial degree of accuracy. The water temperature Tat the water column (of the ocean  or other surrounding fluid condition) is at or proximal to the boundary condition. Specifically, the heat going into the surface, q, at the radius rof the tow cable  is resolved by the equation: \n\n\nassuming that \u2207T=0 in the second armored layer .\n","In the equation, the thermal conductivity is K; A is the circumferential area at the radius rand \n\n\nrepresents the temperature gradient measured at the radius rand the radius r(r=0) of .\n","Solving for Laplace's equation for heat conduction using the cylindrical coordinates intrinsic to the tow cable  and assuming axisymetric temperature distribution: \n\n\nthe temperature T of the surrounding water column at a length z of the tow cable  is resolvable.\n","The water temperature T is reflected by example as Tin . It is found by fitting the solution to the temperatures: Tat the optical fiber  (alternatively the optical fiber  in ); Tat the optical fiber  (alternatively the optical fiber ) and Tat the optical fiber . If the temperature is measured at three radial locations and if the temperature is assumed axisymmetric in nature, the temperature of the tow cable  can be determined by solving Laplaces's equation with Tand Tas boundary conditions with an effective conductance representing the cable material.","Since Tis unknown, the problem is solved for a range of values of T, and then the value of Tis chosen that best fits the measured temperatures Tand T. Since the problem is linear, a look-up table can be pre-computed and stored so that Laplace's equation does not have to be solved in real time. As a result, the temperature Tof the surrounding water column at a length z along the tow cable  is resolved. Fitting to two temperatures Tand Tin a least squares sense minimizes error compared to fitting to only one interior temperature. Also, this accounts for cable heating in the center, which is reflected by the temperature T.","Thus by the present invention its objects and advantages are realized and although preferred embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein, its scope should be determined by that of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
