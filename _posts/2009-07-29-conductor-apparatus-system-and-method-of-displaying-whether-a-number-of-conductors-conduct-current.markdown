Field","The disclosed concept pertains generally to conductors and, more particularly, to conductors, such as, for example, power conductors of a power distribution system. The disclosed concept also pertains to systems and methods for indicating status of such conductors.","2. Background Information","A major problem for an electric utility or other power distribution system is knowing the location of a faulted power cable or knowing when a power cable ceases to conduct current. For example, known methods of determining this information include analyzing reports (e.g., telephone calls) from electric utility customers and\/or reports from electric utility maintenance personnel.","A global positioning system (GPS) receiver calculates its position by precisely timing signals sent by GPS satellites. Each GPS satellite continually transmits messages containing the time the message was sent, precise orbital information, and the general system health and rough orbits of all GPS satellites. The GPS receiver measures the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each GPS satellite. Geometric analysis combines these distances with the location of the GPS satellites to determine the GPS receiver's location. The position can be displayed, perhaps with a moving map display, latitude and longitude, and\/or elevation information. Some GPS units also show derived information, such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.","In general, a GPS receiver includes an antenna, tuned to the frequencies transmitted by the GPS satellites, receiver-processors, and a highly-stable clock. The GPS receiver can also include a display for providing location and speed information to the user. Many GPS receivers can relay position data to a PC or other device using a suitable protocol. Some GPS receivers can interface with other devices using methods including a serial connection, USB or Bluetooth.","GPS receivers are known to be powered from a battery or from a conventional three-prong input, AC\/DC power supply.","U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004\/0198382 discloses a locator device carried on or by a person, particularly a child, that sends out a signal using satellite technology known as GPS. After the child is wearing the GPS locator device, a parent, guardian or care giver logs onto a computer, or a cellular phone or other communication equipment with a GPS feature, and a web page map reveals the child's location to within a few feet.","U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009\/0063680 discloses a system for using signals from a GPS system to determine a physical location of a mobile electric resource, such as a plug-in electric vehicle, on a power grid. Using GPS enables a remote intelligent power flow (IPF) module to resolve its physical location on a power network in a non-exact manner. Noisy location information from GPS is transmitted to a flow control server, which uses it with a survey information database to infer the location of the mobile electric resource.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,783 discloses a fault sensor device, which can detect and distinguish abnormal current and voltage events on an alternating current overhead and underground transmission line or distribution line. The fault sensor device is contained in an elongated molded plastic housing. The fault sensor device includes a current sensor and a voltage sensor connected in proximity to the transmission or distribution line for monitoring current and voltage analog signals. An analog-to-digital converter connected to the current and voltage sensors samples the current and voltage analog signals and produces corresponding digital signals. A processor responds to the digital signals and detects an abnormal condition and distinguishes whether any of a plurality of types of faults have occurred. A transmitter transmits the fault information from the processor to a remote location. Power to operate the overhead sensing device electronics and transceiver is derived from a bank of double-layer capacitors charged by two panels of photovoltaic cells mounted on the housing surface of the overhead fault sensing device. Power to operate the underground fault sensor is derived from the bank of double-layer capacitors charged by inductive power from current through the underground power line. The fault sensor is mounted on an energized overhead power line easily and quickly by a so-called \u201chot stick\u201d manipulated by an individual on the ground, in a bucket truck, or from a power line pole.","A geographic information system (e.g., a geographical information system) (GIS) can capture, store, analyze, manage and present data that is linked to location. A GIS can be a computer system capable of capturing, storing, analyzing and displaying geographically referenced information or data identified according to location.","Google\u00ae created a Google\u00ae Maps API (application programming interface) to allow developers to integrate Google\u00ae Maps into their web sites with their own data points. By using the Google\u00ae Maps API, it is possible to embed the full Google\u00ae Maps site into an external web site. The Google\u00ae Maps API provides a number of utilities for manipulating maps, as with Google\u00ae Maps, and adds content to the map through a variety of services, allowing the creation of robust map applications on the web site. Developers request an API key, which is bound to the web site and directory entered when creating the key. A customized map interface is created by adding Google\u00ae JavaScript code to a page, and then using Javascript functions to add points to the map. Rather than specifying and setting up individual controls, a developer can specify that the map exhibit the look and feel of the Google\u00ae UI (user interface). The developer uses a GMap2.setUIToDefault( ) method, which adds a set of controls and user input behavior to the map corresponding to what is available in the UI on Google\u00ae Maps. This behavior is also dynamic, such that if the Google\u00ae UI changes, the web site automatically gets any new UI behavior after the API updates to reflect those changes, although there can be a delay between when a feature shows up on Google\u00ae Maps and when it is added to the Google\u00ae Maps API.","There is room for improvement in apparatus, systems and methods for indicating status of conductors, such as, for example, the power conductors of a power distribution system.","These needs and others are met by embodiments of the disclosed concept, which provide a global positioning system device structured to wirelessly communicate a determined location of the device when powered by a power supply responsive to current conducted by a conductor, and structured to not wirelessly communicate when current is not conducted by the conductor.","In accordance with one aspect of the disclosed concept, an apparatus for a conductor capable of conducting a current comprises: a global positioning system device structured to determine location of the global positioning system device;

The apparatus  includes a global positioning system (GPS) device, such as the example GPS module , structured to determine location of the GPS module . A coupling device  is structured to couple the GPS module  (and\/or the apparatus ) to the power conductor . A power supply, such as the example power conditioning section , is structured to power the GPS module  responsive to a current  conducted by the power conductor . The GPS module  is further structured to wirelessly communicate the determined location using a wireless signal  when powered by the example power conditioning section  responsive to the current  conducted by the power conductor . The GPS module  does not wirelessly communicate when current is not conducted by the power conductor  for example reasons as will be explained, below.","The wireless signal  from the GPS module  () can be, for example and without limitation, an alarm e-mail message, an alarm text message, or a message communicated over a communication network, such as the Internet.","The GPS module  () can preferably include a first indicator (not shown), such as an LED, to indicate when the GPS system (not shown) is active, and\/or a second indicator (not shown), such as a two-color target area (not shown), to indicate with a first color (e.g., without limitation, red) that the wireless signal  is inactive and to indicate with a different second color (e.g., without limitation, green) that the wireless signal  is active.","The disclosed apparatus  can be applied to, for example and without limitation, a wide range of conductors, such as the example power conductor , other utility and power distribution cables, and a wide range of cables or other conductors that conduct electrical current. A few non-limiting examples of such conductors include a distribution alternating current (AC) power line, a utility power cable, a power distribution cable, and a power bus.","The current  conducted by the example power conductor  can be a direct current (DC) or an alternating current (AC).","The example power conditioning section  can be a parasitic power supply structured to power the example GPS module  responsive to the current  conducted by the example power conductor , and to remove power from the example GPS module  when current is not conducted by the example power conductor . Non-limiting examples of parasitic power supplies are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,145,322; and 7,253,602, which are incorporated by reference herein. Preferably, the example power conditioning section  is suitably clamped to and\/or insulatively coupled to the example power conductor  by the coupling device .","As an alternative to and\/or as a supplement to a parasitic power supply (e.g., Example 3, above), an example power conditioning section \u2032, as shown in , can include a solar power supply  (e.g., using solar (photovoltaic) power) structured to output power responsive to solar energy , a detector  structured to detect the current  conducted by the example power conductor , and a switch  structured to power the example GPS module  from the output power of the solar power supply  when the detector  detects the current  conducted by the example power conductor  and to remove power from the GPS module  when the detector  does not detect current conducted by the example power conductor . Alternatively, the solar power supply  can be a parasitic power supply or any suitable supplemental power supply (e.g., without limitation, back-up; battery).","Referring to , a system  includes the apparatus  and the example power conductor  of , and a display  remote from the apparatus . The GPS module  () of the apparatus  is further structured to wirelessly communicate the determined location to the display  when powered by the example power conditioning section  () of the apparatus . However, the GPS module  () does not wirelessly communicate with the display  when current is not conducted by the power conditioning section  ().","The display  can be a geographic information system (GIS) display.","The disclosed apparatus  preferably wirelessly communicates using a suitable Internet software interface for mapping and location, non-limiting examples of which are discussed below.","The display  can be a GPS overlay of a power distribution system map . If the example power conditioning section  () senses current, then the example GPS module  () is powered and a corresponding indication (e.g., a corresponding illuminated dot ) of the GPS overlay of the distribution system map  is displayed as shown in . If the example power conditioning section  () ceases to sense current, then the example GPS module  () powers down. As a result, for example, the corresponding indication (e.g., the example corresponding illuminated dot ) of the display  is removed. This permits an operator of the power distribution system to identify a specific power cable, such as the example power conductor , and its location that has lost power for any reason.","The display  can be a Google\u00ae Map UI (user interface).","The display  can comprise a Google\u00ae Map API (application programming interface) .","As shown in , a method  displays whether a number of conductors  conduct current.

At , a display  is employed remote from the GPS module . At , the determined location is wirelessly communicated to the display  when the GPS module  is powered responsive to the current conducted by the number of the number of conductors .

The example apparatus  includes the GPS module , which can be coupled (e.g., without limitation, by using the hot stick ) to any conductor, such as the example power conductor . The GPS module  is stationary and interfaces with a remote, suitable display, such as for example and without limitation, one or both of the displays  ( ().","The disclosed apparatus  can be applied, without contact, to an energized conductor, such as the example power conductor  of  or other power line, via a suitable clamping arrangement. For example, the coupling device  of the apparatus  is preferably structured to couple an insulated housing (not shown) of the example power conditioning section  to a current carrying conductor, such as a power bus or power bus bar. See, for example, incorporated-by-reference U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,145,322; and 7,253,602.","The GPS module  can be used in conjunction with a suitable wireless current sensor. Non-limiting examples of wireless current sensors are disclosed in incorporated-by-reference U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,145,322; and 7,253,602. As a non-limiting example, at a predetermined range of bus current levels, the example power conditioning section  regulates a number of direct current (DC) voltages and provides a corresponding direct current at those bus currents to the GPS module , although relatively lower or relatively higher bus currents can be employed. Preferably, suitable power management routines are employed to help save energy consumption by putting a processor (not shown) into a sleep (e.g., low-power) mode and waking up when data is to be sent. As a result, this may allow the apparatus  to self-power at relatively lower bus currents. The processor is structured to perform a power on initialization, execute code in response to a predetermined value of the DC voltage, and enable the GPS module . Conversely, the processor can be structured to perform a power failure routine, execute code in response to a predetermined value of the DC voltage, and disable the GPS module . This advantageously prevents mis-operation of the example GPS module  when the example power conditioning section  cannot provide a suitable DC voltage to the example GPS module  and\/or when no or insufficient current is conducted by the example power conductor  of .","The example power conditioning sections ,\u2032 of  can optionally detect if the current in the conductor  exceeds a suitable trip threshold (e.g., without limitation, a value above rated current; any suitable value) and responsively send an alarm message and\/or disable the GPS device . In this example, the sections ,\u2032 can then be reset by an RF message from a handheld unit (not shown) or by detecting a magnet (not shown) of the hot stick .","While specific embodiments of the disclosed concept have been described in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure.
