Subsequently, a DNA fragment containing the gene of interest was cleaved out from the selected clone using restriction enzymes; the cleaved DNA fragment was purified and then integrated into a fusion protein expression vector; a host was transformed with the vector; the transformed host was allowed to form single colonies; plasmid was purified from the host derived from each colony; a host bacteria for protein expression was transformed with the purified plasmid to thereby express the protein encoded by the gene of interest. The above-described operations are time-consuming; they require nine days at the quickest. Besides, the step of cleaving DNA fragments containing the gene of interest from the sub-cloning vector using restriction enzymes and the step of purifying the resultant DNA fragments require skill.","It is an object of the invention to provide a tool for reducing the time and labor required for obtaining a protein by recombinant expression of a gene in a host.","It is another object of the invention to provide a method of producing a protein encoded by a gene using the above-mentioned tool.","It is known that most representative enzymes used in PCR, such as Taq DNA polymerase\/Tth DNA polymerase, has an activity of a side reaction of adding an extra residue dA to the 3\u2032 end of the amplified DNA product in a template independent manner. Therefore, most of the double-stranded DNA fragments amplified by PCR have a 3\u2032-overhang structure in which one dA residue is added.","When a plasmid vector having a 3\u2032-dT overhang that will form a complementary base pair with dA is prepared and mixed with the PCR-amplified product described above, base pair formation utilizing the one-base overhangs readily occurs. When DNA ligase is added thereto, ligation between the vector and the PCR amplified product occurs. Since DNA ligase does not cause ligation between mismatch-containing DNA ends, it is known that self-ligation of plasmid vector alone without the PCR amplified product hardly occurs.","A method in which an open circular vector having a 3\u2032-dT overhang structure (T-vector) is prepared in advance and then a PCR product is mixed for ligation without restriction enzyme treatment or blunt-ending treatment utilizing the above-described nature is called TA-cloning.","Methods for preparing T-vector are classified into three according to their principles.","The first method uses TdT. TdT (terminal deoxinucleotidyltransferase) is an enzyme which adds any deoxynucleotide to DNA ends in a template independent manner. Therefore, when a plasmid is first digested with a blunt-end restriction enzyme and then treated with TdT in the presence of dTTP, a vector in which one to several dT's are added to its 3\u2032 end can be prepared. However, it seems that no report of T-vector preparation by this method has been made efficiently.","The second method uses the TdT activity of Taq DNA polymerase. As described above, Taq DNA polymerase adds one molecule of dA to the blunt end of DNA in PCR reaction solution. However, when Taq is reacted with the blunt end of DNA in the presence of excessive Mg and in the presence of dTTP alone without other dNTPs, one residue of dT is added to DNA. Therefore, it is possible to prepare T-vector utilizing this nature. Briefly, a vector having one dT added to its 3\u2032 end can be prepared by digesting a plasmid with a blunt-end restriction enzyme and then reacting the digested plasmid with Taq in the presence of dTTP and Mg. In this method, it seems that the T-overhang generation efficiency varies remarkably depending on the recognition sequence of the blunt-end restriction enzyme used. EcoRV is used in most of the preparation examples reported so far, whereas it is known that the generation efficiency is low when SmaI is used. Methods for avoiding this are disclosed on the internet.","The third method is a method in which a \u201ccassette\u201d DNA sequence containing two restriction enzyme sites directly generating T-overhangs is designed and digested with a relevant restriction enzyme. As an example in which a restriction enzyme capable of generating a single 3\u2032-T overhang is used in an actual T-vector, use of XcmI, Eam11051 and AhdI is reported. According to this method, the above-described \u201ccassette\u201d DNA sequence containing two restriction enzyme sites is designed and inserted into a plasmid of interest. Then, the plasmid is digested with a relevant restriction enzyme. As a result, an open circular plasmid having a dT-overhang at both ends is prepared. (This time, the present inventors used AhdI to prepare a T-vector. With this method, it is possible to design an open circular plasmid having \u201casymmetric\u201d dT-overhangs. Besides, almost 100% of the open circular plasmids obtained by this method are expected to have a dT-overhang at both ends. Thus, the plasmid is of extremely high quality.)","However, conventional TA-cloning has a drawback that this method cannot control the orientation of a gene of interest inserted into the vector. As a result, most of those plasmids prepared as T-vector have been mainly applied only as (1) a vector for cloning (or sub-cloning) unknown genes or (2) a vector for cloning genes having novel promoter activity. There have been only a small number of T-vectors which are used for TA-cloning of a region to be expressed as a protein (ORF) into an expression vector directly. In the above-described two uses, the orientation of ORF does not matter. The orientation of ORF only matters when conducting protein expression experiments. (This time, in order to select those plasmids in which a foreign gene (PCR product) is inserted in the proper orientation easily, the present inventors designed a sequence in such a manner that the restriction sequence of restriction enzyme NcoI or NdeI appears only when the foreign gene is inserted in the opposite direction. As a result, it becomes possible to selectively transform only those plasmids which express a fusion protein linked to such as glutathione-5-transferase [GST] in the proper orientation into .)","Vectors for expressing a foreign gene as a GST fusion protein in have been commercialized. PGEX series vectors which are provided with protease recognition and cleavage sequence with multicloning site following the coding region of -derived GST are sold by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Because GST-fusion proteins are relatively high in solubility and expressed at high levels in ; the protein can be purified in almost one step when affinity chromatography using glutathione-immobilized carrier (beads) is employed; interactions between a fusion protein of interest immobilized on glutathione beads and its target molecule (protein, nucleic acid, low molecular weight molecule, etc.) can be observed easily (pull-down assay); compared to proteins without tag, functions of GST-fusion proteins are less damaged when immobilized on a measuring chip for molecular interaction experiments by surface plasmon resonance; the vecors of this series are used very widely in biochemistry and molecular biology as an expression vector. The inventors considered it will be very useful to prepare a number of expression systems in parallel, each of which expresses various proteins and protein fragments of various lengths, by modifying the pGEX series vector into a TA-vector.","After the completion of genome projects, in order to identify functional proteins and functional domains of proteins and to apply the results in industries, it has become important to perform both determination of tertiary structures and determination of molecular functions at high speed. For that purpose, it is necessary to obtain protein samples retaining their activities which may be used for a series of experiments in the form of soluble proteins. Generally, when a full-length or a part of a gene encoding a protein derived from human, mammal or plant is expressed in , the protein often becomes insoluble and makes it very difficult to prepare samples for structural\/functional analyses. In such cases, it is known that changing the region\/length to be expressed as a protein (this technique is called domain mapping or domainization) or introducing one or several site-specific mutations of amino acids improves the solubility dramatically. The same techniques are also used on a protein obtained as a soluble protein, in the process of preparing NMR samples for determination of its tertiary structure, or in the process of improving its solubility for crystallization or its crystallizing property. Among these processes, the process of obtaining many types of gene fragments in a short period of time and at low cost has become possible to achieve due to advances in PCR and reduced prices of synthesized PCR primers. Therefore, the current technical problems are human and time costs for preparing expression vectors, and methods for promptly discriminating whether the protein of interest is soluble or not. The advantage of using GST-fusion proteins for this purpose is that the following procedures are possible: after separating extract containing a GST-fusion protein into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation, the amount of the GST-fusion protein can be measured by calorimetric assay utilizing the enzyme activity of GST as an indicator in the mixture of and crude protein. For example, it is possible to colorimetrically determine the amount of the GST-fusion protein on 96-well plates in parallel and in a short period of time.","Considering what have been described above, the inventors have tried the following.","1. Trial generation of GST-T vector was carried out by the above-described method using \u201cSmaI\/Taq\u201d. Although a GST-T vector was obtained, it lacked reproducibility and its efficiency in PCR product sub-cloning was low. Thus, it was not practical.","2. Methods for improving the efficiency when SmaI\/Taq are used were obtained from documents on the internet and tested. However, no improvement was recognized.","3. The inventors considered that the nucleotide sequence of the blunt end digested by SmaI may be the reason for the low efficiency, and tested a unique improvement method in which the cohesive end generated by BamHI digestion was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment and then dT is attached with Taq. However, the efficiency was not improved.\n\n4. Strategy was changed to the above-described \u201cmethod of using a restriction enzyme cassette\u201d. As the restriction enzyme, AhdI was selected.\n\n5. It was found that when AhdI is reacted with antibiotic-resistant plasmids [not only pGEX-2T\/pGEX-4T3 (GST-fusion vectors)], the ampicillin resistance gene of the plasmids is cleaved. Then, the inventors modified pGEX-4T3 in which the AhdI restriction site contained in ampicillin resistance gene was mutated by introducing a silent, site-directed mutation. (The sequence of the primer (Anti AhdI) used for the site-directed mutagenesis is shown in SEQ ID NO: 21 of the sequence listing.)\n\n6. An AhdI-linker was prepared. Briefly, using PCR primers of SEQ ID NOS: 22 and 23 and a derivative pET32aPACAP from pET32a (Novagen) as a template, PCR was performed to thereby obtain an approximately 500 bp fragment. This fragment was integrated into an existing TA-vector (this time, pGEM-T from Promega was used) by conventional methods, followed by confirmation of the sequence and amplification of the appropriate clone. A purified plasmid was obtained. Then, the plasmid was digested with BamHI to thereby obtain AhdI linker (approx. 500 bp).\n\n7. A vector to be used as the base for GST-T vector (i.e., TA-vector using GST-fusion) was prepared. Briefly, the mutant of pGEX-4T3 obtained in paragraph 5 above was amplified and digested with BamHI. The AhdI linker obtained in paragraph 6 above was ligated into that BamHI site. Appropriately prepared clones were isolated and amplified. The AhdI linker at this stage has no orientation (the linker may be inserted in either direction).\n\n8. GST-T vector was prepared. Briefly, the vector prepared in paragraph 7 above was digested with AhdI to obtain an open circular plasmid, which was then separated and purified using agarose gel. Since the resultant vector has a 3\u2032-dT overhang, it may be used in conventional TA-cloning.\n\n9. An AhdI linker applicable to NcoI ORF selection was prepared. In NcoI ORF selection, those vectors (e.g., plasmids) having a foreign gene inserted in the opposite orientation are digested when treated with NcoI; and hosts harboring such vectors cannot grow. As a result, only those hosts harboring vectors having a foreign gene inserted in the proper orientation can be selected. The method of preparation of this linker is the same as described in paragraph 6 above except that a combination of SEQ ID NOS: 22 and 24 was used as primers. The sequences of the thus prepared AhdI linker applicable to NcoI ORF selection are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 26 and 27. A DNA strand having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 is associated with a DNA strand having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27 to form a double-stranded DNA that is the AhdI linker.\n\n10. dGST-T vector applicable to NcoI ORF selection (directional GST-T vector; this means a GST-T vector capable of selecting the orientation of ORF) was prepared. The method of preparation is the same as described in paragraphs 7 and 8 above. However, at the time of sequence confirmation as described in paragraph 7, those vectors in which the sequence corresponding to the primer sequence of SEQ ID NO: 22 at the fusion site with GST is located proximal to the coding region of GST (GST side) were selected to thereby obtain closed circular vectors to be used as the base for the vector capable of NcoI ORF selection. This closed circular vector was also capable of NdeI ORF selection when the design of PCR primers for amplifying the inserted foreign gene was changed; in NdeI ORF selection, vectors (e.g., plasmids) having a foreign gene inserted in the opposite orientation are digested not with NcoI but with NdeI; hosts harboring such vectors cannot grow; as a result, only those hosts harboring vectors having a foreign gene inserted in the proper orientation can be selected.\n","The present invention has been achieved based on the above-described experimental procedures and results.","The first invention of the present patent application provides a vector having two restriction recognition sequences different in nucleotide sequence which are recognized by a first restriction enzyme, wherein one of the restriction recognition sequences comprises a part of a restriction recognition sequence recognized by a second restriction enzyme that is different from the first restriction enzyme, and the other one of the first restriction recognition sequences does not comprise the part of the restriction recognition sequence recognized by the second restriction enzyme.","The first restriction enzyme may be a restriction enzyme that produces a 3\u2032-overhang in the digested DNA.

Preparation of Vectors","First, a vector is provided. For example, a commercial vector may be purchased and, when this vector has restriction recognition sequences recognized by a first and second restriction enzymes, mutations may be introduced into these restriction recognition sequences. When this vector is a fusion protein expression vector, it is convenient for the following reasons: it is easy to detect\/measure the expression level\/solubility of the protein and\/or protein domain of interest; it is easy to purify the protein and\/or protein domain of interest; and such a vector is advantageous in conducting biochemical experiments for functional analysis\/interaction analysis of the protein of interest. In Example 1 described later, mutation was introduced into pGEX-4T3 vector using a 5\u2032 phosphorylated DNA represented by SEQ ID NO: 21 by site-directed mutagenesis. As a result of this mutagenesis, the AhdI site which pGEX-4T3 originally had in its sequence becomes uncleavable.","Subsequently, a linker is provided which is used for introducing into the above vector two restriction recognition sequences which are different in nucleotide sequence but are both recognized by the first restriction enzyme (only one of these restriction sequences comprises a part of the restriction recognition sequence of the second restriction enzyme that is different from the first restriction enzyme). This linker is designed so that it has a restriction enzyme site at both ends for introduction into the multicloning site of the vector and has the two restriction recognition sequences which are different in nucleotide sequence but are both recognized by the first restriction enzyme (only one of these restriction sequences comprises a part of the restriction recognition sequence of the second restriction enzyme that is different from the first restriction enzyme). In Example 1 described later, PCR was performed using pET32aPACAP (a derivative from pET32a vector) as a template and a pair of primers represented by the sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 22 and 24. As a result, a PCR product with BamHI sites at both ends was obtained; to each of the BamHI sites, AhdI site was linked. This PCR product was subcloned into a TA-cloning vector pGEM-T. After confirmation of the sequence, the plasmid was prepared\/purified and then digested with restriction enzyme BamHI to thereby obtain an approx. 500 bp fragment (AhdI linker).","The above-described vector (mutation-introduced pGEX-4T3 vector in Example 1 described later) is linearized with a restriction enzyme (BamHI in Example 1 described later), dephosphorylated, ligated to the above-described linker (AhdI linker in Example 1 described later) and transformed into . Subsequently, plasmids are prepared\/purified from transformants derived from a plurality of single colonies. Their nucleotide sequences are confirmed to select those plasmids in which the linker was introduced in the proper orientation. The thus selected plasmids are treated with the first restriction enzyme (AhdI in Example 1 described later) to thereby obtain an open circular vector (pGEX-4T3-PRESAT in Example 1 described later).","2. Preparation of Foreign Genes","A foreign gene is prepared. This foreign gene comprises a sequence which is designed in such a manner that the restriction recognition sequence of the second restriction enzyme does not appear when this gene is inserted into the vector prepared in 1 above in the proper orientation, but the restriction recognition sequence of the second restriction enzyme occurs when this gene is inserted in the opposite orientation. The foreign gene may encode a protein and\/or a protein domain.","The foreign gene may be prepared, for example, by PCR. As a template, a cDNA, plasmid, synthetic DNA, RNA or the like comprising a gene of interest may be used. As primers, two oligonucleotides which are complementary to the DNA sequences at both terminals of the gene of interest may be used. These primers must be designed exactly in advance so that the following conditions are satisfied: for one of these primers, the reading frame of translation should not shift after insertion into the vector and, for the other one of these primers, a sequence of 1-10 bases not included in the gene of interest should be added at its 5\u2032 end.","The PCR reaction is usually performed by repeating 20 to 40 cycles, one cycle consisting of the three reactions of dissociation of two DNA strands, annealing with oligonucleotides, and synthesis of complementary strands by DNA polymerase. By using an enzyme having DNA reverse transcription activity in the first reaction, it is also possible to amplify DNA from RNA.","The nucleotide sequences of the primers are designed in such a manner that the restriction recognition sequence of the second restriction enzyme does not occur when the PCR product is inserted into the vector prepared in 1 above in the proper orientation, but the restriction recognition sequence of the second restriction enzyme occurs when the PCR product is inserted in the opposite orientation. In Example 2 described later, the front primer (primer corresponding to the N-terminal of the ORF of the cDNA) was designed in such a manner that (i) it starts with the first codon of any amino acid so that the reading frame coincides with that of the preceding GST and (ii) the 5\u2032-end nucleotides of this primer do not start with 5\u2032-GG. The rear primer (primer corresponding to the C-terminal of the ORF) was designed in such a manner that (i) a stop codon is contained after the boundary of the presumed C terminal region of the protein domain and (ii) the 5\u2032-end nucleotides of this primer start with 5\u2032-GG. As a result, the PCR product amplified with these primers has an NcoI site generated only when it has been ligated to pGEX-4T3-PRESAT in the opposite orientation. This newly generated NcoI site is used in the subsequent selection step.","Other matters to be attended to in designing PCR primers for amplifying DNA to be integrated into pGEX-4T3-PRESAT for recombinant protein production will be described below.","(1) When the First Restriction Enzyme is AhdI and the Second Restriction Enzyme is NcoI (NcoI Selection)","The primer corresponding to the N-terminal of the ORF may be designed according to the following four rules.","(ia) The first base of the primer sequence must correspond to the first base of an amino acid codon so that the reading frame coincides with the reading frame of the preceding GST.","(iia) The base at 5\u2032-end must be G or A. (If necessary, a DNA sequence encoding a small number of amino acids may be inserted.)","(iiia) 5\u2032-end sequence must not be GG.","(iva) NcoI restriction enzyme site must not be included in the PCR amplified fragment.","The primer corresponding to the C-terminal of the ORF may be designed according to the following two rules.","(va) 5\u2032-end sequence must be GG.","(via) When the protein domain of interest does not contain a stop codon, 5\u2032-end sequence must start with GG-Xn-TTA [where Xn may be any bases in a number of n (where n is an integer from 0 to 30); e.g., Xn may be A] (an example of sequence where n=5 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 53).\n\n(2) When the First Restriction Enzyme is AhdI and the Second Restriction Enzyme is NdeI (NdeI Selection)\n","The primer corresponding to the N-terminal of the ORF may be designed according to the following four rules.","(ib) The first base of the primer sequence must correspond to the first base of an amino acid codon so that the reading frame coincides with the reading frame of the preceding GST.","(iib) The base at 5\u2032-end must be G or A. (If necessary, a DNA sequence encoding a small number of amino acids may be inserted.)","(iiib) 5\u2032-end sequence must not be ATG.","(ivb) NdeI restriction enzyme site must not be included in the PCR amplified fragment.","The primer corresponding to the C-terminal of the ORF may be designed according to the following two rules.","(vb) 5\u2032-end sequence must be ATG.","(vib) When the protein domain of interest does not contain a stop codon, 5\u2032-end sequence must start with ATG-Xn-TTA [where Xn may be any bases in a number of n (where n is an integer from 0 to 30); e.g., Xn may be A] (an example of sequence where n=4 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 54).\n\n3. Cloning\n","The foreign gene prepared in 2 above is ligated to the vector prepared in 1 above (pGEX-4T3-PRESAT vector in Example 2 described later), which is then transformed into . The transformed is not inoculated into agar medium or allowed single colony formation. The transformant is cultured in liquid medium, from which a plasmid mixture is purified. When this plasmid mixture is treated with the second restriction enzyme (NcoI in Example 2 described later), those plasmids in which the foreign gene has been inserted into the vector in the opposite orientation are cut at the newly generated restriction site of the second restriction enzyme and linearized. On the other hand, those plasmids in which the foreign gene has been inserted into the vector in the proper orientation remain unlinearized. Therefore, when the plasmid mixture treated with the second restriction enzyme is transformed into an host for expression and the resultant transformant is spread on agar medium, only those cells which harbor a plasmid where the foreign gene has been inserted into the vector in the proper orientation form colonies. From each of the single colonies formed on the agar-medium, is collected, cultured and allowed to express a fusion protein. Those cells which have completed expression are harvested and disrupted by sonication or the like to thereby prepare a total cell lysate fraction. Further, the total cell lysate fraction is centrifuged to obtain the supernatant as a soluble fraction. The precipitate is dissolved completely with an SDS-containing buffer of the same volume as that of the solubilized fraction, to thereby prepare an insoluble fraction. The total cell lysate fraction alone or each of the total cell lysate fraction, soluble fraction and insoluble fraction is analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by confirmation of the band of the protein of interest on the gel. Subsequently, a ratio between the soluble fraction and the insoluble fraction is determined from the thickness of the bands of the fusion protein on the gel. This ratio is used as an indicator for the solubility of the fusion protein of interest (solubility test). It will be still better to quantitatively determine protein bands on the gel using densitometry or the like.","Solubility tests using the enzyme activity of GST are performed based on the method described in the Amersham Pharmacia's manual for handling pGEX series vectors. Briefly, soluble fraction containing the fusion protein of interest diluted in an appropriate buffer is placed in a cuvette in a UV spectrophotometer. After 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and reduced glutathione are added thereto and agitated thoroughly, time course of UV absorbance at 340 nm is measured consecutively up to 5 to 10 minutes. The resultant slope is used as an indicator for the amount of the fusion protein of interest. When a large number of samples are handled in parallel, use of a microplate reader is convenient.","After the above-described operations, clones which are good in the expression level and solubility of the fusion protein of interest are selected. Then, plasmids are purified and their nucleotide sequences are determined. A plasmid comprising the foreign gene of interest is employed as an expression vector for the protein and\/or protein domain, and used in subsequent mass production experiments. According to this method, it has become possible to reduce the time period required for preparing an expression vector for a protein and\/or protein domain of interest by about 30% compared to the conventional method.","4. Mass Production of Proteins and\/or Protein Domains","The protein and\/or protein domain expression vector employed in 3 above is transformed into an host for expression. The resultant transformant is cultured and allowed to express the protein and\/or protein domain of interest. When the protein and\/or protein domain expression vector is a fusion protein expression vector, it is convenient for the following reasons: it is easy to detect\/measure the expression level\/solubility of the protein and\/or protein domain of interest (e.g., detection by means of fluorescence, calorimetric assay using the enzyme activity of GST as an indicator, etc.); it is easy to purify the protein and\/or protein domain of interest (e.g., one step purification using GSH-immobilized beads is possible); and such a vector is advantageous in conducting biochemical experiments for functional analysis\/interaction analysis of the protein of interest (e.g., in vitro binding experiment using BIACORE, in vitro binding experiments using pull down assay, etc.).","Isolation and purification of the expressed protein and\/or protein domain may be performed by known methods. Known methods of isolation and purification include, but are not limited to, methods using solubility (such as salting out and solvent precipitation); methods using difference in molecular weight (such as dialysis, ultra-filtration, gel filtration, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis); methods using difference in electric charge (such as ion exchange chromatography); methods using specific affinity (such as affinity chromatography); methods using difference in hydrophobicity (such as reversed phase HPLC and hydrophobic chromatography); and methods using difference in isoelectric point (such as isoelectric focusing).","The present invention has been described so far using as a host. However, the host used in the present invention is not limited to . Examples of hosts which may be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells (e.g., ), fungal cells (e.g., budding yeast, fission yeast, ), insect cells (e.g., S2 cells, Sf cells), animal cells (e.g., CHO cells, COS cells, HeLa cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells, BHK cells, HEK293 cells) and plant cells.","The first restriction enzyme, second restriction enzyme, two restriction recognition sequences different in nucleotide sequence which are recognized by the first restriction enzyme (one comprising a part of the restriction recognition sequence recognized by the second restriction enzyme, and the other not comprising that part) and pair of PCR primers for preparing a foreign gene used in the present invention are not limited to those described above.

the first restriction enzyme is AhdI or an isoschizomer thereof, XcmI or an isoschizomer thereof, or a combination thereof, it is effective to select NcoI, NdeI or an isoschizomer thereof as the second restriction enzyme.","By using the vector of the present invention, it is possible to construct a library which is capable of expressing, as fusion proteins, partial sequences of a protein of interest different in location and\/or length in the original protein. For example, a primer mixture is designed and used to amplify partial sequences of a protein of interest using the cDNA of the protein as a template; then, the resultant mixture of DNA fragments encoding partial sequences of the protein are ligated downstream of another protein (for example, see ).","Further, by using the vector of the present invention, it becomes possible to create a great number of protein and\/or protein domain expression systems in parallel, for example, in 96-well microtiter plates, and to assay the solubility of the proteins and\/or protein domains produced by such expression systems in parallel or select only those proteins and\/or protein domains with high solubility at high speed (for example, see ).","Further, the above-described method using the vector of the present invention and 96-well microtiter plates is capable of creating a great number of protein and\/or protein domain expression systems in parallel and also conducting fully automated high-throughput selection of highly soluble proteins and\/or protein domains produced, by applying automated colony isolation equipment, automated reagent dispensing\/washing equipment capable of handling 96-well microtiter plates or laboratory automation equipment.","Further, by using the vector of the present invention, it becomes possible to judge whether or not a fusion protein comprising a specific single protein and\/or protein domain of interest is capable of expression in , or whether or not the fusion protein is soluble, in 48 hours from the start of PCR reaction at the shortest (for example, see ).","Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described specifically with reference to the following Examples. It should be noted that these Examples are provided only for the purpose of explanation and do not limit the scope of the present invention.","Restriction enzymes NcoI, NdeI, AhdI and AflII were purchased from New England Biolabs. Restriction enzymes KpnI and BamHI were purchased from Toyobo. T4 DNA ligase, Wizard plasmid miniprepkit and Wizard SV DNA gel purification kit were purchased from Promega. pGEM-T, pGEX-4T3 and pGEX-3X; pET32a; and pET21b were purchased from Promega, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Novagen, respectively. pET32aPACAP is a pET32a derivative prepared by inserting pET32a-derived thioredoxin gene-containing NdeI fragment into the NdeI site of pET21b and inserting PACAP artificial gene into the NheI site of the same pET21b. As cDNAs to be used as templates for PCR cloning, QUICK-Clone cDNAs of mouse spleen, mouse embryo and human HeLa cells were purchased from Clontech.","Mutation was introduced into pGEX-4T3 vector using a 5\u2032 phosphorylated DNA represented by the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21 by site-directed mutagenesis. As a result of this mutagenesis, the AhdI restriction enzyme site which pGEX-4T3 originally had in its sequence becomes uncleavable. Subsequently, PCR reaction was performed using pET32aPACAP vector as a template and a pair of primers represented by the sequences of SED ID NOS: 22 and 24. The resultant PCR product (approx. 500 bp, the sequence of one of the two DNA strands is shown in SEQ ID NO: 25) had an AhdI site linked to each of the two BamHI sites (). This PCR product was subcloned into a TA cloning vector pTEM-T. After confirmation of the sequence, the plasmid was purified. The purified plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme BamHI, followed by purification of an approx. 500 bp fragment (AhdI linker, SEQ ID NOS: 26 and 27). The mutation introduced pGEX-4T3 described above was linearized with BamHI, dephosphorylated and ligated to the above-described AhdI linker. The resultant plasmid was transformed into . After confirmation of the sequence, those transformants in which AhdI linker was introduced downstream of GST gene in the proper orientation were selected. Approximately 2 \u03bcg of the vector into which AhdI linker was introduced downstream of GST gene in the proper orientation was treated with 25 units of AhdI restriction enzyme at 37\u00b0 C. for 3 hours for digestion, followed by purification using 1% agarose gel. Using Wizard SV gel\/PCR clean-up system, an open circular vector of approx. 5 kb (pGEX-4T3-PRERSAT; ) was purified and used in the following Examples.","First, using primers appropriate for NcoI selection, five types of genes [regions comprising five MIT domains of SNX15a (human and mouse) and Vps4b (yeast, mouse and human); SEQ ID NOS: 28, 30, 32, 34 and 36] were amplified simultaneously and in parallel by PCR using appropriate cDNAs as templates. The primers used (SEQ ID NOS: 38-47) were appropriately designed so that they comprise a sequence complementary to a specific region of the cDNA of the relevant gene to be expressed as a protein, a complementary sequence to the stop codon, and GG residues at 5\u2032-end to perform NcoI selection. Briefly, front primers must start with the first amino acid codon so that the reading frame coincides with that of the preceding GST, and the 5\u2032-end nucleotides of front primers must not start with 5\u2032-GG. Rear primers must contain a stop codon after the boundary of the presumed C terminal region of the relevant domain, and the 5\u2032-end nucleotides of rear primers must start with 5\u2032-GG. As a result, the PCR product amplified with these primers has an NcoI site (a site for the second restriction enzyme) generated only when it has been ligated to pGEX-4T3-PRESAT in the opposite orientation. This newly generated NcoI site is used in the subsequent selection step.","Any of the above-described genes is a 200-230 bp cDNA corresponding to a novel protein domain and encodes about 70 amino acid residues.","PCR amplification of a gene of interest was confirmed by electrophoresis. Then, the PCR product was ligated unpurified to pGEX-4T3-PRESAT vector, which was transformed into DH5a. The transformed DH5a was liquid cultured overnight without formation of single colonies. Next day, 1-3 \u03bcg of plasmid was purified from the resultant culture. This plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme NcoI and transformed into an expression host BL21 (DE3), which was then allowed to form single colonies. From the plates carrying single colonies, 3 single colonies for each of the genes were picked (3\u00d75=15) and liquid cultured in LB medium. When OD reached about 0.5, IPTG was added to give a final concentration of 1 mM, and cells were cultured for another 4 hours. cells after completion of expression were harvested and sonicated. Then, the total cell was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by confirmation of the band of the protein of interest (approx. 33-35 kD) on the gel () (expression test). Of those colonies obtained, more than 90% of them (14\/15) expressed a relevant fusion protein of interest with a predicted molecular weight, showing an extremely high efficiency.","Subsequently, disrupted cells derived from those colonies in which the expression of a fusion protein of interest with a predicted molecular weight had been confirmed were separated into solubilized fraction and insolubilized fraction by centrifugation. These two fractions and the total cell fraction were separately analyzed by SDS-PAGE to examine whether the fusion protein of interest was soluble or not () (solubility test).","Also, GST activity measuring solution containing a mixture of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and glutathione was added to aliquots of solubilized fractions of proteins derived from those colonies in which expression of fusion proteins with predicted molecular weights had been confirmed to thereby start a reaction by GST, and determined the initial rate of the reaction by measuring the increase in UV absorbance at 350 nm with a spectrophotometer () (CDNB assay). It was confirmed that the slopes of the straight lines in the graph are almost in proportion to the amount of relevant fusion protein of interest in the solubilized fraction, and thus it was found possible to carry out a semi-quantitative solubility test with a spectrophotometer.","Independently from the above test, the inventors picked 8 colonies from each plate, performing colony PCR and examined the ratio of plasmids from each clone comprising a gene of interest (i.e., efficiency of subcloning). As a result, it was confirmed that a gene with a correct length predicted from the target gene was integrated at the probability of 37\/40 (92.5%).","Two clones were selected from those which were expressing a protein of a correct length, followed by determination and confirmation of the DNA sequences of the plasmids. It was confirmed that the sequences were completely correct and that they were in frame with GST.","The time period required for the entire process of the above operations was about 6 days, showing a significant reduction.","Comparative experiments were conducted to examine whether there would be any difference in efficiency between NcoI selection and NdeI selection in the preparation of expression systems for GST fusion proteins linked to protein fragments containing ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM).","A pair of primers for NcoI selection (SEQ ID NOS: 48 and 45) and a pair of primers for NdeI selection (SEQ ID NOS: 48 and 50) were used to amplify by PCR an approx. 200 bp fragment (the sequence of the coding strand is shown in SEQ ID NO: 51) of human Hrs gene comprising UIM sequence from human cDNA. The primers used were appropriately designed so that they comprise a sequence complementary to the cDNA of the relevant gene, a complementary sequence to the stop codon, and GG residues at 5\u2032-end to perform NcoI selection. The primers for NdeI selection were appropriately designed in advance so that they comprise a complementary sequence to the stop codon and ATG residues at 5\u2032-end. The above-described fragment is a 200 bp cDNA corresponding to a novel protein domain and encodes about 70 amino acid residues.","PCR amplification of the fragment was confirmed by electrophoresis. Then, the PCR product was ligated unpurified to dGST-T vector, which was transformed into .DH5a. The transformed DH5a was liquid cultured overnight without formation of single colonies. Next day, 1-3 \u03bcg of plasmid was purified from the resultant culture. This plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme NcoI or NdeI and transformed into an expression host BL21 (DE3), which was then allowed to form single colonies. Reaction conditions were as follows: 10 units of NcoI or 20 units of NdeI was used per 200 ng of plasmid, at 37\u00b0 C., for 1 hour for both restriction enzymes. From the plates carrying single colonies, 3 single colonies for each were picked (3\u00d75=15) and liquid cultured in LB medium. When OD reached about 0.5, IPTG was added to give a final concentration of 1 mM, and cells were cultured for another 4 hours (expression experiment). cells after completion of expression were harvested and sonicated. Then, the total cell, solubilized fraction and insolubilized fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by confirmation of the band of the fusion protein of interest (approx. 31 kD) on the gel. In the thus obtained colonies, the ratios of those colonies which expressed a fusion protein of interest with a predicted molecular weight were 14\/15 when NcoI selection was used and 3\/3 when NdeI selection was used, respectively. In both cases, the ratio was more than about 90% more than (14\/15), showing extremely high efficiency.","Independently from the above experiment, the inventors picked several colonies from each plate, performing colony PCR and examined the ratio of plasmids in each clone comprising a gene of interest (i.e., efficiency of subcloning). As a result, it was confirmed that a gene with a correct length predicted from the target gene was integrated at the probability of 9\/10 (90.0%) when NcoI selection was used and at the probability of 7\/8 (88%) when NdeI selection was used; thus, the efficiency was almost equal.","From these experiments, it was found that both NcoI and NdeI may be used for the selection of ORF orientation.","Using approx. 0.2 \u03bcg of mixture of the open circular vector prepared in Example 2 (which had human Vps4b gene integrated thereinto and underwent ORF selection by NcoI treatment), conditions for performing in a short period of time expression test and solubility test on the GST-Vps4 fusion protein (a gene of which was believed to have been constructed in that vector) were determined.","Briefly, approx. 0.2 \u03bcg of the pGEX-4T3-PRESAT comprising human Vsp4b gene and already linearized by NcoI treatment as described in Example 2 was transformed into an expression host BL21 (DE3), which was then allowed to form colonies on LB plate medium at 37\u00b0 C. over 14 hours. Onto this plate, 200 \u03bcl of 0.1 M IPTG solution was sprayed. Colonies were grown further at 37\u00b0 C. for 3 hours to thereby allow protein expression on the plate. To the colonies on the plate, 180 \u03bcl of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.0)(hereinafter, called TBS buffer) was added to prepare suspension. The cells were sonicated to prepare the total cell fraction, solubilized fraction and insolubilized fraction, followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE in the same manner as in Example 2 (). The time required from the suspending of to analysis by SDS-PAGE was about 3 hours.","Like in Example 2, the band of the fusion protein of interest with a molecular weight of approx. 32 kDa was also confirmed in this method. It was revealed that the expression level and solubility of this protein were sufficient for subsequent experiments.","In this experiment, comprising a gene of the fusion protein of interest was subjected to expression test and solubility test as it was (i.e., as a mixture) without the step of single colony formation. However, as shown in Example 2, when ORF selection with NcoI has been performed, cells not comprising the gene of the fusion protein of interest are less than 10% of the cells forming colonies on the plate medium. Thus, it was found possible to judge the expression level and solubility by expression test and solubility test using electrophoresis.","The time period required for the entire process of the above operations is about 21 hours, showing a significant reduction. The time period required for the preceding steps from PCR to ORF selection with NcoI is 27 hours at the minimum. Thus, it was revealed that the entire process for constructing single protein and\/or protein domain expression systems and performing solubility test can be done in 48 hours at the minimum.","The
