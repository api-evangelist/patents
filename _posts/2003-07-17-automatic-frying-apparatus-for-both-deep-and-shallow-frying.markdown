title: Automatic frying apparatus for both deep and shallow frying
abstract: An automatic frying apparatus () for both deep and shallow frying. Frying apparatus () comprises a container () having an inner cylindrical wall () installed on the central bottom thereof, so as to emanate from the bottom to substantially the upper portion of container () for holding foods and oil, a lid () covering on top of container (), a plurality of stirring blades () rotatably and removably installed inside container () for stirring foods, a power-drive assembly () operationally coupled with blades () for driving blades () through repeating stirring cycles, a coupling device () for coupling in between assembly () and blades (), a venting device () for filtering and deodorizing cooking fumes, and a blowing device () for forcing fresh air into frying apparatus () for moisture removal from thereinside. Blades () sweep across food pieces intermittently, such that blades () dwell for a predetermined dwell period starting near the end of each stirring cycle. This intermittent operation favors better agitation of food pieces and affords relief from constant stirring of food pieces at a higher speed. Food pieces are partially immersed in the boiling oil, and therefore, less oil is required for frying foods, thereby, causing less energy consumption, less fat absorption by the food, less time for cooking, and less used oil for disposal. The frying process is fully automatic and requires minimal human involvement and chore.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention generally relates to cooking\/food processing apparatuses. More specifically, this invention relates to automatic frying apparatuses for both deep and shallow frying.","Fried foods, such as fried shrimp, fried fish, fried chicken, etc., are tasteful. Two of the most important characteristics of fried foods are: outside, golden and crispy; and inside, juicy and tender. There are some issues associated with preparing fried foods at home.","First, the contact of moisture-containing raw foods with hot oil produces grease splattering. Most times, the splattering liquids and food particles reach out of frying apparatuses to considerable distances. These will not only mess up stovetops and surrounding surfaces but also create undue oil burn injuries to the people who are preparing fried foods. The problem of grease fires in the kitchen as well as severe oil burns to people has been well documented.","Second, oil vapor is produced when oil is heated. The people who are preparing fried foods involuntarily inhale considerable amount of cooking fumes during the cooking process. Oil vapor is harmful to human health and might pose long-term health threats to the people who expose themselves to oil vapor on a very regular base.","Third, the oil vapor generated in the cooking process might easily reach much farther in the kitchen or even other rooms and deposit on the furniture, paintings, electrical appliances, etc., causing long-term hazards to home environment.","Fourth, on the other hand, there is an ever-increasing concern over the amount of oil or fat in one's diet for general public. In particular, a low fat diet is desirable in light of related health concerns. Generally, fried foods prepared using conventional methods and cooking wares contain more fat than other foods.","Many products of deep-frying apparatuses or food processing apparatuses are on the market, including the electric frying apparatus taught by U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,878, issued to Lau, on Apr. 2, 2002. These products are equipped with vertically moving baskets and generally require the food to be immersed deep in the frying oil; which means that large quantity of oil is required. The high quantity of oil needed for proper cooking also means high operating cost due to high energy consumption and longer time for cooking. The quantity of oil absorption by the food is prohibitively high, as well.","The disposal of used oil is going to be an environmental issue. Food processing businesses and restaurants might be able to afford expensive equipment for the disposal or treatment of used oil. But general public will find it difficult in dealing with large quantity of used oil.","Another issue is that the user has to repeatedly stir or turn the food around to separate the food pieces during frying, such that the food can be cooked more uniformly.","Over years, various devices have been developed to address these problems associated with frying at home.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/249,240, filed by myself, on Mar. 25, 2003, teaches a forced venting fry utensil. The fry utensil comprises a container for holding foods and oil, a lid covering on top of the container, a blowing device for forcing fresh air into the fry utensil for facilitating the evaporation of food moisture, and a venting device for filtering and deodorizing cooking fumes.","The aforementioned prior art is concentrating on the issue of splattering of hot grease and food particles and cooking fume treatment. However, It fails to address the necessity of automating frying processes. Without frying process automation, especially at home, consumers have to stir the food or turn the food over in the middle of frying processes. In this case, the generation of hot oil splattering and the escape of oil vapor into the room are still inevitable.","Some patents have been granted in the area of automatic frying apparatuses.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,027,697, issued to De Longhi, on Jul. 2, 1991, teaches a rotating oblique basket fryer for cyclic immersion cooking; which facilitates the elimination of moisture in the food, accelerates the heat exchange process, and favors uniform operating temperatures.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,166, issued to Masel, et al., on Aug. 6, 1996, describes a cooking appliance including a drum for receiving the food articles to be cooked. The appliance is characterized in that the finished food is spun about a central axis to spin out unwanted excess of oil.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,265, issued to Ronci et al., on Mar. 18, 1997, describes a combination of fryer and charbroiler food cooking apparatus. The excessive oil is separated from the fried foods using centrifugal means.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,453,801, issued to Masel, et al., on Sep. 24, 2002, teaches a cooking appliance and method for cooking food articles by means of a rotary drum. The appliance is characterized in that a liquid container is selectively movable to a raised or lowered position to adjust the oil level with respect to the food articles.","The aforementioned prior arts are concentrating on automatic frying apparatuses with special emphasis on low fat frying. The low fat characteristic is mostly achieved by mechanical means, e.g., centrifugal means. This makes the prior art apparatuses less appealing because mechanical separation devices generally require a large size of the frying apparatus. The manufacturing cost is higher and consequently the higher prices the general public pays to buy these apparatuses. Another reason why these prior art apparatuses do not prevail lies on the fact that the mechanisms for achieving targeted objectives are, to some extent, too complicated, which, again, drives up the manufacturing cost. The effort spent on cleaning these apparatuses after use is another important factor. In addition, they fail to address the issue of cooking fume hazards and moisture removal from inside the frying apparatus.","Low fat frying can be, alternatively, achieved by means of how the food is processed. The key point is that the moisture content residing in the raw food, especially in the surfaces of food pieces, has to be removed as quickly as possible. The removal of the surface moisture content greatly favors less fat absorption, less time for frying, less energy consumption, and foods of great looking, taste, and texture.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/249,399, filed by myself, on Apr. 5, 2003, teaches an automatic frying apparatus having a perforated rotary drum for holding and frying foods removably installed inside a container, and a forced venting system for forcing fresh air into the frying apparatus for facilitating food moisture evaporation and cooking fume treatment. The frying apparatus overcomes all the shortcomings of prior art products.","However, all the prior arts, including the one proposed by myself in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/249,399, have a very important drawback; they are specifically addressing the issues associated with deep-frying. These prior art products cannot be used for shallow frying, in another word, stir-frying, which is a widely used food preparing\/processing method, especially in oriental cuisine. Shallow frying requires constant stirring. Therefore, grease splattering and oil vapor hazards are among the most important issues to deal with. On the other hand, shallow frying requires much more human effort, whereby automation is highly desired.","Therefore, it remains desirable to provide frying apparatuses that can be used for both deep and shallow frying, that are automatic to minimize the human involvement or chore during the frying process, that favors homogeneous heating of foods, that require minimal quantity of oil for frying foods, that can effectively and efficiently evaporate the surface moisture content of food pieces to achieve the characteristic of low fat absorption and great looking, taste, and texture of foods, that are inexpensive to manufacture and simple and easy to use, and also that are environment, people, and home friendly.","Accordingly, the present invention is an automatic frying apparatus for both deep and shallow frying. This frying apparatus comprises a container having an open top for holding foods and oil, a lid covering on top of the container for closing up the open top, a plurality of stirring blades rotatably and removably installed inside the container, on the central bottom, a power-drive assembly operationally coupled with these stirring blades for driving these stirring blades through repeating stirring cycles for facilitating homogeneous heating, a blowing device for forcing fresh air into the frying apparatus for facilitating evaporation of moisture content residing in the surfaces of food pieces, and a venting device for filtering and deodorizing cooking fumes.","These stirring blades sweep across food pieces in an intermittent operation, in which they dwell for a predetermined dwell period near the end of each stirring cycle. This intermittent operation affords relief from constant stirring of food pieces at a higher speed, thereby favoring foods of great texture and looking. Food pieces are partially immersed in the boiling oil, and therefore, less oil is required for frying. Cooking fumes are treated right before leaving the frying apparatus, whereby, this fry apparatus of the present invention is people and home environment friendly.","Accordingly, the followings are some of the objects, features, and advantages of the present invention:","It is an object of the present invention to provide a frying apparatus for use to prepare tasteful fried foods for both deep and shallow frying.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a frying apparatus that is automatic in separating, stirring, and turning over food pieces for facilitating moisture evaporation and uniform heating, so as to minimize the human involvement or chore during the frying process.","It is a further more object of the present invention to provide a frying apparatus that is environment, people, and home friendly.","It is a still further more object of the present invention to provide a frying apparatus that requires minimal quantity of oil for frying foods, and consequently causes less energy consumption, less used oil for disposal, and less time for cooking.","It is a still further more object of the present invention to provide a frying apparatus that is of durable and reliable constructions, easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed, and at the same time economically available to the general public.","It is a feature of the present invention that this frying apparatus has a plurality of stirring blades rotatably and removably installed on the central bottom of the container for stirring foods. These blades sweep across food pieces in an intermittent operation, in which they dwell for a predetermined interval of time near the end of each sweeping cycle and then automatically begin another cycle of operation. This intermittent operation affords relief from constant stirring of food pieces at a higher speed, thereby favoring foods of great texture and looking.","It is another feature of the present invention that this frying apparatus has a forced venting system including a blowing device to force fresh air into the frying apparatus for facilitating moisture removal from thereinside and a venting device for removing the oil vapor content in the grease-laden air generated during the frying process before the air is exhausted into the room.","It is a further more feature of the present invention that the food to be fried is partially immersed in the boiling oil, thereby reducing the requirement on the quantity of oil for proper frying, and consequently this frying apparatus of the present invention consumes less energy and takes less time for cooking.","It is a still further more feature of the present invention that this frying apparatus fries foods in a programmed automatic manner; therefore, minimal human involvement or chore is rendered.","It is an advantage of the present invention that this frying apparatus is virtually hand-free for frying foods and can be used for both deep and shallow frying.","It is another advantage of the present invention that this frying apparatus is environment, people, and home friendly.","It is a further more advantage of the present invention that this frying apparatus is easy to operate, cheap to manufacture, and providing large value to businesses and general public.","Further more features and advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated, as the same becomes better understood after reading the subsequent description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Reference is made to , which illustrates a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of the present invention, a frying apparatus . Frying apparatus  comprises a container , a lid , a coupling device , a plurality of stirring blades, generally designated as , a power-drive assembly , a venting device , and a blowing device .","Container , having an open top, an outer wall , and an upstanding inner cylindrical wall , is provided for holding foods and oil. Cylindrical wall is installed on the central bottom of container , so as to emanate from the bottom thereof upward to substantially the open top, forming a central aperture therein. Container  is, preferably, coated with a non-stick material.","A plurality of co-rotation preventing blades, generally designated as , is installed inside container , on outer wall , for preventing the food from co-rotating with stirring blades , as blades  rotate. Blades , disposed on positions slightly higher than blades , generally extend vertically. The size of blades  can be substantially different based on specific designs of container .","A heating element , installed on the outside surface of the bottom of container , is provided for heating foods and oil disposed inside container . Heating element  is in a heat-transferable condition, e.g., in physical contact, with the bottom of container , such that when heating element  heats up upon connection with an electricity source, foods and oil therein will also heat up. Heating element  can be electrical resistance type heaters or many other types, such as high-intensity infrared lamps, as known to those skilled in the art and suggested by this invention disclosure.","A container support , installed on the bottom and side of container , is provided for furnishing a bottom support for container , such that frying apparatus  can stand on a flat surface, e.g., a kitchen counter top. Another function of support  is insulating the bottom of container . The sidewall of support  can extend upward, covering substantially large area of outer wall of container  for minimizing heating energy loss. In this case, support  serves as an outer housing.","A temperature sensor  is provided for measuring the temperature of the frying oil, as an input variable to be controlled. Sensor  is installed at an appropriate position on the bottom of container , or any other suitable positions. When the temperature of the frying oil is above the user's desired one, the electrical power to heating element  will be shut down to better meet the user's desired frying requirement and to save energy.","Lid  is provided for covering on top of container  for closing up the open top thereof. Lid  can be made of a transparent material, or a metal material but has an observation window (not shown), made of a transparent material, for observing the frying process by the user.","An opening is provided on lid , disposed at a suitable location, for adding ingredients to the food inside container  by the user in the middle of frying processes. A cap is provided for covering up opening ",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00066","num":"00066"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106","106","106","120","110","108","106","106","102","102","106","108","106","106","120","122","122","120","120","106","106","102","102","106","120","106"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b ","b ","a ","b ","c","c","a ","b ","b ","b","b"]},"Blades , rotatably and removably installed inside container  on the central bottom thereof, are provided for stirring foods. There is a central aperture on blades  to permit threading over cylindrical wall ","A stirring blade spacer , fixedly installed on the central bottom of container  around the bottom portion of wall , is provided for supporting blades .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00069","num":"00069"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["108","102","108","102","108","108","102"],"i":["a","b","a "]},"However, when the clearance is small, it is inevitable that blades  will scrape on the bottom of container , causing worn-out of blades  and energy loss due to friction of large area. To deal with this dilemma, a plurality of circular protrusions, generally designated as , fixedly installed on the bottom of container , is proposed in this invention disclosure. Reference is made to  for the configuration of protrusions . Protrusions provide further support to blades , in addition to spacer , which is more clearly shown in  predetermined small width of protrusions is desired for providing adequate support and, at the same time, minimizing friction. In the case for a container coated with a non-stick material, the top surface of protrusions is, preferably, not coated. Local areas on blades , which are in the vicinity of protrusions , can have a different material for durability consideration. The height of protrusions is, preferably, small, e.g., less than 1 mm, for ideal performance of blades  in scooping up food pieces and avoiding sticking. Protrusions can readily have many other configurations, or pattens.","The speed, at which blades  sweep across food pieces, is important. For too low speeds, blades  cannot scoop up food pieces and therefore food pieces cannot be agitated adequately to achieve the desired effect of homogeneous heating and the evaporation of food moisture. Co-rotation of food pieces with blades , as blades  rotate, is going to be a big issue. Therefore, a higher speed is desirable for good performance. But, on the other hand, for continuous operation of blade sweeping, when the speed is high, food pieces are agitated too much, for too long time, such that the crispy surfaces of food pieces are damaged, which, in turns, causes frying oil to be wasted due to too many tiny food particles in the oil. In addition, the worn-out of blades  and energy loss due to friction between blades  and the bottom of container  are going to be serious problems.","To solve this dilemma, an intermittent operation of blade sweeping is proposed in this invention disclosure. In this intermittent operation, blades  dwell for a predetermined interval of time after one or two rounds of sweeping, referred as one stirring cycle, and then automatically begin another cycle of operation. This intermittent operation affords relief from constant stirring of food pieces at a higher speed, prolongs the life of blades  and power-drive assembly , and saves some energy required for driving blades , as compared with the continuous operation. This intermittent operation also favors foods of great texture because during the dwell period, the food pieces have adequate time to form crispy surfaces; which, in turns, favors foods of great looking. A computer control method and an electronic control circuit for achieving this intermittent operation are going to be disclosed later on, when the control portion of frying apparatus  is discussed.","Reference is, again, made to FIG. . Power-drive assembly  includes a drive motor  and main shaft .","A motor housing , having an open top, is provided for housing motor . Motor housing  is installed on the central bottom of support . A cap  is provided for covering on top of motor housing  for closing up the open top thereof. There is a central aperture on cap  for permitting main shaft  to thread therethrough.","Motor  is installed inside motor housing  through a bracket  and is operationally connected to a DC adapter .","Main shaft  is operationally coupled with motor , directly for a low-speed motor or via some gears or belt-pulley devices for a high-speed motor. Main shaft  is substantially co-axial to cylindrical wall and threads therein, so as to emanate from the bottom of container  to substantially the upper portion of wall ","Reference is made to , again. On the upper portion of main shaft , coupling pin  is provided for the engagement with coupling element of coupling device . Pin  has a predetermined length so as to conveniently slide in the opening on the lower portion of cylindrical wall for removably locking on coupling element ","A plurality of main shaft supporting elements, generally designated as , installed on the upper portion of main shaft , is provided for further supporting main shaft , against cylindrical wall . Elements  have a ring-like configuration and are slidably threaded inside cylindrical wall , together with main shaft . The clearance between elements  and cylindrical wall is minimized for ideal performance. Bearings are ideal options for elements  for minimizing power loss due to friction.","Reference is, now, made to FIG.  and , which illustrate an embodiment of a forced venting system including a venting device  and a blowing device  of FIG. .","Venting device  includes a venting conduit  and a venting filter . The first end of venting conduit  is mounted on lid . There is an opening on lid  inline with venting conduit  for allowing cooking fumes to be forced out therethrough. Venting conduit  also serves as a bracket for holding venting filter . Venting filter  is removably engaged with the second end of venting conduit . Venting filter  further includes a disposable paper filter and\/or a disposable activated charcoal filter , together, as an integrated filter.","Venting filter  is provided to trap the grease impurities in the grease-laden air forced out from inside frying apparatus . Venting filter  is, preferably, made of one or multiple layers of metal meshes, such as aluminum ones. Metal meshes have different sizes of meshes and overlap each other. When cooking fumes pass therethrough, the oil particles will be trapped thereon. Filters and are provided to further remove the remaining oil vapor and chemical contents in the cooking fumes and for removing the cooking fume odors before the air is exhausted into the room.","Blowing device  includes an in-take conduit , a blowing motor , a fan , and a one-way valve .","The first end of in-take conduit  is mounted on the upper portion of container . There is an opening on the sidewall of container  inline with in-take conduit  for allowing fresh air to be forced into frying apparatus . There is an aperture  on in-take conduit . Aperture  functions as an air inlet. An inlet conduit extends from aperture  to the outside space, such that fresh air from outside atmosphere can be readily drawn into frying apparatus . A filter , made from metal meshes, is provided for preventing some large particles from being drawn therein. In-take conduit  also serves as a bracket for holding motor  in position. Motor  is removably coupled with the second end of in-take conduit . Fan  is connected to motor  on the shaft and inserted inside in-take conduit . Motor  is operationally connected to adapter , which is shown in FIG. .","As shown in , which illustrates an exploded cross-sectional view of one-way valve  of FIG. . Valve  includes a valve housing , a valve body , a covering piece , and a biasing spring . Valve housing  is engaged with the first end of in-take conduit . There are apertures on valve housing  for allowing air to pass therethrough. Valve body  is engaged with the open end of valve housing . There are apertures on valve body  for allowing air to pass therethrough. Covering piece  covers on valve body  for closing and opening valve . There is a central protrusion on covering piece . The central protrusion is slidably inserted into a central aperture on valve body , such that the protrusion can slide along the central aperture for a predetermined distance. Spring  is attached between the protruding end of the protrusion and valve housing , such that spring  is biased in slight tension, thereby, pulling covering piece  toward\/against valve body  for closing up valve .","When blowing device  is in working condition, the air pressure generated by fan  forces covering piece  to slide away from valve body , such that valve  is in opening state for allowing air to pass therethrough. Valve  is provided for preventing cooking fumes inside frying apparatus  from escaping through blowing device  while blowing device  is temporarily not in working condition.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate in view of this invention disclosure that many other suitable valve designs are readily applicable for this application of the present invention.","Venting device  and blowing device  can be alternatively installed on frying apparatus  at many other positions. For example, venting device  can be alternatively installed on the upper portion of container  and blowing device  can be alternatively mounted on lid . These variations are, therefore, covered by this invention disclosure.","Venting device  is provided for cooking fume treatment. Compared with prior art products, which allow cooking fumes to escape freely, this centralized venting system design vents cooking fumes in a controlled manner, such that heating energy is better preserved for a more efficient frying apparatus.","Blowing device  is provided for forcing moisture content out of frying apparatus , especially at the early stage of a frying process, such that frying apparatus  can fry foods of great taste, great texture, and great looking. This also favors less cooking time and, as a result, less energy consumption. However, there is some heating energy loss associated with using blowing device . Therefore, the use of blowing device  should be in a controlled manner.","Stronger blowing favors better inside airflow for better facilitating moisture removal. However, Continuously strong blowing will cause excessive heating energy loss. To solve this dilemma, an intermittent venting operation is proposed in this invention disclosure. In this intermittent venting operation, fan  dwells for a predetermined interval of time near the end of a blowing cycle, e.g., of 10 seconds, and then automatically begins another cycle of operation. An electronic control circuit for achieving this intermittent operation is going to be disclosed later on, when the control portion of frying apparatus  is discussed.","Immediately after the frying is satisfactorily accomplished, the food is still sizzling hot and there is still residual cooking fume residing inside frying apparatus . Blowing device  can be used to bring in fresh air to cool the food down to a predetermined temperature and, at the same time, to purge the residual cooking fumes out through venting device . This process greatly favors safety of food handling, home environment protection, and foods of great texture and looking.","The above-discussed forced venting system is good for both deep and shallow frying. For deep-frying it facilitates the evaporation for food surface moisture. For shallow frying, especially for frying vegetables, it favors foods of great looking. It is a well-known fact that when fried using a conventional frying pan with the lid covering on top thereof, green vegetables tend to become yellowish.","Reference is made to , again. A control housing  is provided for housing a control module . Control housing  is installed on the sidewall of container .","Control module , installed inside housing , is provided for controlling various functions of frying apparatus , such as the oil temperature for frying foods, motor speeds for rotating blades , and the speed at which blowing motor  is rotating.","Control module  includes a control circuit , as the blocked construction diagram shown in FIG. . Circuit  comprises a microcomputer , which controls various functions of frying apparatus , a relay , which activates heating element , a relay , which activates motor , and a relay , which activates motor .","Microcomputer  is provided with ROM and RAM for data memory, and further provided with I\/O ports A\/D converters as interfaces. The aforementioned ROM's comprises a ROM  containing control programs related to the performance of all frying processes and a ROM , which memorizes referenced data.","Temperature sensor  is provided for measuring the oil temperature, which is taken by microcomputer , as an input variable to be controlled. When the temperature of the frying oil is above the user's desired one, the electrical power to heating element  will be shut down by relay  to better meet the user's desired frying requirement and to save energy.","Computer  can be such programmed that relay  activates motor  intermittently with a bias toward a longer dwell after each stirring cycle of one or two rounds of rotation. In the same manner, an intermittent venting operation can be programmed with relay  activating motor  intermittently.","DC adapter  is installed inside control housing , as shown in FIG. . Adapter  provides electricity power to control circuit  and elements, like indicators, beepers, LCD, etc., and to motors  and , as well.","A control panel , attached to control housing , as shown in , is provided for supporting elements, like switches, indicators, adjusting knobs, beepers, LCD, and so on.","Reference is made to , which illustrates a schematic diagram of a control circuit  for providing the intermittent operation of blade sweeping for frying apparatus .","As shown in , drive motor  is operationally coupled with blades  for providing rotation power. Motor  has a first terminal, which is connected to V\u2212, the negative pole of a power source, e.g., DC adapter , which is shown in , and a second terminal, which is connected to the collector terminal of a PNP bipolar transistor . The emitter terminal of transistor  is connected to V+, the positive pole of a power source, e.g., DC adapter , which is shown in FIG. . Associated with motor  is a linkage mechanism , which cooperates with a single pole, double throw switch , such that the shaft angle of motor  controls the switching position. Switch  includes a single pole , which is connected to the first end of a capacitor . Pole  may be switched alternately between two throw positions as represented by RUN and REST. The reference RUN refers generally to the position of blades  when in sweeping. On the other hand, the reference REST refers generally to the position of blades  when in dwelling. The RUN position represents substantially a large portion of a whole round of rotation angle of the motor shaft, e.g., over 80%. The RUN position is associated with V- and the REST position is associated with V+.","A main switch  is provided for activating and deactivating the intermittent operation provided by circuit . Switch  has a first terminal connected to V\u2212 and a second terminal connected to the first end of a variable resistor .","The second end of capacitor  is connected to the second end of resistor . Also connected to the second end of capacitor  are the base of transistor  and the second end of a resistor . The first end of resistor  is connected to the first terminal of a STIR switch , which can activate a STIR feature, a manually activated continuous operation. The second terminal of switch  is associated with V\u2212. The first end of resistor  is also connected to the second end of a capacitor . The first end of capacitor  is connected to V\u2212.","Switch  is a push button switch for activating the STIR feature. When switch  is pushed, the two terminals are connected, which causes the connection of the first end of resistor  to V\u2212 and, at the same time, causes capacitor  to be short-circuited.","With switch  in the activated position and switch  in the deactivated position, circuit  will operate blades  intermittently with a variable dwell period at the end of each sweeping cycle. This intermittent operation is achieved through the circuit of transistor , switch , capacitor , and resistor .","Now, to start with, suppose motor  has not been operating because switch  has been in the deactivated position. Also suppose switch  has been in the REST position, and thus capacitor  has been discharged.","When switch  is activated, the potential at the second end of resistor  will be lowered to cause transistor  to switch to conductive state, thereby energizing motor . As soon as motor  begins to rotate, switch  will be thrown to the RUN position, which causes the first end of capacitor  to be connected to V\u2212. Capacitor  will then begin to charge so as to make the second end of capacitor  positive with respect to the first end thereof. Sufficient base current will be provided through the base of transistor  to cause transistor  to remain conductive even after capacitor  becomes fully charged, thereby causing motor  to continue to rotate throughout a full rotation cycle until switch  is cycled back to the REST position. When switch  cycles back to the REST position, the first end of capacitor is then connected to V+ and capacitor  begins to discharge through resistor  until the potential at the second end of resistor  becomes sufficiently negative relative to V+. During this period of time, transistor  is switched to and remains in non-conductive state, thereby stopping motor  for a predetermined interval of time. And then, sufficient base current flow resumes, causing transistor  to become conductive again, and a new cycle starts.","The length of the dwell interval is determined by the time required for capacitor  to discharge. Proper selection of capacitor  and resistor  will provide desirable dwell intervals.","With resistor  and capacitor  in addition, a manually activated continuous blade-sweeping feature can be achieved in addition to and in combination with the controllable variable dwell feature. This performance feature is achieved regardless of whether switch  is in the activated position or not when switch  is pushed. Moreover, it will be seen if switch  is in the activated position when switch  is pressed, there will be an immediate override of the intermittent operation. The continuous operation will keep on going without any dwell for a predetermined number of cycles, for example, one or two, after switch  is released, before the intermittent operation is resumed. If switch  is in the deactivated position when switch  is pressed, motor  will immediately start to rotate. After switch  is released, motor  will continue for a predetermined number of continuous sweeping cycles and then stops.","When switch  is pressed, the first end of resistor  is connected to V\u2212. This allows sufficient current to flow through the base of transistor  to switch transistor  to conductive state, thereby causing motor  to start and operate. By proper selection of the value of resistor , this mode of operation will occur regardless of the positions of switches  and , so long as switch  is depressed.","At the same time, pressing switch  causes capacitor  to be short-circuited such that any charge stored therein is discharged through the short circuit to V\u2212. When switch  is released, the current flow out of the base of transistor  will continue through discharged capacitor  until capacitor  recharges. As a result, transistor  will continue in conductive state and motor  will continue to operate at the normal speed. Transistor  will continue in conductive state for a predetermined period of time based on the time constant provided by resistor  and capacitor , which are preferably selected to provide one or two continuous sweeping cycles without any dwell after switch  is released.","One important point worth mentioning is that if power-drive assembly  has a rotation reduction mechanism, linkage  should be set between the output shaft of assembly  and switch , instead of between motor  and switch .","If multiple rounds of sweeping are desired for a stirring cycle, before one dwell period, e.g., two rounds of sweeping before one dwell period, a pair of gears, or some other mechanisms, should be provided, with the smaller one installed on the output shaft and the larger one cooperating with switch . The transfer-ratio should be 1:2.","The intermittent operation of blade sweeping can be alternatively achieved using a mechanically controlled timer, e.g., a spring-driven timer (not shown). Numerous discrete contact poles can be provided on a circular plate, such that when a needle is rotating around a central shaft, the needle engages with each contact pole in sequence. The angle range of each pole represents a stirring cycle. At the end of each stirring cycle, there is a predetermined dwell period, which is represented by the angle range in between two adjacent poles.","Reference is made to , which illustrates a schematic diagram of a control circuit  for providing the intermittent venting operation for frying apparatus .","As shown in , blowing motor  is operationally coupled with fan  for forcing fresh air into frying apparatus . Motor  has a first terminal, which is connected to V\u2212, and a second terminal, which is connected to the collector terminal of a PNP bipolar transistor . The emitter terminal of transistor  is connected to V+. The base of transistor  is connected to the second end of a variable resistor . The first end of resistor  is connected to the second end of a capacitor . The first end of capacitor  is connected to V\u2212.","Also connected to the first end of resistor  are the second terminal of a magnetically activated switch  and the first terminal of a VENT switch . The first terminal of switch  and the second terminal of switch  are connected to V\u2212.","Switch  is provided for activating and deactivating the intermittent venting operation provided by circuit . Switch  cooperates with motor , such that when motor  is in working state, switch  is activated and remains in activated condition until motor  ceases to work. Switch  is a push button switch, which is provided for activating a manually activated continuous venting feature.","When either switch  or switch  is activated, the first end of resistor  is connected to V\u2212 and, at the same time, capacitor  is short circuited to V\u2212.","With switch  in the activated position and switch  in the deactivated position, circuit  will operate fan  intermittently with a variable dwell period at the end of each venting cycle. This intermittent venting operation is achieved through the circuit of transistor , resistor , capacitor , and switch , which is conditioned by motor .","When motor  is in working state, switch  is activated, such that the first end of resistor  is connected to V\u2212, and capacitor  is short circuited to V\u2212. The potential at the second end of resistor  is lowered to cause transistor  to switch to conductive state, thereby energizing motor . As soon as motor  stops, switch  is deactivated. The current flow out of the base of transistor  will continue through discharged capacitor  until capacitor  recharges. As a result, transistor  will continue in conductive state and motor  continue to operate at the normal speed. Transistor  will continue in conductive state for a predetermined period of time based on the time constant provided by resistor  and capacitor , which are preferably selected to provide a multiple of a sweeping cycle of blades , e.g., five continuous blade sweeping cycles. Motor  then dwells for a predetermined interval of time until the next cycle of the intermittent operation of blades  starts, when motor  activates switch , again.","With switch  in addition, a manually activated continuous venting performance feature can be achieved in addition to and in combination with the controllable variable dwell feature. This performance feature is achieved regardless of whether switch  is in the activated position or not when switch  is pushed. Moreover, it will be seen if switch  is in the activated position when switch  is pressed, there will be an immediate override of the intermittent venting operation. The continuous operation will keep on going without any dwell for a predetermined interval of time after switch  is released, before the intermittent venting operation is resumed. If switch  is in the deactivated position when switch  is pressed, motor  will immediately start to rotate. After switch  is released, motor  will continue for a predetermined interval of time, and then stops.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00124","num":"00124"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"b":["168","100","168","168","168","112","168","168"],"i":["a ","b","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00125","num":"00125"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["168","168","168","102","168","112","168","168","168","102","168","168","100","168","102","0","106","102","168"],"i":["a ","b ","b ","c ","c ","a ","b ","a ","b ","a.
