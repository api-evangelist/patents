In the first embodiment illustrated in , the terminal  includes, linked together by an address and data bus , an interface for communication on a network , a non-volatile backup unit , a pointing device , a visual-display screen , a keyboard , a central processing unit , a non-volatile central memory  and a random-access memory .","The network  is, for example, the switched telephone network. The server of the access provider  is, for example, the server of the provider of access to the Internet network known by the name of AOL (trademark) or WANADOO (trademark). The network  is, for example, the data communications network known by the name of Internet. The remote data site  is implemented by a data server or a computer programmed for this purpose according to known techniques.","In the first embodiment illustrated in , the terminal  is a personal computer known by the name of PC (acronym for Personal Computer), or a network computer, known by the name of NC (acronym for Network Computer). The interface for communication on a network  is, in the first embodiment described and represented, a modulator\/demodulator or MODEM. The non-volatile backup unit  is, for example, in the first embodiment described and represented, a hard disk or a compact disc reader\/recorder. The pointing device  is, in the first embodiment described and represented, a computer mouse. The visual-display screen  is of known type, for example with a cathode-ray tube, and is compatible with the standard known to the person skilled in the art under the name of SVGA.","The keyboard  includes at least some keys which, alone or in combination, make it possible to select alphanumeric characters. The central processing unit  is, in the first embodiment described and represented, a processor, for example of the Intel Pentium trademark. The non-volatile central memory  holds the program instructions for the processor  which allows it to start up when it starts to be supplied with electricity. The random-access memory  is, in the first embodiment described and represented, a cache memory suitable for holding information representative of at least one page received from a site such as the remote data site .","For implementing certain aspects of the present invention, the terminal  is linked, via the network , to a third-party site for assistance or protection  and\/or to a third-party confidence site . The third-party protection site  and\/or the third-party confidence site  each possess a server which keeps Internet pages. In a variant, at least one of these sites  and  is coincident with that of the access provider .","In a general way, according to the first aspect of the present invention, when the user puts a computer system into operation, the assistance software which implements certain of the aspects of the present invention is initialized and runs as a background task. Next, as long as the user is using this computer system, the assistance software monitors the supply of information to be protected. This information is defined by its form (see, for example, the flowchart illustrated in ) or by its particular value (see, for example, the flowchart illustrated in ). When information to be protected is detected in the background task, an operation for protecting this information is carried out.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0245","num":"0248"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","100","201"]},"In the course of the use of the terminal , and in a known way, the user makes selections by using the mouse  or selects symbols using the keyboard .","In the course of a test , the central processing unit  determines whether or not an icon specific to the implementation of the first aspect of the method envisaged by the present invention has been selected by the user. This specific icon may be an icon, such as the icon  illustrated in  and represented on the visual-display screen , or an icon which represents a memory of personal information, known by the expression of \u201cwallet\u201d, in the software (or \u201cbrowser\u201d) for navigation on the Internet.","When the result of the test  is negative, in the course of an operation , the central processing unit  determines whether a symbol has been selected by the keyboard . When the result of the test  is negative, the test  is reiterated. When the result of the test  is positive, in the course of an operation , the symbol selected is placed in memory into a \u201cfirst in first out\u201d register (known to the person skilled in the art by the acronym FIFO), which possesses dimensions at least equal to the largest of the sequences of symbols distribution of which is protected. In the course of an operation , characteristics for recognition of the sequence input are determined. These recognition characteristics are information which characterizes the sequence kept in the first in-first out register and which is intended to be compelled with characteristics for recognition of protected sequences.","For example, recognition takes place by comparison of the content of the FIFO memory with sequences of symbols to be protected or segments of these sequences, and the characteristics are then the sequence itself or one or more of its segments.","According to another example, if the information protected is a social-security number or a payment-card number, characteristics may consist of the number of figures input consecutively and of the likelihood that certain of these figures represent a month, a year, an indication of sex, information which is redundant with respect to the other figures or any other function, possibly a one-way function, which provides at least one characteristic.","For example, a credit-card number possesses 16 figures, which have a relationship to one another, and an expiry date in the form of two figures for the month and two figures for the year, it being impossible for the year to be more than a few years after the date of issue of the credit-card. This supplies several characteristics of a credit-card number, without it being necessary to identify this number.","For example, a French social-security number possesses the following characteristics (except for very rare exceptions):","it includes 13 figures","the first figure is equal either to 1, or to 2,","the fourth figure is either 0 or 1,","the fifth is 1 or 2 when the fourth figure is 1.","In the course of a test , the central processing unit  determines whether the characteristics determined in the course of operation  correspond to characteristics of information to be protected.","When the result of the test  is negative, test  is reiterated. When the result of the test  or the result of the test  is positive, in the course of an operation , the information to be protected, at least one characteristic of which has been recognized, is protected.","To that end, in the course of operation , the user is interrogated on the data acquisition in progress by the display of a message in the window represented on the visual-display screen , \u201cAre you inputting XXX\u201d, where XXX is replaced by a protected information name, for example \u201cpayment-card number, social-security number, confidential code, etc., and the user has to choose and select either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.","Then, when the user has chosen \u201cno\u201d, the operation  is completed and, when the user has chosen \u201cyes\u201d, at least one of the protection operations set out in the implementation of the other aspects of the present invention is implemented (deleting of symbols from the information to be protected, for example by simulation of inputting the delete key \u201cback space\u201d, placing in memory the succession of operations carried out since the operation , making contact with a third-party protection site , authentication of the user as a person authorized to divulge the information to be protected, time stamping, display of legal information, for example).","Following the operation , test  is reiterated and the operations  to  proceed as background tasks until the terminal is shut down in a known way.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0262","num":"0265"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["201","301","304","205","305"]},"In the course of operation , the assistance software is automatically put into operation and causes the display, on the visual-display screen , in a dialogue window, of a question for inputting new information to be protected (for example \u201cdo you want to input new confidential information to be protected?\u201d) and displaying three possible responses which the user can select via the mouse , \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cdo not start monitoring\u201d. When \u201cdo not start monitoring\u201d is implemented, an authentication operation  is carried out. If the user is authenticated, the operation of the assistance software is stopped. If the user is not authenticated, operation  is reiterated. When \u201cno\u201d is selected, test  is carried out. When \u201cyes\u201d is selected, in the course of an operation , the user is invited to input an identifier of the information to be protected (for example by selecting \u201cwallet\u201d, \u201cpayment card\u201d, \u201csocial security number\u201d, \u201cname\u201d, \u201cdriving license number\u201d, \u201cidentity card number\u201d, \u201cdate of birth\u201d, \u201caddress\u201d, \u201cInternet access code\u201d, \u201cbank account access code\u201d, \u201cother\u201d, etc.), then, a part of the information to be protected, for example the first eight figures of the payment cards to be protected, the first six figures of his social-security number, the day and the month of his birth, the first letters of the street where he lives, the first figures of his postcode, etc.","Then, in the course of an operation , characteristics for recognizing the information to be protected are determined in the same way as in the course of operation , and these characteristics are placed into non-volatile memory . Following operation , operation  is reiterated.","It will be observed that these characteristics may consist of the whole of the information to be protected, in particular when the information to be protected is selected as \u201cother\u201d. The characteristics may also consist of a predetermined number of first figures of the protected number or of any other function, possibly one-way, which supplies at least one characteristic. The reader may draw on the methods for producing redundancy for transmission-error correction (known by the acronym FEC, standing for Forward Error Correction), for example the verification sums known by the name of \u201cchecksum\u201d.","In the case of the information kept in the \u201cwallet\u201d register, the user supplies the name of the browser which he is using, or runs it and selects \u201cwallet\u201d, in such a way that the memory address to be protected or the means of accessing it are determined automatically by the assistance software.","In the course of operation , characteristics for recognizing the sequence of symbols in memory are determined in the same way as in the course of operation .","It will be observed here that only two data-input means are employed in . However, other data-input means, such as a microphone associated with speech-recognition software, a scanner associated with optical character recognition software, or a camera, can be employed in accordance with the first aspect of the present invention.","It will also be observed that the information to be protected may take forms other than a sequence of symbols, such as an image of the back of the eye, a voice signature, a signature input by using the mouse, a printout read by an optical or thermal sensor, etc.","In a variant, not represented, operations  to  are implemented automatically only when communication is implemented. Hence, when children access a data site, for example via the Internet, confidential information is protected.","In general, according to the second aspect of the present invention, contents of data files received on a communications network are placed in memory and this memory space is managed in such a way as to warn that it is saturating the total memory space available for the other applications. Memory storage and deleting of the content received on the network is organized hierarchically.","In general, according to the eighth aspect of the present invention, when the transmission of a set of information fails because of a limitation in the available pass band or of the maximum transmission duration authorized for a set, a request for transmission of a subset of the said set strictly including less information than the set, is automatically sent. The set preferably corresponds to several files and the subset includes one or more of the said files.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0276"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In the course of an operation , the user causes a communications session to be opened between the terminal  and the access provider , via the network , in a known way. In the course of an operation , the assistance software causes the display of a selection window and of a menu including one or more subjects which the user has already chosen and\/or an option of defining a new subject. The user chooses one of the subjects displayed and\/or identifies a new subject. For example, these subjects may be \u201cstock market\u201d, \u201csport\u201d, \u201cmotor cars\u201d, \u201caudio-visual equipment\u201d, \u201cothers\u201d etc. As soon as the user has selected a subject, the selection window is deleted from the visual display screen .","Then, in the course of an operation , the user, in a known way or starting from one of the pages already related to the subject which he has selected (to this end, when the user has chosen a subject, he may select and see displayed a list of the last pages visited in connection with the chosen subject, in the same way as the browser software offers a list of sites known as \u201cfavorites\u201d. The user can then click on a displayed address), selects an Internet page which he wishes to view and a request is transmitted, via the access provider , to a site which holds the information relating to the selected page.","The site in question transmits this information to the terminal , via the network . In general, transmission is carried out with a pass band limited as a function of the traffic present on the network. It then happens that the access provider stops the transmission when the predetermined duration is exceeded. For example, when, at the end of a period of 20 seconds, the information relating to the structure of the page has not been transmitted, the access provider transmits a transmission-failure message. In the course of the test , the central processing unit  determines whether such a message has been received. When the result of the test  is positive, that is to say in the case of a failure to transmit the page, in the course of an operation , the transmission of a part of the content of the page is de-activated, the request for transmission of the page is re-transmitted and the test  is reiterated.","For example, if, for the same page, several transmission failures occur in succession, the following contents are successively de-activated:","animated image files (for example MPEG files),","static image files (for example JPEG files),","sound files (for example WAVE files),","graphics files.","According to another example, with the content of the page being described to the MPEG-7 format, the de-activated files are graded as a function of their content.","According to a third example, at each iteration of operation , the de-activated files include the file of largest dimensions, with the exception of the file which gives the structure of the page and\/or of the text file.","When the result of the test  is negative, in the course of operation , at least a part of the content of the selected page is received and the de-activations carried out in the course of operation  are cancelled for the next page to be received.","In the course of the test , the central processing unit  determines whether the page received is different from all the pages held in memory of the terminal . To that end, the central processing unit  compares the address of the page as well as the dimensions of each file at this page with the address of all the pages held in memory and the dimensions of the memory-stored files which are relative to the said address, if it is recognized.","When the page is not recognized as being stored in memory, the result of the test  is positive and, in the course of an operation , the central processing unit  causes memory storage of all the files associated with the received page, relating to the address of the page, on the hard disk .","When the result of the test  is negative, that is to say if the page received is recognized as already being stored in memory, or as a result of operation , in the course of an operation , the central processing unit  stores in memory, relating to the said memory-stored page, the date, the subject selected in the course of operation , as well as a link with the page previously selected in the course of the same communications session with the site which holds the information relating to the selected page, if the operation  is not being carried out for the first time in the course of this session.","In the course of an operation , at least a part of the received page is displayed, according to known techniques, and the user can shift this page, put an end to the communications session, and more generally use all the functions of his browser software.","In the course of a test , the central processing unit  determines whether or not another page is being selected by the user. When the result of the test  is positive, a transmission request is sent to the site which holds the information relating to the new page selected, with validation of the transmission of all the files attached to the said page, and test  is carried out.","When the result of the test  is negative, in the course of a test , the central processing unit  determines whether or not the memory allocated by the user for holding the content of pages received via the communications network  has been exceeded.","It will be observed here that, in the course of the installation of the assistance software, the user allocates a memory space on the hard disk  for memory storage of page contents.","When the result of the test  is negative, operation  is reiterated. When the result of the test  is positive, in the course of operation , the oldest files kept in the memory space allocated to holding the pages received are sorted on the basis of predetermined criteria and certain files which do not meet the said criteria are deleted.","By way of example, the user can attribute to certain pages an automatic deletion prohibition (see, for example, operation , in ), and the files which are endowed with this prohibition are not automatically deleted. In the event that all the files stored in memory are endowed with this prohibition, the user is warned that he has to:","either allocate supplementary memory space to the function of memory storage of pages received via the communications network  (he can then carry out operation  again),","or choose to delete files relating to memory-stored pages (he is then invited to carry out manual deletion) (see, for example, operation , ),","or authorize compression of the said files with a compression ratio greater than that which is used for the memory-stored files (in this latter case, in the course of operation , the image files and\/or the sound files, of the first pages stored in memory are decompressed then recompressed with a higher compression ratio, until the allotted memory space is complied with).","By way of a second example, not exclusive of the first example, the files are deleted on the basis of the type, the animated image files, fixed image files, then sound, then graphics, then text files being deleted after different periods.","For example, the animated image files are kept for half as long as the fixed image files which are kept for half as long as the sound files, which are kept for half as long as the graphics files which are kept for half as long as the text files which are kept for half as long as the links between the pages which are kept for half as long as the page addresses.","By way of a third example, not exclusive of the first two, the information relating to the pages stored in memory for the longest time is deleted first.","By way of a fourth example, not exclusive of the first three, the information relating to the various subjects is kept for different durations.","By way of a fifth example, not exclusive of the first four, the information relating to the pages of a site where a transaction has been carried out is kept longer than the others, and, for example, for least a period equal to a legal guarantee plus a maximum delivery period (for example, if the guarantee period is 12 months, the information will be kept for a duration of at least 15 months).","Following operation , operation  is reiterated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0303","num":"0306"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B","b":["100","500","501","102"]},"In the course of an operation , the user selects a function related to the re-reading, for example by using icons illustrated in .","In the course of the test , the central processing unit  determines whether or not the function selected in the course of operation  is that of arranging the pages stored in memory by subject.

In the course of operation , the terminal  and, in the course of operation , the third-party merchant site initiate communication of protected information and, in the case illustrated in , a transaction requiring on-line payment by transmission of a means-of-payment identifier.","In the course of an operation , the terminal  and, in the course of an operation , the assistance or protection third party , open a fourth communications session. In the course of an operation , the terminal  transmits, to the protection site , an identifier of the third-party merchant site, for example in the form of an identifier of the page being displayed, and, more particularly, the address of the said page. In the course of an operation , the protection site receives the said identifier.","In the course of an operation , the protection third party transmits to the terminal  information relating to the third session. In the course of operation , the terminal  receives and processes the said information relating to the third session.","By way of example, in , a large number of exchanges of information have been represented between the terminal  and the protection site , in the course of operations  to . However, in accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, at least one item of information relating to the third session is transmitted in the course of operation .","In the example illustrated in , complementing the transmission of information relating to the third session carried out by the protection site  to the terminal  in the course of operation , in the course of an operation  the terminal  requires transmission of the degree of risk, of the degree of punctuality and the degree of satisfaction. The protection site  receives this request in the course of operation  and transmits these degrees in the course of operation . The terminal  receives these degrees and displays them to the user in the course of an operation .","As indicated above, each of these degrees can be based on official satisfaction and fraud statistics (for example country by country or state by state, by means of payment used, by type of transaction in progress, by site, etc.) or available on a network such as the Internet network, and\/or on information supplied by visitors to the protection site  (see ).","In the course of an operation , the terminal  requires transmission of a legal questionnaire. The protection site  receives this request in the course of operation  and transmits this questionnaire in the course of operation . The terminal  receives this questionnaire and displays it to the user in the course of an operation . The questionnaire may include questions to which it is necessary to respond either automatically, by using the assistance software, or manually, by inputting at the keyboard  with a view to keeping a legal trace of the traction. For example, this information may include an identifier of the site , an identifier of the user, a transaction date, a purpose of the transaction and a transaction amount. The questionnaire may also include questions the responses to which are optional but which serve to make the user aware of the consequences of the transaction or of the lack of knowledge which he has of the third-party merchant site.","The terminal  transmits the responses to the questionnaire, and, if appropriate, attached pages which originate from the third session, to the protection site  with a request for sequestration, in the course of an operation . The protection site  receives this information in the course of an operation  and encrypts it, adding to it a certified date and a certificate of integrity, and sends it back to the terminal , in the course of an operation . The terminal  receives this encrypted information and the certificate of integrity in the course of an operation  and places them in memory on the hard disk , and, if appropriate, endowing them with automatic-deletion prohibition (see operation ). In a variant, the protection site  stores a duplicate of this information or the certificate of integrity which makes it possible to detect whether the information held in memory is subsequently altered.","In the course of operation , the terminal  transmits a single-use means-of-payment request to a financial site proposed by the protection site . The financial site receives this request in the course of an operation .","The financial site, in the course of an operation , supplies the terminal  with information intended to participate in determining a single-use means-of-payment identifier.","The identifier of a single-use payment card consists, for example, of the first eight figures of a real payment card and of eight figures supplied by the financial site. It will be observed that the date of expiry of the said card may form part of the information supplied by the financial site and correspond to a code.","According to another variant, the assistance software installed on the terminal  allows coding of the user's payment card number, by means of a key supplied by the financial site, in such a way that the coded number is subsequently decoded by a financial organization, for example the same financial site, and enables a payment to be made.","When the user is already referenced within the financial site, that is to say that a permanent account number is attributed to him, the financial site first of all carries out authentication of the user. Then the third-party financial site does not transmit a whole payment-card number, in order to avoid the possibility of this number being pirated, that is to say used by a third party. In contrast, preferably, the financial site supplies a root which makes it possible to determine an identifier of a payment means by the user or the terminal  but does not make it possible, with the root alone, to constitute a means-of-payment identifier. This characteristic is the opposite of the method of operation described in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,810 which is entirely incorporated here by reference. The root supplied by the financial site and\/or the determination of the identifier of the single-use means of payment depend, preferably, on identifiers of the financial transaction, such as its amount, the identifier of its payee and\/or the identifier of the financial site.","The root supplied by the financial site may be generated as a transaction certificate for the transaction in progress.","The terminal  receives the information intended to participate in determining a single-use means-of-payment identifier in the course of operation . It determines the single-use means-of-payment identifier in the course of operation , for example by implementing a one-way calculation function of the assistance software, acting on the information received from the financial site, of a payment-card number, of an identifier of the site  and of a transaction amount. If appropriate, a transaction certificate is also used to determine the single-use means-of-payment identifier.","In the example illustrated in , in the course of operation , the terminal  and, in the course of operation , a third-party confidence site  open a fifth communications session. In the course of an operation , the terminal  transmits information to be sequestered to the third-party confidence site. This information is legal information relating to the transaction carried out with the third-party merchant site. In the course of an operation , the third-party confidence site  places this information in memory, possibly encrypted and accompanied by a certificate of integrity.","In the example illustrated in , in the course of an operation , the protection site  transmits a security-protection message to the third-party merchant site in order to confirm that the transaction has been security protected.","It will be observed in  that the protection site , financial site and third-party confidence site  have been represented as independent entities. However, in other embodiments of the method of the present invention, two or three of these sites are combined into a single entity.","It will be observed that the site known as financial site can serve only as intermediary between the parties to the transaction (the user and the third-party merchant site) and have the payment made by another financial body, after having supplied it with an identifier of the user or of a real or virtual means of payment. In particular, the site known as financial site can use the root which it has transmitted and, if appropriate, information which it has received on the part of the terminal , in order to determine a permanent payment-card number.","For example, if the key transmitted is a series of figures which have to be added to the figures of the permanent payment-card number in order to supply, modulo , the figures of the single-use means-of-payment identifier, the key kept by the financial site can serve it for determining the permanent payment-card number.","It will be observed that all the communications employed in accordance with the present invention are preferably protected by encryption, according to known or future techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0373","num":"0376"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","100","801","100","802","100"]},"Next, in the course of an operation , the financial site determines the single-use means-of-payment identifier root. This root is preferably related to an identifier of the user and kept with this identifier in a memory (not represented) of the financial site. For example, this root represents the last eight figures of a payment-card number to be supplied to a merchant site such as the merchant site  or the third-party merchant site. According to other embodiments, the key is a coding key used by software resident in the terminal  in order to generate a means-of-payment identifier. In the course of an operation , the root is supplied to the terminal . In the course of an operation , the root is validated in memory of the financial site, in a list of valid roots. According to one variant, the financial site determines the single-use means-of-payment identifier which the terminal  is going to use. For example, the financial site knows the first eight numbers of a payment card and adds to them the last eight numbers which it supplies to the terminal  or the coding function and the roots used by the terminal . This identifier is then kept in a memory of valid identifiers.","The communications session with the terminal  is then broken off. When the merchant site wants to be paid, it supplies a means-of-payment identifier to the financial site. In the course of a test , the financial site determines whether or not it has received a means-of-payment identifier. When the result of the test  is negative, test  is reiterated. When the result of test  is positive, in the course of a test , the financial site determines whether or not the means-of-payment identifier is valid. To that end, for example, the financial site extracts the root which it has supplied and compares it with the roots held in the list of valid roots. According to another example, the financial site compares the identifier which it receives with the elements of a list of valid identifiers which it has determined.","When the result of test  is positive, in the course of an operation , payment is made. When the result of the test  is negative or when the payment operation  is completed, in the course of an operation , the root of the identifier or the identifier itself is invalidated in the memory of the financial site so that this root or this identifier cannot be used for a payment.","In a variant, the user, in the course of operation , supplies information relating to the transaction, such as the name of the company which is managing the merchant site, for example (supplied by the protection third party , for example) or the amount of the transaction and the identifier of the single-use means of payment is determined so as to be representative of this information or to be associated, in the memory of the financial site, with this identifier.

For example, the laws applicable to a transaction may depend on these two pieces of geographical information.","Depending on the geographical location of the terminal , which its user can supply at the moment of the acquisition or of the installation of the assistance software, the offer or the advertising of a local trader close to the terminal  can be supplied to this terminal.","It will be observed that the confidential information or \u201cinformation to be protected\u201d may include any electronic signature, the assistance software detecting the use of a routine or of signature software resident on the terminal , or of a form of information received from the network  and representative of the use of a signature or of a particular form of sequences of symbols of an electronic signature, of a root of an electronic signature or of access to an electronic signature function.","The memory-stored data preferably identifies that data which has been displayed on the screen  and, if appropriate, the duration of its display.","In a variant, the payment is security protected by replacing the payment-card number by a check number which the supplier site  can have drawn on the user's account of that of the protection third party or of a third party providing the payment. According to this variant, the protection third party  preferably requests confirmation, authentication or a signature from the user, sends the site  confirmation of the order for payment by the said check, specifying the check number, the name of the supplier and the amount of the check. Payment is then not made until the delivery of the goods sold has actually been made, as appropriate. This variant possesses the advantage of having the money sub-sequestered until delivery, guaranteeing the supplier that he will be paid and of avoiding a payment-card number circulating on a network such as the Internet. It will be observed, in this case, that it is not indispensable for the third-party protection site  to supply a root for the check number.","In the embodiment illustrated in , following an operation  of starting up the terminal , in the course of operation , the assistance software is automatically started up and causes the visual-display screen  to display, in the tool bar, an icon specific to the said assistance software.

The terminal  or the assistance software then sends the third-party protection site  the following information:","serial number of the assistance software,","URL Internet address of the site ,","the certificate of integrity of the video file,","the size of the video file,","the universal time and date on the terminal  at the end of the transaction.","In return, the assistance software obtains, from the site , and stores, associated with the record in question:","a unique number identifying the transaction on the server of the site ,","the date on the server of the site  at which the transaction was recorded,","the date on the terminal  of recording of the transaction (so as to confirm that the date received is correct and to have exactly what is recorded within the server, in order to take account particularly of time-zone problems).","Upon export (a function implemented by the use of the assistance software menu and of the option of editing records), the assistance software system generates 3 types of files:","From 1 to 10 HTML files containing the pages with a legal content from the site ,","A video file, for example to the AVI format,","A certificate of integrity containing another certificate of integrity calculated on the HTML and video files as well as the size of these files.","It also contains the number of the original transaction, as well as the dates of recording of the transaction from the server of the site  and from the terminal  and the certificate of integrity of the original video file and its size. A certificate of integrity is also calculated on the main certificate of integrity. Hence, any subsequent change made to a video or HTML file or the certificate of integrity will be detected and will make the export set invalid.","By way of example, the certificates of integrity are calculated according to the method known by the name of CRC-32.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the user's terminal does not include any memory available for keeping the information. For example, this telephone is a mobile telephone or a pocket computer. The assistance software is then run in a computer system which receives information representative of the information received by the user's terminal. For example, the assistance software is running in the server of a gateway site or an Internet-service provider (ISP) through which the user gains access to resources of the communications network. Another part of the assistance software is employed in a terminal such as the terminal  and receives records made by the said server, for example in the form of files attached to electronic mail. This other part of the software may be similar to the assistance software illustrated with regard to , with, moreover, a function of importing records made using a portable terminal.","For simplification, in the description which follows, only those cases where only the transactions are protected have been considered, that is to say that the confidential information to be protected is financial information, electronic signatures or information characteristic of a transaction.","Following an operation  for starting up the terminal or for making contact between this terminal and the server running the assistance software, in the course of operation , the assistance software is automatically started up and causes an icon specific to the said assistance software to be displayed by the visual-display screen .
