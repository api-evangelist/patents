{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["I. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to computer networks and computer communications across computer networks. More particularly, the invention relates to the optimal utilization of open data channels between computer devices on the network, preferably a wireless network, by device resources to communicate across the network.","II. Description of the Related Art","Computer devices that communicate data, typically in the form of packets, across a computer network open a \u201cdata\u201d or \u201ccommunication\u201d channel on the network such that the device can send and receive data packets. The computer devices often have computer resources, such as programs and hardware components, which individually use open communication connections to transmit and receive data on the network. In extant network computers, typically personal computers connected through an Ethernet or other LAN, the device resources are polled when an open communication channel is present to see if the resource needs to send or receive data at that time. If the device resources do not need the open channel, then the device closes the channel and simply reopens the channel if a device resource requires communication because the communication channel on the LAN is inexpensive to establish and utilize.","However, a problem arises when the network communication channel is expensive to establish, such as in a wireless network between wireless devices, and especially with cellular telecommunication devices where every second of connectivity has an appreciable cost to the user. Conversely to a wire-based LAN, if a cellular telecommunication device resource needs to communicate across the network, it is not simple to establish a communication channel on the cellular network because such connection will effect a per second airtime charge. The cellular telecommunication device must therefore either open an expensive communication channel if the device resource communication requirement is sufficiently vital to offset the cost of doing so, or the device resource must simply wait until another communication channel is opened intentionally and then communicate across the open connection prior to its closure.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method that can provide device resources the most efficient access to an otherwise expensive communication channel. The system and method should not cause interruption of other device functionality and other device resources that have priority in utilizing the communication channel. Further, the provision of the open communication channel should not overly utilize the expensive bandwidth of the network. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method to optimize device resource data channel usage that the present invention is primarily directed.","The present invention is a system, method, and computer program for communication between computer devices on a computer network where the establishment of a communication channel is expensive, such as in a wireless network. In the system, each computer device selectively opens and closes a communication channel onto the computer network and has a plurality of device resources that selectively utilize open communication channels to communicate with other devices or servers across the network. The computer device selectively opens a communication channel when required by a device resource or as otherwise commanded by the user, and the device optimally delays the closing of the communication channel after cessation of usage thereof by a device resource, such as a voice or data call, and selectively allows other device resources to utilize the open channel prior to the intentional closure thereof. This optimal \u201clingering\u201d of the open channel mitigates device resources requiring data communication and either causing an expensive communication channel to be opened or waiting and affecting computer device functionality. Further, the duration of the open channel can be optimally minimized so as not to overly utilize the expensive bandwidth while still providing connectivity to other device resources.","The method for communication can be implemented by a computer program being executed on a computer device and which effects the steps of selectively opening a communication channel from the device to the network when required by a device resource, and after cessation of usage of the communication channel by a device resource, optimally delaying the closing of the communication channel, and then selectively allowing other device resources to utilize the open communication channel while closure thereof is delayed.","The present invention thus provides a system and method that allows the resources of a computer device to access an otherwise expensive communication channel, wherein the communication channel is expensive to initially establish and maintain. The present invention can implement a priority of device resource communication access and thus not interrupt important device functionality in implementation. Additionally, the optimization of the delayed closure of the open channel can be tailored to the specific resources on the computer device such that the duration of the open channel does not overly utilize the expensive bandwidth of the network. The present invention accordingly provides an advantage in that a computer device, such as a cellular telecommunication device, can minimize the number of communication channel establishments necessary to provide adequate network access to the resident device resources.","Other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and the claims.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates a network  for having a plurality of computer devices interconnected thereon. Such computer devices can include wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , in communication across a wireless network  and a LAN-based network , with at least one network server, such as application download server  or stand alone server , that selectively downloads or provides access to software applications or other data to the wireless devices across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network . There can be other computer devices resident on the LAN , such as a separate applications database , or other devices that can be in data communication with the LAN .","As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , a personal digital assistant , a pager , which is shown here as a two-way text pager, or even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection  to a network or the Internet. The system and method can thus be performed on any form of computer device computer module including a wired or wireless communication portal, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, access terminals, personal computers, access terminals, telephones without a display or keypad, or any combination or sub-combination thereof.","The system and method are utilized in a network where communication channels have significant overhead in their initial creation. In wireless networks, or partially wireless networks, such as that shown in , the communication channel must be initially bridged between at least the computer device itself, such as devices ,,,, and the network, and the maintenance of the communication channel tends to be costly, especially in a cellular telecommunication network. The use of cellular telecommunication pathways has been increasing because wireless devices, such as cellular telephones, are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and handheld personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d), communicating packets including voice and data over the wireless network. These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephones have installed application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) onto their local computer platform that allow software developers to create software applications that operate on the cellular telephone, and control certain functionality on the device.","In many of the smart cellular devices, such as cellular telephone  or PDA , after the last point-to-point (PPP) connection has stopped being used by the device resource, the device waits for a certain \u201clinger\u201d time, having a default duration of linger before fully terminating the connection. Thus, the optimal delay can be implemented through optimization of an extant linger timer on a computer device, or a computer device can be modified to have an optimal duration of linger of the open communication channel as is further described herein. The linger timer, if present, can typically be altered through a software command to platform of the computer device, such as devices ,,,.","As shown more particularly in , each device, such as cellular telephone , has a computer platform  that can receive data, execute software applications, and display data transmitted from other computer devices, such as PDA  and application download server . The computer platform  includes a bus  that interconnects its components. Among other components resident on the device platform  are several device resources: a central processing unit  (CPU), one or more peripheral devices , a communication interface , a memory , and alternately a secondary database  and graphics device . The CPU  computer platform  can be an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The CPU  is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless device and is not normally upgradeable. The CPU  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the computer device. The memory can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local secondary database  that holds the software applications not actively used in memory , such as the software applications downloaded from the application download server . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","The system thus optimizes communication between computer devices, such as devices ,,,,,, on a computer network (wireless network  and\/or LAN ), wherein each device selectively opens and closes a communication channel onto the computer network  and\/or  through the communication interface , and the plurality of device resources, such as resources ,,,,,, each can selectively utilize the communication channel to communicate with other devices, such as devices ,,,,,,, across the network(s). The device platform  will selectively open a communication channel when required by a device resource, such as a voice call to a cellular telephone , a text stream from pager , or a need for data from a process executing on the CPU  that needs to send data to or receive data from a server  on the network. For example, the communication channel can be a secure socket between the one or more devices ,,, and a server .","To minimize the need for each device resource to repeatedly open a communication channel at the moment when needed, each device ,,,,,, optimally delays the closing of an open communication channel after cessation of usage thereof by a device resource and selectively allows other device resources ,,,,, to utilize the open channel prior to closure of the channel. With the optimal delay, the other device resources that need to communicate across the channel can wait until the open and unused channel lingers and then send or receive data through any priority system as known in the art such as round-robin polling, a priority queue, daisy-chain, or bus arbitration.","The delay is preferably a predetermined duration that is optimized based upon statistical usage of device resources ,,,,, in sequence, or likelihood of the requirement of a further communication channel. Alternately, the predetermined duration can be modeling based upon other communication intervals of importance, such as a billing interval for the maintenance of a communication channel. For example, if the billing interval is each minute, i.e. 60 seconds, the linger time can be 59 seconds. Moreover, several methods can be combined to calculate the optimal duration of delay, such as having the duration roll to 119 seconds if the statistical usage of the communication determines that the usage of further device resources of the open channel will span on average greater than 59 seconds of usage of a lingering channel after a certain device resource ceases use of the channel. The predetermined duration of the optimal delay of the closing of a communication channel is reset upon another device resource ,,,,, utilizing the open channel prior to closure thereof. This optimal duration of linger thus further optimally minimizes the overall use of bandwidth and cost to the user that occurs from having too long of a linger duration for the device.","Further, the system can accelerate the closing of open connections that otherwise linger for a default duration on the network based upon the statistical modeling, which preserves system bandwidth. For example, if it is known that specific applications only use an open data channel has been active beyond a certain duration, then the system can alter the duration of the open channel based solely upon the duration of application execution and close the channel earlier than elapse of the default duration. The system could also account for several applications with different probabilities to utilize an open data channel and optimize the closure rate based upon a decreased likelihood of usage.","The device resource usage data for optimization of the predetermined duration can be stored either on the device ,,,, in the memory  or secondary database . Alternately, or in conjunction therewith, the device resource usage data can be sent to a server  or database  across the network  and\/or  to be stored. The actual determination of the optimal duration of the delay can thus be performed at the computer device upon CPU , or alternately can be performed on another device on the network, such as server , and the optimal duration can be sent to the one or more devices ,,,. As would be known to one of skill in the art, the device storage usage data can be transmitted from one computer device to another for the determination process, and does not have to be resident to device making such calculation.","The process executed on the computer device, such as wireless devices ,,, is shown in the flowchart of . The communication channel is opened from a device, as shown at step , and then data is transmitted from a first device resource ,,,,, across the open communication channel, as shown by step . The communication channel can be opened (step ) by either a direct user request, incoming call, or by necessity of a device resource. Once the data from the first device resource has been transmitted (or received) by the first device resource, the device resource ceases use of the communication channel as shown at step , and then the count for the predetermined duration of the open channel (\u201clinger\u201d) occurs as show at step , during which the communication channel will remain available for usage by other device resources ,,,,,. Such \u201ccount\u201d can be a count-up or down, or other method known in the art to determine the elapse of a duration of time.","Once the count for the predetermined duration has begun at step , a decision is made as to whether another device resource needs to communicate across the open channel, as shown at decision . If another device does need to use the open channel, then the data from the second device resource is transmitted across the open communication channel as shown at step . Either while the secondary device resource is transmitting data across the open channel or during such transmission, the device resource usage data is preferably stored on the device as shown at step , and then the predetermined delay is preferably reset to once again count, as shown at step . The same predetermined duration can be used at this reset, or alternately, a new predetermined duration can be used based upon the secondary device resource transmitting or the stored usage data. Furthermore, at step , the device, such as device ,,,, can also or exclusively transmit the device resource usage data to another device on the network.","If another device resource does not require the open communication channel to send or receive data at decision , then another determination is made as to whether the predetermined duration of delay has elapsed, as shown at decision . If the predetermined duration has not elapsed at decision , then the process returns to decision  and again determines if another device resource needs the open channel, and then iterates to decision , thus entering a wait state while the predetermined duration elapses. Once the predetermined duration of delay has elapsed at decision , the device preferably retrieves the stored data on secondary channel usage at shown at step , and then optimizes the predetermined duration for delay (linger) as shown at step . The process then terminates and renews upon an open communication channel occurring on the device ,,,. Step  can also set the optimal duration of linger to close an open channel before a certain default linger duration occurs if application usage indicates that usage of the open channel does not justify maintenance of the expensive open channel for the full linger duration. Through such action, the overall bandwidth of the system can be conserved as open channels of an unnecessary duration can be minimized.","Steps  and  to optimize the predetermined duration are preferably performed at the device, but can alternately be carried out upon another device ,,,,,, on the network  and\/or . The remote device carrying out the optimization should have access to the device resource usage data, or store it locally, but the device can also optimize based upon a larger model or other criteria where the device resource usage data for that specific device is unnecessary.","The method for communication between one or more computer devices ,,,,,, that each selectively opens and closes a communication channel on a computer network  and\/or , wherein each device includes a plurality of device resources ,,,,, that selectively utilize communication channels to communicate with other devices across the network. The method includes the steps of selectively opening a communication channel from the device, such as devices ,,,, to the network  and\/or  when required by a device resource ,,,,,. And after cessation of usage of the communication channel by a device resource, the method includes the steps of optimally delaying the closing of the communication channel (linger), and selectively allowing other device resources ,,,,, to utilize the open communication channel prior to closure thereof.","The step of optimally delaying the closing of the communication channel is optimally delaying of the closing of the communication channel after the elapse of a predetermined duration, as described above. Then method can also include the step of closing the communication channel after elapse of the predetermined optimal duration.","As embodied in , the method can include the step of resetting the predetermined duration of the optimal delay of the closing of a communication channel upon another device resource ,,,,, utilizing the open channel prior to closure of the channel. Further, if there are one or more servers, such as servers  and  in , on the computer network , the step of selectively opening a communication channel from the device to the network is selectively communicating between the device and the one or more servers, such as from device ,,, to servers  and .","In the embodiment of , wherein the computer network includes a wireless network  (specifically a cellular telecommunication network), the step of selectively opening a communication channel from the device to the network is selectively opening a communication channel from a wireless device ,,, to the wireless network  when required by a device resource. Furthermore, with the wireless devices ,,,, the step of selectively opening a communication channel from the devices ,,, to the network  can be opening a secure socket between the one or more wireless devices and the servers  and . More particularly with the embodiment of , the step of selectively opening a communication channel is preferably selectively opening a cellular communication channel from a cellular device to the cellular telecommunication network when required by a device resource ,,,,, or user command.","The step of optimally delaying the closing of the communication channel is preferably optimally delaying the closing of the communication channel based upon device resource usage data, such as that stored at step  in . Thus, the method can further include the step of storing the device resource usage data on the device, as shown at step , or alternately, can store the device resource usage data on another device ,,,,,, in the network  and\/or . Accordingly, the step of optimally delaying the closing of the communication channel can be optimally delaying the closing of the communication channel based upon device resource usage data stored on the one or more servers ,.","The method preferably include the step of determining the optimal delay for the closing of a communication channel after cessation of usage thereof by a device resource ,,,,,, such as shown at step . Such step of determining the optimal delay for the closing of a communication channel can occur at the device ,,,, or at the one or more servers ,.","The system includes a computer device, such as devices ,,,, that selectively opens and closes a communication channel onto a computer network, and preferably at least a partially wireless network . The device is more preferably a cellular telecommunication device that can take full advantage of the optimal data channel usage. Such device preferably includes a plurality of device resources ,,,,, that selectively utilize the communication channel to communicate with other devices across the network . The device selectively opens a communication channel when required by a device resource ,,,,, or at the direction of the user, and optimally delays the closing of a communication channel after cessation of usage thereof by a device resource and selectively allows other device resources to utilize the open channel prior to closure of the channel. The device ,,, preferably optimally delays closing of a communication channel for a predetermined duration, and resets the duration upon another device resource ,,,,, utilizing the open channel prior to closure of the channel. Furthermore, the device ,,, can selectively communicate with one or more servers  and  across the network  and\/or .","The device ,,, can determine locally the optimal predetermined duration based upon locally stored device resource usage data. Alternately, the device ,,, can receive an external command to set the optimal delay of the closing of a communication channel after cessation of usage thereof by a device resource, and such external command can come from another device, such as a server ,, or be input from the user of the device itself.","In view of the method being executable on the computer platform of a wireless device ,,,, the steps of the method can be implemented with a program resident in a computer readable medium, where the program directs a computer device ,,, having a device platform  to perform the steps of the method. Such program can be executed on any single computer platform, or can be multithreaded among several computer platforms, such as when device resource usage data is stored and optimized among several computer devices, such as devices ,,,,,,.","The computer readable medium can be the memory  of the computer platform  of the cellular telephone , or other wireless device ,,, or can be in a local database, such as local database  of the device platform . Further, the computer readable medium can be in a secondary storage media that is loadable onto a wireless device computer platform, such as a magnetic disk or tape, optical disk, hard disk, flash memory, or other storage media as is known in the art.","In the context of , the method may be implemented, for example, by operating portion(s) of the network  and\/or  to execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions, such as device platform , the application download server , and separate server .
