{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent App. Ser. No. 61\/622,377, filed Apr. 10, 2012, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to online search results.","2. Related Art","When a user or consumer wants to find something on the Internet, such as for a possible purchase of goods or services or just to find information, a search is typically conducted. The user enters one or more desired search terms that relate to the information sought by the user. The more terms and\/or narrower the terms, the more focused the search results may be. When the search terms are submitted, a search engine or Internet Service Provider (ISP) performs the search and returns search results to the user.","Typically, search results are presented on a page with links the user can select to take the user to a particular site for more details. Such results may be presented in order of perceived relevance of the search terms, as determined by the search engine. For online shopping or purchases, specific merchants may have their sites or links listed earlier or featured in the search, e.g., as a paid service to the search engine or ISP. Another way to present search results for shopping is to show the user the search results within different categories or ranges to give the user a more manageable or informative result display. For example, a search for a product may show the user results within different price ranges. This may help the user identify which results would be relevant to the user.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","According to one embodiment, a service provider presents results from a search query with dynamic category ranges, with each category range having approximately the same number of items within the category range. In one embodiment, approximately the same is within 10%. In other embodiments, approximately the same is within 5%. The number may vary depending on the number of results and\/or merchant specifications.","When a user submits a search query, the system or service provider determines the number of results returned for the query. The system then sets a number of ranges so that between ranges, in one embodiment, all have approximately the same number of results. Number of ranges could be limited by some predefined number. The ranges can be price, merchant rating (quantitative data), merchant sales of the item, category of item, overall, or other quantitative data. The system may determine a rounding factors set for each range. If a range has a large number of items, the user can select that range and see a finer set of ranges within that range. This can continue as needed or desired. Stores, merchants, or other online commerce sites may choose ranges to best suit their needs.","As a result, consumers may be able to better and more easily navigate search results because ranges will not have too many results (making it harder for the user to navigate through the results) or too few results (making it inefficient for the user to navigate through the results).","In one embodiment, a service provider receives a search query from a user through a user device, such as a PC, computing tablet, smart phone, etc. The search query may be for a specific merchant or a group of merchants. The search query may be one or more key words, along with any other search limiters, such as price, etc. For example, the user may enter \u201cblue shirt.\u201d","The service provider or system accesses a database, cloud, or memory containing available or offered items\/services from the merchant(s) and searches based on the user query. In the above example, the system searches for \u201cblue shirt\u201d and finds 98 items or results matching the search query.","In a typical process, the system may return the results within fixed ranges. For example, the fixed ranges may be price ranges of $0 to $9.99, $10.00 to $19.99, $20.00 to $29.99, $30.00 to $39.99, $40.00 to $49.99, and $50.00 on up. The results may show 0 items in the first four price ranges, 10 items in the next price range, and 88 items in the last price range. This may not be that useful to the consumer, as the consumer would need to select the last price range to see most of the results, which may make it difficult for the user to efficiently navigate through those results.","In one embodiment, the system determines suitable price ranges, such that an approximate same number of items are within each price range. In this example, the price ranges may be $40.00 to $49.99, $50.00 to $54.99, $55.00 to $57.99, $58.00 to $59.99, $60.00 to $69.99, $70.00 to $74.99, $75.00 to $82.99, $83.00 to $85.49, $85.50 to $89.99, and $90.00 to $100.00, with each range having between 8 and 10 items.","The attached flowchart illustrates steps a service provider may perform in determining and\/or setting ranges, according to one embodiment.","Thus, the user is presented with a more manageable set of results for navigation.","If the initial search results yielded a very large number of items, the system may still limit the total number of ranges to ten or some other number. In such a case, each range may still have a large number of items, say approximately 200. The user can select a desired range and have the system automatically create ten (or some other number) ranges again containing approximately the same number of items. In this example, each range may contain approximately 20 items. The system may continue to dynamically set ranges within each preceding range as suitable.","In another embodiment, instead of the system determining a suitable range or a number of ranges, the merchant may specify the number. This number may be the initial range or number, such that subsequent ranges are determined by the system for the approximately equal distribution of search results.","Note that although price ranges are described above, other ranges or categories may also be suitable, such as merchant rating (quantitative data), merchant sales of the item, category of item, overall, consumer reviews (e.g., stars), or other quantitative data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The following algorithm illustrates one embodiment for determining intervals.","1) The system receives a search request from a user or consumer, such as through a user device like a PC, smart phone, computing tablet, or the like.

The search may be for items, services, specific information about a topic, a question, etc. The system may be a service provider that provides search results to a user.
