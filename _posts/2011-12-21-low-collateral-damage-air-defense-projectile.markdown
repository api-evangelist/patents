title: Low collateral damage air defense projectile
abstract: A kinetic energy penetrator with a longitudinal axis may include a forward segment having a lateral surface, a rear surface, and at least one air bleed channel extending from the lateral surface to the rear surface. A second segment may be disposed aft of and torsionally engaged with the forward segment. The second segment may include a front surface adjacent the rear surface of the forward segment. The forward and second segments may each be asymmetric about the longitudinal axis of the penetrator. When the penetrator is in flight, bleed air through the bleed channels may impinge on the front surface of the second segment. The second segment may separate from the front segment. Kinetic energies of each of the forward and second segments may be less than about 75 joules upon impact with a ground surface.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to air defense projectiles.","In warfare, emphasis may be placed on the reduction of collateral damage. Collateral damage may include damage to infrastructure and injury or death of civilians. As battles move into urban environments, so do warfighters and their bases. Also, other urban interests may come under attack, such as, for example, embassies and consulates. Urban interests may require protection from incoming threats. But, it may be desired that the protection not destroy surrounding infrastructure or harm civilians in the area.","Kinetic energy penetrators may be effective in neutralizing incoming air borne threat munitions such as rockets, artillery and mortars. These penetrators may be monolithic cylindrical objects made from high density materials that maximize penetration. However, the high ballistic coefficient of these penetrators may pose a problem in urban environments. If the penetrators miss their intended target, the penetrators may have sufficient kinetic energy to cause collateral damage when they fall to the ground. This problem may restrict the use of otherwise effective air defense systems during urban operations. One solution has been the use of self-destructing high explosive munitions, which may detonate after a preset flight time. However, these munitions may have unreliable fuzes. Unreliable fuzes may cause unexploded ordinance (UXO) hazards and a high-probability of collateral damage.","A need exists for an air defense munition, such as a kinetic energy penetrator, that may create less collateral damage than known air defense munitions.","It is an object of the invention to provide a kinetic energy penetrator that may create less collateral damage than known air defense munitions.","One aspect of the invention is a kinetic energy penetrator having a longitudinal axis. The penetrator may include a forward segment and a second segment. The forward segment may have a lateral surface, a rear surface, and at least one air bleed channel extending from the lateral surface to the rear surface. The second segment may be disposed aft of and torsionally engaged with the forward segment. The second segment may include a front surface adjacent the rear surface of the forward segment. The forward and second segments may each be asymmetric about the longitudinal axis of the penetrator. When the penetrator is in flight, bleed air through the bleed channel may impinge on the front surface of the second segment. The second segment may separate from the front segment. Kinetic energies of each of the forward and second segments may be less than about 75 joules upon impact with the ground.","The second segment may include a lateral surface, a rear surface, and at least one bleed channel extending from the lateral surface to the rear surface. The penetrator may further include a third segment disposed aft of the second segment. The third segment may be torsionally engaged with the second segment. The third segment may include a front surface adjacent the rear surface of the second segment. The third segment may be asymmetric about the longitudinal axis of the penetrator. When the penetrator is in flight, bleed air through the bleed channel of the second segment may impinge on the front surface of the third segment. The third segment may separate from the second segment. A kinetic energy of the third segment may be less than about 75 joules upon impact with the ground.","One of the forward and second segments may include a shaft opening and the other of the forward and second segments may include a shaft disposed in the shaft opening. The shaft and the shaft opening may be keyed for torsional engagement of the forward and second segments.","One of the second and third segments may include a shaft opening and the other of the second and third segments may include a shaft disposed in the shaft opening. The shaft and the shaft opening may be keyed for torsional engagement of the second and third segments.","The penetrator may include no energetic material. The penetrator may include no electrically-operated components.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","10","10","12","14","16","18","14","16","18","18","18","12"]},"A second segment  may be disposed aft of and torsionally engaged with forward segment .

Forward, second, and third segments , ,  may be made of, for example, heavy-metal materials, such as, for example, tungsten. Penetrator  may include no energetic material. Penetrator  may include no electrically-operated components.","In some embodiments of the penetrator, there may be more than three segments. The forward segment may have a generally conical or ogive shape. The other segments may be generally cylindrical in shape. However, if sufficiently asymmetrical, shapes other than generally cylindrical may also be used for the segments.","Penetrators ,  may have a medium caliber, for example, about 20 mm to about 60 mm. Penetrators ,  may be customized so that the segments separate from each other at a specific distance from a protected area. A protected area is an area where collateral damage from the penetrator may be minimized or eliminated. In general, when the number of bleed holes ,  in each segment increases, the range (from firing or launching point) at which the penetrator falls apart may be less. In general, when the diameter of bleed holes ,  is increased, the range at which the penetrator falls apart may also be less. More and\/or larger bleed holes ,  may cause the bled-in high pressure air to act on a larger area of front surfaces , ,  of segments , , , respectively, thereby increasing the net force tending to separate the segments.","Similarly, as the angles A and B () decrease, the effective high pressure area on front surfaces ,  of segments ,  may increase. So, as angles A and B decrease, the range at which the segments separate may be less. And, the location of the entrance holes ,  of channels ,  may be related to the bled-in air pressure. Higher or lower air pressure may flow through channels ,  because the pressure distribution on penetrator  may not be constant. At any instant in flight, penetrator  may have a distributed pressure load over its surface. If the surface pressure bled into channels ,  is low, penetrator  may fly a longer distance before the segments separate. If the surface pressure bled into channels ,  is high, penetrator  may fly a shorter distance before the segments separate.","The mass of third segment  may influence the time of flight or distance at which penetrator  disintegrates. For a given set of loading conditions over time, a larger mass of segment  may increase flight time or distance prior to disintegration. Second segment  may separate later than third segment .","The segmented penetrator may reduce or eliminate collateral damage. Because no energetic material may be present in the penetrator, the problem of unexploded ordnance is eliminated. Furthermore, no electrical components or electronics may be required in the penetrator. The distance or range to separation of the segments may be varied by adjusting the design variables of the segments.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
