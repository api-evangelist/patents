title: Managing network-initiated quality of service setup in mobile device and network
abstract: Systems, methodologies, and devices are described that manage employment of network (NW)-initiated resource allocation and user equipment (UE)-initiated resource allocation for a UE. To employ NW-initiated resource allocation, a core network can transmit an indicator to the UE indicating that Policy and Charging Control (PCC) is supported by a network associated with the UE. The UE receives the indicator and other information, such as indicator regarding whether the current access network supports NW-initiated resource allocation and whether the current application prefers NW-initiated resource allocation, determines that NW-initiated resource allocation is to be employed, and the core network initiates resource allocation for the UE. If any indicator is not received by the UE, or the UE receives an indicator that indicates PCC is not supported or not preferred, the UE determines that UE-initiated resource allocation is to be employed, and transmits a request for resource allocation to the core network.

Field","The following description relates generally to wireless communications, and more particularly to managing network-initiated Quality of Service (QoS) setup in a mobile device and network.","2. Background","Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication; for instance, voice and\/or data can be provided via such wireless communication systems. A typical wireless communication system, or network, can provide multiple users access to one or more shared resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, . . . ). For instance, a system can use a variety of multiple access techniques such as Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Code Division Multiplexing (CDM), Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and others.","Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems can simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. This communication link can be established via a single-in-single-out, multiple-in-signal-out, or a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system.","For instance, a MIMO system can employ multiple (N) transmit antennas and multiple (N) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the Ntransmit and Nreceive antennas can be decomposed into Nindependent channels, which are also referred to as spatial channels, where N\u2266min{N, N}. Each of the Nindependent channels can correspond to a dimension. The MIMO system can provide improved performance (e.g., higher throughput and\/or greater reliability) if the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas are utilized.","A MIMO system can support a time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In a TDD system, the forward and reverse link transmissions can be on the same frequency region so that the reciprocity principle allows the estimation of the forward link channel from the reverse link channel. This can enable the access point to extract transmit beamforming gain on the forward link when multiple antennas are available at the access point.","Wireless communication systems oftentimes employ one or more base stations that provide a coverage area. A typical base station can transmit multiple data streams for broadcast, multicast and\/or unicast services, wherein a data stream may be a stream of data that can be of independent reception interest to a mobile device. A mobile device within the coverage area of such base station can be employed to receive one, more than one, or all the data streams carried by the composite stream. Likewise, a mobile device can transmit data to the base station or another mobile device.","Conventionally, the LTE\/SAE allows a mixed mode of operation for QoS setup where either the UE or the network can initiate the process for setting up resources for an application. However, the current standard does not provide guidance regarding avoiding race conditions or long delays in waiting for resources that can result from usage of mixed mode operation. For instance, if a UE and the network each attempt to set up resources for an application, there can be multiple race conditions where the processes initiated by the UE can cross or conflict with the processes initiated by the network. In another instance, if the UE is expecting the network to set up resources, but the network does not have the policy and charging control functionality required to initiate resource setup, the UE will not receive desired QoS for certain applications. It is desirable to be able to utilize mixed mode of operation for QoS setup while avoiding race conditions or long delays in waiting for resources that can result from usage of mixed mode operation.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure thereof, various aspects are described in connection with facilitating efficient connection and communication associated with a communication device (e.g., mobile communication device, also referred to an user equipment (UE)) within a network by managing employment of network (NW)-initiated resource allocation (e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) and UE-initiated resource allocation for the communication device. When a UE connects to an access network associated with a core network, a Type 1 application, which supports UE-initiated resource allocation only and which can be either an operator controlled application or is not an operator controlled application, or a Type 2 application, which prefers NW-initiated resource allocation but also supports UE-initiated resource allocation and which can normally be an operator controlled application, can be employed with the communication device. In an aspect, to facilitate employing dynamic NW-initiated resource allocation, Policy and Charging Control (PCC) needs to be supported where a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) in the core network authorizes PCC\/QoS rules and provisions the rules to the appropriate gateways within the network to trigger NW-initiated resource allocation. In another aspect, to employ NW-initiated resource allocation and resolve ambiguities on whether the UE should wait for the network to set up resources, the core network can transmit an indicator (e.g., PCC support indicator) to the communication device indicating that PCC for NW-initiated resource allocation is supported by the current network associated with the communication device. The communication device can receive the indicator(s) and can determine that NW-initiated resource allocation is to be employed, and the core network can initiate resource allocation to facilitate establishing a bearer between the communication device and the core network. If the indicator (e.g., PCC support indicator) is not received by the communication device, or if the communication device receives an indicator that indicates PCC for NW-initiated resource allocation is not supported by the network, the communication device can determine that UE-initiated resource allocation is to be employed, and the communication device can generate and transmit a request for resource allocation to the core network to facilitate allocating resources for the communication device and establishing bearer between the communication device and core network. In yet another aspect, when a Type 2 application is being employed, but the communication device is roaming, the roaming network may not support the PCC framework and thus can indicate to the communication device that PCC is not supported. Even if the home PCRF is configured to prefer NW-initiated resource allocation for the application, the communication device may have to use UE-initiated resource allocation.","According to related aspects, a method that facilitates communication associated with a mobile communication device is described herein.

Moreover, the processor can be configured to establish a bearer between the mobile device and the core network in accordance with the resource allocation initiated by the mobile device or the core network based at least in part on the at least one indicator.","According to other aspects, a method that facilitates communication associated with a mobile device is described herein. The method can include transmitting at least one indicator to the mobile device to facilitate indicating to the mobile device that PCC for network-initiated resource allocation is supported and at least one of a core network is to initiate resource allocation associated with the mobile device or the mobile device is to initiate the resource allocation associated with the mobile device. Further, the method can comprise establishing a bearer between the mobile device and the core network in accordance with the resource allocation initiated by the mobile device or the core network based at least in part on the at least one indicator.","Yet another aspect relates to a wireless communications apparatus that can include a memory that retains instructions related to transmission of at least one indicator to a mobile device to facilitate indicating to the mobile device that PCC for network-initiated resource allocation is supported and at least one of a core network is to initiate resource allocation associated with the mobile device or the mobile device is to initiate the resource allocation associated with the mobile device, and establishment of a bearer between the mobile device and the core network in accordance with the resource allocation initiated by the mobile device or the core network based at least in part on the at least one indicator.

Further, the wireless communications apparatus can include means for setting up a bearer between the mobile communication device and the core network in accordance with the resource allocation initiated by the mobile communication device or the core network based at least in part on the at least one indicator.","Still another aspect relates to a computer program product, comprising: a computer-readable medium comprising code for: a first set of codes for causing a computer to transmit at least one indicator to a mobile communication device to facilitate indicating to the mobile communication device that PCC for network-initiated resource allocation is supported and at least one of a core network is to initiate resource allocation associated with the mobile communication device or the mobile communication device is to initiate the resource allocation associated with the mobile communication device; and a second set of codes for causing a computer to establish a bearer between the mobile communication device and the core network in accordance with the resource allocation initiated by the mobile communication device or the core network based at least in part on the at least one indicator.","In accordance with another aspect, an apparatus in a wireless communication system can include a processor, wherein the processor can be configured to transmit at least one indicator to the mobile communication device to facilitate indicating to the mobile communication device that PCC for network-initiated resource allocation is supported and at least one of a core network is to initiate resource allocation associated with the mobile communication device or the mobile communication device is to initiate the resource allocation associated with the mobile communication device. Further, the processor can be configured to set up a bearer between the mobile communication device and the core network in accordance with the resource allocation initiated by the mobile communication device or the core network based at least in part on the at least one indicator.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims.

Mobile devices  and  can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and\/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system . As depicted, mobile device  is in communication with antennas  and , where antennas  and  transmit information to mobile device  over a forward link  (e.g., downlink (DL)) and receive information from mobile device  over a reverse link  (e.g., uplink (UL)). Moreover, mobile device  is in communication with antennas  and , where antennas  and  transmit information to mobile device  over a forward link  and receive information from mobile device  over a reverse link . In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link  can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link , and forward link  can employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link , for example. Further, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link  and reverse link  can utilize a common frequency band and forward link  and reverse link  can utilize a common frequency band.","Each group of antennas and\/or the area in which they are designated to communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station . For example, antenna groups can be designed to communicate to mobile devices (e.g., ) in a sector of the areas covered by base station . In communication over forward links  and , the transmitting antennas of base station  can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links  and  for mobile devices  and . Also, while base station  utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices  and  scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices.","In addition,  illustrates a core network  that can communicate with base station  through link(s) ; it should be appreciated that core network  also can communicate with other base stations (not shown). Core network  typically can comprise substantially any component that generates and\/or administers (e.g., schedules, retains communication records, policies, and so forth) packetized communications (e.g., communications based at least in part on internet protocol packets) such as data flows for UEs  or . Components, such as, for example, a serving gateway, a PDN gateway, and the like, that compose core network  can provide access to disparate packet data network(s) (PDN(s))  which can facilitate access to application(s) and\/or data service(s) . It should be appreciated that core network  also can access application(s) and\/or data service(s) .","Conventionally, the Long Term Evolution (LTE)\/Service Architecture Evolution (SAE) network allows a mixed mode operation for resource allocation (e.g., QoS) setup where either the UE or the network can initiate the process for setting up resources for an application. Evolved Packet Core (EPC)\/Policy and Charging Control (PCC) architecture can allow a UE-initiated resource allocation request and a network (Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF)) initiated resource allocation request, wherein either type of request can result in a dedicated bearer setup between a UE and the network. In particular, in order for the network to dynamically initiate resource allocation for an application, the PCC support is needed. However, PCC is regarded as an optional feature within LTE\/SAE and there is no clear indication whether a certain network supports PCC or not, even though the mixed mode operation is supported by the access network. Since both the UE and the network can initiate a resource allocation request, there potentially can be instances where both the UE and network attempt to initiate resource allocation requests with regard to a single application, which can result in multiple race conditions where the processes initiated by the UE can cross or conflict with the processes initiated by the network. In other cases, the UE may be expecting the network to initiate the resource allocation process while the network does not support PCC. As a result, the UE will not be able to receive the desired QoS for certain applications. The current standard does not provide guidance regarding determining whether the UE or the network is to initiate a resource allocation request with regard to an application and avoiding race conditions or lack of QoS that can result from usage of mixed mode operation. It is desirable to be able to utilize mixed mode of operation for resource allocation setup while avoiding race conditions or lack of QoS that can result from usage of mixed mode operation.","In accordance with various aspects, the subject innovation can employ an indicator that can facilitate determining when to utilize a network (NW)-initiated resource allocation and when to utilize a UE-initiated resource allocation. The subject innovation also can utilize another indicator, which can be generated and sent from the device (e.g., UE) side of the application  to the QoS management layer as well as the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) layer within the device (e.g., UE ), to facilitate indicating whether NW-initiated resource allocation is a preferred mode of operation. The subject innovation can further employ yet another indicator, which can be transmitted from the network  to the UE (e.g., ) to facilitate indicating whether the current network  supports PCC for NW-initiated resource allocation, where this indicator can imply that the appropriate architecture for network-initiated QoS, such as PCC, is available. The UE (e.g., ) can be configured, based at least in part on the indicator received from the network  and the indicator from device side of the application , to either wait for the network  to initiate the resource allocation or to initiate the resource allocation itself. In an embodiment, the wireless communication system  can be configured such that NW-initiated resource allocation can be used when the device side of the application  indicates that the application  prefers NW-initiated resource-allocation operation and the current network  has indicated support of PCC for NW-initiated resource-allocation operation. In an aspect of the subject innovation, an indicator(s) can be a Q-bit word, wherein Q can be virtually any desired integer, or a predetermined value of a packet header field, and so forth.","Turning briefly to , illustrated is an example call flow  that illustrates UE-initiated and NW-initiated resource allocation requests in accordance with various aspects of the disclosed subject matter. In accordance with an aspect, the example call flow  can be employed by wireless communication system . In one aspect, example call flow  can include application level signaling being exchanged between a UE (e.g., ) and an application function , such as depicted at reference numeral . The application function  can transmit service information related to the application to the PCRF , as illustrated at reference numeral .","In one aspect, in a NW-initiated resource setup (as depicted in Sequence A in ), when the PCRF  receives the service information from the application function , the PCRF  can create authorized PCC\/QoS rules in accordance with the received service information, where the PCC\/QoS rules can comprise information that can facilitate enabling detection of service data flow and providing parameters for policy, charging, and QoS control. The PCRF  can transmit the authorized PCC rules to the Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW)  (as depicted at reference numeral  in ). The PGW  can transmit an acknowledgement to the PCRF  to indicate that the authorized PCC rules have been received, as illustrated at reference numeral . At the same time, if the SGW performs bearer binding and event reporting function, the PCRF  can transmit Gateway (GW) control and QoS rules to the SGW , as depicted at reference numeral . The QoS rules can comprise QoS parameters and other information that can facilitate enabling detection of service data flow, performing bearer binding, and verifying uplink bearer binding. The SGW  and UE  can communicate with each other to facilitate setting up dedicated bearer between the UE  and the core network  in accordance with the received QoS rules and GW control, as depicted at reference numeral . The SGW  also can transmit an acknowledgement to the PCRF  to acknowledge that information regarding the GW control and QoS rules was received, as depicted at reference numeral .","In accordance with another aspect, in a UE-initiate resource allocation (as depicted in Sequence B in ), the PCRF  receives the service information from the application function , as illustrated at reference numeral . The UE  can transmit a resource request (e.g., bearer resource allocation request) to the network (e.g., ), where the resource request can be received by the SGW , as illustrated at reference numeral . Based at least in part on the received resource request, the SGW  can transmit a request for GW control and QoS rules to the PCRF , as illustrated at reference numeral , where the PCRF  can authorize the received request. The PCRF  can transmit authorized PCC rules to the PGW  (as depicted at reference numeral  in ). The PGW  can transmit an acknowledgement to the PCRF  to indicate that the authorized PCC rules have been received, as illustrated at reference numeral . At the same or substantially the same time, in response to the request as illustrated at reference numeral , the PCRF  can transmit GW control and QoS rules to the SGW , as depicted at reference numeral . The SGW  and UE  can communicate with each other to facilitate setting up dedicated bearer between the UE  and the core network  in accordance with the received QoS rules and GW control, as depicted at reference numeral .","It is noted that for a single application, since both UE-initiated request and NW-initiate request can be available, the application can make use of either UE-initiated resource allocation or NW-initiated resource allocation. Conventionally, for example, a UE can roam across various networks that may support only one resource allocation method, which can lead to communication deterioration or negation (e.g., due in part to race conditions). In addition, conventionally, an available UE-initiated request procedure(s) and NW-initiated procedure(s) can interact adversely: race conditions (e.g., flawed logic) can arise from mixed utilization of resource allocation procedures within a single application. As another example, conventionally there potentially can be multiple race conditions when NW-initiated procedure (e.g., procedures described with regard to reference numerals -) is started in parallel, or concurrently, with UE-initiated procedures (e.g., procedures described with regard to reference numerals -). For instance, the NW-initiated procedures, such as the PCC rule provision, PCC rule provision acknowledgement, and\/or GW control and QoS rule provision (e.g., reference numerals , , and\/or ) may cross with the UE-initiated procedure, such as the GW control and QoS rule request (e.g., reference numeral ); and\/or a NW-initiated procedure, such as the dedicated bearer setup (e.g., reference numeral ) may cross with a bearer resource allocation request (e.g., reference numeral ). As another example, the application on the UE may be preconfigured to prefer the NW-initiated resource allocation. If the UE moves to a network where the PCC for NW-initiated resource allocation is not available, the UE will either not receive the desired QoS for communication or wait for a long time before realizing that the network is not setting up QoS.","Referring again to  and system , in accordance with various aspects of the disclosed subject matter, system  can define interaction and maintain clean separation of UE-initiated QoS procedures and NW-initiated QoS procedures for a single application. System  can employ specified indicators that can be communicated between the UE  and the network , and between specified components or layers within the network , to allow a clean indication of when to employ NW-initiated QoS (e.g., NW-initiated resource allocation) and when to use UE-initiated QoS. In addition, the subject innovation can facilitate managing interactions within a UE  between an application, a signaling layer, and a radio layer.","In an aspect of the subject innovation, applications can be classified into at least two types:\n\n","In another aspect of the subject innovation, coordination that can utilize signaling indication(s) and operator policy is provided between the UE  and network  for Type 2 application(s). The signaling indication(s) can be stored in a data store within a core network  and operator policy can be stored in a policy store within the core network . Additionally, such indication(s) can facilitate allowing a clean separation of NW-initiated QoS and UE-initiated QoS.","Referring to , depicted is an example call flow  that illustrates an example technique that can facilitate managing NW-initiated resource allocation and UE-initiated resource allocation in accordance with aspect(s) of the subject innovation.
