{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The use of wireless communication devices to send and receive information has become increasingly prominent. Typically, an operating system is installed on a wireless communication device to manage and coordinate the various functions that the device performs. In addition to the operating system, various applications are often available for the wireless communication device that are designed to execute on the operating system. Some examples of applications available for wireless communication devices include news, sports, and weather applets, games, media players, business tools, educational software, social networking applications, internet browsers, and many more. However, in operation, such applications often request large amounts of data, placing a high demand on network bandwidth and other resources.","To address this demand, communication service providers often apply data rate-limiting policies to wireless communication devices for data usage exceeding a reasonable amount as deemed by the service provider. Typically, rate-limiting is effectuated by adjusting parameters within the home agent associated with the problem device in order to reduce the amount of data carried by radio frequency (RF) timeslots destined for the rate-limited device. For example, if the RF timeslots have a capacity of 2.4 megabits per second, the home agent might limit the slot occupancy to only 256 kilobits per second to effectuate rate-limiting on a particular device. However, such rate-limiting techniques result in inefficient use of available slot occupancy and waste power cycles transmitting partially-filled slots.","Overview","A wireless communication device comprises a wireless communication transceiver and a processing system. The wireless communication transceiver is configured to receive data via a communication network and to receive a data restriction message that instructs the wireless communication device to limit a rate at which the data is provided to a user. The processing system is configured to determine individual amounts of the data associated with a plurality of applications of the wireless communication device, identify an application of the plurality of applications associated with an individual amount of the data that meets a criterion, and limit a delivery rate at which application data associated with the application is provided to the user based on the data restriction message.","A computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon for operating a wireless communication device is disclosed herein. The instructions, when executed by the wireless communication device, direct the wireless communication device to receive data via a communication network, and receive a data restriction message that instructs the wireless communication device to limit a rate at which the data is provided to a user. The instructions further direct the wireless communication device to determine individual amounts of the data associated with a plurality of applications of the wireless communication device, and identify an application of the plurality of applications associated with an individual amount of the data that meets a criterion. The instructions further direct the wireless communication device to limit a delivery rate at which application data associated with the application is provided to the user based on the data restriction message.","A communication system comprises a wireless communication device and a data usage management system. The wireless communication device is configured to receive data via a communication network. The data usage management system is configured to monitor data bandwidth usage of the wireless communication device and transmit a data restriction message for delivery to the wireless communication device when the data bandwidth usage exceeds a usage threshold, wherein the data restriction message instructs the wireless communication device to limit a rate at which the data is provided to a user. The wireless communication device is configured to receive the data restriction message and determine individual amounts of the data associated with a plurality of applications of the wireless communication device. Further, the wireless communication device is configured to identify an application of the plurality of applications associated with an individual amount of the data that meets a criterion, and limit a delivery rate at which application data associated with the application is provided to the user based on the data restriction message.","The following description and associated drawings teach the best mode of the invention.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","110","120","130","101","110","111","110","120","121","120","130","131"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","101","120","201","101","101","101","101","120"]},"Wireless communication device  also receives a data restriction message that instructs wireless communication device  to limit a rate at which the data is provided to a user (). Typically, wireless communication device  receives the data restriction message from communication network  or some communication system associated with network , such as data usage management system . For example, data usage management system  could monitor data bandwidth usage of wireless communication device  and transmit the data restriction message for delivery to wireless communication device  when the data bandwidth usage exceeds a usage threshold. In some examples, the data restriction message could indicate a target rate at which to provide the data to the user, which would typically be a slower rate than the rate that wireless communication device  receives the data via communication network .","In response to the data restriction message, wireless communication device  determines individual amounts of the data associated with a plurality of applications of wireless communication device  (). The applications typically comprise third-party executable processing instructions configured to operate within an operating system of wireless communication device , but the applications could be associated with the operating system and\/or comprise the operating system itself in some examples. For example, the applications could include web browsers, streaming media applications, gaming applications, television applications, or any other software application installed on wireless communication device .","Wireless communication device  could determine the individual amounts of the data associated with each of the applications in several ways. In some examples, wireless communication device  could determine which applications are presently executing on wireless communication device  during a communication session and then determine percentages of data packets received in the data that are associated with each of the executing applications. For example, wireless communication device  could utilize source packet addresses, source and destination ports, media access control (MAC) addresses, protocols, application programming interface (API) objects, and other information to determine a distribution of packets received in the data for each of the applications of device  during the communication session. In some examples, wireless communication device  could additionally or alternatively determine the individual amounts of the data associated with the applications by analyzing historical bandwidth usage information for each of the applications. For example, wireless communication device  could continuously monitor data bandwidth usage for each application installed on device , and store the individual data usage information for each application in a memory system for use in determining the individual amounts of the data associated with the applications. Thus, in some examples, the individual amounts of the data associated with each of the applications could include historical data usage in addition to current\/real-time data usage during a communication session. Other techniques to determine individual amounts of data received via communication network  that are associated with each of the applications executing on wireless communication device  are also possible and within the scope of the present disclosure.","Wireless communication device  then identifies an application of the plurality of applications associated with an individual amount of the data that meets a criterion (). Typically, after determining the individual amounts of the data associated with each of the applications, wireless communication device  processes each of the individual amounts with a criterion to identify the application associated with the individual amount of the data that meets the criterion. In some examples, the criterion could be predetermined, received in the data restriction message, or determined dynamically by wireless communication device , such as calculated based on a percentage of total data usage consumed by wireless communication device .","There are many ways in which wireless communication device  could identify the application associated with the individual amount of the data that meets the criterion. For example, to identify the application associated with the individual amount of the data that meets the criterion, wireless communication device  could determine that the individual amount of the data associated with the application exceeds a threshold. In another example, wireless communication device  could identify the application associated with the individual amount of the data that meets the criterion by determining that the individual amount of the data associated with the application has a greatest value of the individual amounts of the data associated with the plurality of applications. For example, by comparing the individual amounts of the data associated with each of the applications, wireless communication device  can identify the application or applications responsible for the greatest amount of data usage. Additionally, in some examples wireless communication device  could also refer to a list of predetermined applications that are typically associated with high levels of data usage, and could factor in this information when identifying the application associated with the individual amount of the data that meets the criterion.","Typically, the criterion is described in such a way that the application or applications with the heaviest data usage of all the applications will meet the criterion. However, in some examples, wireless communication device  could store locations of device  when data usage occurs for each of the applications, along with time periods of such usage per application, and could further utilize this information in dynamically determining the criterion and\/or identifying applications associated with individual amounts of the data that meet the criterion. For example, the criterion could comprise a data usage score threshold, and wireless communication device  could determine data usage scores for each of the applications by applying more weight to data usage that occurs in predetermined high traffic locations and\/or during predetermined high volume time periods. Therefore, the application with the heaviest data usage may not meet the criterion in this case if that usage primarily occurred at relatively lower-weighted locations and time periods.","After identifying the application associated with the individual amount of the data that meets the criterion, wireless communication device  limits a delivery rate at which application data associated with the application is provided to the user based on the data restriction message (). The application data associated with the application could comprise data packets that are currently being received by wireless communication device  on behalf of the application and\/or data packets that will be received by device  for the application in the future. Typically, wireless communication device  limits the delivery rate at which the application data associated with the application is provided to the user by providing the application data to the application at a slower rate than device  is receiving the application data from communication network . For example, wireless communication device  could limit the delivery rate at which the application data associated with the application is provided to the user by caching the application data in a rate-limited buffer prior to providing the application data to the user.","Advantageously, wireless communication device  can identify a particular application or applications having data bandwidth usage that meets a criterion, such as threshold values, application ranking by data usage, and other types of criteria. Wireless communication device  then internally limits the delivery rate of data associated with the identified application, while continuing to receive data via communication network  at the typical rate and capacity of communication network . However, because wireless communication device  provides the application data to the application at the limited delivery rate, communication network  can send the data to wireless communication device  less frequently, thereby reducing the burden on communication network  by freeing up bandwidth and other network resources.","Referring back to , wireless communication device  comprises any device having wireless communication connectivity with hardware and circuitry programmed to function as a telecommunications device, such as Radio Frequency (RF) communication circuitry and an antenna.

Typically, data usage management system  monitors the data usage of smartphone  during a predefined period, such as during a particular month or billing cycle. The usage threshold is typically a predetermined amount of data usage allowed for a single device such as smartphone  that is considered reasonable by the communication network for consumption during the time period being monitored. For example, the usage threshold could be set to five gigabytes of data throughput during a billing cycle. To monitor the data usage of smartphone , data usage management system  typically sums data packets having a destination IP address assigned to smartphone . However, although  shows data being transferred to smartphone  via the communication network, one of skill in the art will understand that smartphone  could also utilize an uplink communication channel to transmit data to other communication systems via the communication network, and this uplink data transmitted by smartphone  could be included in the data usage monitoring performed by data usage management system  and compared to the usage threshold in some examples.","If the data usage of smartphone  exceeds the usage threshold during the monitored time period, data usage management system  transfers a data restriction message for delivery to smartphone . The data restriction message directs smartphone  to limit a rate that the data is provided to the user, and could include a target rate for providing the data to the user. In this example, the data restriction message also indicates a time period during which the restriction is in effect, which is for the remaining duration of the current billing cycle in this instance.","In response to the data restriction message, smartphone  identifies at least one application with data usage that meets a criterion. To make this determination, smartphone  maintains data logs of historical data usage for each application of smartphone , and processes the historical data usage with the criterion to determine an application that meets the criterion. In this example, the criterion directs smartphone  to identify the application with the greatest amount of data usage during the time period identified in the data restriction message, which smartphone  identifies as a streaming video application in this case. Of course, depending on the criterion utilized, in some examples smartphone  could determine that multiple applications have data usage that meets the criterion. Further, smartphone  could apply several criteria to identify these applications.","Upon identifying the application, smartphone  caches application data associated with the application in a rate-limited buffer that limits a delivery rate of the application data to the application. In order to cache the application data, in this example smartphone  reads the headers of incoming data packets and caches those packets having IP addresses, ports, and\/or other information that can be associated with the application in the rate-limited buffer instead of providing the packets directly to the application. The packets are then provided to the application from the rate-limited buffer at a slower rate than they are received by smartphone  via the communication network. For example, if the application data for the application is provided by the communication network to smartphone  at a rate of 2.4 megabits per second, smartphone  may trickle the application data out of the rate-limited buffer to the application at a rate of only 256 kilobits per second.","Although not shown in , upon limiting the delivery of the application data, smartphone  could display a notification to the user that the delivery rate of the application data is limited for the application. The user notification could also indicate time periods during which the delivery rate limitation is in effect for the application, such as weekdays and high-traffic time periods, until the end of a month or billing cycle, and other types of restrictions on data usage for the application. Additionally, the user notification could indicate alternative time periods during which performance will improve for the application, such as weekends or other low-traffic time periods, and smartphone  could remove the restrictions on data usage for the application during these time periods.","As smartphone  is caching the application data for the application, which are streaming video packets for the identified streaming video application in this example, smartphone  also monitors a capacity of the rate-limited buffer and compares the capacity to threshold values, which could be predetermined, based on a percentage of the total capacity of the buffer, or based on some other threshold considerations. Thus, when the capacity of the rate-limited buffer exceeds a maximum threshold, smartphone  transmits a buffer full notification for delivery to data usage management system . Data usage management system  then halts transmission of the application data associated with the application in response to receiving the buffer full notification. The buffer full notification could include attributes of the packets associated with the application such as IP addresses, ports, and the like which can be used by data usage management system  to identify which packets to stop transmitting. Data usage management system  could then buffer these packets at the home agent until instructed to resume transmission.","Smartphone  uses the rate-limited buffer to slowly deliver, or \u201ctrickle\u201d the application data to the application. In some examples, the delivery rate at which smartphone  provides the application data to the application could be determined dynamically. For example, the data restriction message received by smartphone  from data usage management system  could indicate a target rate at which to provide the data to the user, and smartphone  could determine the delivery rate for the application data based on the target rate included in the data restriction message. In some examples, the target rate could comprise the actual delivery rate that smartphone  should use for providing the application data to the application. In other examples, the target rate could comprise an overall target rate for all data transmitted to smartphone  via the communication network, and smartphone  could calculate the delivery rate for the application data based on rates of data received for other applications that are not being limited to arrive at the overall target rate for all data sent to smartphone  as indicated in the data restriction message. Other rate calculations are also possible, including the use of predetermined delivery rates stored within smartphone .","When the capacity of the rate-limited buffer has been depleted and falls below a minimum threshold, smartphone  transmits a buffer empty notification for delivery to data usage management system . Responsive to the buffer empty notification, data usage management system  resumes transmission of the application data for delivery to smartphone , which in this example is accomplished by directing the home agent to start transferring packets associated with the application that were being buffered at the home agent in response to the buffer full notification received earlier. Upon receiving the application data, smartphone  again caches the application data in the rate-limited buffer, trickles the application data to the application at a slower delivery rate than the rate the data is received from the home agent, and informs data usage management system  when the buffer has been filled again by transmitting another buffer full notification. The rate-limited buffer management process described above is thus repeated until all of the application data has been transferred to smartphone  and\/or until the data rate limitations for the application have expired.","Advantageously, by implementing data rate limiting per application at smartphone  instead of throttling back data packets for smartphone  at the home agent, smartphone  can intelligently determine which application or applications are causing the excessive data usage that triggered data usage management system  to transfer the data restriction message. By having smartphone  cache the application data in the rate-limited buffer and slowly trickle it to the problem applications, the home agent serving smartphone  can periodically pause the transmission of packets associated with the applications having high data usage, thereby reducing strain on the network and freeing up network capacity for other users. The operation of managing the rate-limited buffer and the associated messaging between smartphone  and data usage management system  will now be described with respect to the trend chart shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","500","301","301","330","330","301","301","500"]},"At each of the peaks and valleys appearing on the trend, smartphone  transmits a buffer full notification or a buffer empty notification, respectively, for delivery to data usage management system . Thus, in this example, smartphone  is configured to transmit a buffer full notification to data usage management system  when the rate-limited buffer reaches 90% of total capacity, and transmits a buffer empty notification when the rate-limited buffer falls to 15% of total capacity. As shown in , smartphone  downloads the data into the rate-limited buffer in bursts of three seconds, but trickles the data to the applications over time periods of nine seconds. Thus, the rate-limited buffer in this example limits the delivery rate of the data to the applications to a rate that is roughly three times slower than the rate at which the data is received from the home agent over the communication network. Advantageously, during each of the \u201ctickle\u201d downward-sloping portions of the trend, the home agent can halt the transfer of data associated with rate-limited applications. Further, one of skill in the art will understand that the rate-limited buffer described herein is not limited to use with one or more applications installed on smartphone , but could be utilized by smartphone  to buffer all data received and\/or transferred by smartphone  over the communication network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","101","101","600","601","602","603","602","601","603","602","604","605","606","606","607","610","600","600"]},"Wireless communication transceiver  comprises RF communication circuitry and an antenna.
