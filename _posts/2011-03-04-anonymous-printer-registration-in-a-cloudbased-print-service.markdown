{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 120 to, and is a continuation-in-part of, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/725,067, titled CLOUD-BASED PRINT SERVICE, filed on Mar. 16, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","This description relates to printing.","An ability to print within a computing environment generally ranges from desirable to indispensable. Conventional printers, and associated printing techniques, typically involve installation of a print driver within the context of an operating system or platform of an associated computer. The print driver is generally specific to the associated (type of) printer, and to the operating system, and enables applications running in the context of the operating system to communicate with (e.g., send print jobs to) the printer.","Thus, in an example user experience, an owner of a computer running a particular operating system purchases a printer, and then installs a version of the printer driver associated with the user's operating system onto the computer. In other example scenarios, a printer (i.e., associated printer driver) may be installed in the context of a network. In the latter scenario(s), it is possible to share the installed printer among multiple network users. For example, a local computer executing an application, operating system, and printer driver, may print from the application to a remote printer, using an intermediary print server. Somewhat similarly, an application may execute on a remote device, and the operating system and printer driver may be installed on the remote device, as well. Then, a user may experience or use the remotely-executing application at a local computer (e.g., in a remote desktop or other virtual computing environment), and may print to a local or remote printer which receives commands from the remotely-installed printer driver.","The above-referenced paradigm for printing generally uses, for each (type of) printer, a print driver for each operating system\/platform from which printing may occur. Consequently, it may be difficult for printer manufacturers to generate and maintain such print drivers for all available operating systems\/platforms, and, even to the extent to which printer manufacturers are successful in doing so, it may be difficult for individual and\/or network users to be aware of, identify, obtain, or otherwise implement an appropriate driver(s) (or associated updates).","Further, it may occur that a particular operating system\/platform does not support a particular print driver, or any print driver at all. For example, operating systems designed to run in resource-limited environments, such as mobile devices (e.g., netbooks or smartphones), may have limited or no resources to execute a print driver. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for applications running on such devices, or running remotely for use on such devices, to print in a satisfactory manner.","Similarly, network applications (e.g., \u201cweb applications\u201d) exist in which an application executes on a remote server while being used by a user on a local machine, e.g., using a browser or other client-side user interface. Such applications allow users to benefit from the use thereof, without requiring local installation (and associated depletion of local hardware resources). Printing documents associated with such applications is typically problematic, and often requires an initial conversion of such documents into a standardized format (e.g., the portable document format, or \u201c.pdf\u201d) before printing can proceed in a reliable or predictable fashion.","In short, conventional printers and printing paradigms often provide a fragmented, expensive, resource-intensive, potentially unpredictable user experience which is sub-optimal at best and unworkable at worst for many users.","According to one general aspect a print server may include instructions stored on a computer-readable medium and executable by at least one processor. The print server may include an anonymous printer registration module configured to receive, at a cloud print service, a registration request from a printer over a network and return a registration response to the printer over the network. The anonymous printer registration module may include a claim code provider configured to provide a claim code included within the registration response to the printer over the network, wherein the printer is configured to provide the claim code to a user of the printer, and a printer matcher configured to receive the claim code from the user over the network and match a user account of the user within the cloud print service with the printer, in response to the receipt of the claim code from the user.","According to another general aspect, a computer-implemented method may include receiving a registration request at a cloud print service from a printer over a network, providing a registration response to the printer over the network, the registration response providing a claim code, wherein the printer is configured to provide the claim code to a user of the printer, receiving the claim code from the user over the network, and matching a user account of the user within the cloud print service with the printer, in response to the receipt of the claim code from the user.","According to another general aspect, a computer program product may be tangibly embodied on a computer-readable storage medium and may include executable code that, when executed, is configured to cause a data processing apparatus to receive a registration request at a cloud print service from a printer over a network, provide a registration response to the printer over the network, the registration response providing a claim code, wherein the printer is configured to provide the claim code to a user of the printer, receive the claim code from the user over the network, and match a user account of the user within the cloud print service with the printer, in response to the receipt of the claim code from the user.","According to another general aspect, a printer may include a registration requester configured to receive an initiation request from a user to initiate a registration of the printer, and further configured to send a registration request to a cloud print service over a network, a claim facilitator configured to receive a registration response from the cloud print service over the network, the registration response including a claim code, and further configured to provide, using printer functionality, the claim code to the user, and an authentication manager configured to request an authentication credential issued by the cloud print service in response to a matching of the printer with a user account of the user within the cloud print service, the matching based on a receipt of the claim code from the user at the cloud print service, and further configured to receive and store the authentication credential at the printer.","According to another general aspect, a method may include receiving, at a printer, an initiation request from a user to initiate a registration of the printer, sending, from the printer, a registration request to a cloud print service over a network, receiving, at the printer, a registration response from the cloud print service over the network, the registration response including a claim code, providing, using printer functionality, the claim code to the user, requesting an authentication credential issued by the cloud print service in response to a matching of the printer with a user account of the user within the cloud print service, the matching based on a receipt of the claim code from the user at the cloud print service, and receiving and storing the authentication credential at the printer.","According to another general aspect, a computer program product may be tangibly embodied on a computer-readable storage medium and may include executable code that, when executed, is configured to cause a cloud aware printer to receive, at a printer, an initiation request from a user to initiate a registration of the printer, send, from the printer, a registration request to a cloud print service over a network, receive, at the printer, a registration response from the cloud print service over the network, the registration response including a claim code, provide, using printer functionality, the claim code to the user, request an authentication credential issued by the cloud print service in response to a matching of the printer with a user account of the user within the cloud print service, the matching based on a receipt of the claim code from the user at the cloud print service; and receive and store the authentication credential at the printer.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","102","104","106","102","102"]},"In , a device  is illustrated as an example of virtually any computing device from which a user may wish to execute a print job. By way of non-limiting example, then, the device  may include a laptop or desktop computer, a netbook, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a camera, or any device which may store or have access to data which the user may desire to print.","In the example of , an operating system  is illustrated as executing an application . Again, these elements are included by way of illustration and example, and may include virtually any operating system or other platform on which virtually any application may run. For example, the operating system  may include operating systems such as the Windows operating system, Mac OS, or Linux, and may include mobile platforms such as Android, Symbian, or iPhone OS, to name a few examples. In other examples, the operating system  may include a browser-based operating system, such as the Chrome OS.","Consequently, the application  may include virtually any application which may run on any underlying operating system or platform. Examples of such applications are well-known and too numerous to mention in any detail, but generally include document processing applications, email applications, image editing or presentation software, a web browser, or virtually any application which provides the user with a rendering of data which the user may wish to print.","In particular, as referenced above, the application  may represent a web application which executes on a remote application server  as application . That is, the application  may include any application functionality which is accessed by the user over the network  and experienced locally as the application , e.g., using a browser running at the device . As is known, such web applications allow an owner of the application server  to assume responsibility for installing, configuring, executing, and maintaining the application  at the application server , so that the user of the device  may obtain the benefit of the application  without many or any of the associated costs and responsibilities. Techniques for executing such a web application, and related technology, are well known in the art and are therefore not described further in detail herein, except as may be helpful or necessary to understand operations of the system  of .","The network  may thus represent, for example, the public Internet or other wide area public or private network. The network  may represent, in further examples, a corporate or other intranet, and\/or a smaller-scale, local or personal network, any of which may be implemented using standard network technology.","Further in , a cloud-aware printer  is illustrated which is configured to communicate with the cloud print service  over the network . In this regard, the term \u201ccloud\u201d or \u201ccloud-aware\u201d references the use of \u201ccloud computing,\u201d which, generally speaking, includes a style of computing in which computing resources such as application programs and file storage are remotely provided over a network such as the Internet, typically through a web browser. For example, many web browsers are capable of running applications, which can themselves be application programming interfaces (\u201cAPI's\u201d) to more sophisticated applications running on remote servers. In the cloud computing paradigm, a web browser interfaces with and controls an application program that is running on a remote server. Through the browser, the user can create, edit, save and delete files on the remote server via the remote application program. Thus, it may be observed that the application server  and associated application  may also represent examples of cloud computing.","In the context of the cloud-aware printer , the cloud print service  enables the application  to print directly to the cloud-aware printer , without a requirement or need for (e.g., independently of), involvement of the operating system . In other words, the application  may communicate directly with the cloud print service  to thereby print to the cloud-aware printer , without e.g., requiring a local driver within the operating system . As a result, virtually any application  that may be configured to communicate with the cloud print service  may make use of the cloud-aware printer , as described in detail, below.","For example, the cloud print service  may be configured to register the user and\/or the device , as well as the cloud-aware printer . In a specific example, the device may be a smartphone, and the user may use the application  to purchase a ticket (e.g., a movie ticket, or an airline ticket). Then, the user may print the purchased ticket directly to the cloud-aware printer , even though the device  and\/or the operating system  may not have the resources, or otherwise be configured, to support native printing in a conventional sense (e.g., may not currently be executing a print driver of any sort associated with the cloud-aware printer ). In this way, the user of the application  may be provided with a print option and associated abilities that are not currently provided in conventional printing paradigms and techniques. Many other such examples are described herein, or would be apparent.","The cloud-aware printer  may be contrasted with a legacy printer , which does not natively support communication with the cloud print service . Therefore, to illustrate additional or alternative examples of implementations of the system  of , a separate device  is illustrated, which, as described below, may be modified to impart the advantages of the cloud print service  to the legacy printer . Similarly, a router  may additionally or alternatively be modified to thereby enable the legacy printer  to participate in the cloud printing paradigm defined by the operations of the cloud print service , as described in detail below.","In short, the system  provides an ability for virtually any application running on any device within the network  (e.g., the applications ,  and devices , ) to communicate with the cloud print service  to thereby print to any printer which is also in (direct or indirect) communication with the cloud print service . Consequently, users may benefit from increased printing options and abilities, and experience an overall decrease in the costs and efforts associated with doing so. Meanwhile, printer manufacturers may experience a decreased or eliminated need to provide users with the (updated) driver(s) and other prerequisites for users to fully experience the benefits of their products. This may result in, for example, higher customer satisfaction, and a decreased cost of producing and maintaining printers.","In more detail, the cloud print service  includes a registration manager , which may be configured to register printers and users. As shown, then, a printer manager  may be configured to receive a registration of the cloud-aware printer  and\/or the legacy printer , including storing identification information therefore within a data store  of registered printers. Similarly, a user manager  may be configured to register a user(s) who may currently or potentially wish to execute print jobs using the cloud print service , and to store identification information for such users within a data store  of registered users.","There are many example scenarios and techniques by which users and\/or printers may come to be registered with the cloud print service  through the registration manager , many of which are described below in detail, e.g., with respect to . In general, for example, a user of the device  may use a browser to visit a website associated with the cloud print service , and may enter a username\/password combination to establish a user account with the print service.","In other examples, such users already may have a user account with a separate and possibly related service or service provider. For example, various online services (e.g., other cloud-based computing resources) may provide functionality such as email, data storage, and document processing, and, in such cases, a user already may have a secure user account established in connection therewith. In such cases, the cloud print service  may leverage or access such existing user accounts, e.g., to avoid a need to create a new user account, and to facilitate access of existing users of other services with the cloud print service.","Consequently, it may be appreciated that although the user manager  and registered users data store  are illustrated as being within the cloud print service , it also may occur that related functionality exists externally to the cloud print service, and is accessed thereby. For example, the application server  may provide an email application as the application , and a user of the device  may be registered with this email application (service). In such a case, the application server  may have the responsibility of maintaining the user's account, and the cloud print service  may simply interface with the application server  and provide access to the user once the user is logged into the application .","Techniques for registering users, maintaining user accounts, and maintaining security of users' accounts, are well-known in the art, and are not necessarily described here in detail, except as may be necessary or helpful to understand operations of the system , or related systems.","Meanwhile, the printer manager , as referenced above, is responsible for registering the cloud-aware printer , the legacy printer , and\/or any printer which may interface with the cloud print service  and which may currently or potentially be accessed by a user of the cloud print service. As also referenced above, specific techniques for, and example of, printer registration are provided below with respect to .","An application manager  may be configured to communicate with any application which may be desired to be used for printing within the system , including, e.g., the application , and the application . Thus, for example, the application manager  may implement various application programming interfaces (APIs) which enable such communication with external applications.","Specific examples of operations of the application manager  are provided below, e.g., with respect to . In general, though, the application manager  may include the functions of receiving a print request, and then receiving an actual print job, from, e.g., the application . In general, the first function of receiving a print request may include providing the user of the application  (directly or indirectly) with a print dialog or other user interface with which the user may select an available\/associated registered printer. Receiving the print job may include receiving print data to be printed, along with print characteristics characterizing preferences and other aspects of how the print data is desired to be printed (e.g., color vs. black-and-white, paper size, orientation, number of copies, or any other relevant or desired print characteristic). The application manager  may conduct other communications with the application , as well, such as, e.g., providing a status of a printer or print job.","The application manager  may communicate with the application  (or other application) in a format that is independent of a specific printer, e.g., that is generic with respect to all available or relevant printers within the system . In this way, the application  is relieved of some or all of the burdens associated with needing knowledge of a destination printer when formulating and\/or sending the print job.","For example, with reference to the print job just described, the application  may formulate both the print data and print characteristics in the same manner, regardless of whether the print job is destined for, e.g., the cloud-aware printer  or the legacy printer . In fact, even if the user of the application  does not currently have any registered printer associated with his or her user account, the print job still may be forwarded to the cloud print service  for storage, and later printed to whatever printer is ultimately registered with the cloud print service  and the user's account.","Consequently, the application  may include or use, or be associated with, APIs to communicate with the application manager , where such APIs may be light-weight, consistent, customizable, and easy to implement within or among various applications. Moreover, such APIs may rarely, if ever, need to be updated or maintained by the user in order for the user print from the application using the cloud print service . Instead, such updates may be managed by an administrator or other provider of the cloud print service  and\/or by a provider of the application , so that the user of the application  is unburdened of associated efforts and responsibilities. Even as new printers are introduced into the marketplace over time, the user may have the experience that the application  is able to utilize the new printer(s) simply by way of registration of the new printers with the cloud print service , as described in detail, below.","Print jobs received at the application manager  in the printer-independent or generic format may be passed to a format converter , which may be configured to receive a print job from the application manager  and facilitate or execute conversion of the print job into a format associated with the designated (type of) printer for the print job in question. Such conversion may thus generally include, as needed, conversion of the print data itself, as well as conversion of the print characteristics specified within a given print job.","For example, printers generally require low-level, device or type-specific instructions which provide a basis by which printers actually apply ink to paper to achieve a desired appearance. Such instructions therefore may include very specific portrayal of the desired print outcome, using, e.g., a Page Description Language (PDL). For example, the language PostScript may be used to describe a desired print outcome, and then rendered (e.g., rasterized) by a specific printer to generate printed text or images. Additionally, fixed-layout document formats exist which are designed to facilitate device-independent printing while maintaining document fidelity. For example, the portable document format (.pdf) is an example of such a format, where .pdf documents may be generated using PostScript. Somewhat similarly, the XML Paper Specification (XPS) provides such a fixed-layout document format, which is based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML).","Print data may be received from the application  in virtually any format, including, e.g., Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), or in a format associated with document processing and\/or images (e.g., .jpeg), or in the PDF or XPS formats referenced above. The format converter  may thus be configured to receive print data in these and other various formats and convert the print data into a format that is recognizable by a designated printer.","Similarly, the format converter  may be configured to convert the print characteristics associated with the print job into a format that is recognizable by the designated printer. That is, as referenced above, the print characteristics may include aspects of how the print data should or can be printed; i.e., based on preferences of the user and\/or on capabilities (or lack thereof) of the designated printer(s). For example, the legacy printer  may be a black-and-white printer with no two-sided printing abilities, while the cloud-aware printer  may be a color printer with two-sided printing. The format converter  may then provide conversion, accordingly, depending on a selected printer.","The format converter  may provide and execute the resulting, converted print job using, e.g., a protocol referred to herein as a cloud print protocol (CPP). Thus, the cloud print protocol allows the cloud print service to communicate with the cloud-aware printer  or the legacy printer . Further detail and other aspects of the cloud print protocol are described in more detail, below.","The converted print job may be stored in a data store , illustrated as job store  in . Although illustrated separately in  for the sake of clarity and description, it may be appreciated that the job store  may overlap or coincide with the data stores ,  of the registration manager . That is, for example, print jobs of a given user may be stored in conjunction with the user account of the user, and in conjunction with one or more printers registered to that user. As a result, print jobs may be committed to long-term storage, so that, for example, users may locate, identify, and re-print desired print jobs, even if the user later accesses the cloud print service  from a different device than was used to originally send a given print job.","Thus, it may be observed that conversion of the print job at leas partially occurs at a separate device(s) (e.g., the cloud print server , the cloud-aware printer , the device , or the router ) from the device(s) on which the originating application is executing (e.g., the device , the application server , or the device ). In this way, for example, it is possible to formulate and submit a print job at least partially separately from a conversion of the print job into a printer-specific format, and to thereby divorce such conversion from an underlying operating system of the executing application.","A print job router  may be configured to route the converted print job to a designated printer, and otherwise monitor and mediate execution and success\/failure of the print job. The print job router  may thus be responsible for managing and monitoring on-going print jobs from a plurality of users which are designated for a corresponding plurality of printers, as described in detail, below.","In so doing, the print job router  may be configured to execute, e.g., with a print client  executing on firmware  of the cloud-aware printer . The print client  may communicate with the cloud print service , e.g., with the print job router  and\/or the registration manager , using the cloud print protocol referenced above.","More specifically, the print client  may be configured to register the cloud-aware printer  with the cloud print service , and to thereby associate the thus-registered printer  with a user of the device . Moreover, the print client  may be configured to actually drive the cloud-aware printer  and thereby execute the desired printing.","In the example of , the cloud-aware printer  is illustrated as including the print client  within the firmware . The firmware , as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art, may represent factory-installed hardware and\/or software which provides designated functions without generally requiring or allowing user modification or configuration (e.g., may utilize read-only memory). Thus, the cloud-aware printer  may be pre-configured from before a time of purchase to communicate and coordinate with the cloud print service , to thereby provide a convenient and enjoyable user experience.","For example, the cloud aware printer  may include a network access manager , user input , and a display (or other user output) , which may generally represent conventional components that are not described here in detail except as needed to assist in understanding the operation of the system . Of course, the cloud-aware printer  also may include other conventional components, which are not discussed here for the sake or clarity and conciseness.","The network access manager  may represent associated hardware and\/or software which enables the cloud-aware printer  to communicate over the network  with the cloud print service . For example, such communication may be conducted wirelessly if the cloud-aware printer  is within range of an appropriate wireless network. In other examples, the network access manager  may enable a wired connection of the cloud-aware printer  to the network , e.g., by way of connection to a router such as the router .","The user input  may represent virtually any sort of keypad, stylus, or other techniques for entering data to the cloud-aware printer . Similarly, the display  may represent virtually any sort of audio and\/or video display to output information to a user of the cloud-aware printer .","In example scenarios, then, a user may purchase the cloud-aware printer . Upon powering, the cloud-aware printer  may automatically output or identify the cloud print service , e.g., by printing a URL or other identifier on paper loaded in a paper tray of the cloud-aware printer , or by displaying such information using the display . Similarly, the cloud-aware printer  may output registration information for itself, e.g., a serial number or other unique identifier.","Then, in one example scenario, the purchaser may use the device  or other network device to communicate with the cloud print service , e.g., by using a browser to visit a website of the cloud print service  provided by the cloud print server . The user\/purchaser may then log into his or her user account associated with the cloud print service  and be prompted to enter the registration information for the cloud-aware printer .","In other example implementations, the user input  and display  may similarly be used to communicate directly with the cloud print service  using the network access manager . For example, upon powering, the cloud-aware printer  may automatically connect to the cloud print service  using the print client  and the network access manager , and then use the display  to prompt the user\/purchaser to login to the cloud print service , to thereby automatically associate the cloud-aware printer  as being registered to the user\/purchaser.","In contrast, the legacy printer  may not be manufactured to include the print client  and\/or other components of the cloud-aware printer . For example, the legacy printer  may have been manufactured prior to an availability of the cloud print service , or simply may have been made without the necessary components to communicate with the cloud print service .","In such a case, the legacy printer  may be connected in a conventional way to the device  (e.g., by USB or other suitable wired or wireless connection). For example, the device  may include an operating system , which may be used to host a print client  which is conceptually similar to the print client , and which serves as a proxy for the legacy printer  to thereby allow the legacy printer  to participate in the system .","In some implementations, the print client\/proxy  may communicate directly with the legacy printer  to execute a print job from the cloud print service . In other implementations, the operating system  may have a conventional printer driver  installed for the legacy printer , in which case the system  may leverage some or all of the functionality of the print driver  to drive the legacy printer .","Thus, in operation, the print client\/proxy  may be configured to register the legacy printer  with the registration manager  (printer manager ) of the cloud print service , in a similar manner(s) as described above and depending on a presence or absence of capabilities of the legacy printer  (e.g., whether the legacy printer  includes network access, user input and\/or display components).","Once registered, an application  which may desire to print to the legacy printer  may communicate a print job to the cloud print service , e.g., in the manner described above with respect to the application . As the legacy printer  is thus incorporated and integrated into the system , it may be appreciated that the application  and\/or the application  may thus print to the legacy printer , as easily as to the cloud-aware printer . For example, a user of the device  may use the application  to execute a print job to the legacy printer , even if the legacy printer  is remote from the device  over the network at the time of the printing.","Similarly, a print client  may be installed as a proxy component on the router , as an addition or alternative to the print client , to integrate the legacy printer  into the system . The print client (proxy)  may thus similarly allow for registration of the legacy printer  with the cloud print service  and with one or more users (e.g., of the device  and\/or the device ), and may accept print jobs from the cloud print service  which are designated for the legacy printer .","Many features and advantages are provided by the system  and variations thereof, as referenced herein and\/or as would be apparent to one of skill in the art. For example, as described, the system  facilitates remote printing in a straight-forward and easily implementable fashion, because a user need only log in to the cloud print service  and register a printer using any device (e.g., personal computer, smartphone or other mobile device, or a printer itself). Then, the user can thereafter login to the cloud print service  from any device, anywhere on the network , and send a print job to the thus-registered printer from any compatible application, even if the device and printer are remote from one another.","In other example implementations, it is possible to share printers between different users. For example, techniques currently exist for sharing documents in existing cloud-based document processing\/management systems, such as when a first user sends an email to a second user with a link to a document to be shared. With the system , such techniques and concepts can be extended to the realm of printing. For example, the first user may send a link referencing a printer to be shared (e.g., referencing or including registration information for the printer), so that the second, receiving user may simply follow the link to associate the identified printer with the second user's cloud print service user account. In these and other scenarios, users may, e.g., print documents directly to a receiving user, or print work documents to a home printer (or vice versa), and otherwise experience the benefits of remote printing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","214","200","202","214"]},"In the example of , a print request may be received at a server, over a network and from an application executing on a device (). For example, as described above, the application manager  may receive a print request from a user of the application  executing on the device , or of the application  executing on the application server , or of the application  of the device . The print request may be received over the network  using an API that is common to the application \/\/ and the application manager .","A user account associated with a user of the application may be determined at the server (). For example, the application manager  may conduct authentication of the user of the application in question, e.g., in conjunction with the registration manager . The authentication may occur prior to the print request, or in response thereto.","A print dialog may be provided over the network to the user in association with the application, the print dialog configured to provide for a selection of at least one printer associated with the user account (). For example, the application manager  may determine that both of the printers ,  are registered and associated with the user account of the user in question. Then, the application manager  may render the print dialog in conjunction with the application, and including a selection between the two printers , .","A selected printer from the selection may be received, via the print dialog (). For example, the application manager  may receive a selection of either the cloud-aware printer  or the legacy printer .","A print job designating the selected printer may be received at the server, the print job including print data and print characteristics expressed in a first format (). For example, the application manager  may receive the print job designating either of the printers , . The print job, as described, may include both the actual print data to be printed, as well as print characteristics specifying a manner in which the print data is to be printed, relative to printer capabilities of the selected printer(s). For example, such print characteristics may include a designation of one-sided versus two-sided printing, paper size, paper tray, color versus black-and-white, and various other such well-known print characteristics.","The print job, including the print data and such print characteristics, may be expressed in the first format as a printer-independent format. That is, the print job may be communicated to the application manager  by way of an appropriate API and in a manner which is generic or agnostic with respect to the selected printer, or to any printer. Consequently, the application in question need not have any knowledge of the printer to be used, even after the printer has been selected, in order to transmit the print job.","The print job may be converted from the first format into a printer-specific format associated with the selected printer (). For example, the format converter  may be configured to convert the first (e.g., printer-independent) format into a printer-specific format for a selected one of the printers , . As may be appreciated, and as described herein, the term printer-specific in this context may include, e.g., reference to a specific type, category, or brand of printer, or to a uniquely-identified printer. The print job in the printer-specific format may include a full rasterization of the print job for use in printing by the selected printer (e.g., when the selected printer includes the cloud-aware printer), or may include a partial conversion so that final rasterization may occur later (e.g., at the print client (proxy)  and\/or the print driver  of the device , as described herein).","The print job may be routed over the network from the server to a print client associated with the selected printer for printing by the selected printer, using the printer-specific format (). For example, the print job router  may be configured to route the print job to the print client  of the cloud-aware printer , or to the print client(s) \/ of the legacy printer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 1","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":"102"},"In , a user may be registered with the cloud print service  (). For example, as referenced above, a user wishing to use the cloud print service  may visit a web site thereof and establish a user account, e.g., by providing a username\/password combination. In other scenarios, the user may visit the cloud print service website or a related website (e.g., an online email provider), and associate an existing user account of the related website with the cloud print service . The user account information may then be established and stored by (or accessed by) the user manager  and\/or the registered users data store .","In , a single cloud print service  is illustrated. However, it may be appreciated that the network  may be used by multiple providers to provide multiple cloud print services. For example, a printer manufacturer may provide a cloud print service for its printers, while a 3party provider for more general cloud computing may provide the cloud print service  as an auxiliary feature for its existing cloud-based computing platform, and therefore as a general service which is not specific to any particular type of printer.","Once a user account is established or available, a new printer may be determined (), such as when a new printer is purchased and powered on, or when a given user gains access to a previously-inaccessible printer. For example, if the new printer is cloud-aware (), the registration of the cloud-aware printer with the cloud print service  may proceed directly, such as described above (). For example, as described, the user may login to the cloud print service  through an associated website or using the cloud-aware printer  itself, and registration information identifying the cloud-aware printer  may be entered by the user or received automatically by the cloud print service  over the network .","If the new printer is not cloud-aware, e.g., is a legacy printer such as the legacy printer , then it may be determined whether a print client is available on a device associated with the legacy printer  (). If not, then it may be necessary to install such a print client proxy on an associated device (), such as on the device  and\/or associated router , as shown in . For example, the user may execute such an installation by visiting the website of the cloud print service , and following a link to download an appropriate print client \/.","If the legacy printer  requires an associated conventional print driver in addition to the print client \/, e.g., from a manufacturer of the legacy printer , then such software also may be downloaded or otherwise installed an the appropriate device (), e.g., on the device  or the router .","Then, e.g., using the print client, the legacy printer  may be registered with the cloud print service . As with the cloud-aware printer, such registration may include providing of a unique identifier for the legacy printer , as well as other information which may be required by, or useful to, the cloud print service . For example, such registration information may include printer capabilities of the legacy printer , such as whether and how the legacy printer  provides color printing, two-sided printing, or other print features, and, further, details of the legacy printer  such as a number and location of paper trays, detailed information on how to report paper jams or other exceptions or malfunctions, and other information characterizing the legacy printer .","Again, such registration information may also be required by, or useful for, the cloud print service  with respect to the cloud-aware printer . However, in the case of the cloud-aware printer , it may occur that such registration information is provided automatically by the cloud-aware printer , or at least partially provided at an earlier stage, such as at a time of manufacture of the cloud-aware printer . In the latter case, for example, it may occur that a printer manufacturer provides the cloud print service  for all of its printers. In such a case, the printer manufacturer may know or may determine any needed registration information (e.g., printer capabilities) when initially manufacturing each printer for sale. Then, during an actual registration of a specific cloud-aware printer, it may only be necessary to transmit a minimal amount of information to identify the specific printer uniquely for association with one or more users.","In the above examples, it is assumed that the printer(s) to be registered are being registered with the account(s) of logged-in users who wish to access a new printer. As a further technique for registering printers, and as referenced above, it may occur that already-registered printers of a first user may be associated (shared) with an already-registered second user.","For example, a share request may be received from a user (), identifying a registered printer to be shared and identifying one or more users to receive the share request. The share request may be provided, e.g., by email, to the identified user(s). Then, the registered printer(s) may be designated as shared with the designated users (). That is, a receiving\/second user may thereafter have some or all printing rights with respect to the shared printer.","In the example flowchart of , it is assumed that all relevant users and printers are registered with the cloud print service , and that a user, e.g., a user of the device  and\/or , may wish to print to either the cloud-aware printer  or the legacy printer .","Initially, then, the cloud print service , e.g., the print job router , may be configured to periodically check a status of a printer(s), using a corresponding print client (). For example, the print job router  may be aware that the cloud-aware printer  is available, as long as the cloud-aware printer  is powered on at a given time. On the other hand, checking a status of the legacy printer  may require that the router  and\/or the device  is\/are both powered (e.g., so that corresponding print client(s) \/ is\/are available). In the present context, printer status may include a determination as to whether a given printer is available, or is currently experiencing an exception (e.g., paper jam), and\/or a determination as to a current number of print jobs queued for the printer in question.","At some point in time, a print request may be received from an application (). For example, a user of the device  may be using the application , e.g., by reading an email or other document, or by viewing an image within an image viewing application. Within the application, the user may select a print option, e.g., by using a generally conventional technique(s), such as selecting from within a drop-down menu, or selecting a printer icon displayed within the application. Such action may initiate or execute a communication between the application  and the application manager , so as to notify the application manager  that a print job may be forthcoming.","It may be necessary to authorize the user () as being allowed to proceed with printing. For example, the need may exist to ensure that the user in question has a user account established with the cloud print service .","User authorization techniques are generally well-known, and not discussed here in detail. In general, though, the application manager  may communicate with the user manager  to verify that the user has provided a valid username\/password, or otherwise been authenticated. If the user does not have a valid user account, then a user account may be established. Of course, it may occur that user authorization occurs prior to receipt of a print request, as well.","For the authorized user, the application manager  may then communicate with the printer manager  to determine which registered printers from the registered printers  are associated with the user's account, including any printers shared with the user by another user (). For example, the application manager  may determine that the user is associated with both the cloud-aware printer  and with the legacy printer . Based on the status checks referenced above by the print job router, it may be assumed that both printers ,  have been determined to be available for printing.","As referenced herein, the user may be remote from the printers , , e.g., may be using a mobile device as the device , and may be walking, riding within a car, or otherwise in an environment not currently considered optimal or feasible for printing. Further, the user may be using the application , which may similarly represent an application not currently associated with optimal or feasible printing options (e.g., web applications, as referenced above).","Nonetheless, simply by selecting \u201cprint\u201d and signing into the cloud print service , such a user may be presented with full printing options for all registered and available printers. For example, the cloud-aware printer  may represent a work printer, while the legacy printer  is a home printer of the user. In another example, and continuing the example above in which the device  represents a mobile device, e.g., a smartphone, it may occur that the user is talking to another user who owns the cloud-aware printer . The device user may use online capabilities of the device  to select and purchase tickets, e.g., tickets to a show, or airline tickets. Then, the device user may select the cloud-aware printer  of the other user to print the tickets, so that the two users may both meet later at a rendezvous point and may both have hard copies of the needed tickets.","Continuing the example operations of  in more detail, once the printers ,  are determined as being associated with the user of the device , the application manager  may present the user with a print dialog including a list of the available printers , , and\/or current information about capabilities or a status of each printer ().","As referenced above, and as described in more detail below with respect to , the application manager  may provide such a print dialog either directly or indirectly. That is, in either case the application manager  may access a suitable API to interact with the application . In a first example, a suitable API may be used to actually render a print dialog within the application , where a presentation and other aspects of an appearance of such a print dialog may be determined exclusively by the application manager . In such cases, such print dialogs are thus provided by the cloud print service  and may therefore be consistent in appearance and content within and among various applications. For example, the cloud print service  may be included within, or operate in conjunction with, a suite of applications (e.g., email applications, image viewing applications, and any other cloud-based\/web applications). Consequently, there may be value to a provider of such a suite of application to have the cloud print service  provide a uniform print dialog across multiple applications. Further, it may be easiest and most straight-forward for a developer of the application  to integrate and utilize the API(s) of the application manager by using a provided print dialog.","In other example implementations, however, an application developer may specifically wish to develop a specific print dialog to be associated with the application , which may be different from a default print dialog provided by the application manager . For example, such a choice may be a matter of preference as to an appearance or functionality of the print dialog. In other examples, and conversely to the examples above, it may occur that the application  is itself part of a suite of applications, and, further, that each application within such a suite may be compatible with multiple cloud print services. In such a case, the application developer may wish to provide a uniform print dialog across all of the application suite and cloud print services. Consequently, the application manager  may use a suitable API (or aspects thereof) to provide the application  with information necessary to render a print dialog, and the application itself may be responsible for an actual desired rendering.","However the print dialog is provided, it may subsequently occur that the user selects from the provided printer list, e.g., from the printers , , and then is provided with printer options associated with a selected printer. Upon selecting from these options, the user may then submit, and the application manager  may then receive, the print job from the selected printer (), including the actual print data and the selected print characteristics. As referenced and described herein, the print job may be communicated to the application manager using a corresponding API, and in a format that is independent of the selected printer (e.g., in a format that would be the same for the same print job for either printer , , regardless of which printer ,  was actually selected). In this way, the application  need not have any awareness or knowledge of the selected printer, other than allowing for the actual selection thereof by the user from within the print dialog.","At the cloud print service , the received print job may then be converted into a printer format for the selected printer (). For example, the format converter  may be configured to convert the printer-independent format into a format associated with the cloud-aware printer  or the legacy printer , depending on a selection of the user.","The print job may then be stored in association with the user account of the user (), e.g., within the job storage . The print job may be stored in either the printer-independent format as received from the application , or in the printer format associated with the selected printer. In either case, as referenced above, such persistent storage of the print job in association with the user account allows for later location and printing of the same print job at a later date, without having to re-generate the document to be printed (e.g., without having to visit a website at which a document was originally generated).","The print job may then be output to a corresponding print client (). For example, the print job router  may output the converted print job to either of the printers , , or both, depending on which was selected earlier. If the selected printer does not include a cloud-aware printer (), e.g., includes a legacy printer, then the print job may be received at the local print client and communicated to the local print driver (e.g., may be received at the print client(s) \/ and communicated to the print driver ).","It may be appreciated that the burden of converting the print job from the printer-independent format received from the application  for actual printing at one of the printers , , may be shared to varying extents between the format converter  and the various print clients , , . For example, in one example using the cloud aware printer , the format converter  may provide essentially the entire process of determining printer commands for the cloud-aware printer . In this case, the print client  may be used to receive the print job for forwarding to appropriate printer hardware (e.g., processor(s) driving the associated ink dispensers). In such a case, the cloud-aware printer  may be very inexpensive to manufacture, with minimal hardware\/software requirements.","In other scenarios, the format converter  may execute a partial format conversion, and the print clients , ,  may be more involved in calculating or otherwise determining actual, low-level printer commands. Such a practice may be suitable, for example, where a manufacturer of the printer in question has certain specific needs or requirements which are not readily compatible with the cloud print service , or, in other cases, where the printer in question already has the processing capabilities to be responsible for a certain amount of the conversion process. In the latter case, although such printers may be relatively more expensive due to supporting the associated hardware and software requirements associated with the conversion(s), it may make sense simply to leverage such existing resources if they do already exist, rather than support them independently at the cloud print service . In particular, the legacy printer  may already have a relatively large amount of hardware\/software resources, including the print driver , so that it may make sense to perform a relatively small proportion of the format conversion process at the format converter , while allowing the print client \/ and the print driver  to finalize and execute a final print job.","In either case, the print job may proceed with execution (), during which the print job router , having provided the print job, may continue to maintain the print job status for provision to the application , as needed (). For example, after execution of the print job begins, a paper jam may occur at the legacy printer . Then, the print job router  may become aware of the paper jam through the print client , and may thereafter output a notification to the application , perhaps using the print dialog of the application manager .","Assuming any such exceptions may be resolved, the print job may be completed (). At a later time, as referenced above, a request may be received for a previous, stored print job (). For example, a user of the application  may select \u201cprint,\u201d and the resulting print dialog may include an option to select previous print jobs, whereupon such previous print jobs may be retrieved from the job storage  (). For example, the user may be provided the options of identifying previous print jobs by search terms, dates of printing, or other selection criteria. Then, the user may execute a selected, previous print job, and, moreover, may execute such a print job using any registered printer associated with the user ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","102","102"]},"In the example of , the cloud print service  is illustrated as including a print dialog API , which is in communication with a tickler . The tickler  may be operable to send notification(s) of new print jobs available for a given printer(s).","Then, upon authorization of a user by the print dialog API , a list of printers, associated printer capabilities, and current jobs per printer and other status information may be provided to the application user, e.g., by way of a common print dialog , which may be rendered, e.g., using Javascript. As already explained, such a print dialog  may, in appearance, resemble conventional print dialogs, except as otherwise set forth herein (e.g., may allow for selection of an available printer and associated print features). In an example of a non-conventional aspect of the common print dialog , the common print dialog  may include a field(s) to allow a user to search and identify a previous\/stored print job that is persistently stored by the cloud print service .","The print dialog API  may thus provide (e.g., render) the common print dialog  essentially in its entirety for the application user, and thereby provide a common print dialog experience across applications interfacing with the cloud print service . As also described, the print dialog API also may simply provide sufficient information for an application developer to construct a third party dialog , which may be different in appearance than the common print dialog , e.g., may have a proprietary appearance associated with a suite of applications provided by the developer\/provider thereof.","Assuming authorization of the user proceeds, the user may then provide printer selection(s) and associated desired print characteristics, as well as the actual print data. The print data may be expressed in any conventional format, e.g., HTML, PDF, XPS, or an image format such as JPG, to name a few.","The print job may then be received at a job submit API , e.g., from either dialog , . In some implementations, the print data may be included by reference to remote print data, e.g., by identification of an appropriate URL. Then, an application data fetcher  may be used to retrieve data to be printed.","The job submit API  may receive the print job in, to give a specific and non-limiting example(s), a hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) multi-part request which may include the printer capabilities expressed, e.g., in XPS, as well as a MIME type identifying the content type. The job submit API may then provide the print job, including the print data and print characteristics, to a format converter . The format converter  operates essentially as described herein with respect to the format converter  of , and stores the print job within storage .","A print client , which may represent any of the print clients , ,  of , communicates with a job control API  and a job fetch API , to execute the print job. Specifically, the job fetch API  may provide the print job to the print client , e.g., may be used by the print client  to fetch the next available job for the specified printer.","The job control API  may be responsible for authorizing the print client  as needed, and for receiving updated status information from the printer in question, such as whether the print job has completed or failed. Such status information may also be stored within the storage  in associated with a corresponding print job. The job control API may include status information including, e.g., whether a print job is currently queued and not yet downloaded to a corresponding print client , or spooled\/downloaded and added to the client side native printer queue (if applicable).","In further examples of the print client as the print client proxy , it may occur that the proxy fetches print jobs in PDF format, along with the user-selected print characteristics represented as XML. Then, the proxy may use a PDF interpreted library to rasterize and print the PDF.","Finally in , a user\/printer register API  is illustrated which is responsible for communicating with the print client  to register the user(s) and all associated printers. Such registration information may be communicated using a HTTP multi-part request, and may include identification of the printer along with the printer capabilities (e.g., expressed in XPS), and may be stored in the storage  with the various print jobs. Further, as referenced above with respect to , such registration processes and information may occur previously to actual print job executions, or interspersed therewith. In the latter case, for example, the user may seek to execute a print job only to find that all available printers are currently occupied, jammed, or offline. Nonetheless, it would be a simple matter for the user then to register a new printer with the cloud print service  and proceed accordingly with the newly-registered printer to execute the desired print job.","Many other examples and variations of the systems and operations of  would be apparent to one skilled in the art.

In such cases, the cloud-aware printer  may be equipped with instances of the user input  and the user display  which enable the user to register and authenticate the cloud-aware printer . For example, the user may plug in the cloud aware printer , which may then recognize a local wireless network, whereupon the user may use the user input  and display  to enter a password for the network. Then, either automatically and\/or under user direction, the cloud aware printer  may establish a communications connection with the cloud print service . The user may then authenticate with the cloud print service  and request registration of the cloud aware printer  in question. Thereafter, the cloud aware printer  is associated with the users account and may be used by the user for print jobs.","In other scenarios, however, the cloud aware printer  may not be equipped with either or both of versions of the described hardware (e.g., user input  or display ) and\/or the underlying software (e.g., firmware) functionality required to implement the above registration scenarios. For example, a manufacturer may wish to manufacture a cloud aware printer which is inexpensive and thus has a reduced feature set.  thus provides examples where registration and authentication of the cloud aware printer  may proceed in a simplified manner, which requires minimal resources on the part of the cloud aware printer , yet is convenient for a user who wishes to register and authenticate the cloud aware printer . More specifically, as described in detail herein,  provides examples in which registration of the cloud aware printer  may occur anonymously, without (initial or pre-existing) knowledge of a particular user or association with a user account thereof. Afterwards, the user may claim the printer for association with his or her account and subsequent use for print jobs.","In the example of , the cloud print service  is illustrated in a reduced form which does not include various components included in the example of  which are described above and which are not necessary for understanding the registration\/authentication operations of . Of course, it may be understood that these and additional or alternative components may be included in the cloud print service  and operated in an appropriate manner(s) in conjunction with the registration\/authentication processes described herein.","Thus, the cloud print service  as illustrated in  includes the previously-illustrated and described registration manager , which includes the printer and user managers , , as well as their respective repositories ,  of registered printers and users. Additionally,  is illustrated as including an anonymous printer registration module . The anonymous printer registration module  is illustrated in  as a separate component; however, it will be appreciated that such illustration is merely for the sake of clarity and convenience, and that the anonymous printer registration module may be implemented in a number of different embodiments, e.g., separately as shown, or wholly or partially included within one or both of the managers , .","In , the anonymous printer registration module  is illustrated as conducting message exchanges of messages -with each of the cloud aware printer  and\/or the user device  (examples of the user device  are provided above). For purposes of this description, the messages -are itemized alphabetically in order to indicate a corresponding order of occurrence thereof in the example of . That is, the messages -generally occur (e.g., are transmitted) temporally in the alphabetical order illustrated. However, it will be appreciated that, in other examples, some of the messages -may occur in a different order than that shown, or may overlap or occur in parallel. Moreover, some additional or alternative messages may be included beyond the example messages -shown in , and\/or, in alternative embodiments, one or more of the messages -may be omitted.","In , the cloud aware printer  is illustrated as including a registration requester , which generally represents any hardware and\/or software implemented by the cloud aware printer  to initiate the anonymous registration process. For example, a user of the user device  may be in proximity to the cloud aware printer , and may use an appropriate button or other portion of the user input  to initiate the anonymous registration process. More specifically, for example, there may be a menu option provided with the display  and selectable by the user input  for initiating an anonymous registration of the cloud aware printer .","Thus, upon initiation of the anonymous registration process, the registration requester  may transmit a registration request . The registration request may include, for example, relevant information regarding characteristics of the cloud aware printer, such as, e.g., print capabilities thereof (e.g., whether the cloud aware printer offers double-sided printing, color printing, or other known print capabilities), or any features, defaults, or characteristics of the cloud aware printer  (many of which are described above) which may be useful to the cloud print service  in determining whether and how to communicate with, or otherwise utilize, the cloud aware printer  during potential future print jobs. In the example of , the registration specifically does not include authentication credentials associated with a user account of the user of the user device ; instead, as described herein, registration of the cloud aware printer  may proceed anonymously, and the cloud aware printer  may be associated with the relevant user account(s) at a later stage.","The registration requester  may transmit the registration request via a secure network connection (e.g., HTTPS) to a pre-configured Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other address associated with the cloud print service . For example, there may be a number of entities each offering their own cloud print service, and the cloud aware printer  may be pre-configured or factory-configured with a corresponding network address for each. Thus, for example, the display  may display each such potential provider of a cloud print service, so that, as referenced above, the user input  may be used to select a desired provider so that the registration request may be transmitted accordingly.","The cloud print service , e.g., the anonymous registration module , may thus receive the registration request and provide a registration response in return. For example, a claim code provider  of the anonymous printer registration module  may provide a unique claim code that is to be provided to the user by way of the cloud aware printer . As described herein, the claim code may be provided with a time-to-live (TTL), after which the claim code will expire and be invalid.","Further, a claim URL provider  may provide a specific URL at which the claim code will be provided by the user. A printer ID provider  may generate a unique printer ID to be assigned to the cloud aware printer. Finally, in some example implementations, a polling URL provider  may provide a polling URL that the cloud aware printer  may use to complete an authentication process. Specific example uses and implementations of each of the claim code, claim URL, printer ID, and polling URL are provided in detail below, with respect to relevant ones of messages -","Specifically, the anonymous printer registration module  may transmit the claim code, claim URL, printer ID, and polling URL within the registration response . In some implementations, one or more of the claim code, claim URL, printer ID, and polling URL may be provided in separate messages, rather than within the single registration response ","After the exchange of the messages \/, the cloud aware printer  may be considered to be anonymously registered with the cloud print service , in that the cloud print service  has necessary information for communicating with the cloud aware printer , yet the cloud aware printer  is not associated at this stage with any user of the registered users  (and, specifically, is not associated with the user (or associated user account) of the device ).","Subsequently, a claim facilitator  of the cloud aware printer  may provide the received claim code and claim URL to the user of the user device  who initiated the registration process, by way of message . For example, the claim facilitator  may cause the cloud aware printer  to initiate a print job and print a page which contains the claim code and claim URL (e.g., where the claim code may be embedded or included within the claim URL). An example of such a page is illustrated and described below with respect to . In other examples, the claim facilitator  may provide the claim code and claim URL using the display , or by communicating the claim code and claim URL to the user device . In another example, the claim facilitator  may provide a separate URL which the user may visit to obtain the claim code and claim URL therefrom. In yet another example, the claim facilitator  may provide a Quick Review (QR) code which may contain or reference the claim code and\/or claim URL. In these latter scenarios, as discussed below, the QR code may be read by the user device  (if equipped to do so) and then used to transmit the claim code to the claim URL.","The user device , as illustrated, may include user input  associated with a display . For example, the user input  and display  may include a keyboard\/monitor, or a touchscreen of a mobile device, or any appropriate hardware\/software for receiving input from the user and displaying the results of such input(s). As also illustrated, the display  may be used to provide a user interface, such as, e.g., a conventional browser or other graphical user interface.","Thus, upon receipt of the claim URL and claim code, the user may authenticate with the cloud print service  (if not already authenticated), e.g., by logging onto the cloud print service  by providing a username\/password combination at a website of the cloud print service , for validation by the user manager  against a corresponding username\/pas sword combination stored in conjunction with registered users . Then, the user may enter the claim URL into the user interface , using the user input , to thereby visit a website provided by the anonymous printer registration module , e.g., by a printer matcher . An example of such a website is provided and illustrated below with respect to .","At the website, the user may enter the previously provided claim code and thereby transmit the claim code in a message to the printer matcher . Upon receipt thereof, the printer matcher  may identify the cloud aware printer  based on a corresponding of the claim code with the previously-provided claim code and associated printer ID. Then, based thereon, the printer matcher  may associate the identified printer  with a user account of the user of the device . The printer matcher  also may notify an authentication manager  of the anonymous printer registration module  that a successful matching has occurred, and thereby grant permission to the authentication manager  to proceed with an authentication of the cloud aware printer  if possible.","The printer matcher  may provide a claim confirmation in a message to the user of the user device . For example, the claim confirmation may be generated for inclusion in the claim URL page, and is illustrated as such in the example of . Thus, the claim confirmation of message may indicate to the user that the cloud aware printer  has successfully been registered and associated with the user's account.","Meanwhile, or subsequently, an authentication manager  of the cloud aware printer  may generate an authentication request in a message transmitted to the authentication provider  at the anonymous printer registration module . More specifically, the authentication manager  may utilize the polling URL referenced above as being included within the registration response to perform periodic polling of the authentication provider , during which instances of the message , each including the previously-provided printer ID, may be sent to the authentication provider . Such polling may begin, in some examples, as soon as (or shortly after) the claim facilitator  provides the message including the claim code and claim URL.","Thus, once the printer matcher  has notified the authentication provider  of the successful matching of the cloud aware printer  with the user account of the user of the user device , and once the authentication provider  subsequently receives the authentication request (e.g., as opposed to instances of the authentication request which may have been received prior to successful matching), the authentication provider  may generate and send an authentication credential or credentials in a message . For example, such an authentication credential may be included within an authentication cookie or an authentication header to be used in subsequent message exchanges between the cloud aware printer  and the cloud print service , or by any appropriate authentication technique.","The authentication credential(s) may be stored within a credential repository  (which also may be used, alone or in conjunction with another memory, to store the previously-received printer ID) for future use thereof during subsequent authentications and message exchanges between the cloud aware printer  and the cloud print service  (e.g., during future print jobs). As referenced above, and described in more detail below, it may occur that the claim code may be provided in association with a time-to-live (TTL), in which case the exchange of the authentication request and the authentication credential must occur prior to expiration of the claim code in order for successful authentication to occur. More detailed discussion of such implementations is provided below, e.g., with respect to .","In other examples, not specifically illustrated in the example of , the user may be required to notify the cloud aware printer  of receipt of the claim confirmation . In such implementations, the authentication manager  may proceed immediately with transmission of the authentication request , with some confidence that successful matching of the cloud aware printer  with the account of the user of the user device  has already occurred. For example, as described below with respect to , the cloud aware printer  may enter a wait mode upon providing of the claim code and claim URL in the message , during which the cloud aware printer  awaits a specific entry from the user indicating that the claim confirmation of the message has been received by the user.","Once the authentication credential of the message is successfully stored within the credential repository , the authentication manager  may provide an authentication confirmation to the user within a message . For example, as with the message , such confirmation may be provided by way of a printed page, a message displayed using the display , or by any appropriate technique for communicating with the user.","Thus, the user may thereafter be enabled to utilize the cloud aware printer  in any described, appropriate, or available manner in conjunction with the cloud print service . For example, the user may send print jobs to the cloud aware printer  from any appropriately-configured application or device, may share the cloud aware printer  with other ones of the registered users , or may otherwise take advantages of the features and function of the cloud aware printer  in the context of the cloud print service .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0173","num":"0172"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","602","604","604"],"i":["a","h "]},"In the example of , a registration request may be received at a cloud print service from a printer over a network (). For example, the anonymous printer registration module  may receive the registration request . In the example of , as described above in the example of , the registration request may be received via HTTPS or other secure network connection over the network , e.g., the public Internet, in response to an initiation of a registration\/authentication process by the user at the cloud-aware printer . The registration request , in the examples, does not include either user authentication credentials or other information regarding an account of the user as may be maintained by the user manager  in conjunction with the registered users . Further, in the examples, the registration request does not include any specific printer ID identifying the cloud aware printer  (e.g., a unique, factory or manufacturer-provided ID). Rather, as described herein, a unique printer ID may be assigned by the anonymous printer registration module .","Further with respect to , a registration response may be provided to the printer over the network, the registration response providing a claim code, wherein the printer is configured to provide the claim code to a user of the printer (). For example, the claim code provider  may generate a claim code for inclusion within the registration response . As described, the claim code provider  may be configured to generate the claim code as having a defined lifetime, after which the claim code will expire and be invalid. The defined lifetime may be selected as being adequate for the user to provide the claim code within the message , e.g., using the claim URL which also may be provided in the message as described above. For example, the lifetime may be defined as lasting three minutes, five minutes, or some other appropriate time.","Thus, the claim code may be received from the user over the network (). For example, the printer matcher  may receive the claim code within the message ","A user account of the user within the cloud print service may thus be matched with the printer, in response to the receipt of the claim code from the user ().

These example scenarios result in a number of possibilities by which the user may provide the claim code to the cloud print service . For example, from the printed page, if the user (e.g., the device ) does not have the capability of reading the QR code, then the user can manually enter the provided URL which will implicitly provide the claim code at the same time, and may ultimately receive a claim confirmation web page in response which confirms success of the claim confirmation. In other examples, if the user (device) is capable of reading the QR code, then the user may do so and remaining operations (e.g., transmitting the QR code to the printer matcher ) could be done automatically at that point (i.e., the QR code may include the URL\/claim code and the user device  may automatically use these to submit the claim code). In yet other implementations, the user device  may read the QR code, and then the user may be required to take affirmative steps to submit the result at the claim URL and thereby receive the claim confirmation.","In the example of , it may occur that the cloud aware printer  may then begin, or continue, visiting the polling URL included within the registration response message (), e.g., by sending authentication request from the authentication manager  to the authentication provider . As described, the authentication manager  may begin sending the authentication request , including the printer ID previously assigned, either as soon as the claim facilitator  provides the claim code\/URL to the user, or shortly thereafter (to provide time for the user to visit the claim URL and enter the claim code). The authentication manager  may send the authentication request periodically, e.g., every 30 seconds or at another appropriate time interval.","Thus, the user may or may not have successfully claimed the cloud aware printer  by the time of the (first) authentication request ().

The cloud aware printer , e.g., the authentication manager , may thus store the authentication header within the credential repository  ().","In the first instance, if desired, the user may thus proceed with sending a print job to the cloud aware printer  (). Once finished, the user may sign out (e.g., log out) of the user account of the user. Later, the user may wish to commence another print job, and may re-authenticate and select the cloud-aware printer  from among a number of printers associated with the user account of the user (). In this way, the cloud print service  may communicate the requested print job to the cloud aware printer , using the authentication header ().","At a later time, the user may wish to de-register the cloud-aware printer  (e.g., if the user wishes to return or throw away or recycle the cloud-aware printer). In such cases, the printer  (e.g., the registration requester ) may receive a request for such de-registration () and provide an appropriate interface (e.g., the user interface ) for executing such de-registration (). For example, such an interface may include an indication of de-registration and may receive a user selection of de-registration as an option. Based on such de-registration, the authentication manager  may delete the authentication credential stored in the credential repository  (). In other, related examples, a printer may be re-registered, e.g., simply by re-executing the registration processes and ultimately over-writing (and thus erasing) the previous authentication header or other credential. As may be noted, such de-registration may be executed locally to the cloud-aware printer , and any subsequent re-registration will occur as described herein and, as such, will result in the anonymous printer registration module  of the cloud print service  recognizing the cloud aware printer as a new printer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0197","num":"0196"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 6"],"b":["1002","1002","604"],"i":"c "},"As shown, the page  may include a message  which instructs the user that he\/she has approximately 14 minutes to register the printer, and to \u201c(p)lease visit https:\/\/example_claim_page.com and enter claim code 123ABC.
