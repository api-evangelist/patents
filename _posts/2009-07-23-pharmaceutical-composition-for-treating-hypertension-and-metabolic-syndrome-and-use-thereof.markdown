{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a national phase of International Application No. PCT\/CN2009\/000824 filed Jul. 23, 2009.","The present invention relates to the pharmaceutical field, and specifically relates to a pharmaceutical composition and use thereof in preparing a medicament for treating hypertension and metabolic syndrome.","Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, and is closely related to some of the most fatal human diseases, such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, etc. Although the incidence of hypertension in China is not as high as that in Western countries, it increases year by year. With the improvement of living standards and the degradation of the environment, the number of patients suffered from cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipemia and hypercholesterolemia keeps increasing. According to the report, the number of hypertension patients in China has reached 150 million by the end of 2003, and increases at a rate of 5 million per year. Great attention has been paid all over the world to the researches on hypertension, ranging from pathogenesis to clinical prevention and treatment of the disease. Hypertension mainly impairs the blood vessels of humans, rendering arterial angiosclerosis and arteriarctia, which are generally called \u201carteriosclerosis\u201d. When hypertension is combined with diabetes mellitus, the damage to blood vessels would become accelerated and more severe, and the conditions of patients would be worsened rapidly, to which active treatment should be applied.","Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that prevents calcium from transmembranely entering myocardial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, and thus has anti-hypertension effect. Amlodipine exists as two isoforms, levo-amlodipine and dextro-amlodipine, wherein the activity of levo-amlodipine is 1000 times as high as that of the dextroisomer, and twice as high as that of the racemate. Amlodipine exhibits higher selectivity on vascular smooth muscle than that of nifedipine, and can increase cardiac output and coronary flow of the patients suffered from myocardial ischemia, increase myocardial oxygen supply and decrease oxygen consumption, and improve locomotive ability. Additionally, amlodipine may also activate LDL receptor, reduce the accumulation of fat in artery wall, inhibit the synthesis of collagens, and thus has anti-arteriosclerosis effects. The anti-hypertension effect of amlodipine is based on the mechanism of direct relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. Although the exact angina-relieving mechanism thereof has not been ascertained, amlodipine can expand peripheral arteriola and coronary artery, reduce peripheral resistance, release coronary artery spasm, decrease cardiac after-load, reduce cardiac energy consumption and oxygen requirement, and thus relieve angina.","Rosuvastatin calcium is a synthesized statin drug which was developed by Shionogi Co., Ltd. (Shionogi Company, Osaka) and assigned to AstraZeneca UK Limited in April, 1998. Rosuvastatin is a selective 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and may be used in the treatment of atheroma, hyperlipemia, familial hypercholesterolemia and similar diseases. The molecular formula of rosuvastatin calcium is shown as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"37.59mm","wi":"114.89mm","file":"US08722697-20140513-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In view of the clinically testing results and the comparison data among statins, rosuvastatin calcium is indeed a \u201csuper statin\u201d, which has extremely good antilipemic effects, and is so far the most potent antilipemic drug.","Chinese Patent Application CN200510094723.3 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising 5-40 wt. % of amlodipine besylate and 5-40 wt. % of rosuvastatin calcium, and a method for preparing the same.","Chinese Patent Application CN200610028434.8 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of amlodipine and a therapeutically effective amount of rosuvastatin calcium, and a method for preparing the same.","Although the combination of amlodipine and rosuvastatin could bring both antihypertensive and antilipemic effects as described in the above two patent applications, these effects are not sufficient for hypertensive patients who may have high risk of cardiovascular diseases, as chronic hypertension may result in damages to key organs such as cardiovascular system and kidney. Accordingly, the objective of antihypertensive treatment is not only to reduce the blood pressure to desired level, but also to rectify the coexisting risk factors such as cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile, a suitable medicament shall be selected to improve metabolic disorders and prognosis of the patients. Therefore, it is desired in clinical treatment to find a multidrug combination therapy which could treat hypertensive diseases, while effectively controlling the incidence of associated cardiovascular diseases, and more potently improving the survival and prognosis of hypertensive patients.","The objective of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition for treating hypertension or metabolic syndrome, while effectively controlling the incidence of associated cardiovascular diseases, and more potently improving the survival and prognosis of hypertensive patients. While the blood pressure is reduced to desired level by the antihypertensive therapy, the coexisting risk factors such as cardiovascular diseases are rectified, metabolic disorders and prognosis of the patients are improved, and the survival rate of the hypertensive patients is increased.","The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises the following active ingredients:","1) amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;","2) pioglitazone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and","3) rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of amlodipine is selected from besylate, maleate, hydrochloride, formate, acetate, hydrobromate, aspartate, methanesulfonate, sulfate or tartrate.","In one embodiment of the present invention, amlodipine is levo-amlodipine or a mixture of levo-amlodipine and dextro-amlodipine.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the weight ratio of amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, pioglitazone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is 1:(0.1\u02dc18):(0.1\u02dc16), wherein the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of amlodipine is calculated as amlodipine, the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of pioglitazone is calculated as pioglitazone, and the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of rosuvastatin is calculated as rosuvastatin.","Preferably, the weight ratio of amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, pioglitazone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is 1:(0.1\u02dc9):(0.1\u02dc8), wherein the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of amlodipine is calculated as amlodipine, the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of pioglitazone is calculated as pioglitazone, and the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of rosuvastatin is calculated as rosuvastatin.","Preferably, the weight ratio of amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, pioglitazone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is 1:(0.1\u02dc4.5):(0.1\u02dc4), wherein the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of amlodipine is calculated as amlodipine, the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of pioglitazone is calculated as pioglitazone, and the weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of rosuvastatin is calculated as rosuvastatin.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of pioglitazone in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is preferably pioglitazone hydrochloride.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of rosuvastatin in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is preferably rosuvastatin calcium.","In view of recent progress of clinical research in antihypertensive therapy and the trend of the development of hypertensive diseases, the present invention inventively introduces pioglitazone, an anti-diabetes insulin sensitizer, into the existing antihypertensive therapy and achieves extraordinary treatment effects. The experiments demonstrate that the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention not only exhibits significant antihypertensive benefits, but also effectively reduces the damage to key organs such as cardiovascular system and kidney caused by chronic hypertension, effectively rectifies the coexisting risk factors such as cardiovascular diseases, improves metabolic disorders and prognosis of the patients, and achieves good and unexpected synergistic effects in the treatment and control of various cardiovascular complications caused by hypertension. The determination result of cardiac hypertrophy and carotid intima-media thickness in rats demonstrates that the pharmaceutical composition provided by the present invention can reverse cardiac hypertrophy and effectively control the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, which proves its advantages in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile, the determination result of urinary microalbumin in rats demonstrates that the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention also has renoprotective effects, and can effectively delay the damage to the kidney of hypertension patients.","It has been confirmed by a great deal of experimental researches that combined administration of one of a mixture of levo-amlodipine and dextro-amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or the besylate, maleate, hydrochloride, formate, acetate, hydrobromate, aspartate, methanesulfonate, sulfate or tartrate of amlodipine with pioglitazone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can also reverse cardiac hypertrophy in rats, exhibit remarkable antihypertensive effects, effectively reduce the damage to key organs such as cardiovascular system and kidney caused by chronic hypertension, effectively rectify the risk factors such as cardiovascular diseases, reduce urinary microalbumin, and protect kidney from damage caused by hypertension. Meanwhile, it can also improve metabolic disorders and exhibit treatment effects in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a use of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention in preparing a medicament for treating hypertension or metabolic syndrome.","The present invention also provides a method for treating hypertension or metabolic syndrome with the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, which comprises administration of an effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention to a patient in need of such treatment.","The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition as described above for treating hypertension or metabolic syndrome.","The term \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d refers to a pathological condition in which several metabolic disorders coexist in one single patient, and includes obesity (abdominal obesity), insulin resistance, impaired glucose regulation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbunminuria and hyperuricemia, etc. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can effectively reduce total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipid cholesterol (HDLC), glycated hemoglobin (HbAlC), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and fibrinogen (Fg) in patients with metabolic syndrome, effectively control associated symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, and reduce invalidism rate and fatality rate.","The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to a dosage of the pharmaceutical composition that could produce desired treatment effects in a patient.","The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be formulated into a solid pharmaceutical formulation, such as tablets, capsules, granules, pills, dripping pills, etc., depending on the properties of the drug and the requirements of convenient administration for the patients. Said tablets include general tablets, coated tablets, sugar-coated tablets, film-coated tablets, enteric-coated tablets, effervescent tablets, chewable tablets, multi-layered tablets, disintegrating tablets, dispersible tablets, sublingual tablets, buccal tablets, implant tablets, soluble tablets, sustained-release tablets, etc. The solid pharmaceutical formulation is employed in the present invention since it has the advantages of convenient carrying and usage, simple and feasible administration route, and good compliance of the patients.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be in the form of, but not limited to, tablets, capsules or granules.","The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be formulated following traditional techniques with the addition of traditional additives such as excipients (e.g., lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannose, sorbitol, starch, dextrin, crystalline cellulose, arabic gum, dextran, etc.), lubricants (magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, talc powder, micronized silica gel, boric acid, sodium dodecylsulfate, etc.), binders (hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, etc.), disintegrating agents (low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc.), emulsifiers (bentonite, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, sodium dodecylsulfate, etc.), stabilizers (methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, phenol, sorbic acid, dehydroacetic acid, etc.), flavoring agents (sucrose, flavors, aspartame, cyclodextrin, etc.), diluents, etc.","Additionally, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can also be formulated into sustained-release tablets according to the requirements of the patients, so as to regulate blood pressure effectively and safely, maintain a relatively stable plasma drug concentration and longer acting term by slow release, and have the advantages of reduced toxicity and side effects and convenient administration.","The sustained-release tablets prepared from the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention uses cellulose derivatives or vinyl polymer as the sustained-release matrix, wherein the matrix may be one or more of methyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxyethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and acrylic resin.","The advantages of the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention lie in the following aspects:","1. The present invention inventively introduces pioglitazone, an anti-diabetes insulin sensitizer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof into the existing antihypertensive therapy, and achieves very good synergetic antihypertensive effects.
