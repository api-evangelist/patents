Technical Field","The invention relates to the field of solid state image sensors, and more particularly to CMOS and CCD image sensor generated carrier to voltage conversion with high sensitivity and no kTC noise generation.","2. Background Art","Silicon based solid state CMOS and Charge Coupled Device (CCD) image sensors are particularly suitable for imaging in the visible spectrum. These image sensors are based on monolithic focal plane arrays which may have up to 100 million densely packed photodetectors, and a read-out multiplexer. The detector array samples the image by segmenting it into a two dimensional array of analog samples, where each photodetector provides an analog charge signal (or sample) proportional to the optical signals received by the photodetector. This arrangement yields a two dimensional densely packed array of analog charge samples that are processed by a CMOS or CCD read-out multiplexer. In addition to the x-y photodetector address function, the multiplexer converts the generated analog charge signal into a voltage. This charge-to-voltage read-out transduction is a very important operation for it determines the sensor's sensitivity, and operating speed. Accordingly, much attention is given to transduction of photons from the scene into analog voltage signals. The transduction process includes two steps: conversion of photons into charges, and conversion of charges into analog output voltage signal. With silicon, converting photons into charge signal is done directly by interband electron-hole excitation. This conversion process is a very efficient, low noise, and high speed process, and it alleviates the need for electrical injection of photosignals into CCD or CMOS devices. Conversion of generated charges into output voltage signal is more difficult and has a major impact on the imager's performance. Similarly, CCD signal, processors need transducers to convert charge signals to analog output voltages. Consequently, whether the charge signals are generated by photons or an electrical circuit, much attention has been focused on optimizing the charge-to-voltage read-out structures.","Conventional charge-to-voltage read-out circuits fall into two broad categories: destructive read-out and non-destructive read-out (NDRO). Destructive charge read-out uses a Field-Effect-Transistor (FET) to convert the charge to a voltage signal and is used with both CMOS and CCD imagers. The approach is to deposit directly, or indirectly, the signal charge on a precharged floating diffusion that is part of a p\/n junction. The charge changes the DC potential of the diffusion and a FET gate is used to sense this change. Read-out of many charge signals, with the same structure, is achieved by resetting the floating diffusion after each read-out operation. The approach for destructive read-out for a CMOS imager is the same as is used in a CCD. However the CCD's destructive read-out also incorporates charge transfer. A disadvantage of the destructive charge read-out method is that charging and discharging the FET gate's capacitance for read-out gives rise to kTC reset noise. The kTC reset noise is removed using the Correlated-Double-Sampling (CDS) technique and this has significantly improved the performance of destructive charge read-out. However, the inclusion of CDS circuits in the imaging system adds complexity and the technique is particularly difficult to apply at high frequencies. An advantage of the destructive charge read-out structure is the relative ease of fabrication that utilizes existing CCD and CMOS imager semiconductor processing technology.","In the NDRO approach, the charge signal inside a potential well is sensed electrostatically. The NDRO does not have kTC reset noise since the charge sensed is in a potential well and not on a capacitor's plate. Removal of the charge after sensing is by clocking the potential well wherein the charge resides. Clocking the potential well is different than removing charge present on a capacitor plate with a reset switch. In conventional destructive readout structures, removing charge from a capacitor's plate is with a rest switch and the switches' resistance gives rise, to kTC reset noise. NDRO charge read-out circuits remove charge after sensing by clocking potential wells, and are more compact than destructive charge read-out circuits. Early mechanization of NDRO's (see ) was with floating gate  incorporated within the CCD clocking gates. The floating gate's potential V, changes as signal charge Qis transported below and within the CCD channel. Changes in the floating gate's potential \u03b4Vis related to the signal charge Qby,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["V","FG"]}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"Q","mrow":{"mi":"CCD","mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"msub":{"mi":"C","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["+","+"],"mfrac":[{"msub":[{"mi":["C","CN"]},{"mi":"C","mn":"1"}]},{"msub":[{"mi":["C","CN"]},{"mi":"C","mn":"2"}]}]}}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 ","CN ","CN","1 ","2","FG","CCD","CCD","CCD ","CCD "],"b":["109","110","109","109","109"],"sup":"1\/2 "},"The gate's  potential problems can be circumvented by replacing the floating gate with a FET that is built directly into the CCD channel. Incorporating a depletion mode FET into the CCD channel (see ) eliminates the floating gate issues and several associated problems. Charge sensing is produced by changes in the depletion width between the CCD channel and the FET. As the generated charge packet Qincreases, the depletion width decreases, making the FET more conductive. This sensing effect is analogous to using a back gate to modulate the FET. It should be evident that replacing the depletion mode FET by a surface channel device (see ) will also sense Qin the CCD channel. However, with a surface channel FET, the coupling to the CCD charge is very poor resulting in low charge-to-voltage conversion gain. A close proximity between the NDRO surface channel FET and the CCD signal charge should reduce the effects of fixed pattern noise due to electrical feed-throughs. The benefits offered with the prior art NDRO structures are mitigated by increased fabrication difficulties and issues related to the NDRO's transfer function, which converts the signal charge to a voltage signal. With the invention of CDS, the NDRO's advantage has been reduced and destructive CCD read-out structures, using a floating diffusion, have gained dominance.","It is therefore desirable to provide an NDRO structure capable of high sensitivity charge-to-voltage read-out, no kTC read-out noise, and a simplified fabrication that utilizes existing CCD and CMOS imager semiconductor processing technology. It should be noted that while a number of noteworthy advances and technological improvements have been achieved within the art of CCD and CMOS charge-to-voltage read-out circuits, none completely fulfill the specific objectives achieved by this invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a high sensitivity, high speed, and low noise, semiconductor non-destructive read-out device for the conversion of a generated signal charge into an output. The non-destructive read-out device comprises a semiconductor substrate having a first type of dopant, a semiconductor layer having a second type of dopant different from the first type of dopant and disposed on the semiconductor substrate, potential wells formed inside the semiconductor layer for integration and\/or transfer of the signal charge, and potential wells formed inside the semiconductor layer for read-out and\/or transfer of the signal charge. A MOSFET is formed in the top semiconductor layer having a gate defining the underlying potential well used for sensing the signal charge, a first type of dopant source, a first type of dopant drain, and a surface channel wherein a source to drain charge flow is used to sense the signal charge. A feedback amplifier with a gain of G, G being a selectable gain number preferably less than one, has an input connected to the MOSFET source and an output connected to the MOSFET gate. A current generator is connected in series with the MOSFET source. A second type of dopant reset drain formed in the top semiconductor layer. Signal charge can be directly generated inside the charge sensing potential well (see ). After signal charge sensing, a reset gate enables removal of signal charge from the charge sensing potential well into a reset drain. Signal charge can also be transferred into the signal charge sensing potential well with CCD transfer gates and\/or a multiplexer gate (see. ). These gates are on a dielectric formed on top of the semiconductor layer with second dopant type. Reduction of readout noise is mechanized by connecting several NDRO structures in series (see ) and performing multiple nondestructive signal charge readouts. Correlating \u201cN\u201d nondestructive signal charge readout outputs will improve the signal to noise ratio by N, since the outputs contain correlated signals and uncorrelated noise. During readout with multiple NDRO devices connected in series, after readout, signal charge is transferred from the first NDRO's charge sensing potential well into the second NDRO's charge sensing potential well where it is subsequently readout. After readout with all the series connected NDRO structures, each signal charge is drained from the last NDRO stage into a reset drain by the action of the reset gate. A description is provided of a high sensitivity, high speed, and low noise, semiconductor multiple stage non-destructive read-out device comprising an input stage, a selectable number of interior NDRO stages, and a reset stage, for the conversion of signal charge into an output voltage.","These and other objects, advantages and preferred features of this invention will be apparent from the following description taken with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein is shown the preferred embodiments of the invention.","So that the manner in which the above recited features, advantages and objects of the present invention are attained can be understood in detail, more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to the embodiment thereof that is illustrated in the appended drawings.

The charge-to-voltage gain with destructive read-out is smaller because FET's gate capacitance C is in parallel with capacitances from floating diffusions, reset FET's diffusions, and the interconnect lines between them. With careful layout of destructive read-out these capacitance increases can be minimized thereby limiting the advantages of the NDRO circuit.

Photons incident through the NDRO gate  will generate electron-hole pairs and the electrons will be integrated in the buried channel signal charge sensing potential well  underneath the NDRO gate . Without loss of generality, we show an n-channel potential well  for integrating\/storing\/transporting signal charge Q, and a p-MOSFET channel  for sensing this signal charge . Opposite polarity channels  and channel potential well  are required to maintain separation between the signal electrons Q and the p-MOSFET's holes, used to sense Q. The flow of holes at the p-MOSFET surface channel  is represented by two arrows . The holes flow from source  to drain  (which also serves as a channel stop) and are in very close proximity to the electrons signal Q. Using opposite polarity carriers for signal and sensing maximizes sensitivity since the signal charge and the p-MOSFET sensing channel  are arranged in tandem and very close to each other. During charge-to-voltage conversion (sensing), the signal electrons Q are confined within a charge sensing potential well , formed in buried n-channel . The potential well  is rectangular or oval with the center removed and wherein we form the source  of the sensing p-MOSFET . Thus, with reference to , top view  of the NDRO , the signal, under a rectangular gate , Q is confined and distributed within a rectangular frame like charge sensing potential well .

Sufficient negative bias on the RESET GATE , the n-type surface will be inverted and pinned to the P+ DRAIN potential, and thereby form a potential barrier on all four sides , , , and  of the NDRO gate  that defines the underlying Q,  sensing potential well. Pulsing positive the RESET GATE , will dynamically remove the potential barrier and drain the signal Q into the N+ RESET DRAIN .","The NDRO structure  of  has been configured for optical signal injection and periodic reset through the N+ REST DRAIN . The NDRO structure  of  combines the read-out and integration regions into a single potential well . However, more complicated CMOS and CCD imagers have architectures where signal integration, transfer and read-out are performed at different locations. For such imaging devices more sophisticated read-out structures are needed. By incorporating several changes, the NDRO structure  of  is readily extended for use in modern imagers. The major change is to incorporate provisions for electrical injection of signal charge into the charge-to-voltage conversion well. With reference now to , a cross sectional view of an NDRO structure  with electrical injection is shown. The NDRO structure  charge reset portion remains the same as in the NDRO structure  of . Small changes are made to the charge-to-voltage sensing NDRO stage. The NDRO GATE  may be split into two sections,  and  to speed up charge removal needed for very high speed reset operation. For most applications, the single NDRO GATE  configuration, shown in the NDRO structure  of , is preferred over the dual NDRO GATE configuration  and , shown in . Electrical charge injection is incorporated in the NDRO structure  without negatively affecting the charge-to-voltage conversion performance. The p-MOSFET sensing channel  is arranged in tandem and in close proximity with the charge sensing potential well  storing electron charges Q. Normally, combining NMOS electron (NMOS) with hole (PMOS) devices requires isolation wells with guard rings. PMOS (NMOS) devices are made in n-wells (p-wells) with N+ (P+) guard rings. The guard rings prevent parasitic surface transport between source and drain. The parasitic surface transport is facilitated by: surface interface states, fixed charge in the dielectric, and\/or field inversion by interconnect lines. Since the NDRO structure  incorporates in tandem NMOS and PMOS devices, conventional guard rings cannot be used. PMOS (NMOS) guard rings made from N+ (P+) would create shorts between the NMOS (PMOS) source and drain. We solve the NDRO N+\/P+ guard ring problem with a novel design. The NDRO structure's  need for N+ and P+ guard rings is eliminated by shaping the p-MOSFET  drain into a rectangular frame as shown in the top view , , of NDRO structure . The rectangular P+ frame is located around a square NDRO gate  and , in , or around a doughnut shape gate  in , with P+ source  in the center, , A, and B. Since there are no parasitic paths between the P+ source  and drain , the need for a N+ guard ring is eliminated. The NDRO's P+ drain  also doubles as the P+ guard ring (channel stop) for the Q n-channel charge sensing potential well . The need for reset and electrical injection of Q dictates a dynamic solution to the guard ring (channel stop) problem. Thus the drain  cannot be made from a P+ diffusion shaped like a rectangular frame. Instead, the P+ drain  is divided into two regions; region with segments top  and bottom , and region with segments left  and right . The PMOS drain  top  and bottom  segments are P+ diffusions that double as channel stops for Q. The left  and right  PMOS drain segments are dynamic since they are formed by surface inversion when negative bias is, applied to the MUX GATE  and RESET GATE , . Thus, surface inversion completes the P+ drain  around the NDRO GATE  and  by electrically connecting the dynamic left  and right  PMOS drain segments to static top  and bottom  channel stops segments. While the P+ drain completely surrounds the NDRO GATE  and , signal electrons Q are confined in the charge sensing potential well  formed below the NDRO GATE  and . Signal Q confinement continues while the MUX GATE  and RESET GATE  are biased into surface inversion.","Biasing the RESET GATE  out of inversion completely eliminates the potential barriers and Q electrons are drained into the N+ RESET drain . Once Q is drained, the RESET GATE  is again biased into inversion. A new Q is injected into the potential well  under the NDRO GATE by applying proper pulses to the CCD #1 GATE , CCD #2 GATE , and MUX GATE . With proper phasing, signal electrons Q are drained from, and injected into, the charge sensing potential well  located below the NDRO GATE  and .","Operation of the NDRO structure  is detailed in . Transfer of signal electrons  into and out of the NDRO structure  mechanizes charge-to-voltage conversion of many charge packets with a single non destructive read-out. With CMOS imagers, a single NDRO structure  is built into each pixel. With CCD, each NDRO structure  is used to read-out a large group of pixels. These application requires electrical injection into, and removal of, Q from the charge sensing potential well  under the NDRO GATE  and . The potentials needed for mechanizing this operation are inserts A, B, C, and D, illustrated in  for NDRO structure . The potentials in inserts A, B, C, and D, are produced by clocking waveforms which consist of analog pulses applied to MIS gates, including: CCD GATES  and , MUX GATES , NDRO GATES  and , and RESET GATES . Operation of the NDRO structure  is explained with the aid of the four potential diagrams [inserts A, B, C, and D], in  and potential configurations detailed in Table I. A DC current, DC voltages, and analog AC clock voltages are applied to the NDRO structure . The positive side of a DC current generator  (not shown) is attached to the p-MOSFET P+ source  node. The negative side of the DC current generator  is attached to a positive bias voltage V1. The p-MOSFET DRAIN , which also acts as the CCD channel stop, is attached to ground. The N+ RESET DRAIN , connected to the N-channel, is connected to a positive voltage V2 and this is equal to, or more positive, than V1. The p-type substrate  is connected to a negative voltage or ground, and is used to optimize the operation of the n-channel  CCD and the charge sensing potential wells under the NDRO GATE  and . The two NDRO GATE segments  and  are shorted together and driven by an amplifier  (not shown) with gain less than one. The \u201cunity\u201d gain amplifier's  input is connected to the P+ PMOS source  and its output to the NDRO GATE  and . The amplifier  combined with the NDRO's p-MOSFET (buried p-MOSFET  or surface p-MOSFET ) form a feedback loop that minimizes the effective capacitance Q experiences. Minimizing the effective capacitance Q experiences is important for maximizing charge-to-voltage gain. The amplifier  also provides output drive. Additionally, the amplifier  includes provisions for adjusting DC offsets, used to optimize the DC bias conditions on the NDRO GATE  and . The amplifier's  second function is to provide output signal voltage drive for the NDRO structure .","Operation of the NDRO structure  is periodic since it repeats after cycling through the potential configurations represented by inserts A, B, C, and D in . The potential configuration state A is listed in the first line of Table I. Shown in cross section signal charge packet Q, held inside a charge sensing potential well . The signal charge packet Q before injection into the sensing well  is held under CCD #1 GATE  and CCD #2 GATE . The second signal charge packet Q is held under the NDRO GATE  and . During state A, the RESET GATE  and MUX GATE  are operated in the surface inversion mode. Surface inversion completes a P+ drain frame that encloses the area around the NDRO GATE  and  and confines Q under the NDRO GATE  and . Signal charge Q is subjected to feedback and this minimizes the effective capacitance Q experiences and thereby maximizes the output signal. During state A, the NDRO structure  performs the high gain charge-to-voltage conversion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"CCD#1","CCD#2","MUX","PMOS","NDRO","RESET",{},"PMOS DRAIN"]},{"entry":[{},"GATE","GATE","GATE","SOURCE","GATE","GATE","N+ DRAIN","& CCD C\/S"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","Opened","Attractive","Inverted","Current","Active","Inverted","DC2 Pos.","Ground"]},{"entry":["B","Blocking ","Attractive","Inverted ","Current","Inactive","Opened","DC2 Pos.","Ground"]},{"entry":["C","Blocking ","Attractive","Inverted ","Current","Inactive","Inverted","DC2 Pos.","Ground"]},{"entry":["D","Blocking ","Repulsive","Opened","Current","Inactive","Inverted","DC2 Pos.","Ground"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In TABLE I potentials applied to the NDRO structure  are tabulated as a function of one of the four potential states A, B, C, and D, at which the NDRO structure  is biased during operation.","After read-out of the Q the NDRO structure  is biased into state B (see Table I). In state B, the reset gate  is opened (non-blocking) and CCD #1 GATE  is made repulsive. Charge Q is transferred to a potential well formed by CCD #2 GATE . At the same time charge Q, under the NDRO GATE  and , is drained into the N+ reset drain . Draining charge Q from the charge sensing potential well  formed under the NDRO GATE  and  is a charge transfer process. This is very important since no kTC reset noise is associated with a reset operation using potential wells for charge transfer. Preventing kTC reset noise has a tremendous integration advantage, since a CDS circuit with a large capacitor is not required inside every pixel. Thus the pixels can be made significantly smaller.","After draining the charge Q into the N+ DRAIN , the NDRO structure  is biased into state C (see Table I). In state C the RESET GATE  is again biased into the surface inversion mode, leaving the charge sensing potential well  under the NDRO gate  and  empty and surrounded by a potential barrier formed by the p-MOSFET drain . After reforming the potential well  under the NDRO GATE  and  for Q, the NDRO structure  is biased into state D. In state D the MUX GATE  is opened (made non-blocking) and the CCD #2 GATE  is made repulsive. This causes the charge Q to be transferred into the potential well  formed under the NDRO GATE  and . Following this transfer, the NDRO structure  is returned into state A and the whole process repeats.","With some modifications, several modified NDRO structures similar to NDRO structure  can be connected in series. An exemplary series NDRO structure  shown in  consists of three NDRO stages: input type NDRO , interior type NDRO , and end type NDRO . The end type NDRO  will include the N+ RESET DRAIN . The interior type NDRO  will not have an N+ RESET DRAIN , and it will be replaced by several CCD transfer gates  and . The input type NDRO  will also not have an N+ RESET DRAIN  and the input portion will be the same as for the NDRO structure  shown in . The input NDRO  and interior NDRO  are similar and the difference facilitates connection to a charge source. Multiple non-destructive readout of a charge signal is mechanized by interconnecting in series NDRO stages , , and . For two non-destructive readouts of a charge signal, NDRO  and  are connected in series. For three or more non-destructive readouts of a charge signal, an input type NDRO , at least one interior type NDRO , and an end type NDRO  are connected in series, and this will allow repeated nondestructive sensing of charge Q trough the multiple NDRO stages. Combining (after proper delay) outputs from the NDRO stages , , and , will provide means for signal\/noise improvement. The signal\/noise will improve with the square root of the number of NDRO stages interconnected in series. The improvement in signal\/noise ratio is very important for low light level applications. Low light level applications strive for single photon sensitivity. Although the series NDRO structure  consists of an input type NDRO , an interior type NDRO , and an end type NDRO  for illustration purposes, a person of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that other combinations of stages, and series NDRO structures consisting of multiple interior type NDROs  in series can be implemented without departing from the spirit of the invention. In series NDRO structure  operation, charge signal Q is injected into the input type NDRO . The interior type NDRO  accepts the charge signal Q from the input type NDRO  and injects charge signal Q to the end type NDRO . The charge signal Q is read-out by the end type NDRO  and subsequently destructively drained into the N+ RESET DRAIN . The length of the series NDRO structure  can be adjusted by increasing the number of interior type NDRO  stages. A feedback amplifier  is included with each NDRO stage to maximize charge-to-voltage conversion gain in each NDRO stage in structure , but for reasons of clarity is not shown. The NDRO structures , , and  are high sensitivity, low noise, and high speed structures for charge-to-voltage conversion and have applications in CMOS and CCD imaging sensors. Their fabrication process is compatible with semiconductor processes used for fabricating CMOS and\/or CMOS imagers.","The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention are illustrative and explanatory thereof, and various changes in the size, shape and materials, as well as in the details of the illustrated construction may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["A more particular description of the invention briefly summarized above is available from the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawing and discussed in further detail below.
