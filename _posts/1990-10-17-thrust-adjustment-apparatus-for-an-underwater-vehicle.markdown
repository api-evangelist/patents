title: Thrust adjustment apparatus for an underwater vehicle
abstract: An apparatus for providing thrust adjustment on an underwater vehicle with a propeller shroud is disclosed. A portion of the vehicles body is provided with a compliant surface such that expansion and contraction of the compliant surface affects the flow of water through a channel formed by the vehicle body and the propeller shroud, resulting in variable thrust on the vehicle.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to underwater vehicle propulsion systems and more particularly to an apparatus for providing thrust adjustment of an underwater vehicle independent of vehicle propulsion motor speeds.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Numerous propulsion systems exist for underwater vehicles. A basic underwater vehicle propulsion system uses a motor to drive a shaft which, in turn, is connected to a propeller outside of the vehicle body. Adjustment of vehicle speed is dependent upon an adjustment of the motor speed. Unfortunately, many underwater vehicle propulsion system motors respond sluggishly to speed adjustment.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a thrust adjustment apparatus on an underwater vehicle that is independent of vehicle propulsion motor speed.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a thrust adjustment apparatus on an underwater vehicle that rapidly responds to a request for thrust adjustment.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus is provided for adjusting the thrust of an underwater vehicle. A water passageway is formed by the vehicle body and a propeller shroud circumferentially deployed about the vehicle body. A vehicle propulsion system is operable within the water passageway. A circumferential channel is provided in the vehicle body forward of the propulsion system. A compliant surface covers the circumferential channel. A hydraulic pump system pumps water into the channel at a sufficient pressure to expand the compliant surface in response to a request for thrust adjustment. As the compliant surface expands, it increasingly chokes the water passageway, thereby decreasing the flow of water available to the propulsion system. The decreased flow of water causes the vehicle to decelerate. Conversely, when the hydraulic pump system pumps water out of the channel, the compliant surface contracts, thereby increasing the flow of water into the water passageway. The increased flow of water causes the vehicle to accelerate. Thus, thrust adjustment is achieved independent of the propulsion system's motor speed.","Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to , a cross-sectional, side-view of the aft end of a typical underwater vehicle is shown and referenced generally by numeral . Vehicle  is propelled in the forward direction, indicated by arrow , by propellers  spinning about the vehicle body . Propellers  typically are encased within a shroud  having a diameter considerably larger than that of vehicle body . Shroud  circumferentially encases propellers  and is supported by a plurality of circumferentially spaced supports  attached to, and extending radially from vehicle body  at preselected spacing. Supports  are designed to produce minimal flow restriction. An annular passageway is thus formed between shroud  and vehicle body , such that a relative water flow, indicated by arrow , may flow to propellers . Thrust adjustment is achieved by decreasing the speed of the propellers  which, as mentioned above, is a function of the response time of the propeller's drive motor (not shown).","In order to achieve thrust adjustment independent of and more quickly than the propeller's drive motor, the present invention makes use of a compliant surface  shown schematically in . Note that  employ like reference numerals for common elements. Compliant surface , which extends in an annular fashion around the circumference of body , may be adjusted between its expanded position as shown and a neutral position as indicated by the dotted line referenced by numeral . In its expanded position, compliant surface  chokes the relative water flow  entering the passageway formed between shroud  and vehicle body . Accordingly, the water flow, indicated by arrow passageway , entering the passageway between shroud  and vehicle body , is less than water flow . The remainder of water flow  passes outside of shroud  and is indicated by arrow shroud . The reduced water flow entering passageway made available to propellers  changes the thrust delivered to the vehicle  thereby causing vehicle  to decelerate.","In the preferred mode of operation, the compliant surface  would be nominally maintained to provide a half-choke position. This would allow quick speed changes of the vehicle , namely, deceleration upon further expansion of compliant surface  and acceleration upon contraction of compliant surface  toward the dotted line indicating neutral position . Expansion and contraction is achieved by constructing compliant surface  from a synthetic rubber such as neoprene. Any synthetic rubber will suffice as long as a continuously variable, smooth surface contour can be achieved during either expansion or contraction of compliant surface . A smooth surface contour equates to a smooth flow area to keep noise and flow losses at a minimum. Furthermore, specific surface contours may be achieved by varying the thickness of compliant surface .","To better understand the expansion and contraction of compliant surface , a detailed schematic view of the thrust adjustment apparatus is shown in . Once again, like elements between ,  and  will share common reference numerals. A channel  is cut into vehicle body . Channel  is provided circumferentially around vehicle body . Shown in its expanded state, compliant surface  covers, and is fixably attached to, channel  to form a smooth contour, continuously variable surface.","A hydraulic control system  is provided to pump water into channel  at sufficient pressure to expand compliant surface  in response to a request for thrust adjustment. Control system  consists of a pressure-referencing bladder  which is referenced to sea pressure outside the vehicle body  via seawater passage inlet . Referencing bladder  is, in turn, connected to a hydraulic pump  and control valve . Hydraulic pump  is then also connected to control valve . In this way, hydraulic pump  is continuously referenced or biased to the sea or depth pressure being exerted on the vehicle body . Control valve  permits water to pass into and out of channel .","When control system  receives a request for thrust adjustment, hydraulic pump  need only overcome the dynamic pressure head outside of the vehicle body , which is a function of the underwater vehicle speed. Since underwater vehicle speeds are relatively slow, hydraulic pump  can quickly and easily effect the expansion or contraction of compliant surface . The resulting thrust adjustment is independent of, and more quickly realized than, a propeller's drive motor speed adjustment.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. By providing a continuously variable compliant surface forward of an underwater vehicle's propulsion system, thrust adjustment is achieved independent of the propulsion system's motor speed. Furthermore, by referencing the hydraulic pump to the underwater sea pressure being exerted on the vehicle body, thrust adjustment is quickly obtained as the hydraulic pump need only overcome a dynamic pressure head.","Thus, it is to be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
