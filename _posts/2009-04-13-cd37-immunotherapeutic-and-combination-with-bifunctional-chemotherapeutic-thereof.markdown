The name of the text file containing the Sequence Listing is SEQUENCE_LISTING.txt. The text file is 295 KB, was created on Feb. 1, 2012, and is submitted electronically via EFS-Web.","1. Technical Field","The present disclosure generally provides compositions and methods for treating B-cell disorders and, more specifically, a humanized anti-CD37 small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) molecule, as well as synergistic combination therapies of CD37-specific binding molecules with bifunctional chemotherapeutics for use in treating or preventing B-cell related autoimmune, inflammatory, or hyperproliferative diseases.","2. Description of the Related Art","The human immune system generally protects the body from invading foreign substances and pathogens. One component of the immune system is B lymphocytes, also referred to as B-cells, which produce antibodies that protect the body by binding to, and in some cases mediating destruction of, a foreign substance or pathogen. In some instances, however, the immune system functions can go awry and disease results. For example, there are numerous cancers, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory diseases that involve uncontrolled proliferation of B-cells.","B-cells can be identified by molecules on their cell surface, such as CD37. CD37 is a heavily glycosylated 40-52 kDa protein that belongs to the tetraspanin transmembrane family of cell surface antigens, which is highly expressed on normal antibody-producing B-cells but not on pre-B-cells or plasma cells. In addition to normal B-cells, almost all malignancies of B-cell origin are positive for CD37 expression, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), and hairy cell leukemia (Moore et al., J. Pathol. 152:13 (1987); Merson and Brochier, Immunol. Lett. 19:269 (1988); and Faure et al., Am. J. Dermatopathol. 12:122 (1990)).","A few CD37 specific immunotherapies have been developed. An IgG1 murine monoclonal antibody specific for CD37, MB-1, was labeled with I and tested in a clinical trial in the treatment of NHL (see Press et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 7:1027 (1989); Bernstein et al., Cancer Res. (Suppl.) 50:1017 (1990); Press et al., Front. Radiat. Ther. Oncol. 24:204 (1990); Press et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 303:91 (1991) and Brown et al., Nucl. Med. Biol. 24:657 (1997)). The MB-1 antibody lacks Fc effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the naked MB-1 antibody did not inhibit tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model (Buchsbaum et al., Cancer Res. 52:6476 (1992)). In addition, an immunoconjugate having adriamycin linked to G28-1, another murine monoclonal anti-CD37, was administered to mice and shown to be internalized with adriamycin being released intracellularly (see, Braslawsky et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 33:367 (1991)). An engineered fusion protein, termed a small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP\u2122) product, directed to CD37 is currently being tested in humans (see, e.g., US Patent Application Publications 2003\/0133939 and 2007\/0059306).","Although there has been extensive research carried out on antibody-based therapies, there remains a need in the art for alternative or improved compositions and methods for treating B-cell associated disorders or diseases.","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides humanized CD37-specific binding molecules and a method for reducing B-cells or treating a disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein.","In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule, comprising from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus: (i) a humanized heavy chain variable region, (ii) a linker as set forth in SEQ ID NO:229, (iii) a humanized light chain variable region, (iv) an IgG1 hinge, (v) human IgG1 CH2 region, and (vi) human IgG1 CH3 region, wherein (a) the humanized heavy chain variable region comprises from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus: a humanized heavy chain FR1, a heavy chain CDR1 as set forth in SEQ ID NO:63, a humanized heavy chain FR2, a heavy chain CDR2 as set forth in SEQ ID NO:65, a humanized heavy chain FR3, a heavy chain CDR3 as set forth in SEQ ID NO:67, 68 or 69, and a humanized heavy chain FR4, and (b) the humanized light chain variable region comprises from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus: a humanized light chain FR1, a light chain CDR1 as set forth in SEQ ID NO:61 or 62, a humanized light chain FR2, a light chain CDR2 as set forth in SEQ ID NO:64, a humanized light chain FR3, and a light chain CDR3 as set forth in SEQ ID NO:66, and a humanized light chain FR4.","In certain embodiments of the above humanized CD37-specific binding molecules, the humanized heavy chain FR1 comprises SEQ ID NO:144, the humanized heavy chain FR2 comprises SEQ ID NO:151, the heavy chain FR3 comprises SEQ ID NO:158, and the heavy chain FR4 comprises SEQ ID NO:161 or 162.","In certain embodiments of any one of the above humanized CD37-specific binding molecules, the humanized light chain FR1 comprises SEQ ID NO:171, the light chain FR2 comprises SEQ ID NO:182, the light chain FR3 comprises SEQ ID NO:195, and the light chain FR4 comprises SEQ ID NO:206.","In a related aspect, the present disclosure provides a CD37-specific binding molecule that comprises the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:253.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule consists essentially of the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:253.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule consists of the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:253.","In a related aspect, the present disclosure also provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule that comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein.","In another related aspect, the present disclosure provides a vector that comprises an isolated nucleic acid molecule that encodes a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein.","In another related aspect, the present disclosure provides a host cell that comprises the above-described vector.","The present disclosure also provides a composition that comprises a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for reducing B-cells or treating a disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein.","In certain embodiments, the disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity is a B-cell lymphoma, a B-cell leukemia, a B-cell myeloma, a disease characterized by autoantibody production, or a disease characterized by inappropriate T-cell stimulation associated with a B-cell pathway.","In certain embodiments, the disease characterized by autoantibody production is idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, Grave's disease, type I diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, or Waldenstrom's macroglobinemia.","In certain embodiments, the disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides compositions and methods for the combined use of CD37-specific binding molecules and bifunctional chemotherapeutics to reduce B-cells or treat a disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity. A surprising result of this combination is that these compounds act synergistically, which results in an increased B-cell reduction.","For example, the present disclosure provides a composition that comprises a CD37-specific binding molecule and bendamustine.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule is a CD37-specific antibody or SMIP, such as a humanized antibody or humanized SMIP.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule competes with G28-1 mAb in CD37-specific binding.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule is a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein, such as a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule that comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:253.","In a related aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for reducing B-cells or treating a disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a CD37-specific binding molecule and bendamustine.","In certain embodiments, the disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity is a B-cell lymphoma, a B-cell leukemia, a B-cell myeloma, a disease characterized by autoantibody production, or a disease characterized by inappropriate T-cell stimulation associated with a B-cell pathway.","In certain further embodiments, the disease characterized by autoantibody production is idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, Grave's disease, type I diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, or Waldenstrom's macroglobinemia.","In certain other embodiments, the disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule and bendamustine are administered concurrently.","In certain other embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule and bendamustine are administered sequentially.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule and bendamustine are formulated together.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule is a CD37-specific antibody or SMIP, such as a humanized antibody or a humanized SMIP.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule competes with G28-1 mAb in CD37-specific binding.","In certain embodiments, the CD37-specific binding molecule is a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein, such as a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule that comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:253.","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides the CD37-specific binding molecule CAS-024 (SEQ ID NO:253), which is a humanized version of CAS-006 (a small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) protein having the immunoglobulin variable regions from mouse anti-human CD37 monoclonal antibody G28-1). The CAS-024 SMIP protein is unexpectedly (1) expressed at up to about 25-fold higher levels than other humanized versions of CAS-006 (such as CAS-002, CAS-003; see Examples 2 and 5), (2) capable of binding CD37 as well as CAS-006 while other humanized versions do not (see Examples 4 and 5), and (3) produced as a homogenous population of molecules as compared the heterogenous nature of other humanized versions (see Example 3). Additionally, the instant disclosure provides the CD37-specific binding molecule CAS-024 (SEQ ID NO:253) for use in methods for reducing B-cells or treating disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of CAS-024 provided herein.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides compositions and methods for the combined use of any CD37-specific binding molecule and bifunctional chemotherapeutics (such as bendamustine) to reduce B-cells or treat a disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity. A surprising result of this combination is that this combination of compounds acts synergistically and results in a substantially more effective therapeutic regimen.","Prior to setting forth this disclosure in more detail, it may be helpful to an understanding thereof to provide definitions of certain terms to be used herein. Additional definitions are set forth throughout this disclosure.","In the present description, any concentration range, percentage range, ratio range, or integer range is to be understood to include the value of any integer within the recited range and, when appropriate, fractions thereof (such as one tenth and one hundredth of an integer), unless otherwise indicated. Also, any number range recited herein relating to any physical feature, such as polymer subunits, size or thickness, are to be understood to include any integer within the recited range, unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, \u201cabout\u201d or \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d mean\u00b120% of the indicated range, value, or structure, unless otherwise indicated. It should be understood that the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used herein refer to \u201cone or more\u201d of the enumerated components. The use of the alternative (e.g., \u201cor\u201d) should be understood to mean either one, both, or any combination thereof of the alternatives. As used herein, the terms \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201ccomprise\u201d are used synonymously. In addition, it should be understood that the individual compounds, or groups of compounds, derived from the various combinations of the structures and substituents described herein, are disclosed by the present application to the same extent as if each compound or group of compounds was set forth individually. Thus, selection of particular structures or particular substituents is within the scope of the present disclosure.","A \u201cbinding domain\u201d or \u201cbinding region\u201d according to the present disclosure may be, for example, any protein, polypeptide, oligopeptide, or peptide that possesses the ability to specifically recognize and bind to a biological molecule (e.g., CD37) or complex of more than one of the same or different molecule or assembly or aggregate, whether stable or transient. A binding region includes any naturally occurring, synthetic, semi-synthetic, or recombinantly produced binding partner for a biological molecule or other target of interest. A variety of assays are known for identifying binding domains of the present disclosure that specifically bind a particular target, including Western blot, ELISA, or Biacore analysis.","Binding domains and fusion proteins thereof of this disclosure can be capable of binding to a desired degree, including \u201cspecifically or selectively binding\u201d a target while not significantly binding other components present in a test sample, if they bind a target molecule with an affinity or K(i.e., an equilibrium association constant of a particular binding interaction with units of 1\/M) of, for example, greater than or equal to about 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, or 10M. \u201cHigh affinity\u201d binding domains refers to those binding domains with a Kof at least 10M, at least 10M, at least 10M, at least 10M, at least 10M, at least 10M, at least 10M, or greater. \u201cLow affinity\u201d binding domains refers to those binding domains with a Kof up to 5\u00d710M, up to 10M, up to 10M, up to 10M, or less. Alternatively, affinity may be defined as an equilibrium dissociation constant (K) of a particular binding interaction with units of M (e.g., 10M to 10M). Affinities of binding domain polypeptides and fusion proteins according to the present disclosure can be readily determined using conventional techniques (see, e.g., Scatchard et al. (1949) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,283,173, 5,468,614, or the equivalent).","The term \u201cCD37-specific binding molecules\u201d refer to a protein, polypeptide, oligopeptide or peptide that specifically binds to CD37 with a Kof at least about 10M(e.g., at least about 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, or 10M).","The term \u201cCD37-specific binding domain\u201d refers to a portion or a domain of a CD37-specific binding molecule responsible for the specific CD37 binding of the molecule. A CD37-specific binding domain itself (i.e., without any other portion of the CD37-specific binding molecule) binds to CD37 with a Kof at least about 10M(e.g., at least about 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, or 10M). A CD37-specific binding domain itself may be sufficient as a CD37-specific binding molecule. Exemplary CD37-specific binding domains include CD37-specific scFv and Fab fragments, which can be derived from anti-CD37 antibodies, such as monoclonal antibody G28-1.","Terms understood by those in the art as referring to antibody technology are each given the meaning acquired in the art, unless expressly defined herein. For example, the terms \u201cV\u201d and \u201cV\u201d refer to the variable binding region derived from an antibody light and heavy chain, respectively. The variable binding regions are made up of discrete, well-defined sub-regions known as \u201ccomplementarity determining regions\u201d (CDRs) and \u201cframework regions\u201d (FRs). The terms \u201cC\u201d and \u201cC\u201d refer to an \u201cimmunoglobulin constant region,\u201d i.e., a constant region derived from an antibody light or heavy chain, respectively, with the latter region understood to be further divisible into C, C, Cand Cconstant region domains, depending on the antibody isotype (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM) from which the region was derived. A portion of the constant region domains makes up the Fc region (the \u201cfragment crystallizable\u201d region), which contains domains responsible for the effector functions of an immunoglobulin, such as ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity), CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) and complement fixation, binding to Fc receptors, greater half-life in vivo relative to a polypeptide lacking an Fc region, protein A binding, and perhaps even placental transfer (see Capon et al., Nature, 337:525 (1989)). Further, a polypeptide containing an Fc region allows for dimerization or multimerization of the polypeptide.","A \u201chinge region\u201d is an amino acid sequence interposed between and connecting a CD37-specific binding domain and another region (e.g., a CH2 region) in a fusion protein so that the fusion protein is still capable of specific binding to CD37 (i.e., with a Kof at least about 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, or 10M). In certain embodiments, a hinge region is an immunoglobulin hinge region.","An \u201cimmunoglobulin hinge region\u201d refers to a wild type immunoglobulin hinge region or an altered wild type immunoglobulin hinge region.","According to crystallographic studies, the immunoglobulin hinge region can be further subdivided functionally into three regions: the upper hinge region, the core region, and the lower hinge region. The upper hinge region includes amino acids from the carboxyl end of CH1 to the first residue in the hinge that restricts motion, generally the first cysteine residue that forms an interchain disulfide bond between the two heavy chains. The length of the upper hinge region correlates with the segmental flexibility of the antibody. The core hinge region contains the inter-heavy chain disulfide bridges, and the lower hinge region joins the amino terminal end of the CH2 domain and includes residues in CH2. Id. The core hinge region of human IgG1 contains the sequence Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys (SEQ ID NO:264) which, when dimerized by disulfide bond formation, results in a cyclic octapeptide believed to act as a pivot, thus conferring flexibility.","A \u201cwild type immunoglobulin hinge region,\u201d as used herein refers to a naturally occurring amino acid sequence interposed between and connecting CH1 and CH2 regions of a single chain of an antibody. It contains the upper hinge region, the core hinge region, and the portion of the lower hinge region that is not part of CH2 region. An exemplary wild type immunoglobulin hinge region is human IgG1 hinge region as set forth in SEQ ID NO:90, in which from its amino terminus to its carboxyl terminus, the first ten amino acids (EPKSCDKTHT, SEQ ID NO:263) form the upper hinge region, the next four amino acids (CPPC, SEQ ID NO:264) form the core hinge region, and the last amino acid (i.e., proline) is the first amino acid in the lower hinge region and is not part of CH2.","An \u201caltered wild type immunoglobulin hinge region\u201d or \u201caltered immunoglobulin hinge region\u201d refers to (a) a wild type immunoglobulin hinge region with up to 30% amino acid changes (e.g., up to 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, or 5% amino acid substitutions or deletions), (b) a portion of a wild type immunoglobulin hinge region that is at least 10 amino acids (e.g., at least 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acids) in length with up to 30% amino acid changes (e.g., up to 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, or 5% amino acid substitutions or deletions), or (c) a portion of a wild type immunoglobulin hinge region that comprises the core hinge region (which may be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15, or at least 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 amino acids in length). When an altered wild type immunoglobulin hinge region is interposed between and connecting a CD37-specific binding domain and another region (e.g., a CH2 region) in a fusion protein, it allows the fusion protein to specifically bind to CD37 (i.e., with a Kof at least about 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, 10M, or 10M). In certain embodiments, one or more cysteine residues in a wild type immunoglobulin hinge region may be substituted by one or more other amino acid residues (e.g., one or more serine residues). An altered immunoglobulin hinge region may alternatively or additionally have a proline residue of a wild type immunoglobulin hinge region substituted by another amino acid residue (e.g., a serine residue).","A \u201clinker\u201d refers to an amino acid sequence that connects a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region together and provides a spacer function compatible with interaction of the two sub-binding domains so that the resulting polypeptide is capable of CD37-specific binding.","\u201cDerivative\u201d as used herein refers to a chemically or biologically modified version of a compound that is structurally similar to a parent compound and (actually or theoretically) derivable from that parent compound. Generally, a \u201cderivative\u201d differs from an \u201canalogue\u201d in that a parent compound may be the starting material to generate a \u201cderivative,\u201d whereas the parent compound may not necessarily be used as the starting material to generate an \u201canalogue.\u201d A derivative may have different chemical or physical properties from the parent compound. For example, a derivative may be more hydrophilic or it may be a mutated sequence having altered reactivity (e.g., a CDR having an amino acid change that alters its affinity for a target) as compared to the parent compound or sequence.","\u201cB-cell associated disorder or disease\u201d refers to aberrant B-cell activity or activity that deviates from the normal, proper, or expected course. For example, a B-cell associated disorder or disease may include inappropriate proliferation of cells that have damaged or defective DNA or other cellular components. Aberrant B-cell activity may include cell proliferation characterized by inappropriately high levels of cell division, inappropriately low levels of apoptosis, or both. Such diseases may have, for example, single or multiple local abnormal proliferations of cells, groups of cells or tissue(s), whether cancerous or non-cancerous, benign or malignant. A B-cell associated disorder or disease may also include aberrant antibody production, such as production of autoantibodies, or overproduction of antibodies more desirable when produced at normal levels. It is also contemplated herein that aberrant B-cell activity may occur in certain subpopulations of B-cells and not in other subpopulations, or may include inappropriate stimulation of T-cells, such as by inappropriate antigen presentation to T-cells or by other B-cells pathway.","\u201cTreatment\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d refers to either a therapeutic treatment or prophylactic\/preventative treatment. A therapeutic treatment may improve at least one symptom of disease in an individual receiving treatment or may delay worsening of a progressive disease in an individual, or prevent onset of additional associated diseases.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount (or dose)\u201d or \u201ceffective amount (or dose)\u201d of a specific binding molecule or compound refers to that amount of the compound sufficient to result in amelioration of one or more symptoms of the disease being treated. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, a therapeutically effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered serially or simultaneously. The invention specifically contemplates that one or more specific binding molecules may be administered according to methods of the invention, each in an effective dose.","\u201cAn individual having, or suspected of having, a disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity\u201d is an individual in whom a disease or a symptom of a disorder may be caused by aberrant B-cell activity or B-cell proliferation, may be exacerbated by aberrant B-cell activity, or may be relieved by regulation of B-cell activity. Examples of such diseases are a B-cell malignancy or B-cell cancer (for example, B-cell lymphoma, a B-cell leukemia or a B-cell myeloma), a disease characterized by autoantibody production or a disease characterized by inappropriate T-cell stimulation caused by inappropriate B-cell antigen presentation to T-cells or caused by other pathways involving B-cells.","Additional definitions are provided in the following detailed description of the present disclosure.","Humanized CD37-Specific Binding Molecules","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides humanized CD37-specific binding molecules. These molecules may be in any form that contains a humanized CD37-specific binding domain, including a humanized anti-CD37 antibody, an Fab fragment of a humanized anti-CD37 antibody, a humanized CD37-specific single chain Fv (scFv), a humanized CD37-specific SMIP protein, a humanized CD37-specific PIMS protein (a fusion protein comprising the components of SMIP in the reverse orientation), a humanized CD37-specific SCORPION protein, and other bi- or multi-specific binding proteins that comprise at least one humanized CD37-specific binding domain. Detailed description of SMIP proteins and methods for making the same may be found, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2003\/0133939, 2003\/0118592, and 2005\/0136049 and WO 2005017148. Constructs and methods for making PIMS proteins are described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/168,875. Methods for making SCORPION proteins may be found, for example, in PCT Application Publication No. WO 2007\/146968. Other exemplary multi-functional fusion proteins may be found, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006\/0051844 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,166,707.

For example, the wild type human IgG1 hinge region contains three cysteine residues\u2014the most N-terminal cysteine is referred to the first cysteine, whereas the most C-terminal cysteine in the hinge region is the third cysteine. In certain embodiments, the mutated human IgG1 hinge region has only two cysteine residues, such as a human IgG1 hinge region with the first cysteine substituted by a serine. In certain other embodiments, the mutated human IgG1 hinge region has only one cysteine residue. In certain embodiments, the proline C-terminal to the third cysteine in the human IgG1 hinge region is substituted, for example, by a serine.

Another characteristic of certain CD37-binding molecules contemplated in this disclosure is that they exhibit a half life in circulation of about 5 to about 30 days.","In certain embodiments, CD37-specific binding molecules are capable of competing with G28-1 mAb in CD37-specific binding.","Bendamustine (4-[5-[Bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl]butanoic acid) is a nitrogen mustard with alkylator and antimetabolite activities. Bendamustine has both an alkylating group and a benzimidazole ring. The alkylating group allows bendamustine metabolites to alkylate and crosslink macromolecules, resulting in DNA, RNA and protein synthesis inhibition, and subsequently apoptosis. The benzimidazole ring may allow bendamustine to act as a purine analogue. Bendamustine hydrochloride has trade names TREANDA\u00ae and RIBOMUSTIN\u00ae.","Although bendamustine or its salts are preferred therapeutic agents that may be used in combination with CD37-specific binding molecules, other therapeutic agents that both comprise one or more alkylating groups and are capable of functioning as a purine analogue may also be used in combination with CD37-specific binding molecules according to the present disclosure.","The term \u201calkylating group,\u201d as used herein, refers to a group that enables the compound comprising this group to attach an alkyl group to DNA. The compound that comprises an alkylating group may be referred to as an \u201calkylating agent.\u201d In certain embodiments, alkylating agents are nitrogen mustards.","The term \u201cpurine analogue\u201d refers to an antimetabolite that mimics the structure of metabolic purines (e.g., adenine and guanine) and has one, two, three or four substituents at the purine ring that differ from metabolic purines. Exemplary purine analogues include azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, fludarabine, pentostatin and cladribine.","A therapeutic agent is \u201ccapable of functioning as a purine analogue\u201d if it possesses at least one function of a purine analogue. Exemplary functions of purine analogues include interference with or inhibition of purine nucleotide synthesis, purine nucleotide metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis, nucleic acid processing, or nucleic acid function, such as inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase, adenosine deaminase, and being incorporated into DNA or RNA.","Compositions and Methods","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for reducing B cells or treating a disease associated with aberrant B cell activity comprising administering to a subject in need thereof (i.e., an individual having or suspected of having a disease associated with aberrant B-cell activity) an effective amount of a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule provided herein (e.g., CAS-024).","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for reducing B cells or treating a disease associated with aberrant B cell activity comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a CD37-specific binding molecule (e.g., CAS-024) and a bifunctional chemotherapeutic (e.g., bendamustine). As described above, CD37-specific binding molecules useful for combination therapy with a bifunctional chemotherapeutic are not limited to humanized CD37-specific binding molecules, but include other CD37-specific binding molecules that have not been humanized.","In one embodiment, a composition comprising a CD37 therapeutic and a bifunctional chemotherapeutic act synergistically in reducing B cells or treating a disease associated with aberrant B cell activity. Two or more compounds that act synergistically interact such that the combined effect of the compounds is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each compound when administered alone (see, e.g., Berenbaum, Pharmacol. Rev. 41:93, 1989). For example, an interaction between small modular immunopharmaceutical that targets CD37 and another agent or compound may be analyzed by a variety of mechanistic and empirical models (see, e.g., Ouzounov et al., Antivir. Res. 55:425, 2002). A commonly used approach for analyzing the interaction between a combination of agents employs the construction of isoboles (iso-effect curves, also referred to as isobolograms), in which the combination of agents (d, d) is represented by a point on a graph, the axes of which are the dose-axes of the individual agents (see, e.g., Ouzounov et al., supra; see also Tallarida, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 298:865, 2001).","Another method for analyzing drug-drug interactions (antagonism, additivity, synergism) known in the art includes determination of combination indices (CI) according to the median effect principle to provide estimates of ICvalues of compounds administered alone and in combination (see, e.g., Chou. In Synergism and Antagonism Chemotherapy. Eds. Chou and Rideout. Academic Press, San Diego Calif., pages 61-102, 1991; CalcuSyn\u2122 software). A CI value of less than one represents synergistic activity, equal to one represents additive activity, and greater than one represents antagonism.","Still another exemplary method is the independent effect method (Pritchard and Shipman, Antiviral Res. 14:181, 1990; Pritchard and Shipman, Antiviral Therapy 1:9, 1996; MACSYNERGY\u2122 II software, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.). MACSYNERGY\u2122 II software allows a three-dimensional (3-D) examination of compound interactions by comparing a calculated additive surface to observed data to generate differential plots that reveal regions (in the form of a volume) of statistically greater than expected (synergy) or less than expected (antagonism) compound interactions. For example, a composition comprising a CD37-specific binding molecule and a bifunctional chemotherapeutic alters viral replication will be considered to have synergistic activity or have a synergistic effect when the volume of synergy produced as calculated by the volume of the synergy peaks is preferably about 15% greater than the additive effect (that is, the effect of each agent alone added together), or preferably about a 2-fold to 10-fold greater than the additive effect, or preferably about a 3-fold to 5-fold or more greater than the additive effect.","In further embodiments, a CD37-specific binding molecule and a bifunctional chemotherapeutic can be administered to act synergistically in the treatment of B-cell malignancies or B-cell cancers. B-cell malignancies or B-cell cancers include B-cell lymphomas [such as various forms of Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) or central nervous system lymphomas], leukemias [such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hairy cell leukemia and chronic myoblastic leukemia] and myelomas (such as multiple myeloma).

It can be divided into three main clinical variants: the endemic, the sporadic and the immunodeficiency-associated variants.","Non-Burkitt's B cell malignancies include, but are not limited to, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\/small lymphocytic lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (including, but not limited to, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia), marginal zone lymphomas (including, but not limited to, splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, and extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type), hairy cell leukemia, plasma cell myeloma\/plasmacytoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma, transforming large B cell lymphoma, mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and non-Burkitt's non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).","Disorders characterized by autoantibody production are often considered autoimmune diseases.

The above autoimmune diseases may also be treated with humanized CD37-specific binding molecules or with the combination of CD37-specific binding molecules and a bifunctional chemotherapeutic.","In one aspect of the disclosure, a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule or a combination of a CD37-specific binding molecule with a bifunctional chemotherapeutic is administered in a pharmaceutical composition. To administer a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule or a combination of a CD37-specific binding molecule with a bifunctional chemotherapeutic to human or test animals, it is preferable to formulate the binding molecule or the combination in a composition comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable\u201d refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce allergic, or other adverse reactions when administered using routes well-known in the art, as described below.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable carriers\u201d include any and all clinically useful solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. In addition, compounds may form solvates with water or common organic solvents. Such solvates are contemplated as well.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure containing a humanized CD37-specific binding molecule or a combination of a CD37-specific binding molecule with a bifunctional chemotherapeutic used in a method of the disclosure may contain pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or additives depending on the route of administration. Examples of such carriers or additives include water, a pharmaceutical acceptable organic solvent, collagen, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, a carboxyvinyl polymer, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polyacrylic sodium, sodium alginate, water-soluble dextran, carboxymethyl starch sodium, pectin, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, xanthan gum, gum Arabic, casein, gelatin, agar, diglycerin, glycerin, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, Vaseline, paraffin, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, human serum albumin (HSA), mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant and the like. Additives used are chosen from, but not limited to, the above or combinations thereof, as appropriate, depending on the dosage form of the present disclosure.","Formulation of the pharmaceutical composition will vary according to the route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion). An appropriate composition comprising the antibody to be administered can be prepared in a physiologically acceptable vehicle or carrier. For solutions or emulsions, suitable carriers include, for example, aqueous or alcoholic\/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles can include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles can include various additives, preservatives, or fluid, nutrient or electrolyte replenishers","A variety of aqueous carriers, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine, or aqueous suspensions may contain the active compound in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyl-eneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate.","A CD37-specific binding molecule, a combination of a CD37-specific binding molecule with a bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or a composition comprising the binding molecule or the combination can be lyophilized for storage and reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to use. This technique has been shown to be effective with conventional immunoglobulins. Any suitable lyophilization and reconstitution techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that lyophilization and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of activity loss and that use levels may have to be adjusted to compensate.","Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active compound in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.","The concentration of CD37-specific binding molecule or bifunctional chemotherapeutic in these formulations can vary widely, for example from less than about 0.5%, usually at or at least about 1% to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected. Thus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for parenteral injection could be made up to contain 1 mL sterile buffered water, and 50 mg of antibody. A typical composition for intravenous infusion could be made up to contain 250 mL of sterile Ringer's solution, and 150 mg of antibody. Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, 15th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1980). An effective dosage of CD37-specific binding molecules (including humanized CD37-specific binding molecules) is within the range of 0.01 mg to 1000 mg per kg of body weight per administration.","The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous, oleaginous suspension, dispersions or sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.","In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial or antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, or the like. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","Compositions useful for administration may be formulated with uptake or absorption enhancers to increase their efficacy. Such enhancers include for example, salicylate, glycocholate\/linoleate, glycholate, aprotinin, bacitracin, SDS, caprate and the like. See, e.g., Fix (J. Pharm. Sci., 85:1282-1285, 1996) and Oliyai and Stella (Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 32:521-544, 1993).","In addition, the properties of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the compositions contemplated for use in the disclosure are well balanced, thereby enhancing their utility for both in vitro and especially in vivo uses, while other compositions lacking such balance are of substantially less utility. Specifically, compositions contemplated for use in the disclosure have an appropriate degree of solubility in aqueous media which permits absorption and bioavailability in the body, while also having a degree of solubility in lipids which permits the compounds to traverse the cell membrane to a putative site of action. Thus, antibody compositions contemplated are maximally effective when they can be delivered to the site of target antigen activity.","In one aspect, methods of the disclosure include a step of administration of a CD37-specific binding molecule composition. In certain embodiments, the combinations of compounds may be administered concurrently, together in the same pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or separately (but concurrently). In other embodiments, the CD37 immunotherapeutic (i.e., the CD37-specific binding molecule) and a bifunctional chemotherapeutic can be administered sequentially, in any order and in any combination.","The binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or combination compositions may be administered orally, topically, transdermally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, vaginally, rectally, or by intracranial injection, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, both the CD37-specific binding molecule and the bifunctional chemotherapeutic are administered parenterally, either concurrently or sequentially. The term parenteral, as used herein, includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intracisternal injection, or infusion techniques. Administration by intravenous, intradermal, intramusclar, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection and or surgical implantation at a particular site is contemplated as well. Generally, compositions are essentially free of pyrogens, as well as other impurities that could be harmful to the recipient. Injection, especially intravenous, is preferred.","In one embodiment, administration is performed at the site of a cancer or affected tissue needing treatment by direct injection into the site or via a sustained delivery or sustained release mechanism, which can deliver the formulation internally. For example, biodegradable microspheres or capsules or other biodegradable polymer configurations capable of sustained delivery of a composition (e.g., a soluble polypeptide, antibody, or small molecule) can be included in the formulations of the disclosure implanted near the cancer.","Therapeutic compositions may also be delivered to the patient at multiple sites. The multiple administrations may be rendered simultaneously or may be administered over a period of time. In certain cases it is beneficial to provide a continuous flow of the therapeutic composition. Additional therapy may be administered on a period basis, for example, hourly, daily, weekly or monthly.","Binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or combination compositions of this disclosure may comprise one or more than one binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or any combination thereof. Also contemplated by the present disclosure is the administration of binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or combination compositions in conjunction with a further therapeutic agent. Further therapeutic contemplated by the disclosure are listed in paragraphs below.","A further therapeutic agent may be a B-cell-associated molecule.

Alternatively, the agents are administered in a separate formulation but concurrently, with concurrently referring to agents given, for example, within minutes, hours or days of each other.","In another aspect, the further therapeutic agent is administered prior to administration of the binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or combination composition. Prior administration refers to administration of the further therapeutic agent within the range of minutes, hours, or one week prior to treatment with the binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or combination composition. It is further contemplated that the further therapeutic agent is administered subsequent to administration of the binding molecule composition. Subsequent administration is meant to describe administration more than minutes, hours, or weeks after binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or combination composition treatment or administration.","It is further contemplated that when the binding molecule is administered in combination with a further therapeutic agent, wherein the further therapeutic agent is a cytokine or growth factor, or a chemotherapeutic agent, the administration may also include use of a radiotherapeutic agent or radiation therapy. The radiation therapy administered in combination with an antibody composition is administered as determined by the treating physician, and at doses typically given to patients being treated for cancer.","These compositions may be administered in a single dose or in multiple doses. Standard dose-response studies, first in animal models and then in clinical testing, reveal optimal dosages for particular disease states and patient populations.","The administration of the binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic or combination composition decreases the B-cell population by at least 20% after a single dose of treatment. In one embodiment, the B-cell population is decreased by at least about 20, about 30, about 40, about 50, about 60, about 70, about 80, about 90, or about 100%. B-cell reduction is defined as a decrease in absolute B-cell count below the lower limit of the normal range. B-cell recovery is defined as a return of absolute B-cell count to, for example, 70%, 80%, 90% of a subject's baseline value or normal range. Further, the administration of binding molecule, bifunctional chemotherapeutic, or combination composition of this disclosure results in desired clinical effects in the disease or disorder being treated.","In some embodiments, patients suffering from a disease associated with aberrant B cell activity who receive treatment according to the disclosure may demonstrate an overall beneficial response to the treatment, based on clinical criteria well known and commonly used in the art and as described below.","For example, in patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis, the administration may improve the patient's condition by a clinically significant amount [e.g., achieves the American College of Rheumatology Preliminary Detection of Improvement (ACR20)], and\/or an improvement of 20% in tender and swollen joint and 20% improvement in \u2157 remaining ACR measures (Felson et al., 1995, 38:727-35). Biological measures for improvement in an RA patient after administration of CD37-specific and CD20-specific binding molecules include measurement of changes in cytokine levels, measured via protein or RNA levels. Cytokines of interest include, but are not limited to, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, interferons, Blys, and APRIL. Cytokine changes may be due to reduced B cell numbers or decreased activated T cells. In RA patients, markers relevant to bone turnover (bone resorption or erosion) are measured before and after administration of CD20-specific binding molecules. Relevant markers include, but are not limited to, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, collagen breakdown fragments, hydroxyproline, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and RANK ligand (RANKL). Other readouts relevant to the improvement of RA include measurement of C reactive protein (CRP) levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor, CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies and assessment of systemic B cell levels and lymphocyte count via flow cytometry. Specific factors can also be measured from the synovium of RA patients, including assessment of B cell levels in synovium from synovium biopsy, levels of RANKL and other bone factors and cytokines set out above.","In a related aspect, the effects of combination administration on other diseases may be measured according to standards known in the art. For example, it is contemplated that Crohn's disease patients treated according to the invention achieve an improvement in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) in the range of about 50 to about 70 units, wherein remission is at 150 units (Simonis et al, 1998, 33:283-8). A score of 150 or 200 is considered normal, while a score of 450 is considered a severe disease score. It is further desired that administration of the CD37-specific and CD20-specific binding molecules results in a reduction in perinuclear anti-neutrophil antibody (pANCA) and anti-antibody (ASCA) in individuals affected by inflammatory bowel disease.","It is further contemplated that adult and juvenile myositis patients treated according to the disclosure may achieve an improvement in core set of evaluations, such as 3 out of 6 of the core set measured improved by approximately 20%, with not more than 2 of the core measurements worse by approximately 25% (see Rider et al., 2004, 50:2281-90).","It is further contemplated that SLE patients treated according to the disclosure may achieve an improvement in Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) or SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score of at least 1 point (Gladman et al, 1994, 21:1468-71) (Tan et al., Arthritis Rheum. 1982, 25:1271-7). A SLAM score of >5, or SLEDAI score>2, is considered clinically active disease. A response to treatment may be defined as improvement or stabilization over the in 2 disease activity measures (the SLE Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI] and the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure) and 2 quality of life measures (patient's global assessment and the Krupp Fatigue Severity Scale) (Petri et al., 2004, 50:2858-68.) It is further contemplated that administration of the binding molecule to SLE patients results in a reduction in anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. Alternatively, improvement may be gauged using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Criteria (BILAG).","It is further contemplated that multiple sclerosis patients treated according to the disclosure may achieve an improvement in clinical score on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability status scale (EDSS) (Kurtzke, F., 1983, 33:1444-52) of at least 0.5, or a delay in worsening of clinical disease of at least 1.0 on the Kurtzke scale (Rudick et al., Neurology 1997, 49:358-63).","It is further contemplated that patients suffering from IIM treated according to the disclosure may achieve a reduction in at least one of five criteria set out in the Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy Criteria (IIMC) assessment (Miller, F., supra). It is further contemplated that administration to IIM patients may result in a reduction in IIM associated factors selected from the group consisting of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and antinuclear autoantibody (ANA), myositis-specific antibodies (MSA), and antibody to extractable nuclear antigens. Alternatively, patients meet 3 out of 6 of the criteria set out in Rider et al., Arthritis Rheum., 50(7):2281-2290 (2004), with worsening in no more than 2 criteria.","In some embodiments, patients suffering from a B cell cancer that receive treatment according to the disclose may demonstrate an overall beneficial response to the treatment, based on clinical criteria well-known and commonly used in the art, and as described below, such as a decrease in tumor size, decrease in tumor number and\/or an improvement in disease symptoms.","Exemplary clinical criteria are provided by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), which has divided some of the classes of cancers into the clinical categories of \u201cindolent\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d lymphomas. Indolent lymphomas include follicular cell lymphomas, separated into cytology \u201cgrades,\u201d diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma\/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphoplasmacytoid\/Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Marginal zone lymphoma and Hairy cell leukemia. Aggressive lymphomas include diffuse mixed and large cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma\/diffuse small non-cleaved cell lymphoma, Lymphoblastic lymphoma, Mantle cell lymphoma and AIDS-related lymphoma. In some cases, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) is used in cases of aggressive and follicular lymphoma. Factors to consider in the IPI include age (<60 years of age versus>60 years of age), serum lactate dehydrogenase (levels normal versus elevated), performance status (0 or 1 versus 2-4) (see definition below), disease stage (I or II versus III or IV), and extranodal site involvement (0 or 1 versus 2-4). Patients with 2 or more risk factors have less than a 50% chance of relapse-free and overall survival at 5 years.","Performance status in the aggressive IPI is defined as follows: Grade Description: 0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction; 1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work; 2 Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities, up to and about more than 50% of waking hours; 3 Capable of only limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; 4 Completely disabled, unable to carry on any selfcare, totally confined to bed or chair; and, 5 Dead. (See, The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project. A predictive model for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 329:987-94, 1993.)","Typically, the grade of lymphoma is clinically assessed using the criterion that low-grade lymphoma usually presents as a nodal disease and is often indolent or slow-growing. Intermediate- and high-grade disease usually presents as a much more aggressive disease with large extranodal bulky tumors.","The Ann Arbor classification system is also used to measure progression of tumors, especially non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In this system, stages I, II, III, and IV of adult NHL can be classified into A and B categories depending on whether the patient has well-defined generalized symptoms (B) or not (A). The B designation is given to patients with the following symptoms: unexplained loss of more than 10% body weight in the 6 months prior to diagnosis, unexplained fever with temperatures above 38\u00b0 C. and drenching night sweats. Definitions of the stages are as follows: Stage I-involvement of a single lymph node region or localized involvement of a single extralymphatic organ or site. Stage II-involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm or localized involvement of a single associated extralymphatic organ or site and its regional lymph nodes with or without other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm. Stage III-involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm, possibly accompanying localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site, involvement of the spleen, or both. Stage IV-disseminated (multifocal) involvement of one or more extralymphatic sites with or without associated lymph node involvement or isolated extralymphatic organ involvement with distant (non-regional) nodal involvement. For further details, see The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project: A predictive model for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, New England J. Med. (1993) 329:987-994.","In one aspect, a therapeutic effect of the methods according to the disclosure is determined by the level of response, for example, a partial response is defined as tumor reduction to less than one-half of its original size. A complete response is defined as total elimination of disease confirmed by clinical or radiological evaluation. In one embodiment, the individual receiving treatment according to the invention demonstrates at least a partial response to treatment.","According to the Cheson criteria for assessing NHL developed in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (Cheson et al., 1999, 17:1244; Grillo-Lopez et al., 2000, 11:399-408), a complete response is obtained when there is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms, all lymph nodes have returned to normal size, the spleen has regressed in size, and the bone marrow is cleared of lymphoma.","An unconfirmed complete response is obtained when a patient shows complete disappearance of the disease and the spleen regresses in size, but lymph nodes have regressed by more than 75% and the bone marrow is indeterminate. An unconfirmed complete response meets and exceeds the criteria for partial response. An overall response is defined as a reduction of at least 50 percent in overall tumor burden.","Similar criteria have been developed for various other forms of cancers or hyperproliferative diseases and are readily available to a person of skill in the art. See, e.g., Cheson et al., 2006, 4:4-5, which describes criteria for assessing CLL; Cheson et al., 2003, 21:4642-9, which describes criteria for AML; Cheson et al., 2000, 96:3671-4, which describes criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes.","In another aspect, a therapeutic response in patients having a B cell cancer is manifest as a slowing of disease progression compared to patients not receiving therapy. Measurement of slowed disease progression or any of the above factors may be carried out using techniques well-known in the art, including bone scan, CT scan, gallium scan, lymphangiogram, MRI, PET scans, ultrasound, and the like.","As an additional aspect, the disclosure includes kits which comprise one or more compounds or compositions useful in the methods of this disclosure packaged in a manner which facilitates their use to practice methods of the disclosure. In a simplest embodiment, such a kit includes a compound or composition described herein as useful for practice of a method of the disclosure packaged in a container such as a sealed bottle or vessel, with a label affixed to the container or included in the package that describes use of the compound or composition to practice the method of the disclosure. Preferably, the compound or composition is packaged in a unit dosage form. The kit may further include a device suitable for administering the composition according to a preferred route of administration or for practicing a screening assay. The kit may include a label that describes use of the binding molecule composition(s) in a method of the disclosure.","Various CD37-specific binding proteins can be made with exemplary components provided in Tables 2-4. For example, antibodies or SMIP molecules can be made, and these molecules can be chimeric, humanized, or human. More specifically, preferred light chain variable region CDRs are found in SEQ ID NOS:236-240 and 247-254 and preferred heaving chain variable domain CDRs include SEQ ID NOS:241-245 and 247-254. Also, preferred light and heavy chain variable regions are provided in SEQ ID NOS:236-240 and SEQ ID NOS:241-245, respectively. Preferred light and heavy chain variable regions may also be found in SEQ ID NOS:247-254.

The binding domain comprises a humanized scFv based on the G28-1 antibody variable region CDRs, including mutations in the heavy chain CDR3 and in the light chain CDR1. The variable domains are linked by a (GS)(25 amino acid) sequence (SEQ ID NO:229), which is connected via a three amino acid junction (GDQ) to the amino terminus of a modified upper and core IgG1 hinge region (wherein the first two of three cysteines found in these hinge regions are each substituted with a serine). The carboxy-terminus of the hinge is fused to an effector domain comprising CH2 and CH3 domains of IgG.

Transfected CHO cells that produced the SMIP molecules were cultured in shake flasks.","All of the CD37-specific binding SMIP molecules were purified from CHO culture supernatants by Protein A affinity chromatography. A 50 mL rProtein A FF sepharose column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated at 5.0 mls\/min (150 cm\/hr) for 1.5 column volumes (CV) with dPBS. The culture supernatant was loaded onto the rProtein A Sepharose FF column at a flow rate of 1.7 mls\/min using the AKTA Explorer 100 Air (GE healthcare), capturing the recombinant SMIP molecules.

The recombinant CD37-specific binding molecules were eluted from the column with 100 mM glycine, pH 3.5. Fractions (10 mL) of the eluted product were recovered and then brought to pH 5.0 with 20% of the eluted volume of 0.5 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH6.0. This eluted product was concentrated to approximately 25 mg\/mL protein and filter sterilized.","This concentrated and sterilized protein was further purified by GPC size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to achieve separate SMIP (dimer) molecule from higher molecular weight aggregates. An XK 50\/100 column (GE healthcare) containing 1 L of Superdex 200 FF sepharose was equilibrated at 12.6 ml\/min (38 cm\/hr) for 1.5 column volumes (CV) with dPBS. A maximum volume of 54 mls (3% CV) of sample was applied to the column. The column continued to run at 12.6 ml\/min and the eluted protein was fractionated in 40 mL fractions. Each fraction was analyzed for product quality using an analytic HPLC, and the eluted fractions were pooled to greater than about 95% protein of interest (non-aggregated).

The CAS-024 peak is narrower and more symmetric than the CAS-001, CAS-002, and CAS-003 samples (broader and asymmetric). The CAS-006 (chimeric) molecule produces a sharp peak similar to CAS-024. The CAS-001, CAS-002, and CAS-003 samples all had a slight tailing shoulder, which if integrated, accounts for about 35% of the POI area. This \u2018shoulder\u2019 would be difficult to separate from the POI and probably represents either misfolded conformers or a heterogenous population of molecules (e.g., have different levels of glycosylation). This indicates that CAS-024 was not only expressed better, but this construct also produces a more homogenous population of molecules.","A competition assay was used to compare the binding affinity of different anti-CD37 specific small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) molecules to CD-37 found on Ramos cells (a B-lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a Burkitt lymphoma). An SEC purified chimeric anti-CD37 SMIP molecule (CAS-006, SEQ ID NO:247) was labeled with the FMAT Blue\u00ae fluorescence dye (Applied Biosystems) and used as the standard to compete with purified unlabeled chimeric anti-CD37 SMIP molecule (positive control) and purified unlabeled humanized anti-CD37 SMIP test molecules. Higher affinity showed up as a weaker fluorescence signal and an FL1 fluorescence value was used to generate the competition curve. Briefly, the reagent FMAT Blue\u00ae labeled chimeric anti-CD37 SMIP molecule was diluted to 2 \u03bcg\/ml in FACS blocking buffer and the purified protein samples (CAS-001 (SEQ ID NO:6), CAS-002 (SEQ ID NO:48), CAS-003 (SEQ ID NO:52), and CAS-024 (SEQ ID NO:253)) were serially diluted 1:2 to concentrations ranging from 50 \u03bcg\/ml to 0.02 \u03bcg\/ml. Ramos cells were harvested at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspend in FACS blocking buffer at 4\u00d710cells\/10 ml buffer. To each well of a black 96-well plate the following was added: 50 \u03bcl sample, 50 \u03bcl FMAT Blue\u00ae labeled chimeric anti-CD37 SMIP molecule, and 50 \u03bcl Ramos cells (4\u00d710\/well). The plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and read on an 8200 Cellular Detection System (Applied Biosystems) gated for middle cell size and low signal.","This FMAT competition assay showed that CAS-024 (humanized anti-CD37 SMIP molecule having a VHVL scFv with a 25 amino acid variable domain linker) has the same affinity for CD37 as the parent chimeric anti-CD37 SMIP molecule and, in contrast, has an unexpectedly up to a 4-fold greater affinity for CD37 than the humanized anti-CD37 SMIP molecules having the reverse VLVH structure and a shorter 16 amino acid variable domain linker (see ). The best binding, although still significantly less than CAS-006 or CAS-024, was found in a VLVH construct that does not have any CDR mutations (CAS-001). However, CAS-001 was consistently the worst expressing construct and produced a non-homogenous population of purified molecules\u2014even for this construct, CAS-024 bound from 1.5- to 2-fold better than CAS-001.","This result was also surprising because M99 and Y102 in the heavy chain CDR3 of CAS-024 are mutated\u2014the Y102 position is generally conserved and it would be expected that a change at this position alone would diminish or even abolish binding (e.g., CAS-062, mutated at position Y102, has detectable but severely decreased binding compared to CAS-001 or CAS-024, while CAS-063 to CAS-067 each have barely detectable to no binding activity in this assay when a mutation at position M99 or D101 is added, data not shown). Thus, the structure of CAS-024 provided a molecule that surprisingly bound as well as the chimeric molecule, CAS-006.","CAS-024 and other CD37-specific binding SMIP molecules were produced by recombinant DNA technology and transfected into HEK293 cells for 7 days. Cell culture supernatants were harvested on day 7 and titered using Octec Q Protein A sensor.","Similar to the results found in Example 2, here Table 6 shows that CAS-024 (VHVL format with 25 amino acid variable domain linker) expressed from about 5-fold to about 27-fold better than the other humanized or mouse-human hybrid anti-CD37 SMIP molecules.

The mouse-human hybrid molecules, regardless of variable domain orientation (mouseVH-humanizedVL with a 22 amino acid linker or humanizedVL-mouseVH with a 16 amino acid linker), bound as well as or even better than (1.5- to 2-fold) CAS-006 and CAS-024 (see ). These data show that a mouse-human hybrid molecule without mutations binds as well as or better than CAS-006, regardless of orientation, and that a fully humanized VLVH construct with no CDR mutations binds better than other humanized molecules but still has diminished binding compared to CAS-006 or CAS-024. Together, these data suggest that no mutations in CDRs for this molecule would be better binders. Also, the particular order (VLVH or VHVL) did not seem to solve the expression problem, even when a longer variable domain linker is used (see CAS-014). Thus, it was unpredictable to select a molecule with the CAS-024 structure and properties similar to the parent molecule CAS-006.","Experiments were performed to identify the CD37 epitope bound by CAS-006 and other previously described CD37-specific antibodies.

One mg (200 ul) was added to kit tubes with a stirbar, and 1M NaHCO(adjusted to pH 8.5 with 6N NaOH), was added to a final concentration of 0.1M. 50 ul DMSO was added to 370 ug of FITC and was added to the tubes at molar ratios of 15, 20, 30 and 40 FITC: protein using the following formula to determine the ul of FITC to add: [\u03bcl of FITC solution to add=5 mg\/mL protein\u00d70.2 mL\u00d7389\u00d7100\u00d7 desired molar ratio\/Molecular weight of CAS-006 (110,000)].","Reactions were shielded from light and stirred continuously for 75 minutes at room temperature.

The OD at 280 nM and 494 nM was determined with 2 ul drops on the Nanodrop; the extinction coefficient for CAS-016 was experimentally determined for this instrument by reading dilutions of the starting unconjugated SMIP molecule, the concentration of each of the conjugates was 4.25 mg\/ml and the following FITC:protein rations were determined: 2.7 FITC\/CAS-016 at a ratio of 15; 3.7 FITC\/CAS-016 at a ratio of 20; 4.4 FITC\/CAS-016 at a ratio of 30; and 5.1 FITC\/CAS-016 at a ratio of 40.","BSA was added to 3 mg\/mL to help stabilize the protein. Binding of each fraction was assessed at dilutions ranging from 100-24,300\u00d7 on Ramos and 3200-25,600 on human PBMC. All bound, but the MR30 ratio was chosen for further use since it gave a high MFI that was well maintained over the titration range used, indicating that binding avidity was least affected in this reaction.","FITC labeled antibody conjugates were titrated from 10 ng\/mL to 10 \u03bcg\/mL in an initial binding study to determine the optimal amount to use in the blocking studies. The level chosen was just below saturating amounts, and was kept constant in the subsequent assays, while levels of blocking antibody were increased over a 10-fold range. Data were plotted as percent of maximal binding versus concentration of blocking antibody, so that higher levels indicate less efficient blocking, while lower levels indicate more efficient blocking activity. All of the antibodies tested showed blocking activity of the maximal binding observed without unlabeled reagents ().","BJAB-cells, a lymphoblastoid B-cell line were then stained with a panel of various clones of anti-CD37 mAbs, including MB371, BL14, NMN46, IPO24, HH1, WR17, and chimeric CAS-006 SMIP.","For competitive binding assays, 2.5\u00d710BJAB cells were incubated in 96-well V-bottom plates in staining media (PBS with 2% mouse sera) with the FITC-conjugated anti-CD37 mAbs at 1.25 \u03bcg\/mL in the presence of unconjugated anti-CD37 MAb at the indicated concentrations (2.5, 1.25, 0.6, or 0.3 \u03bcg\/ml) or staining media for 45 minutes on ice in the dark.

Samples were centrifuged, washed in PBS, then fixed in 200 \u03bcl 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS (USB, Cleveland, Ohio). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACsCalibur instrument using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.).","Each antibody showed dose dependent inhibition of binding, indicating that all the molecules tested bind to an identical or closely related epitope. A different potency for inhibition of binding was observed for each antibody. CAS-006 SMIP had the highest level of blocking activity of all molecules tested, while HH1 gave an intermediate level of blocking activity, and WR17, IPO24 blocked better than MB371, but showed less effective blocking than the other two unlabeled molecules ().","In addition to analysis of blocking activity, a similar series of experiments was performed in which various CD37 targeted antibodies were tested for their ability to compete with one another for binding to the CD37 receptor. The results from these experiments, like results obtained in the blocking studies for all the molecules tested, indicated that the various CD37 targeted antibodies and CAS-006 have the same or closely overlapping epitopes.","The objective of this experiment was to examine the dose response to treatment with CAS-024 in a model of established subcutaneous human tumor (DOHH2) xenograft model in SCID mice. DOHH2 is a CD20CD37 human B-lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with follicular lymphoma (Kluin-Nelemans et al., Leukemia 5:221, 1991). Thus, DOHH2 was derived from a patient with a non-Burkitt's NHL.","Five million DOHH2 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of female CB-17SCID mice (Harlan, Somerville, N.J.) at 6.5 weeks of age and at a mean weight of 18.0\u00b10.1 g (ranging from 14.6 to 22.6 g). On day 8 post-tumor inoculation, palpable tumors were apparent in a majority of mice.

Thus, at the end of the study, the survival curves and the incidence of tumor-free mice in the CAS-024 treated group differed significantly from the huIgG control group and the RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) treated group.  shows that CAS-024 was statistically superior to RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) in the in vivo treatment of this animal model of follicular lymphoma.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0241","num":"0240"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"287pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Median Survival Time and Incidence of Tumor-Free Mice"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"Fischer's"]},{"entry":[{},"Treatment",{},"p Value","Death (other",{},"Exact Test"]},{"entry":[{},"Days and","Median","from Log","than for","Tumor-","(Comparison"]},{"entry":["Treatment","Cumulative","Survival","Rank","Tumor Size","Free Mice","of tumor-free"]},{"entry":["Group","Dose","Time (Days)","Test","Sacrifice)","at Day 81","incidence)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["HuIgG","Days 0, 4, 8","13","\u2014","0\/15","\u20020\/15 (0%)","NA"]},{"entry":[{},"600 \u03bcg"]},{"entry":["CAS-024","Days 0, 4, 8",{"b":"Undefined","sup":"d,e"},"<0.0001","1\/15",{"b":"10\/14 (71%)","sup":"f"},"<0.0001"]},{"entry":["IP","600 \u03bcg",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Rituxan\u2009\u00ae","Days 0, 4, 8",{"b":"43"},"<0.0001","0\/15","\u20020\/15 (0%)","NA"]},{"entry":["IP","600 \u03bcg"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"left","id":"FOO-00014"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"left","id":"FOO-00015"},"sup":"b"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"left","id":"FOO-00016"},"sup":"c"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"left","id":"FOO-00017"},"sup":"d"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"left","id":"FOO-00018"},"sup":"e"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"left","id":"FOO-00019"},"sup":"f"}}]}}]}}},"In conclusion, CAS-024 and RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) were efficacious as single agents in a human tumor (DOHH2) xenograft model in SCID mice. While both agents caused an initial tumor regression in the majority of mice, long-term tumor regression was observed only in the group of mice treated with CAS-024 as tumors relapsed after optimal anti-CD20 treatment. Consequently, CAS-024, a humanized anti-CD37 SMIP, shows significant efficacy in pre-clinical tumor xenograft models including models that show that RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) treatment fails over time. These results therefore suggest that CAS-024 treatment of B cell lymphoma and leukemia patients is beneficial and is a viable alternative treatment in patients who fail RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) treatment.","It was previously demonstrated that CAS-006 acts synergistically in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent fludarabine to kill chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in vitro (see, e.g., US Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0059306). As CLL cells do not actively divide in cell culture in vitro, the data indicate that cell proliferation is not required for the pro-apoptotic effect of CAS-006 or CAS-024 for its synergy with chemotherapeutic agents. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether CAS-024 and various chemotherapeutic agents were effective on a mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell line, Rec-1, that actively grows and divides in cell culture in vitro and whether the combination of CAS-024 and a chemotherapeutic agent (drug) would desensitize or enhance the response of mantle cell lymphoma cells to various chemotherapeutic agents. The chemotherapeutic agents tested were doxorubicin, vincristine, and fludarabine, which are used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other lymphoid malignancies.","Rec-1 cells, a CD37+ human B cell line established from a patient with mantle cell lymphoma, were tested for growth inhibition in response to crosslinked CAS-024 in the presence or absence of doxorubicin, vincristine, or fludarabine (see ). CAS-024 was preincubated with anti-human IgG F(ab)\u2032to crosslink the protein. Cells were cultured with medium alone or with medium containing various concentrations of the crosslinked CAS-024 protein, in the presence or absence of various concentrations of doxorubicin, vincristine, or fludarabine. Cultures were incubated for 96 hours and growth inhibition was assessed using an ATP viable cell detection system (i.e., viable cells quantified by ATP release).","The Median Effect\/Combination Index (CI) method of Chou and Talalay (Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22:27, 1984) was used for data analysis. A numerical value, assigned to each drug combination at predefined dose levels, enabled quantitative drug\/drug interaction comparisons between different drug combinations. Results were expressed as combination indices (CI) vs. effect level, in which effect level represented percent inhibition of cell growth. The mean CI\u00b1SEM for each effect level was averaged over three experiments. A CI<1.0 was considered synergy, CI=1.0 additivity, and CI>1.0 antagonism. Values presented are the mean\u00b1SEM for each effect level, averaging three independent assays.","The combination of CAS-024 with vincristine or fludarabine was synergistic (CI<1.0) and the combination of CAS-024 and doxorubicin was additive (CI not significantly different from 1.0). None of CAS-024 and chemotherapeutic agent combinations were antagonistic (CI>1.0) across all effect levels. Therefore, the combination of CAS-024 with each of the three chemotherapeutic agents tested did not desensitize target cells to drug-induced growth inhibition, but instead resulted in synergistic or additive inhibitory effects on target cell growth. A preferred embodiment would be the combination of CAS-024 (SEQ ID NO:253) with vincristine or fludarabine. These data indicate that the efficacy of established chemotherapeutics increase when used in combination with CAS-024.","As provided herein, pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that CD37 SMIP molecules mediate significantly greater direct and natural killer (NK)-cell mediated killing of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells as compared to other therapeutic antibodies used in CLL. Hence, a Phase \u00bd, open label, dose escalation study has been initiated in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).","Patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who had adequate organ function, platelets>30,000\/mmwere eligible. Six doses and two different schedules (cohorts 1-10) have\/or will be studied. The planned doses range from 0.03 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg IV once a week for 4 doses (cohort 1-6 and 9). The second schedule (cohort 7, 8, and 10) will test 3.0, 6.0, or 10.0 mg\/kg on days 1, 3 and 5 the first week followed by 3 weekly doses. Dose escalation and de-escalation is based on Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events (CTC AE) toxicity grades. Patients may receive 2 additional cycles, if positive biologic effect after first cycle.","Results: To date, 22 patients have been enrolled (cohort 1-7 and 9) and completed treatment (all have received prior fludarabine and rituximab treatment). Six patients have entered a second cycle and two patients have entered a third cycle. The patients being treated have gone through a number of prior regimens (e.g., Cohort 4 patients had from 6 to 10 (median 6) and Cohort 5 had 5 to 13 (median 9.5) prior regimens). Eight of the ten have high risk genomic features [del(17p13.1), n=5 and del(11q22.3), n=3]. No dose limiting toxicities or serious adverse events have occurred. Mild (grade 1-2) infusion toxicity has been observed in three patients. Beginning with the 0.3 mg\/kg dose, all eight patients demonstrated evidence of biological activity including patients with del(17p13.1). Two patients had partial clearing of leukemia cutis, and the median reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count has been 64% (see ). One patient had a 99% reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count with no serious adverse events and a continuing response after 3 months of treatment (see ). One patient had an increase in hemoglobin of 40% and a reduction in lymph node size of 36% as determined by CT scan and continues to respond after 3 months of treatment (see ). Two patients had a significant increase in platelet count.","Conclusion: To date, this CD37 SMIP molecule is a well tolerated treatment with minimal infusional toxicity and no observed dose limiting toxicity. There also seems to be any complement involvement since patients with severe drops in lymphocyte counts are not showing signs of tumor lysis syndrome. Encouraging reduction in tumor lymphocyte blood counts, reduction in lymph node\/spleen size, clearing of leukemia cutis, and\/or partial clearing of marrow disease, and\/or improvement in normal hematopoeitic function in patients with high risk genomic CLL have already been observed at low, non-saturating doses of CD37 SMIP molecule.","This study was to determine the effects of CAS024, bendamustine, and the combination of CAS024 and bendamustine on Rec-1 (a mantle cell lymphoma cell line) and SU-DHL-6 (a diffuse large cell lymphoma line) cells.","The following human cell lines expressing CD37 were used: Rec-1 and SU-DHL-6 (both from DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Bendamustine (TREANDA\u00ae) was purchased from the University of Washington Pharmacy (Seattle, Wash.) and was dissolved in PBS and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until use.","Rec-1 and SU-DHL-6 cells were plated at 1\u00d710cells\/well in 100 \u03bcL medium in 96 well black-sided, black-bottomed plates. Cells were treated with various concentrations of CAS024 that had been preincubated with anti-human IgG F(ab)\u2032and plates were incubated for 96 hr at 37\u00b0 C., 5% COin the presence of serial dilutions of bendamustine. The final volume in each well was 150 \u03bcL. After incubation, plates were cooled to room temperature and labeled with 100 \u03bcL\/well of ATPlite detection reagent (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.). The assay measures cellular ATP as a marker for viable cells. Samples were analyzed by detection of luminescence using a Topcount NXT (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) plate reader. Data were reduced using a 4-parameter curve fit in Prism (version 4.0, Graphpad Software, San Diego, Calif.) and the ICdefined as the concentration resulting in 50% inhibition compared to untreated cultures.","For synergy determination the Median Effect\/Combination Index (CI) method was used for data analysis (Chou and Talalay). A numerical value, assigned to each drug combination at predefined dose levels, enables quantitative drug\/drug interaction comparisons between different drug combinations. The CI values assign interactions into three categories: synergism, additivity, and antagonism (CI<1.0, =1, or >1.0 respectively). After labeling and data reduction, Combination Index (CI) values were determined using the Calcusyn software package (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The results of two separate experiments show that the combination of CAS024 with bendamustine resulted in synergistic inhibitory effects on target cell growth (see, ). Similar results were obtained showing that the combination of CAS024 with bendamustine also synergistically inhibited SU-DHL-6 cell growth.","Combination effects of CAS-024 with another alkylating agent, chlorambucil, were also determined using the method described above and the concentrations shown in . Unlike bendamustine, chlorambucil in combination with CAS-024 did not result in synergistic inhibitory effects on SU-DHL-6 cell growth (see, )","This study was to compare the efficacy of CAS024 combined with bendamustine against each agent individually administered against subcutaneous DOHH2 human tumor xenografts in SCID mice.","Establishment of tumor xenografts and sorting into treatment groups. As described above, DOHH2 is a CD20CD37 human B-lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with follicular lymphoma. Five million DOHH2 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of female CB-17 SCID mice. On day 8 post-tumor inoculation, palpable tumors were apparent in majority of mice. The tumor-bearing mice were sorted into five groups with equivalent mean tumor volumes (n=15 per group; 3 cages of 5 mice for each group). The day of the sort was defined as day 0. Tumor diameters were determined with a pair of calipers and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: V=\u00bd[length\u00d7(width)]. The baseline mean tumor volume was 231 mm, the median baseline tumor size was 229 mm, and the range was 201 to 261 mm.","In vivo treatment. Groups of mice were treated with an injection of 0.2 mL of PBS containing 10 \u03bcg huIgG (days 0, 4, 8 IV), 10 \u03bcg CAS024 (days 0, 4, 8 IV), 10 mg\/kg Bendamustine (0, 2, 4, 7, 9 IP), or 10 \u03bcg CAS024 (days 0, 4, 8 IV) AND 10 mg\/kg Bendamustine (0, 2, 4, 7, 9 IP).","Monitoring and endpoints. Mice were monitored daily by visual inspection. Weights were determined weekly, and tumor diameters were determined at least 3 times per week (M, W, F) by an observer blinded (see above) to the treatment groups. Tumor volumes were calculated as described above.","Mice were euthanized if their tumor volume reached more than 1500 mm(or 1200 mmon Fridays). Death was not an endpoint in this study, and unless noted otherwise, \u201csurvival\u201d of a mouse was determined by the time it was euthanized due to its tumor volume reaching the predetermined limits. Mice were euthanized if their tumor volume exceeded the parameters noted above, ulceration of a tumor occurs, the tumor inhibits the mobility of the mouse, or if weight loss exceeds 20%.","Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Significant differences in mean tumor volumes and mean relative tumor volumes were determined using a one-way ANOVA for nonparametric data (Kruskal-Wallis test) with Dunn's multiple comparison post test. Significant differences in survival of mice over time were determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test for comparing survival curves. Significant differences in the incidence of tumor-free mice were determined using Fisher's exact test. p values<0.05 were considered significant.","In the Bendamustine treated groups scruffy coats and diarrhea were seen starting around day 6. On day 10, one mouse in the CAS024+Bendamustine treatment group was euthanized due to \u226720% weight loss. This mouse was treated as censored data for the analysis of survival curves. No clinical signs of toxicity were seen in the CAS024 alone treatment group.","All treatments, demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the growth of DOHH2 compared to huIgG. On day 13 (which was the last day all mice were alive) the mean tumor volume and mean relative tumor volume of all the treatment groups were statistically different than the huIgG control group of mice (). A significant difference in mean tumor volumes and mean relative tumor volumes was also seen between Bendamustine and the CAS024+Bendamustine combination treatment group. There were no significant differences in mean tumor volumes or mean relative tumor volumes between any two other treatment groups. Mean tumor volumes over time of the four groups are shown in .","The tumors in the mice treated with huIgG grew rapidly, and all of the mice in this group were euthanized by day 17. As shown in  and summarized in Tables 12 and 13, the survival of mice dosed with any of the treatment groups was prolonged compared to the huIgG treated group (p\u22660.0001 for all groups). There was also a significant difference between the survival curves of all three treatment groups and each other with the CAS024\/bendamustine combination being superior to either single agent.","None of the huIgG-treated mice were alive (thus none were tumor-free) at the end of the study (day 34) ( and Table 12). The incidence of tumor-free mice in the other groups was 0\/15 (0%) in the CAS024 and Bendamustine treatment groups and 2\/14 (14%) in the CAS024+Bendamustine combination treatment group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of tumor-free mice between any of the treatment groups.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0266","num":"0265"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 12"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Median Survival Time and Incidence of Tumor-Free"},{"entry":"Mice at the end of the Observation Period"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Median","Tumor-Free"]},{"entry":["Treatment",{},"Survival Time","Incidence at"]},{"entry":["Group","Treatment Days","(Days)","End of Study"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["huIgG","Days 0, 4, 8","15","0\/15 (0%)"]},{"entry":["CAS024","Days 0, 4, 8",{"b":"17","sup":"b"},"0\/15 (0%)"]},{"entry":"10 \u03bcg"},{"entry":["Bendamustine","Days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9",{"b":"17"},"0\/15 (0%)"]},{"entry":"10 mg\/kg"},{"entry":["CAS024 +","Days 0, 4, 8",{"b":"24"},"2\/14 (14%)"]},{"entry":["Bendamustine","0, 2, 4, 7, 9"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00020"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00021"},"sup":"b"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00022"},"sup":"c"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00023"},"sup":"d"}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0267","num":"0266"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 13"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"p Values for Comparison of Survival Curves Between Treated Groups"},{"entry":"p Values for Comparison of survival curves (log- rank test)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"TRU-016 +"]},{"entry":[{},"huIgG","TRU-016","Bendamustine","Bendamustine"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["huIgG","NA",{"b":"<0.0001"},{"b":"<0.0001"},{"b":"<0.0001"}]},{"entry":["TRU-016",{"sup":["\u2002\u2009","a"],"b":"<0.0001 "},"NA",{"b":"0.0050"},"0.01"]},{"entry":["Bendamustine",{"b":"<0.0001"},{"b":"0.0050"},"NA",{"b":"<0.0001"}]},{"entry":["TRU-016 +",{"b":"<0.0001"},{"b":"0.01"},{"b":"<0.0001"},"NA"]},{"entry":"Bendamustine"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"This study shows that CAS024 combined with Bendamustine exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of DOHH2 tumors in SCID mice greater than that seen with either agent alone.","The various embodiments described above can be combined to provide further embodiments.
