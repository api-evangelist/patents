No. 61\/491,151, filed May 27, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers DK86125, DK72517, HL73856, EP00415, DK35124, and EY13574 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Technical Field","Therapeutics are needed for treating diseases and disorders related to aberrant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR)-mediated ion transport, such as polycystic kidney disease, increased intestinal fluid secretion, and secretory diarrhea. Small molecule compounds are described herein that are potent inhibitors of CFTR activity and may be used for treating such diseases and disorders.","2. Description of the Related Art","The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated chloride (Cl) channel expressed in epithelial cells in mammalian airways, intestine, pancreas, and testis (see, e.g., Sheppard et al., 79:S23-45 (1999); Gadsby et al., 40:477-83 (2006)). Hormones, such as a \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, or a toxin, such as cholera toxin, lead to an increase in cAMP, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and phosphorylation of the CFTR Cl channel, which causes the channel to open. An increase in cell Ca can also activate different apical membrane channels. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C can either open or shut Cl channels in the apical membrane. CFTR is predominantly located in epithelia where it provides a pathway for the movement of Cl ions across the apical membrane and a key point at which to regulate the rate of transepithelial salt and water transport.","CFTR chloride channel function is associated with a wide spectrum of disease, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and with polycystic kidney disease, secretory diarrhea, and some forms of male infertility. Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary lethal disease caused by mutations in CFTR (see, e.g., Quinton, 79:S3-S22 (1999); Boucher, 23:146-58 (2004)). Observations in human patients with CF and mouse models of CF indicate the functional importance of CFTR in intestinal and pancreatic fluid transport, as well as in male fertility (see, e.g., Grubb et al., 79:S193-S214 (1999); Wong, 4:107-110 (1997)). CFTR is also expressed in enterocytes in the intestine and in cyst epithelium in polycystic kidney disease (see, e.g., O'Sullivan et al., 32:976-983 (1998); Sullivan et al., 78:1165-91 (1998); Strong et al., 93:347-54 (1994); Mall et al., 126:32-41 (2004); Hanaoka et al., 270:C389-C399 (1996); Kunzelmann et al., 82:245-289 (2002); Davidow et al., 50:208-18 (1996); Li et al., 66:1926-38 (2004); Al-Awqati, 110:1599-1601 (2002); Thiagarajah et al., 3:594-99 (2003)).","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common human genetic diseases and a major cause of chronic renal insufficiency requiring dialysis and kidney transplantation (see, e.g., Torres et al., 369, 1287-301 (2007)). Cyst growth in PKD involves fluid secretion into the cyst lumen coupled with epithelial cell hyperplasia. PKD is characterized by massive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts of renal tubular origin that compromise normal renal parenchyma and cause renal failure (see, e.g., Arnaout, 52: 93-123, 2001; Gabow 329: 332-342, 1993; Harris et al., 81: 75-85, 2004; Wilson 350: 151-164, 2004; Sweeney et al., 326: 671-685, 2006; Chapman 18: 1399-1407, 2007). Human autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in one of two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding the interacting proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively (see, e.g., Wilson, supra; Qian et al., 87: 979-987, 1996; Wu et al., 93:177-88, 1998; Watnick et al., Torres et al., 10: 363-364, 2004 25: 143-44 (2000)).","Cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) involves progressive fluid accumulation (see, e.g., Grantham et al., 1:148-57 (2006); Ye et al., 329:310-13 (1993)). Fluid secretion into the cyst lumen requires chloride secretion by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, (see, e.g., Hanaoka et al., 11:1179-87 (2000); Magenheimer et al., 17:3424-37 (2006)), a cAMP-regulated chloride channel, which, when mutated, causes the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (see, e.g., Riordan, 77:701-26 (2008)). CFTR is expressed strongly in epithelial cells lining cysts in ADPKD (see, e.g., Brill et al., 93:10206-11 (1996)). Cystic fibrosis (i.e., CFTR-deficient) mice are resistant to cyst formation and CFTR inhibitors block cyst formation in cell\/organ culture and in vivo models (see, e.g., Davidow et al., 50:208-18 (1996); Li et al., 66:1926-38 (2004)). In rare families affected with ADPKD and cystic fibrosis, individuals with both ADPKD and CF have less severe renal disease than those with ADPKD only (see, e.g., Cotton et al., 32:1081-83 (1998); O'Sullivan et al., 32:976-83 (1998); Xu et al., 19:529-34 (2006)).","Several CFTR inhibitors have been discovered, although many exhibit weak potency and lack CFTR specificity. The oral hypoglycemic agent glibenclamide inhibits CFTR Cl conductance from the intracellular side by an open channel blocking mechanism (see, e.g., Sheppard et al., 503:333-346 (1997); Zhou et al., 120:647-62 (2002)) at high micromolar concentrations where it affects other Cl and cation channels (see, e.g., Edwards & Weston, 1993; Rabe et al., 110:1280-81 (1995); Schultz et al., 79:S109-S144 (1999)). Other non-selective anion transport inhibitors, including diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropyl-amino)benzoate (NPPB), and flufenamic acid, also inhibit CFTR by occluding the pore at an intracellular site (see, e.g., Dawson et al., 79:S47-S75 (1999); McCarty, 203:1947-62 (2000)).","High-affinity CFTR inhibitors also have clinical application in the therapy of secretory diarrheas. Secretory diarrheas caused by enterotoxins, such as cholera and Travelers' diarrhea (enteropathogenic ), require functional CFTR for primary chloride secretion into the intestinal lumen, which secondarily drives sodium and water secretion (see, e.g., Kunzelmann et al., 82:245-89 (2002); Thiagarajah et al., 3:594-9 (2003)). Cell culture and animal models indicated that intestinal chloride secretion in enterotoxin-mediated secretory diarrheas occurs mainly through CFTR (see, e.g., Clarke et al., 257:1125-28 (1992); Gabriel et al., 266:107-109 (1994); Kunzelmann and Mall, 82:245-89 (2002); Field, 111:931-43 (2003); and Thiagarajah et al., 126:511-519 (2003)). Several classes of small molecule CFTR inhibitors have been described previously (see, e.g., review by Verkman et al., 8:153-71 (2009)).","Diarrheal disease in children is a global health concern: Approximately four billion cases among children occur annually, resulting in at least two million deaths. Travelers' diarrhea affects approximately 6 million people per year. Antibiotics are routinely used to treat diarrhea; however, the antibiotics are ineffective for treating many pathogens, and the use of these drugs contributes to development of antibiotic resistance in other pathogens. Oral replacement of fluid loss is also routinely used to treat diarrhea, but is primarily palliative. Therapy directed at reducing intestinal fluid secretion (\u2018anti-secretory therapy\u2019) has the potential to overcome limitations of existing therapies.","A need exists for CFTR inhibitors, particularly those that are safe, non-absorbable, highly potent, inexpensive, and chemically stable.","Briefly, provided herein are pyrimido-pyrrolo-oxazine-dione (BPO) compounds and certain pyrimido-pyrrolo-quinoxalinedione (PPQ) compounds, and compositions comprising such compounds, that inhibit cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mediated ion transport.

Also provided herein are certain pyrimido-pyrrolo-quinoxalinedione (PPQ) compounds that inhibit CFTR. The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein are capable of inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport (e.g., CFTR-mediated Cl transport) (i.e., inhibiting CFTR conductance). The most potent BPO compounds have substantially improved metabolic stability (greater than 10-fold) compared with a previously characterized PPQ compound (called herein PPQ-102; see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2011\/019737). These compounds disclosed herein also exhibit greater polarity and potency for inhibiting CFTR chloride conductance in vitro (\u02dc10-fold) and renal cystogenesis ex vivo (>5-fold).","The compounds and compositions comprising these compounds are useful for administering to a subject who has or who is at risk of developing a disease, disorder, or condition that is treatable (i.e., administration of the compounds and compositions will provide a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit) by inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport. The compounds described herein may therefore be useful for treating diseases, disorders, and conditions including, for example, polycystic kidney disease, secretory diarrhea, and other intestinal secretion conditions, diseases, and disorders characterized by aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion.","As noted above, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a major health care burden and has a prevalence of 1 in 500 to 1000 individuals (see, e.g., Torres et al., (2007), supra). No FDA-approved drug is available at present that is capable of slowing the progression of renal disease in PKD. Cyst expansion in ADPKD also requires cyst epithelial cell proliferation involving mTor signaling (see, e.g., Lieberthal et al., 20:2493-502 (2009); Torres et al., 5: 1312-29 (2010)), which is the basis of several \u2018anti-proliferative\u2019 therapies under development (see, e.g., Belibi et al., 19:315-28 (2010); Torres, 3:1212-18 (2008); Masoumi et al., 67:2495-2510 (2007); Patel et al., 18:99-106 (2009); Torres, 17:190-204 (2010)). \u201cAnti-secretory\u201d (e.g., CFTR inhibition) therapy is predicted to complement antiproliferative therapy or be effective alone in life-long treatment of ADPKD. The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein are CFTR inhibitors that may be useful as anti-secretory therapy for PKD. An alternative anti-secretory therapy, vasopressin V2 antagonism, is in clinical trials for PKD and is based on the concept that cysts in PKD often express V2 receptors, which when stimulated by antidiuretic hormone, elevate cytoplasmic cAMP and activate both CFTR chloride conductance and mTOR signaling (see, e.g., Belibi et al. (2010), supra; Torres, 3:1212-18 (2008)). An alternative, V2 receptor-independent strategy has been suggested for reducing cAMP involving small-molecule phosphodiesterase activators, which were shown to resist growth in an in vitro PKD model (see, e.g., Tradtrantip et al., 75:134-42 (2009)). Pure anti-proliferative therapies, most based on the central role of mTOR signaling in proliferation of cyst-lining epithelial cells, are also in clinical trials, as well as renin-angiotensin inhibitors and statins (see, e.g., Masoumi et al., (2007), supra; Patel et al., (2009), supra; Torres, (2010), supra).","Several classes of small-molecule CFTR inhibitors have been identified by high-throughput screening and characterized (see, e.g., Verkman et al., supra). Exemplary compounds are shown in . Thiazolidinone-class CFTR inhibitors such as CFTR-172 act on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane at a site near the CFTR pore to block CFTR chloride conductance (see, e.g., Caci et al., 413:135-42 (2008); Ma et al., 110:1651-58 (2002); Taddei et al., 558:52-56 (2004); U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,235,573 and 7,638,543). CFTR-172 inhibits CFTR with ICin the range of 300-3000 nM, depending on cell type and membrane potential and has low toxicity and metabolic stability with primarily renal excretion (see, e.g., Ma et al., supra; Sonawane et al., 94:134-43 (2005)). The tetrazolo-substituted thiazolidinone Tetrazolo-172 (see ) had improved water solubility compared to CFTR-172 (see, e.g., Sonawane et al., 16:8187-95 (2008); International Patent Application Publication No. WO 09\/120,803), and reduced cyst expansion in organ culture and mouse models of PKD (see, e.g., Yang et al., 19:1300-10 (2008)). A second class of small-molecule CFTR inhibitors, the glycine hydrazides, such as GlyH-101 (see ), block CFTR at an external site within the CFTR pore (see, e.g., Muanprasat et al., 124:125-37 (2004); U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,414,037 and 7,888,332). Membrane-impermeant, non-absorbable conjugates of glycine hydrazides with polyethylene glycols (see ) (see, e.g., Sonawane et al., 20:130-32 (2006); Sonawane et al., 15:718-28 (2008); U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,414,037 and 7,888,332; U.S. Application Publication No. US2009\/0253799; Int'l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 09\/146,144) and lectins (see, e.g., Sonawane et al., 132:1234-44 (2007); U.S. Application Publication No. 2008\/0171793; Int'l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 08\/079,897) inhibit CFTR with an ICof 50-100 nM when added at the mucosal cell surface, and were effective in rodent models of secretory diarrheas such as cholera. An absorbable glycine hydrazide, phenyl-GlyH-101 (see ), reduced cyst growth in PKD (see, e.g., Yang et al., 2008, supra; Int'l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 09\/120,803).","Additional small molecule screening yielded pyrimido-pyrrolo-quinoxalinedione (PPQ) compounds, which were uncharged, and thus membrane-potential insensitive, CFTR inhibitors, and were very potent CFTR inhibitors (Tradtrantip et al., 52, 6447-55 (2009); Int'l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 2011\/019737). One inhibitor, called PPQ-102 (7,9-dimethyl-11-phenyl-6-(5-methyl furan-2-yl)-5,6-dihydro-pyrimido-[4\u2032,5\u2032-3,4]pyrrolo[1,2-\u03b1]quinoxaline-8,10-(7H,9H)-dione, see ) inhibited CFTR chloride current with IC\u02dc90 nM, by a mechanism involving stabilization of the channel closed-state. PPQ-102 prevented cyst expansion and reduced the size of pre-formed cysts in an embryonic kidney organ culture model of PKD. However, PPQ-102 has poorer metabolic stability than desired, (precluding animal testing in certain animal models), as well as low polarity and hence low aqueous solubility.","Derivative compounds of PPQ compounds were prepared. The BPO compounds described herein exhibit significantly improved stability, water solubility, and CFTR inhibition potency. The most potent compounds described herein have significantly improved potency more than 10-fold improved metabolic stability, and much greater polarity and thus increased aqueous solubility compared to PPQ-102. As described herein, the improved compounds were effective in preventing renal cyst expansion in a PKD model. By way of example with respect to CFTR inhibitory activity, the compound BPO-27 described herein has an ICof approximately 8 nM compared with PPQ-102 having an ICof 100 nM. The PPQ and BPO compounds described herein may also be useful for treating secretory diarrheas and for investigating and elucidating CFTR-dependent cellular and physiological processes.","Pyrimido-Pyrrolo-Oxazine-Dione (BPO) and Pyrimido-Pyrrolo-Quinoxalinedione (PPQ) Compounds","Provided herein are compounds that have the capability to inhibit CFTR-mediated ion transport.

Accordingly, methods of inhibiting ion transport (e.g., inhibiting chloride ion transport) by CFTR are provided herein.","Also as described herein, the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II (and substructures thereof) that are CFTR inhibitors are useful in the treatment of a CFTR-mediated or -associated condition, i.e., any condition, disorder, or disease, that results from activity of CFTR, such as CFTR-mediated ion transport. The condition, disorder, or disease may result from aberrantly increased CFTR activity, particularly aberrantly increased CFTR-mediated ion transport. These conditions, disorders, and diseases, are thus amenable to treatment by inhibiting CFTR activity, e.g., inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion, such as chloride ion, transport.","Accordingly, methods are provided for treating a disease, disorder, or condition that is treatable by inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport. In certain embodiments, methods are provided for inhibiting cyst formation and\/or cyst enlargement, particularly kidney cyst formation or enlargement. These methods are described in greater detail below and herein.","The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein are capable of blocking or impeding the CFTR pore or channel and inhibiting ion transport (e.g., inhibiting chloride ion (Cl) transport (also referred to as inhibiting chloride ion conductance)) by CFTR, which is located in the outer cell membrane of a cell. Provided herein are methods of inhibiting ion transport by CFTR, which methods comprise contacting a cell that has CFTR located in its outer membrane with any one or more of the BPO or PPQ compounds described herein, thus permitting CFTR and the compound or compounds to interact. Interaction of a BPO or PPQ compound described herein results in binding to CFTR, thereby inhibiting chloride ion transport.","In one embodiment, a method is provided for inhibiting (i.e., preventing, retarding, slowing, impeding) cyst formation and\/or for inhibiting (i.e., preventing, retarding, slowing, impeding) or reducing cyst enlargement, or reducing the size and\/or volume of one or more cysts, which method comprises contacting (a) a cell that comprises CFTR and (b) at least one BPO or PPQ compound as described herein, under conditions and for a time sufficient for CFTR and the compound to interact, wherein the compound inhibits ion (e.g., chloride ion) transport by CFTR, (i.e., the compound inhibits CFTR-mediated ion transport in a statistically significant, clinically significant, and\/or biologically significant manner). In particular embodiments, the cyst formation or cyst enlargement that is inhibited is kidney cyst formation or kidney cyst enlargement (i.e., cyst formation or cyst enlargement in at least one kidney is inhibited).","Inhibiting kidney cyst formation and\/or cyst enlargement by the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein is useful for treating a patient who has been diagnosed with or who is at risk of developing polycystic kidney disease. Accordingly, methods are provided herein for treating polycystic kidney disease, which methods comprise administering to a subject in need thereof (a) a pharmaceutically suitable excipient and (b) at least one of the BPO or PPQ compounds (i.e., the compounds of structure I and substructures (Ia(i)), (Ib(i)), (IA), (IA1), (IB), (IB1), (IC), (IC1), and specific compounds and the compounds of structure (II), substructures IIA, and specific compounds) as described herein (i.e., a pharmaceutical composition as described herein). In a specific embodiment, polycystic kidney disease is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In another specific embodiment, polycystic kidney disease is autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.","In another embodiment, a method for treating a disease, disorder, or condition that is treatable by inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport includes a disease, disorder, or condition that is associated with aberrantly increased CFTR-mediated ion transport. Accordingly, in a specific embodiment, a method is provided for treating a disease, condition, or disorder associated with aberrantly increased ion transport by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), wherein the method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutically suitable excipient and at least one of the BPO or PPQ compounds described herein (i.e., a pharmaceutical composition as described herein), wherein ion transport mediated by CFTR is inhibited. In a specific embodiment, the disease, condition, or disorder is aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, which may be acute aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion.","In another embodiment, the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I and structure II, respectively (and substructures and specific compounds thereof) are used in the treatment of conditions associated with aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, particularly acute aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, including secretory diarrhea. Diarrhea amenable to treatment using any one of the BPO or PPQ compounds described herein can result from exposure to a variety of agents or pathogens, including those that cause an enteropathogenic infection. In a more specific embodiment, secretory diarrhea is caused by an enteric pathogen. Exemplary enteric pathogens include without limitation, , (particularly enterotoxigenic (ETEC)), (including ), , parasites (e.g., (e.g., ), ), or diarrheal viruses (e.g., rotavirus). Secretory diarrhea resulting from increased intestinal fluid secretion mediated by CFTR may also be a disorder or sequelae associated with food poisoning, or exposure to a toxin including but not limited to a bacterial enterotoxin such as cholera toxin (), a toxin, a toxin, a toxin, or a toxin, or any other bacterial toxin that causes aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion.","Other secretory diarrheas that may be treated by administering any one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein include diarrhea associated with or that is a sequelae of AIDS; diarrhea that is a condition related to the effects of anti-AIDS medications such as protease inhibitors; diarrhea that is a condition of or is related to administration of chemotherapeutic compounds; inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, diverticulosis, and the like. Intestinal inflammation modulates the expression of three major mediators of intestinal salt transport and may contribute to diarrhea in ulcerative colitis both by increasing transepithelial Cl secretion and by inhibiting the epithelial NaCl absorption (see, e.g., Lohi et al., 283:G567-75 (2002)). Thus, one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II and substructures thereof, and specific structures as described herein, may be administered in an amount effective to inhibit CFTR ion transport and, thus, decrease intestinal fluid secretion.","As understood by a person skilled in the medical art, the terms, \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment,\u201d refer to medical management of a disease, disorder, or condition of a subject (i.e., patient) (see, e.g., Stedman's Medical Dictionary). In general, an appropriate dose and treatment regimen provide the BPO and\/or PPQ compound in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit. Therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit resulting from therapeutic treatment and\/or prophylactic or preventative measures includes, for example, an improved clinical outcome, wherein the object is to prevent or slow or retard (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, or to prevent or slow or retard (lessen) the expansion or severity of such disorder. As discussed herein, beneficial or desired clinical results from treating a subject include, but are not limited to, abatement, lessening, or alleviation of symptoms that result from or are associated the disease, condition, or disorder to be treated; decreased occurrence of symptoms; improved quality of life; longer disease-free status (i.e., decreasing the likelihood or the propensity that a subject will present symptoms on the basis of which a diagnosis of a disease is made); diminishment of extent of disease; stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease; delay or slowing of disease progression; amelioration or palliation of the disease state; and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable; and\/or overall survival. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival when compared to expected survival if a subject were not receiving treatment. Subjects in need of treatment include those who already have the condition or disorder as well as subjects prone to have or at risk of developing the disease, condition, or disorder, and those in which the disease, condition, or disorder is to be prevented (i.e., decreasing the likelihood of occurrence of the disease, disorder, or condition).","Other embodiments provided herein include use of at least one of the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I, structure II, substructures, and specific structures as described herein for treating any one of the diseases or disorders described herein (e.g., polycystic kidney disease, aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, secretory diarrhea) that is treatable by inhibiting ion transport (e.g., chloride ion transport) by CFTR. In one embodiment, a use is provided for the preparation of a medicament for treating any one of the diseases, conditions or disorders described herein (e.g., polycystic kidney disease, aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, secretory diarrhea) that is treatable by inhibiting ion transport (e.g., chloride ion transport) by CFTR.","In other embodiments, methods are provided for treating a disease, disorder, or condition described herein (including but not limited to PCKD, secretory diarrhea or other condition associated with aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion). Such methods comprise administering the compound or a pharmaceutical composition that comprises at least one BPO or PPQ compound and a pharmaceutically suitable (i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable, or physiologically suitable or acceptable) excipient in combination with, either in the same composition or in a separate (or second) composition, at least one thiazolidinone compound and\/or at least one glycine hydrazide compound that inhibit CFTR-mediated ion transport (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,235,573; 7,414,037; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008\/0064666; International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2008\/079897; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2009\/0253799; International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2009\/038292, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties) for treating any one of the diseases or disorders described herein that is treatable by inhibiting ion transport (e.g., chloride ion transport) by CFTR. When a first composition comprising at least one BPO or PPQ compound described herein and a second composition comprising at least one thiazolidinone compound and\/or at least one glycine hydrazide compound is administered to a subject in need thereof, the first composition may be administered prior to, concurrently with, or subsequent to administration of the second composition.","In particular embodiments of the methods described herein, the subject is a human or non-human animal. A subject in need of the treatments described herein may exhibit symptoms or sequelae of a disease, disorder, or condition described herein or may be at risk of developing the disease, disorder, or condition. Non-human animals that may be treated include mammals, for example, non-human primates (e.g., monkey, chimpanzee, gorilla, and the like), rodents (e.g., rats, mice, gerbils, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits), lagomorphs, swine (e.g., pig, miniature pig), equine, canine, feline, bovine, and other domestic, farm, and zoo animals.","In another embodiment, a method is provided for inhibiting ion transport by a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) comprising contacting (a) a cell that comprises CFTR and (b) at least one of the compounds of structure I or structure II, substructures, and specific structures described herein, under conditions and for a time sufficient that permit CFTR and the compound to interact, thereby inhibiting ion transport (e.g., chloride ion transport) by CFTR, that is, inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport.","In another embodiment, a method is provided for treating secretory diarrhea comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and at least one of the compounds of structure I or structure II, substructures, and specific structures described herein (i.e., a pharmaceutical composition as described herein). In a particular embodiment, the subject is a human or non-human animal.","The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using the PPQ compounds and compositions comprising these compounds are described in greater detail herein.","Methods for Characterizing and Using the BPO and PPQ Compounds","Also provided herein are methods that are useful, for example, for characterizing the potency of BPO and PPQ compounds (and derivatives and analogs thereof) to inhibit CFTR-mediated ion transport (particularly CFTR-mediated chloride ion transport); for monitoring the level (i.e., for example, concentration level, mass level, or IClevel) of a BPO or PPQ compound that has been administered to a subject; and examining disease pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis by blocking or inhibiting CFTR function as models for cystic fibrosis disease, such as in ex vivo tissues (e.g., human tissues) and in animals.","In certain embodiments, these methods may be performed in vitro, such as with using a biological sample as described herein that comprises, for example, cells obtained from a tissue, body fluid, or culture-adapted cell line, or other biological source as described in detail herein below. The step of contacting refers to combining, mixing, or in some manner familiar to persons skilled in the art that permits the compound and the cell to interact such that any effect of the compound on CFTR activity (e.g., the capability of a BPO or PPQ compound to inhibit CFTR ion transport or the level to which the compound inhibits CFTR ion transport) can be measured according to methods described herein and routinely practiced in the art. Methods described herein for inhibiting ion transport by CFTR are understood to be performed under conditions and for a time sufficient that permit the CFTR and the compound to interact. Additional BPO and PPQ compounds may be identified and\/or characterized by such a method of inhibiting ion transport by CFTR, performed with isolated cells in vitro. Conditions for a particular assay include temperature, buffers (including salts, cations, media), and other components that maintain the integrity of the cell and the compound, which a person skilled in the art will be familiar and\/or which can be readily determined. A person skilled in the art also readily appreciates that appropriate controls can be designed and included when performing the in vitro methods and in vivo methods described herein.","In secretory epithelia, fluid secretion occurs by primary chloride exit across the cell apical membrane, which secondarily drives transepithelial sodium and water secretion (see, e.g., Barrett et al., 62:535-72 (2000)). In renal cells, lumenal fluid accumulation causes progressive cyst expansion directly by net water influx into the cyst lumen, and indirectly by stretching cyst wall epithelial cells to promote their division and thinning (Ye et al., 329:310-13 (1993); Sullivan et al., 78:1165-91 (1998); Tanner et al., 6:1230-41 (1995)). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, CFTR inhibition interferes with fluid secretion at the apical chloride exit step.","Methods for characterizing the compounds described herein, for determining an effective concentration to achieve a therapeutic benefit, for monitoring the level of a BPO or PPQ compound in a biological sample, and for other purposes as described herein and apparent to a person skilled in the art, may be performed using techniques and procedures described herein and routinely practiced by a person skilled in the art. Exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, fluorescence cell-based assays of CFTR inhibition (see, e.g., Galietta et al., 281:C1734-C1742 (2001); Ma et al., 110:1651-58 (2002)), short circuit apical chloride ion current measurements and patch-clamp analysis (see, e.g., Muanprasat et al., 124:125-37 (2004); Ma et al., (2002), supra; Sonawane et al., 20:130-32 (2006); see also, e.g., Carmeliet, 55:5-26 (1993); Hamill et al., 391:85-100 (1981)).","Methods that may be used to characterize a BPO or a PPQ compound, including those described herein, and to determine effectiveness of the compound for reducing, inhibiting, or preventing cyst enlargement and\/or preventing or inhibiting cyst formation, and which compound is therefore useful for treating a subject who has or who is at risk of developing PKD, include methods described in the art and herein. The PPQ compounds may be analyzed in models using embryonic or neonatal kidney organ cultures, for example (see, e.g., Yang et al., 19:1300-1310 (2008); Magenheimer et al., 17:3424-37 (2006); Tradtrantip et al., 52:6447-55 (2009)). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, certain scientific observations support use of CFTR inhibitors to slow cyst growth in autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD): (a) CFTR is expressed strongly in epithelial cells lining cysts in ADPKD; (b) cystic fibrosis (CFTR-deficient) mice are resistant to cyst formation; (c) CFTR inhibitors block cyst formation in cell\/organ culture and in vivo models; and (d) in some families affected with ADPKD and cystic fibrosis, individuals with both ADPKD and CF have less severe renal disease than those with ADPKD only (see, e.g., O'Sullivan et al., 32:976-983 (1998); Cotton et al., 32:1081-1083 (1998); Xu et al., 19:529-34 (2006)). Intact kidney models to study cystogenesis are useful for recapitulating native kidney anatomy and cellular phenotype (see, e.g., Magenheimer et al., 17:3424-3437 (2006)).","An additional example of a cell culture model for determining whether a compound inhibits cyst formation or enlargement includes an MDCK cell (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cell) model of PKD (Li et al., 66:1926-38 (2004); see also, e.g., Neufeld et al., 41:1222-36 (1992); Mangoo-Karim et al., 86:6007-6011 (1989); Mangoo-Karim et al., 3:2629-32 (1989); Grantham et al., 102:158-62 (1989); Mohamed et al., 322: 259-65 (1997)). See also, e.g., Murcia et al., 55:1187-97 (1999); Igarishi et al., 13:2384-88 (2002)). Accordingly, provided herein are methods for identifying and\/or characterizing BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II (and substructures and specific structures thereof) by determining the capability of the compound to inhibit cyst enlargement or prevent or inhibit cyst formation in an in vitro cell culture model.","The MDCK cell line may also be used in methods and techniques for determining that a compound lacks cytotoxicity, for example, by evaluating cell viability (e.g., by any one of numerous cell staining methods and microscopy methods routinely practiced in the art), cell proliferation (e.g., by determining the level of incorporation of nucleotide analogs and other methods for measuring division of cells), and\/or apoptosis by using any one of a number of techniques and methods known in the art and described herein. Other methods for determining or quantifying the capability of a compound described herein to inhibit or reverse cyst enlargement or expansion and\/or to inhibit or prevent cyst formation and\/or to reduce the number of cysts formed include an embryonic kidney organ culture model, which is practiced in the art and described herein (see, e.g., Magenheimer et al., 17: 3424-37 (2006); Steenhard et al., 16:1623-1631 (2005); Yang et al., 19:1300-1310 (2008)). In such an embryonic kidney culture model, organotypic growth and differentiation of renal tissue can be monitored in defined media in the absence of any effect or influence by circulating hormones and glomerular filtration (Magenheimer et al., supra; Gupta et al., 63:365-376 (2003)). In metanephric organ culture, the early mouse kidney tubule has an intrinsic capacity to secrete fluid by a CFTR-dependent mechanism in response to cAMP (Magenheimer et al., supra).","Persons skilled in the art may also use animal models to characterize a BPO or PPQ compound, including those described herein, and to determine effectiveness of the compound for reducing, inhibiting, reversing, or preventing cyst enlargement and\/or preventing or inhibiting cyst formation thereby reducing the number of cysts formed, and to determine the usefulness of such compounds for treating a subject who has or who is at risk of developing MD. By way of example, Pkd1mice and Ksp-Cre transgenic mice in a C57BL\/6 background may be generated as described and practiced in the art (see, e.g., Shibazaki et al., 13:10-11 (2004) (abstract); Shao et al., 13:1837-46 (2002)). Ksp-Cre mice express Cre recombinase under the control of the Ksp-cadherin promoter (see, e.g., Shao et al., supra). Pkd1; Ksp-Cre mice may be generated by cross-breeding Pkd1mice with Pkd1:Ksp-Cre mice. The effect of a test compound may be determined by quantifying cyst size and growth in metanephroi and kidney sections, histological analyses of tissues and cells, and delay or prevention of renal failure and death (see, e.g., Tradtrantip et al., , supra; Shibazaki et al., supra).","The BPO and PPQ compounds may also be analyzed in animal models that are art-accepted animal models for increased intestinal fluid secretion. By way of example, a closed intestinal loop model of cholera, suckling mouse model of cholera, and in vivo imaging of gastrointestinal transit may be used for characterizing the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein (see, e.g., Takeda et al., 19:752-54 (1978); see also, e.g., Spira et al., 32:739-747 (1981)). Animal models of secretory diarrheas have been useful for determining efficacy of thiazolidinone (see, e.g., Thiagarajah et al., 126:511-19 (2004)) and glycine hydrazide CFTR inhibitors (see, e.g., Sonawane et al., 15:718-28 (2008); Sonawane et al., 132:1234-44 (2007)) and may be employed for testing the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein.","The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein may also be useful for establishing animal models that may be used as cystic fibrosis models. The CF phenotype (in the absence of the CF genotype) may be established by administering any one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein. CFTR inhibitors are also useful to create the CF phenotype in ex vivo human and animal tissues, as has been done, for example, in studies of the role of CFTR in airway submucosal gland fluid secretion (see, e.g., Thiagarajah et al., 18:875-77 (2004)). Finally, though mouse, pig and ferret models of CFTR gene deletion exist, pharmacological creation of the CFTR phenotype in animals by CFTR inhibitors might provide complementary data on CFTR function in the absence of compensatory phenomena that can occur in transgenic animal models.","Methods of inhibiting CFTR-mediated ion transport include in vitro methods that comprise contacting a cell with any one or more of the BPO and\/or PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II (and substructures and specific structures thereof) as described herein, under conditions and for a time sufficient for CFTR present in the outer membrane of the cell and the compound to interact. Cells (or cell lines) that may be used in such methods are cells that express CFTR and have channels or pores formed by CFTR in the cell membrane. Exemplary cells and cell lines include without limitation a Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cell (including a FRT cell that co-expresses human or other animal wildtype CFTR and the halide indicator YFP-H148Q or other comparable yellow fluorescent protein); a cultured human bronchial epithelial cell; and a gastrointestinal cell (such as T84 human intestinal epithelial cells)) that comprises CFTR in the outer membrane of the cell. Such methods are useful for identifying analogs of the BPO and PPQ compounds (i.e., species of structure I or structure II, including species of substructures described herein) and for characterizing the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein.","In certain embodiments, the cell is contacted in an in vitro assay, and the cell may be obtained from a subject or from a biological sample. A biological sample may be a blood sample (from which serum or plasma may be prepared and cells isolated), biopsy specimen, body fluids (e.g., urine, lung lavage, ascites, mucosal washings, synovial fluid), bone marrow, lymph nodes, tissue explant (e.g., kidney cells), organ culture (e.g., kidney), or any other tissue or cell preparation from a subject or a biological source. A sample may further refer to a tissue or cell preparation in which the morphological integrity or physical state has been disrupted, for example, by dissection, dissociation, solubilization, fractionation, homogenization, biochemical or chemical extraction, pulverization, lyophilization, sonication, or any other means for processing a sample derived from a subject or biological source. The subject or biological source may be a human or non-human animal, a primary cell culture (e.g., a primary kidney cell culture or primary intestinal epithelial cell culture), or culture adapted cell line, including but not limited to, genetically engineered cell lines that may contain chromosomally integrated or episomal recombinant nucleic acid sequences, immortalized or immortalizable cell lines, somatic cell hybrid cell lines, differentiated or differentiatable cell lines, transformed cell lines, and the like.","The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein may also be used in any one or more of the assays described above and herein for in vitro screening methods. By way of non-limiting examples, the compounds may be used as controls for comparing the potency, polarity, solubility, or other properties of compounds in compound libraries when screening assays are performed to identify and characterize compounds that inhibit CFTR activity.","Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Using Pharmaceutical Compositions","Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising any one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II (and substructures and specific structures thereof). The compounds described herein may be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition for use in treatment or preventive (or prophylactic) treatment (e.g., reducing the likelihood of occurrence of cyst formation), of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which includes autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD). In other embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one BPO or PPQ compound may be formulated for use in treatment or preventive treatment (i.e., for reducing the likelihood of occurrence) of a disease, condition, or disorder manifested by increased intestinal fluid secretion, such as secretory diarrhea.","In pharmaceutical dosage forms, any one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I, substructures, and specific structures or structure II, substructures, and specific structures described herein may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative, such as a salt, or they may also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The methods and excipients described herein are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.","Optimal doses may generally be determined using experimental models and\/or clinical trials. The optimal dose may depend upon the body mass, weight, or blood volume of the subject. In general, the amount of a BPO or PPQ compound of structure I or structure II (and substructures and specific structures thereof) described herein, that is present in a dose, ranges from about 0.01 \u03bcg to about 1000 \u03bcg per kg weight of the host. The use of the minimum dose that is sufficient to provide effective therapy is usually preferred. Subjects may generally be monitored for therapeutic effectiveness using assays suitable for the condition being treated or prevented, which assays will be familiar to those having ordinary skill in the art and are described herein. The level of a compound that is administered to a subject may be monitored by determining the level of the compound in a biological fluid, for example, in the blood, blood fraction (e.g., serum), and\/or in the urine, and\/or other biological sample from the subject. Any method practiced in the art to detect the compound may be used to measure the level of compound during the course of a therapeutic regimen.","The dose of a composition comprising at least one of the BPO or PPQ compounds described herein for treating PCKD may depend upon the subject's condition, that is, stage of the disease, renal function, severity of symptoms caused by enlarged cysts, general health status, as well as age, gender, and weight, and other factors apparent to a person skilled in the medical art. Similarly, the dose of the BPO or PPQ compound for treating a disease or disorder associated with aberrantly increased CFTR function, including but not limited to intestinal fluid secretion, secretory diarrhea, such as a toxin-induced diarrhea, or secretory diarrhea associated with or a sequelae of an enteropathogenic infection, Traveler's diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), AIDS, chemotherapy and other diseases or conditions described herein may be determined according to parameters understood by a person skilled in the medical art. Accordingly, the appropriate dose may depend upon the subject's condition, that is, stage of the disease, general health status, as well as age, gender, and weight, and other factors considered by a person skilled in the medical art.","Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a manner appropriate to the disease or disorder to be treated as determined by persons skilled in the medical arts. An appropriate dose and a suitable duration and frequency of administration will be determined by such factors as the condition of the patient, the type and severity of the patient's disease, the particular form of the active ingredient, and the method of administration. In general, an appropriate dose (or effective dose) and treatment regimen provides the composition(s) comprising at least one BPO or PPQ compound (as described herein) in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit (for example, an improved clinical outcome, such as more frequent complete or partial remissions, or longer disease-free and\/or overall survival, or a lessening of symptom severity or other benefit as described in detail above). When a subject is treated for aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion, clinical assessment of the level of dehydration and\/or electrolyte imbalance may be performed to determine the level of effectiveness of a compound and whether dose or other administration parameters (such as frequency of administration or route of administration) should be adjusted.","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (or PCKD) and polycystic renal disease are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a group of disorders characterized by a large number of cysts distributed throughout enlarged kidneys. The resultant cyst development leads to impairment of kidney function and can eventually cause kidney failure. PKD includes autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and recessive autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), in all stages of development, regardless of the underlying etiology or cause. Effectiveness of a treatment for PKD may be monitored by one or more of several methods practiced in the medical art including, for example, by monitoring renal function by standard measurements, and by radiologic investigations that are performed with ultrasounds, computerized tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging, which are useful for evaluating renal cyst morphology and volume and estimating the amount of residual renal parenchyma.","To evaluate and to monitor the effectiveness of any one of the BPO or PPQ compounds described herein to treat PKD or a related disease or condition, one or more of several clinical assay methods may be performed that are familiar to a person skilled in the clinical art. For example, a clinical method called a urea clearance test may be performed. A blood sample is obtained from a subject to whom the compound is being administered so that the amount of urea in the bloodstream can be determined. In addition, a first urine sample is collected from the subject and at least one hour later, a second urine sample is collected. The amount of urea quantified in the urine indicates the amount of urea that is filtered, or cleared by the kidneys into the urine. Another clinical assay method measures urine osmolality (i.e., the amount of dissolved solute particles in the urine). Inability of the kidneys to concentrate the urine in response to restricted fluid intake, or to dilute the urine in response to increased fluid intake during osmolality testing may indicate decreased kidney function.","Urea is a by-product of protein metabolism and is formed in the liver. Urea is then filtered from the blood and excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The BUN (blood urea nitrogen) test measures the amount of nitrogen contained in the urea. High BUN levels may indicate kidney dysfunction, but because blood urea nitrogen is also affected by protein intake and liver function, the test is usually performed in conjunction with determination of blood creatinine, which is considered a more specific indicator of kidney function. Low clearance values for creatinine and urea indicate diminished ability of the kidneys to filter these waste products from the blood and excrete them in the urine. As clearance levels decrease, blood levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen increase. An abnormally elevated blood creatinine, a more specific and sensitive indicator of kidney disease than the BUN, is diagnostic of impaired kidney function.","The pharmaceutical compositions described herein that comprise at least one BPO or PPQ compound may be administered to a subject in need by any one of several routes that effectively deliver an effective amount of the compound. Such administrative routes include, for example, oral, parenteral, enteral, rectal, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, intramuscular, and transdermal. By way of example, at least one or more of the compounds may be administered to a mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., by an enteral route, which includes administration directly to the tract via a tube inserted into the nose, stomach, or small intestine) or to a mucosal surface of the oral or nasal cavities, or (e.g., intranasal, buccal, sublingual, and the like). These administrative methods and additional methods are discussed in greater detail herein.","A pharmaceutical composition may be a sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion, which additionally comprises a physiologically acceptable excipient (pharmaceutically acceptable or suitable excipient or carrier) (i.e., a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the activity of the active ingredient). Such compositions may be in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas (aerosol). Alternatively, compositions described herein may be formulated as a lyophilizate, or compounds may be encapsulated within liposomes using technology known in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other components, which may be biologically active or inactive. Such components include, but are not limited to, buffers (e.g., neutral buffered saline or phosphate buffered saline), carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans), mannitol, proteins, polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine, antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione, stabilizers, dyes, flavoring agents, and suspending agents and\/or preservatives.","Any suitable excipient or carrier known to those of ordinary skill in the art for use in pharmaceutical compositions may be employed in the compositions described herein. Excipients for therapeutic use are well known, and are described, for example, in (Gennaro, 21Ed. Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. (2005)). In general, the type of excipient is selected based on the mode of administration, as well as the chemical composition of the active ingredient(s). Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for any appropriate manner of administration, including, for example, topical, oral, nasal, intrathecal, rectal, vaginal, intraocular, subconjunctival, sublingual or parenteral administration, including subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal, intracavernous, intrameatal or intraurethral injection or infusion. For parenteral administration, the carrier preferably comprises water, saline, alcohol, a fat, a wax or a buffer. For oral administration, any of the above excipients or a solid excipient or carrier, such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, kaolin, glycerin, starch dextrins, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, glucose, sucrose and\/or magnesium carbonate, may be employed.","A pharmaceutical composition (e.g., for oral administration or delivery by injection) may be in the form of a liquid. A liquid pharmaceutical composition may include, for example, one or more of the following: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, preferably physiological saline, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride, fixed oils that may serve as the solvent or suspending medium, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, propylene glycol or other solvents; antibacterial agents; antioxidants; chelating agents; buffers and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. A parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. The use of physiological saline is preferred, and an injectable pharmaceutical composition is preferably sterile.","A composition comprising any one of the compounds of structure (I) or structure (II), substructures, and specific structures described herein may be formulated for sustained or slow release. Such compositions may generally be prepared using well known technology and administered by, for example, oral, rectal or subcutaneous implantation, or by implantation at the desired target site. Sustained-release formulations may contain the compound dispersed in a carrier matrix and\/or contained within a reservoir surrounded by a rate controlling membrane. Excipients for use within such formulations are biocompatible, and may also be biodegradable; preferably the formulation provides a relatively constant level of active component release. The amount of active compound contained within a sustained release formulation depends upon the site of implantation, the rate and expected duration of release, and the nature of the condition to be treated or prevented.","For oral formulations, a BPO or PPQ compound of structure (I) and substructures and specific structures or of structure (II) and substructures and specific structures described herein can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders, such as starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, and acacia; with disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, or xanthan gum; with lubricants, such as talc, sodium oleate, magnesium stearate sodium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, or sodium chloride; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and flavoring agents. The compounds may be formulated with a buffering agent to provide for protection of the compound from low pH of the gastric environment and\/or an enteric coating. A BPO or PPQ compound may be formulated for oral delivery with a flavoring agent, e.g., in a liquid, solid or semi-solid formulation and\/or with an enteric coating.","Oral formulations may be provided as gelatin capsules, which may contain the active compound along with powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar carriers and diluents may be used to make compressed tablets. Tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of active ingredients over a period of time. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract.

Publication No. WO 2011\/019737). As shown in Scheme 1,6-methyluracil 1 was exhaustively alkylated using dimethyl sulfate to give 1,3,6-trimethyluracil 2 in 98% yield. 1,3,6-Trimethyluracil 2 was subject to Friedel-Crafts acylation utilizing benzoyl chloride and anhydrous zinc chloride to give ketone 3a in 66% yield. Bromination of ketone 3a gave 4a in quantitative yield. At the first point of diversification, 4a was reacted with substituted 1,2-phenylenediamines (2 eq) to give pyrroles 5a-c in 97% (R\u2550H), 89% (R\u2550NO), and 83% (R=Me) yields. Pyrroles 5a-c were condensed with the appropriately substituted furfural or thiophene carbaldehyde using catalytic acid to give PPQ-(5-15, 23) with yields of 57-98%. PPQ-102 was obtained on a gram scale in 83% yield. Amide analogs were synthesized from PPQ-102 and acid halides or anhydrides to give PPQ-(1-3), in 73%, 80% and 79% yields, respectively. The nitrosamine PPQ-4 was synthesized from PPQ-102 and t-butyl nitrite in 79% yield.","Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of benzoxazine BPO compounds. Ketone 3d (R=Me) was synthesized from 2 by Friedel-Crafts acylation utilizing m-tolyl chloride in 26% yield, and subsequently brominated to give 4d in 93% yield. The condensation of substituted 2-aminophenols with 4a,d in ethanol gave pyrroles 5d-h in 96% (R\u2550CH, R\u2550R\u2550H), 96% (R\u2550R\u2550R\u2550H), 88% (R\u2550H, R\u2550Cl, R\u2550NO), 94% (R\u2550R\u2550H, R\u2550NO) and 98% (R\u2550R=H, R\u2550COOEt) yields, respectively. Pyrroles 5d-h were then condensed with substituted furfurals using catalytic acid at 150\u00b0 C. to give BPO-(16-22, 24-26) in yields of 43-84%. BPO-25 was saponified utilizing KOH in THF and water to give BPO-27 in 83% yield after acid work-up.","In an experiment intended to improve yield, bromination of ketone 3a was conducted under strict anhydrous conditions. Ketone 3a was refluxed in CHCland bromine (1 eq), but after several hours TLC showed little product. Serendipitously, when several drops of wet CHClwere added to the reaction, a remarkably rapid discharge of the bromine color and evolution of fuming HBr gas occurred. After several minutes TLC indicated a near quantitative yield of 4a, which spontaneously crystallized when dried in vacuo. When 4a was condensed with N-methyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, the more reactive secondary amine can undergo alkylation by displacement of the readily accessible bromide of 4a. The high regioselectivity evident in the 83% isolated yield of 5c suggests that the formation of the pyrrole ring in the initial reaction is one of imine formation rather than alkylation, despite the crowded reaction center.","The analogs were efficiently synthesized in 5-6 steps with 11-61% overall yield.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0473","num":"0472"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00062","num":"00062"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00062","he":"47.75mm","wi":"51.48mm","file":"US09062073-20150623-C00062.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Modification of PPQ-102 by bromine substitution at the 5-position of the furan ring, replacement of the secondary amine with an ether bridge, and carboxylation, gave BPO-27.

In a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with stir bar, BPO-25 (1.00 g, 1.73 mmol) was dissolved in THF (100 mL) with gentle heat and then allowed to cool. A mixture of water (70 mL) and KOH (768 mg, 13.7 mmol) was quickly added to the vigorously stirred solution which formed a white suspension. After 3 days the mixture was a homogenous yellow solution free of BPO-25 as determined by LC\/MS. The THF was removed using a rotary evaporator and warm water bath leaving behind a viscous aqueous solution. The solution was made strongly acidic to litmus using 1% aq. HCl while stirring vigorously with a glass rod. The resulting gel was shaken with EtOAc (125 mL) and then quickly poured into a 1 liter separatory funnel where a precipitate formed in the organic layer.

The mixture was shaken vigorously until no undissolved solids remained. The EtOAc layer was collected and extracted with brine and then dried over NaSO. The EtOAc was evaporated in a 50 ml recovery flask on a rotory evaporator and then dried under high vacuum to give a white solid (24 mg, 44 mmol, yield 89%). To the recovery flask was added a magnetic stir bar, DMAP (1 mg, 8 mmol), EDAC (9 mg, 47 mmol) and finally dry DCM (15 ml). Once the stirred solution became homogenous, dry ethanol (10 \u03bcL, 7.9 mg, 172 mmol) was added and the reaction was stirred for 24 h sealed with a rubber septum. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with dilute citric acid (10 ml). The organic layer was collected in a 50 ml beaker, dried over NaSOand then evaporated in a 50 ml recovery flask on a rotary evaporator. The residue, which shared the same Rvalue as racemic BPO-25 (BPO-27 ethyl ester) on TLC, was purified by flash chromatography (EtOAc:hexanes, 2:3) to give a clear residue (20 mg, 35 mmol, yield 79%). The residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml toluene and placed in a 1 dram vial. The vial was placed upright in a jar filled with 3-4 mm of mixed hexanes and then sealed. The setup was placed for 6 d in a quiet, vibration-free room, yielding diffraction-quality crystals, which by x-ray analysis, revealed the compound to be (S)-BPO-27 ethyl ester [(S)-BPO-25].

The crystal to detector distance was 4.96 cm, thus providing a complete sphere of data to 2\u03b8136.52. Crystallographic calculations were performed on an iMac with 2.80 GHz quad core processor and 8 GB of extended memory. A total of 18750 reflections were collected and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects with SAINT and absorption using crystal faces and Blessing's method as incorporated into the program SADABS (Blessings, R.

The SHELXTL program package was implemented to determine the probable space group and set up the initial files. System symmetry, systematic absences, and intensity statistics indicated the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group P222(no. 19). The structure was determined by direct methods with the successful location of a majority of the main molecule using the program XS (Sheldrick, G. M. (1997) SHELXS97 and SHELXL97. Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen: G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). The structure was refined with XL (Sheldrick, G. M. (1997) SHELXS97 and SHELXL97. Universitat G\u00f6ttingen: G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). The data collected were merged for least squares refinement to 4752 unique data [R(int)=0.0925]. A series of least-squares difference-Fourier cycles were required to locate the remaining non-hydrogen atoms and optimize the full occupancy, disordered solvent toluene molecule. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were idealized throughout the final refinement stages. The final structure was refined to convergence with R(F)=9.09%, wR(F2)=22.64%, GOF=1.128 for all 4752 unique reflections [R(F)=8.86, wR(F2)=22.46% for those 4529 data with Fo >4\u03c3(Fo)]. The final difference-Fourier map was featureless indicating that the structure is both correct and complete. An empirical correction for extinction was also attempted and found to be negative and therefore not applied. The absolute structure parameters, Flack(x) (Flack, 1983, A39, 876-881), was refined and found to be \u22120.08(4) while the Hooft (Hooft, R. W. W, Strayer, L. H. & Spek, A. L. . (2008), 41, 96-103) parameter is \u22120.085(18) indicating that the structure's absolute configuration has been reliably determined.

,"The relative ICvalues obtained from the plate reader assay are useful for comparisons. Absolute ICvalues obtained from the plate-reader assay are approximate, generally underestimating compound potency because of assay non-linearities, pH-dependent YFP fluorescence, the use of iodide instead of chloride, and compound dilution at the start of the assay (see, e.g., Galietta et al., 281:C1734-42 (2001)).","Quantitative concentration-inhibition data for the most potent compounds were obtained by analysis of short-circuit current, which represents a definitive electrophysiological measure of compound potency. Current was measured in CFTR-expressing FRT cells in which the basolateral membrane was permeabilized and in the presence of a transepithelial chloride concentration gradient, so that current is a quantitative linear measure of CFTR function. CFTR was activated by forskolin, followed by serial additions of increasing concentrations of test compounds.  illustrates a representative short-circuit current measurement. Increased CFTR chloride conductance was observed following addition the cAMP agonist forskolin. Conductance was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by a PPQ inhibitor, with complete inhibition observed at high inhibitor concentration.","Initial synthesis efforts focused on preventing aromatization, which was initially achieved by derivatizing the secondary amine of PPQ-102 to give analogs PPQ-(1-5). The PPQ-102-derived amides PPQ-(1-3) were found to be substantially less active than PPQ-102. Because the loss of the basic amine coincided with a loss in activity, nitrosamine PPQ-4 was synthesized, but attempts to reduce the nitrosamine to a strongly basic hydrazine only yielded PPQ-102. To maintain basicity and to prevent aromatization, synthesis of the N-methyl analog PPQ-5 was attempted via reductive alkylation using formaldehyde, but these efforts were unsuccessful. However, the N-methyl precursor 5c was obtained in good yield from N-methyl-1,2-phenylenediamine and 4a. Pyrrole 5c was then used to synthesize PPQ-5, which was weakly active.","Re-examination of SAR data obtained from \u02dc350 commercially available analogs (see, e.g., Tradtrantip et al., 2009, supra; Int'l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 2011\/019737) suggested that the 5-position of the furan ring in PPQ-102 was privileged. Therefore, compounds PPQ-(6-15) were synthesized to probe the steric and electronic requirements for activity of the furyl moiety. Substituting bromine at the 5-position of the furyl ring yielded PPQ-10, which was substantially more stable than PPQ-102 and had similar CFTR inhibition potency (see , C). To further probe oxidative aromatization as a metabolic pathway, the secondary amine of PPQ-10 was replaced by oxygen forming an ether bridge, which is unable to undergo oxidation. The resulting benzoxazine BPO-16 had similar CFTR inhibition potency (see ) and better stability than PPQ-102. Synthesis of BPO-(17-18) confirmed CFTR inhibition activity (see Table B) and improved stability (see ) imparted by bromine and illustrated the synergy between the 5-bromofuran moiety and the ether bridge.","Previous SAR data (see, e.g., Tradtrantip et al., 2009, supra) showed that an m-tolyl moiety (R=Me) increased CFTR inhibition potency. However, synthesis of BPO-(19-20) revealed that the m-tolyl moiety reduced CFTR inhibition in the BPO series. To increase the polarity and hence the aqueous solubility of BPO-16, a nitro group was introduced at R. The resulting compound, BPO-21, had substantially greater CFTR inhibition potency (see ) with excellent metabolic stability in hepatic microsomes (see ). BPO-22 and PPQ-23 showed that the increased CFTR inhibition activity conferred by the nitro substituent at Rwas independent of both the 5-bromo substituent and the ether bridge.","To increase compound polarity further, the nitro functionality at Rin BPO-21 was replaced with a carboxyl moiety to provide BPO-27. BPO-27 was the most potent CFTR inhibitor with IC\u02dc8 nM (see ), and had excellent stability in hepatic microsomes with <5% compound loss in 30 min (see ). At physiological pH BPO-27 is deprotonated and thus substantially more polar then PPQ-102 (clogP 1.76 for BPO-27 vs. clogP4.92 for PPQ-102) and with solubility of 17 \u03bcM in a pH 7.4 aqueous phosphate buffer. BPO-27 was synthesized by hydrolysis of the ethyl ester BPO-25, which, interestingly, also had excellent CFTR inhibition activity, and could potentially serve as a pro-drug of BPO-27, to facilitate efficient intestinal absorption and cell accumulation following de-esterification by ubiquitous intracellular esterases.","SAR analysis suggests that the relative stability of BPO-27 compared with PPQ-102 is the consequence of the 5-Br substituted furan and the ether bridge, which largely prevent hydroxylation and aromatization modifications. The greatly improved water solubility of BPO-27 compared with PPQ-102 is a consequence of the carboxylic acid substituent, which is charged at physiological pH. The carboxylic acid addition also, unexpectedly, improved CFTR inhibition potency.","An established embryonic ex vivo kidney organ culture model of PKD was used to test BPO-27 (racemic mixture of R and S forms) efficacy in reducing cAMP agonist-induced renal cystogenesis (see Example 30). Progressive renal cyst formation and growth in 8-Br-cAMP agonist-treated cultures, as seen by transmitted light microscopy, is shown in . Kidney growth without cyst formation was observed in the absence of 8-Br-cAMP. Cyst growth in the 8-Br-cAMP-treated kidney was remarkably reduced by inclusion of BPO-27 in the culture medium. As quantified by percentage area occupied by cysts, BPO-27 inhibited cyst growth with ICof approximately 100 nM (see ), much better than that of >500 nM measured for PPQ-102 (see, e.g., Tradtrantip et al., 2009, supra). Thus, racemic BPO-27 was shown to have prevented and reversed renal cyst formation in an embryonic kidney culture model of PKD.","The racemic mixture of BPO-27 was further separated into its respective isolated enantiomers, namely, (R)-BPO-27 and (S)-BPO-27. See, Example 2A. As shown herein, while the (R)-BPO-27 enantiomer strongly inhibited CFTR chloride conductance with IC-4 nM, the other enantiomer, (S)-BPO-27, was inactive.","CFTR inhibition potency was measured by short-circuit current analysis in FRT epithelial cells expressing human CFTR in presence of a transepithelial chloride gradient and in which the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with amphotericin B. Under these conditions short-circuit current is proportional to CFTR chloride conductance.  shows no significant inhibition by BPO-27 fraction 1 at 100 nM, whereas BPO-27 fraction 2 at 100 nM completed inhibited current.  shows the fraction 2 concentration-dependence, giving an ICof approximately 4 nM, as compared to approximately 8 nM for racemic BPO-27 (Example 31).","The in vitro metabolic stability of (R)-BPO-27 and (S)-BPO-27 was studied using hepatic microsomes. Following compound incubation with hepatic microsomes in the presence of NADPH, remaining non-metabolized compound was assayed by LC\/MS.  shows little metabolism of either BPO-27 isoform. As a control, PPQ-102 was >75% metabolized at 4 h when tested in parallel.","BPO-27 pharmacokinetics in mice was measured following bolus intraperitoneal administration in an aqueous formulation in 5% DMSO, 2.5% Tween-80 and 2.5% PEG400 in water. BPO-27 was measured by LC\/MS in kidney, blood and urine.  (left) shows ion current in calibration studies in which specified amounts of BPO-27 were added to kidney homogenates. The assay was linear with a detection sensitivity of better than 100 nM BPO-27.  (right) shows the disappearance kinetics of BPO-27 from kidney following bolus intraperitoneal administration.  summarizes the deduced BPO-27 concentrations in kidney, blood and urine over time. The tfor disappearance of the original compound was approximately 2 h. Compound concentration remained at predicted therapeutic levels (i.e., at levels much greater than 4 nM, which is the IC) for many hours following single dose administration.","The various embodiments described above can be combined to provide further embodiments.
