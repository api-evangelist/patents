title: System and method for consolidated reporting of characteristics for a group of file systems
abstract: A system and method enables one or more storage volumes and associated devices on one or more storage appliances (filers) to be combined or consolidated into arbitrary groups so that statistical information related to performance, operational status and other usage-based parameters can be made available to interested parties associated with the group. The volumes can drawn from different storage appliances and grouped so as to allow administration and access by a common group of administrators or users. The statistical information can be compared to threshold values to generate events. The events can be e-mailed or otherwise transmitted to interested parties. The statistical information can also be organized and displayed in a variety of formats as a web page on a graphical user interface that resides on a management station and/or client display of an interested party.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to networked storage systems and more particularly to systems for reporting status and other information with respect to volumes within a networked storage system environment.","A network storage appliance is a special-purpose computer that provides file service relating to the organization of information on storage devices, such as disks. The network storage appliance or filer includes an operating system that implements a file system to logically organize the information as a hierarchical structure of directories and files on the disks. Each \u201con-disk\u201d file may be implemented as a set of disk blocks configured to store information, such as text, whereas the directory may be implemented as a specially formatted file in which information about other files and directories are stored. An example of a file system that is configured to operate on a filer is the Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL\u2122) file system available from Network Appliance, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.","A filer may be configured to operate according to a client\/server model of information delivery to thereby allow many clients to access files stored on a server, e.g., the filer. In this model, the client may comprise an application, such as a file system protocol, executing on a computer that \u201cconnects\u201d to the filer over a computer network, such as a point-to-point link or a shared local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Each client may request the services of the filer by issuing file system protocol messages (in the form of packets) to the filer over the network.","A filer is organized so that it includes one or more of storage \u201cvolumes\u201d that comprise a cluster of physical storage disks, defining an overall logical arrangement of storage space. Currently available filer implementations can serve a large number of discrete volumes (for example 150, although this number is subject to increase). Each volume is generally associated with its own file system (WAFL for example). The disks within a volume\/file system are typically organized as one or more groups of Redundant Array of Independent (or Inexpensive) Disks (RAID). RAID implementations enhance the reliability\/integrity of data storage through the redundant writing of data \u201cstripes\u201d across a given number of physical disks in the RAID group, and the appropriate caching of parity information with respect to the striped data. In the example of a WAFL-based file system, a RAID 4 implementation is advantageously employed. This implementation specifically entails the striping of data across a group of disks, and separate parity caching within a selected disk of the RAID group.","A complex distributed storage arrangement typically requires monitoring and administration of various devices (e.g. disks, filers, etc.) by a competent network administrator at regular intervals. Expected maintenance items and unexpected alert conditions may arise, requiring intervention by the administrator. For example, physical disks may run low on storage or even occasionally malfunction, or other significant events may impair function of a particular volume or of the entire network. In such cases, the administrator should be alerted so that he or she may take appropriate action.","Currently available network administration tools enable an operator to retrieve various status and performance information\/reports from individual volumes, or from the entire array of network devices. While such reporting is valuable, it is often limited in usefulness, particularly where a large network of disparate users is present. For example, a large organization such as a bank may have a variety of separate departments, each having its own requirements and characteristics of network use. In order to effectively monitor and administer the various departments it is desirable to divide volumes into separate reporting groups. In addition, it may be desirable to selectively group certain volumes into more than one group where a given volume may cross certain departmental lines. For example upper management may wish to view data from a variety of departments, that are otherwise restricted to individuals in the particular departments. Similarly, certain departments may be subject to system alerts that are particularly critical. For example, the bank's credit card department may be more concerned about low storage than the safe deposit box department due to the relatively greater rate at which credit card transactions are accumulated. Having a low-storage alert tailored to this critical group can expedite action by the administrator.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for selectively grouping discrete volumes of a network storage arrangement into separate groups that may be a subset of the overall network architecture. This system and method should provide customization and versatility with respect to the type of information that are reported for the various groups and should allow alert information to be tailored to the particular group.","This invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a system and method for enabling one or more storage volumes and associated devices on one or more storage appliances (filers) to be combined or consolidated into arbitrary groups so that statistical information related to performance, operational status and other usage-based parameters can be provide to interested parties associate with the group. The volumes can be drawn from different storage appliances, and their statistical information can be grouped\/consolidated so as to allow administration and access by a common group of administrators or users.","According to a preferred embodiment, the grouping of volumes is controlled via a management station that is attached to the network containing the volumes. The management station includes a graphical user interface that allows the groups to be organized and displayed. A monitor process polls the volumes and devices for statistical information and returns it to the management station. There is a database that stores information about users in the group and various threshold values that are associated with the statistical information. The monitor process compares the thresholds to the monitored statistical information and determines whether an event has occurred. If an event has occurred, then the monitor process notifies an event process that determines whether there are listed any interested parties in the event, and, if so, how to notify the parties. In a typical form of notification, the event process can e-mail at least some of the interested parties in the group (e.g. users, administrators, managers) if an event has occurred. Similarly, the notification can take the form of an alarm, alert, telephone call or page to an interested party that is implemented through appropriate automated systems. There is also a command process that generates displays on the statistical information using, preferably a web-based format that is accessed by a browser on the management station's graphical user interface or on an interested party's client display.","According to a preferred embodiment, the graphical user interface can display statistical information in connection with the group in a variety of formats that can be organized based upon the group's volumes, the devices within volumes (e.g. disks), the storage appliances implicated by the group, or with respect to selected events or alerts. The information can include color-coded alert information or status displays that show the relative severity of the problem associated with the event\/alert (e.g. low storage, disk failure and the like).","According to another aspect of the invention statistical information stored on the database resulting from the polling of the monitor process can be bundled in various time periods (e.g. days, weeks, quarters) that each have roughly the same number of intervals, each bundle having a different relative time span between respective intervals. In this manner samples for more recent time periods are maintained in smaller intervals, while samples for older time periods are maintained at successively longer sample intervals. This reduces the concomitant burden on the database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","104","106","107","108","109"]},"In addition exemplary filers  and  (Filer and Filer, respectively) are connected two the LAN. These filers, (described further below) are network storage appliances configured to control storage of, and access to, data in a set of interconnected storage volumes  and , respectively. The volumes , , respectively, are numbered 0-N. As described further below, each volume is typically organized to include one or more RAID groups of physical storage disks for increased data storage integrity and reliability. Each filer ,  can also include a dedicated storage cache\/disk , , respectively for filer applications and data handling functions. Each of the devices attached to LAN include an appropriate, conventional network interface arrangement (not shown) for communicating over the LAN using desired communication protocols, such as the well-known Transport Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Small Network Management Protocol (SNMP).","Also connected to the LAN  is a management station  according to a preferred embodiment of this invention. The management station  can include a server or PC-based computer with a network interface for communicating over the LAN. Within the management station  resides the management software , the function of which is described further below. In general, the software  enables an administrator or other operator to access usage and performance information with regard to various LAN-connected devices, including the filers  and  and associated volumes , . The management station utilizes an SNMP communication process to obtain and manipulate this information. This protocol is designed to enable networks to be remotely managed from a centralized management station. In particular it comprises a packet-based protocol using messaging to communicate with networked devices and clients. The messages are provided as management information blocks (MIBs). The MIBs and SNMP protocol, and their use in providing network management information between SNMP management stations and agents are well-known and described in SNMP, SNMPv2 and RMON by William Stallings, printed by Addison Wesley Publishing Company, 1996. The information is displayed and manipulated using a graphical user interface (GUI)  that can include a display , keyboard  and mouse  (or other GUI-compatible device, such as a touch-screen). In addition a storage disk  or other memory device is interconnected with the management station computer . This storage  holds database information on various devices and their associated statistics as well as other data related to management station operations and functions. The configuration of the storage can be based upon RAID or another architecture.","Before describing the structure and functions of the management station in further detail, the exemplary filer architecture is now described in further detail.  is a more-detailed schematic block diagram of the exemplary network storage appliance  (Filer) that is advantageously used with the present invention. Other filers can have similar construction (including exemplary Filer ). By way of background, a network storage appliance or filer is a special-purpose computer that provides file service relating to the organization of information on storage devices, such as disks. However, it will be understood to those skilled in the art that the inventive concepts described herein may apply to any type of special-purpose (e.g., server) or general-purpose computer, including a standalone computer. The filer  comprises a processor , a memory , a network adapter  and a storage adapter  interconnected by a system bus . The filer  also includes an operating system  that implements a file system to logically organize the information as a hierarchical structure of directories and files on the disks.","In the illustrative embodiment, the memory  may have storage locations that are addressable by the processor and adapters for storing software program code and data structures associated with the present invention. The processor and adapters may, in turn, comprise processing elements and\/or logic circuitry configured to execute the software code and manipulate the data structures. The operating system , portions of which are typically resident in memory and executed by the processing elements, functionally organizes the filer  by, inter alia, invoking storage operations in support of a file service implemented by the filer. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other processing and memory means, including various computer readable media, may be used for storing and executing program instructions pertaining to the inventive technique described herein.","The network adapter  comprises the mechanical, electrical and signaling circuitry needed to connect the filer  to a client  (including management station ) (see ) over the computer network (LAN ), which, as described generally above, can comprise a point-to-point connection or a shared medium, such as a local area network. A client (, ) can be a general-purpose computer configured to execute applications including file system protocols, such as the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. Moreover, the client can interact with the filer  in accordance with a client\/server model of information delivery. That is, the client may request the services of the filer, and the filer may return the results of the services requested by the client, by exchanging packets that encapsulate, e.g., the CIFS protocol format over the network . The format of the CIFS protocol packet exchanged over the network is well-known and described in () -0.9, Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), Draft SNIA CIFS Documentation Work Group Work-in-Progress, Revision Date: Mar. 26, 2001 (hereinafter \u201cCIFS specification\u201d), which is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein.","The storage adapter  cooperates with the operating system  executing on the filer to access information requested by the client, which information may be stored on a number of storage volumes  each constructed from an array of physical disks that are organized as RAID groups , ,  and . The RAID groups include independent physical disks including those storing striped data (D) and those storing separate parity (P) for the data, in accordance with a preferred RAID 4 configuration. However, other configurations (e.g. RAID 5) are also contemplated.","The storage adapter  includes input\/output (I\/O) interface circuitry that couples to the disks over an I\/O interconnect arrangement, such as a conventional high-performance, Fibre Channel serial link topology. The information is retrieved by the storage adapter  and, if necessary, processed by the processor  (or the adapter  itself) prior to being forwarded over the system bus  to the network adapter , where the information is formatted into a packet and returned to the client .","To facilitate access to the disks , the operating system  implements a file system that logically organizes the information as a hierarchical structure of directories and files on the disks. Each \u201con-disk\u201d file may be implemented as set of disk blocks configured to store information, such as text, whereas the directory may be implemented as a specially formatted file in which other files and directories are stored. In the illustrative embodiment described herein, the operating system  associated with each volume is preferably the NetApp\u00ae Data ONTAP\u2122 operating system available from Network Appliance, Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif. that implements a Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL) file system. The preferred operating system for the exemplary filer is now described briefly. However, it is expressly contemplated that the principles of this invention can be implemented using a variety of alternate operating system architectures.","As shown in , the operating system  comprises a series of software layers, including a media access layer  of network drivers (e.g., an Ethernet driver). The operating system  further includes network protocol layers, such as the IP layer  and its TCP layer , and UDP layer . A file system protocol layer  provides multi-protocol data access and, to that end, includes support for the CIFS protocol, the Network File System (NFS) protocol  and the HTTP protocol . In addition, the operating system  includes a disk storage layer  that implements a disk storage protocol, such as a RAID protocol, and a disk driver layer  that implements a disk access protocol such as, e.g., a Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) protocol. Bridging the disk software layers with the network and file system protocol layers is a WAFL file system layer  of the operating system. Generally, the WAFL layer implements the WAFL file system having an on-disk format representation that is block-based using, e.g., 4-kilobyte (KB) data blocks and using inodes to describe the files. The WAFL file system generates operations to load (retrieve) the requested data from volumes  if it is not resident \u201cin-core\u201d, i.e., in the filer's memory . If the information is not in memory, the WAFL layer  indexes into the inode file using the inode number to access an appropriate entry and retrieve a logical volume block number. The WAFL layer then passes the logical volume block number to the disk storage (RAID) layer , which maps that logical number to a disk block number and sends the latter to an appropriate driver (e.g., SCSI) of the disk driver layer . The disk driver accesses the disk block number from volumes  and loads the requested data in memory  for processing by the filer . Upon completion of the request, the filer (and operating system) returns a reply, e.g., a conventional acknowledgement packet defined by the CIFS specification, to the client ,  over the network . It should be noted that the software \u201cpath\u201d  through the operating system layers described above needed to perform data storage access for the client request received at the filer may alternatively be implemented in hardware.","According to one aspect of the invention, the separate volumes  can be grouped according to predetermined criteria to create reporting groups that are used advantageously. Reference is made to , which show, respectively, a procedure  for grouping volumes and an associated graphical representation  of an exemplary grouping. The procedure can be implemented by an administrator using the management station  and the graphical representation may be generally symbolic of the information appearing of the station's graphical user interface .","The procedure begins with the location of filers resident on the network and associated volumes within the filers as detailed in step . In this example Filer and Filer are located and displayed in association with all respective volumes (Vol, Vol, Vol, etc.) as denoted by the display window . Volumes can be located manually be specifying the appropriate address (if such address is known), or the volumes can be located automatically by the management software using a discovery process having appropriate polling capabilities. This discovery process is part of an overall monitor process within the management station that is described further below. In general, the discovery process uses SNMP to communicate with the filers and extract desired volume information.","In accordance with step , the management software then generates a unique identifier for each volume in each filer. The identifiers are shown as discrete numbers 1-5. For example, Filer, Vol is assigned identifier ; Filer, Vol is assigned identifier , and so forth.","In accordance with step , the administrator can establish a group which in this example is identified as \u201cENG. HOME\u201d (Group 6) in this example. See selection block . This group can be one of a large number of groups. Each group can be defined by a set of like users\/members (e.g. a department) or by certain administrative criteria (those users having high-volume storage usage or users served by a particular administrator). In general, the creation of groups and other user-directed functions implicates a command process that interacts with the management software and stores input commands and data on a database, both of which are described further below.","In accordance with step , one or more volumes related to the group (i.e. those containing data related to the group) are then selected for inclusion in the group. In the example of , the volumes identified by numbers 1, 3 and 4 are selected by flagging the selected group members using the GUI as denoted by cursor marks . The resulting selection is depicted in the graphical window . Each of the members ,  and  are associated with Group 6 \u201cENG. HOME.\u201d","Finally, in accordance with step , any group-related reporting parameters and event parameters are assigned to the group using the GUI (window ). In other words, various threshold values for reporting \u201cevents\u201d or \u201calerts\u201d in connection with one of the group volumes or underlying devices (disks) are associated with the group. Such event parameters (described further below) can include, but are not limited to, exceeded thresholds for device or filer central processing unit (CPU) utilization, device environmental conditions (temperature, etc.), volume free space, disk free space and NFS operations per second. In addition, the general operational state (on\/off, broken\/working) is reported. As described below, these parameters are generally monitored by the management software's monitor process based upon SNMP polls passed over the LAN. The reporting\/polling period for various event parameters may vary based upon criticality of the parameters to normal operation and other criteria. In general, statistical information on devices within desired thresholds is also maintained for each group, and is accessed via the GUI by the management station operator\/administrator.","In addition, the administrator in step  can establish the interested parties (other than the management station operator\/administrator) to which selected information is to be reported (e.g. reporting parameters). This reporting takes the form of electronic mail (e-mail) delivered to e-mail in-boxes of the interested parties alerts using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) (see window ). These interested parties can include local group administrators and particular users (for example, an identified, specific user in a group who is exceeding allotted storage maximums). The reporting process is described further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["600","140","700","600","602","604"]},"In accordance with decision step , the monitor process  determines whether an event has been detected requiring reporting to occur. The monitor can be supplied with the appropriate threshold values, either stored by the administrator or preset in the database . The monitor performs a comparison of received statistical information to threshold information contained in the database. According to one embodiment, the database  is a relational-type database commercially available from Sybase of Emeryville, Calif. However, any acceptable data-storage arrangement can be employed. In this embodiment, the database  can be organized and accessed using Structured Query Language (SQL) and the Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) standard. If an event occurs, such as an out-of-threshold parameter, the decision step branches to step  in which the monitor process transmits the details of the event to the event process  using an appropriate messaging protocol such as HTTP.","The event process  then queries the database , in accordance with step  to determine if any interested parties\/group members are implicated by the event with respect to the particular volume or device. Note that a given volume may implicate multiple groups. If the database  contains entries relating to the volume, this data is returned to the event process . These entries can include web links for related information (described below) and e-mail addresses for the interested parties.","In accordance with step , the event process  uses appropriate APIs  to generate e-mail messages to each interested party retrieved from the database with respect to the implicated group or groups. The e-mails can be transmitted using the SMTP protocol, and show up as e-mailed alerts on the events in the interested parties' inboxes . In this manner, specific administrators and others are immediately informed of any critical information involving volumes directed related to their group or themselves. The management station can include an appropriate e-mail server application, interacting with the event process, to facilitate the e-mail function. Alternatively, the notification of an event can take the form of an alarm, alert, telephone call, page or other messaging mechanism to an interested party that is implemented through appropriate automated systems.","In accordance with step , the database  is also queried by a command process . This process uses a common gateway interface (CGI) to generate web-based reports on particular volumes. The CGI is used as an interface between the command process  and its associated command tools and a web server . The volume information is accessed via the web server , which provides web content (including web pages ) through a web browser application  resident on the computer console of the administrator (via GUI ), and\/or on the client displays of other interested parties. The content can be displayed in any acceptable and useful form including graphs as described further below. Note that the decision step, in absence of a particular event or alert, branches to step , in which updated statistics on volumes can be obtained at any time by group members and the administrator via web pages.","It is contemplated that various access control limitations may be placed on members of a group when appropriate. The administrator can set certain access control limitations through the database or web server. A governing access control list (ACL) can reside on the database  (or elsewhere) for this purpose. Permitted individuals can access the information, including specific event information in accordance with step .","As part of the event notification\/reporting process, e-mails to interested parties can include conventional web links  to the web pages on volume statistics or to outside web-links accessed via, for example, the Internet. These links can be routed through the web server  and\/or through another network switching appliance connected to the LAN (e.g. router ). By accessing the links, interested parties can bring up the relevant statistical data on the affected volume or another utility, such as an application (e.g. a repair program) that is designed to diagnose or address the problem that triggered the alert\/event.","The graphical user interface (GUI) displayed to the administrator and interested parties is shown in further detail in . It is expressly contemplated that a variety of formats and organizational schemes for displaying and manipulating data can be employed. The version described herein is only one possible arrangement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806","807","802"]},"A particular report within the GUI is selected using the respective tab in the menu . In this example, the Summary  tab is selected by cursor . The depicted summary  window lists all volume statistics  associated with the group, including, for example, events, volumes, appliances and operating system (OS) versions present within the group. A separate status box  is provided this can include specific alert\/event information related to particular volumes or devices. The box can be color coded to show the significance of the status alert or event. For example, a green box may indicate all clear, while a yellow box may denote potential problems and a red box may denote immediate trouble. Additional, or different colors or patterns, may also be employed in the status box and elsewhere. A link box or tab  may also be provided that can direct the operator\/viewer to further reports, help sites or repair applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","812","902","808","900","904","906","908","910","914"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","812","1002","1004","1006","1008","1010","1012","1020","1022"]},"Note that a variety of additional pull-down menus for displaying data according to various formats can also be provided. The depicted windows are only by way of example and further, or differing, display formats can be provided including lists with rows and columns for various reporting parameters, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","812","1101","1102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","812","1202","1204","1206","1208","1210","1212","1214","1216","1220"]},"The GUI can include further utilities such as a group edit window that enables an operator to add or delete volumes and\/or interested parties from a group, and to change relevant addresses, links and thresholds.","Performance data, events and other monitor process information in connection with the management station is stored for long time periods (e.g. indefinitely) on the database . With continual additions to the data, there is a risk of significantly overfilling the database with voluminous and unnecessary data points. While it is desirable to retain samples over a long period of time (months or years) it is recognized that individual data points typically become less significant, the longer the time interval. Accordingly,  depict respectively, a procedure  and associated scheme  for reducing storage requirements for network and group monitor process even where data is stored over a long time period.","According to the storage procedure and associated scheme, the data is divided into time-based bundles. In this example, the bundles represent a daily bundle , a weekly bundle , a quarterly bundle  and a yearly bundle . The exact characteristics of bundles can vary depending upon the desired reporting requirements (i.e. two-months, half-year, etc.). In one example, each bundle includes roughly one hundred data points, although this number can vary significantly from bundle-to-bundle in an alternate embodiment. The intervals are chosen to facilitate this approximate number. Hence the daily bundle has fifteen-minute intervals, the weekly has two-hour intervals, the quarterly has daily data points and the yearly has two to four-day intervals.","Referring to the procedure , the statistical data is collected at a given rate in accordance with step . This sample rate may be every minute, every second or every hour depending upon the characteristics and relative importance of the data. For example, fast-changing data like CPU usage may be collected more frequently than temperature data. When a given bundle's storage interval for any of the bundles has arrived (decision step ), then the sample data is condensed into an actual storage sample in accordance with step . The process for condensing a stream of samples into one storage sample, representing the data point for the bundle's interval (fifteen minutes, two hours, one day, etc.), can be accomplished using a variety of techniques. For example, the samples for a given interval can be averaged (according to various statistical algorithms including straight averaging). In a more basic case, a first, last or middle sample from the overall group of samples is used to mark the particular interval.","In order to economize on space, the second part of the procedure determines (decision step ) whether enough time has elapsed (for example, more than  intervals) to remove older bundle data for each particular bundle. The location the data base for the given bundle freed for restorage, and certain data may be archived if appropriate (steps  and ). Archiving is optional and performed periodically on certain specified data.","It should be clear that this scheme causes samples for more recent time periods to be maintained in smaller intervals, while samples for older time periods are maintained at successively longer sample intervals. This reduces the concomitant burden on the database and associated disk storage, while ensuring that statistical data is available for more-recent events\u2014where it may be scrutinized more-closely.","The foregoing has been a detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention. Various modifications and additions can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. For example, the management station network location and functional architecture can vary. Additional network devices and storage appliances can be provided. Similarly, it is expressly contemplated that the network may include only a single storage appliance and that volume information is consolidated into groups from volumes on that particular appliance. Other storage architectures, such as storage area networks can also be employed. Also, the GUI can include other utilities and windows beyond those shown and described herein. Furthermore, it is expressly contemplated that the processes and architecture shown described according to this invention can be implemented as software, consisting of a computer readable medium including program instructions executing on a computer; as hardware or firmware implemented using state machines and the like; or as a combination of hardware, software and firmware.
