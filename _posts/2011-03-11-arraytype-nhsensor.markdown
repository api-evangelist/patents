{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The inventions were made with government support under Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-000R22725 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in inventions.","This disclosure relates generally to chemical sensors and more particularly to an array-type sensor for sensing ammonia (NH).","\u201cArray-type\u201d sensors, comprising a plurality of individual sensing elements, each element having limited selectivity for a particular chemical species, can be used in selective detection. For example, array-type sensors made from carbon black\/polymer composites elements, each element sensitive to many different volatile organic compounds, may selectively detect nerve agent stimulants. As another example, arrays made from resistive metal oxide sensing elements, each element sensitive to many different hydrocarbons, may selectively detect forane.","Array-type sensors may also be useful in emission control of combustion exhausts by sensing and\/or characterizing the chemistry of the combustion exhaust. Combustion exhausts are complex mixtures, containing several reducing and oxidizing species, including CO, NO, and hydrocarbons (CH) along with varying amounts of O, HO, and CO. While CO and CHcan be readily ameliorated by oxidation, NOis more difficult to remove from exhausts, especially in an O-containing environment. One technique that is used to reduce the amount of NOemitted from the exhaust is selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which uses ammonia (NH) as a reagent. Under appropriate conditions, NHreacts with NOto produce nitrogen (N) and water (HO). However, escape (or \u201cslip\u201d) of NHfrom a SCR system may be harmful, so monitoring for NHis desirable.","Resistive metal oxide arrays may selectively detect NH. However, resistive metal oxide sensing elements may be sensitive to varying [O] and [HO] because the transduction mechanism in these sensing elements (change in DC electrical resistivity) relies upon changes in the surface concentration of adsorbed species such as O. Because combustion exhausts often have varying [O] and [HO], resistive oxide sensing elements may not be optimal for use with combustion exhausts. Resistive oxide sensing elements may lose their effectiveness above about 500\u00b0 C.","An array-type sensor senses NH. The sensor array may use non-Nernstian sensing elements constructed from metal and\/or metal-oxide electrodes on an Oion conducting substrate, such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). These non-Nernstian sensing elements, which individually may comprise a pair of electrodes, may produce measurable DC voltages (usually about 10-100 mV) for example, in the presence of small, yet non-equilibrium, amounts (usually about 10-1000 ppm) of reducing (e.g., CO) and\/or oxidizing (e.g., NO) species. In one embodiment, the sensing elements comprise a plurality of electrodes comprising five materials: platinum (Pt), manganese (III) oxide (MnO), tungsten trioxide (WO), LaSrCoFeO, and LaCrMgO. The array-type sensor in this embodiment operates at temperatures within two temperature ranges. A first temperature range is from approximately 550-degrees Celsius to approximately 650-degrees Celsius. A second temperature range is from approximately 650-degrees Celsius to approximately 750-degrees Celsius. In this example embodiment of the array-type sensor, a first set of electrodes are configured to operate at a temperature in the first temperature range, and a second set of electrodes are configured to operate at a temperature in the second temperature range.","The materials and operating temperatures were determined based on exposing various sensing elements (electrode pairs) to mixtures of gases containing NH, CO, CH, and NOat concentrations between about 10 and 300 ppm, and Oat a concentration of 7 vol %, the balance of the mixture being N. The materials used in the electrode pairs included Pt, MnO, WO, LaSrCoFeO, LaCrMgO, CoCrO, COO, FeO, (Cu(Ba))CrO, and ZnO. When reducing species (e.g., NH) or oxidizing species (e.g., NO) were presented to the electrode pairs (e.g., Pt\u2014WO), typically a DC voltage that varied as ln([Re or Ox]\/[O]), where Re and Ox stand for reducing (e.g., CO) or oxidizing (e.g., NO) species respectively, was observed. However, the magnitude of the voltage was different depending on the identity of the materials making up the pair, and the operating temperature. There were also cases where the logarithmic dependence was not observed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIGS. 5-7","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIGS. 5-7"],"sub":["3","3","6","2","2","3 ","3 ","0.6","0.4","0.2","0.8","3","0.95","0.05","3 ","3"]},"After the voltages were measured for all of the electrode pairs, the measured voltages as a function of the gas concentration were subjected to a kernel or ridge regression analysis, which determined the electrode pairs yielding the most utility for sensing NH. This procedure identified the most orthogonal electrode pairs, those whose response to NHdiffered the most from the other gases. Three electrode pairs yielded the greatest orthogonality: Pt and MnOat approximately 600-degrees Celsius; Pt and WOat approximately 700-degrees Celsius; and LaSrCoFeO, and LaCrMgOat approximately 700-degrees Celsius. Based on this work, materials and operating temperatures of electrode pairs suitable for incorporation into an array-type sensor for detecting NHis determined.

For example, for a given amount of NH, the voltage generated between the first electrode  and the second electrode  is different from the voltage generated between the second electrode  and the third electrode , which is different from voltage generated between the third electrode  and the fourth electrode , and so on. Based on the different voltage responses between the electrodes, a pattern of response voltages that signals the presence of NHmay be determined. The pattern of voltage responses may be determined based on the electrodes - being exposed to NHin isolation. In addition or alternatively, the pattern of response voltages may be based on the electrodes - being exposed to NHin combination with other gases, including interferents and\/or other gases the may be present in the environment surrounding the sensor, such as O. For example, in diesel combustion exhaust, interferents CO, CH, and NO, in addition to oxygen O, may be present with NH. The pattern of voltage responses may be determined based on NHin combination with Oand\/or one or more of the interferents CO, CH, and NO. Alternatively or in addition, the pattern may be determined by the electrodes being exposed to one or more of the gases in isolation, and\/or varying Owhile holding NHand the interferents at constant levels, and\/or varying NHwhile holding Oand the interferents at constant levels. When the sensor  is in operation and the electrodes - are exposed to NH, voltages generated by the electrodes - are measured, and the measured voltages are compared with the pattern of voltage responses. Based on the comparison, an amount of NHin the environment surrounding the sensor  at a given time, and\/or a rate of change in the amount of NHin the environment over a period of time may be determined.","The length of the sensor  may be between approximately three centimeters and six centimeters. The width of the sensor  may be between approximately 0.5 centimeters and 2.5 centimeters. However, the length and width of the sensor  may be of any dimensions suitable to accommodate the array of electrodes -. The layers of the sensor may be combined using any known manufacturing method, such as by heating the layers at high temperatures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100","200","202","202","202","206","208","209","210","212","214","200","246","248","250","252","254","209","209","206","208","210","212","214"],"sub":["3","2","3","3","0.6","0.4","0.2","0.8","3","0.95","0.05","3"],"i":["f","f","f","f","f "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","100","300","300","306","312","346","346","354","306","312","308","310","314","304","302","320","304","302","320","302","320"],"sub":"3","i":["a ","d","a "]},"Although the sensors , ,  illustrated in , , and  show five or six electrodes, the array-type sensor of the present disclosure is not limited to five or six electrodes.
