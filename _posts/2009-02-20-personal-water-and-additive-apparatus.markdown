No. 10\/875,020, filed on Jun. 23, 2004, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/483,465, filed on Jun. 30, 2003. Application Ser. No. 10\/875,020 and application Ser. No. 60\/483,465 are hereby incorporated by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.","The invention relates in general to personal hydration devices and in particular to personal hydration devices that provide for the addition of substances into the personal water supply of an individual.","Water is essential for good health. Individuals undergoing physical exertion, in particular soldiers, athletes and the physically active members of the public, have increased water consumption needs and thus often require a personal hydration device to maintain the necessary level of hydration. In addition, it can be advantageous to introduce other substances into the drinking water for purposes such as taste enhancement, electrolyte or essential salt replacement, nutritional support, etc.","There may be several obstacles to sustaining hydration, electrolyte balance and energy status. For example, chlorinated or iodinated water commonly does not taste good thereby inhibiting water consumption. Attempting to improve electrolyte balance by simply adding sodium to chlorinated water, without flavoring, brings out the unpleasant taste of chlorine. The taste of water can be improved by adding flavorings, but flavorings almost instantly destroy residual chlorine and compromise resistance to contamination. The food intake of soldiers and other physically active people in the field is often inadequate. For example, soldiers in the field typically consume an inadequate amount of carbohydrate. However, simply adding carbohydrate to water increases the risk of mold and bacterial growth inside a personal bladder-type water reservoir. The bacterial contamination of water can cause diarrhea.","Some known devices for personal hydration with additives require a separate drink container, for example, a canteen cup, to mix the drink ingredients. In other devices, the additive is added directly to the water reservoir, thereby contaminating the water reservoir and\/or compromising water resistance to contamination.","In the present invention, a separate drink container is not required for mixing the additive with the water. In addition, the user is not required to physically add water to the additive or vice versa before consumption. Furthermore, the present invention does not contaminate the water reservoir or compromise water resistance to contamination.","Typical personal bladder-type hydration systems comprise a water reservoir with a tube leading to a bite valve. The present invention improves on prior systems by allowing additives to be mixed with water just prior to being drawn through the bite valve into the user's mouth. Also, a check valve prevents contamination of the water in the reservoir. Thus, the invention provides additives to water in a manner that does not contaminate the water reservoir or compromise water resistance to contamination.","The invention enables the user to consume the nutrients or additives necessary for the chosen activity. The additives may include flavoring, macronutrients (i.e., carbohydrate, protein, fat), micronutrients (e.g., electrolytes, minerals, vitamins), aspirates, oral medications or other dietary supplements. In addition, the primary fluid may be something other than water, for example, a beverage.","Further objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the following drawing.","An important purpose of the invention is to introduce an additive into a personal water supply in such a way as to prevent contamination of the water reservoir by the additive. The invention enables the user to consume the additives necessary for their chosen activity while maintaining a reservoir supply of uncontaminated water. The composition of the additives is highly versatile and may include those specific to exercise such as electrolytes, flavoring, carbohydrates, vitamins, etc. Additionally, the device may be used to administer oral medications or dietary supplements. The additives may be in solid form, for example, granules or tablets, or in liquid or gel form.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","20"]},"Referring now to , apparatus  includes a first container  connected to a manifold  by a first tube . Container  is capable of holding liquid and includes a fill opening  and an outlet . Preferably, container  is of the collapsible bladder type. Container  is filled with water . Second container  is connected to manifold  by a second tube . Container  is capable of holding liquid and preferably is a collapsible bladder type container. Container  is filled with additive  that will be mixed with water  from container . Second container  has a volume smaller than the first container , preferably less than half the volume of the first container .","As shown in detail in , manifold  includes a water passageway  and an additive passageway . The water passageway  and additive passageway  intersect to form a single mixing passageway . In some embodiments, the water passageway  has a larger diameter than the additive passageway . In the embodiment of , however, the relative sizes of the diameters of the water passageway  and additive passageway  are not critical because flow regulator ,  controls the flow rate in passageways ,  respectively and thereby create the desired proportions of water  and additive . The first tube  connects the first container  to the water passageway  of the manifold and the second tube  connects the second container  to the additive passageway . The combination of the first tube  and water passageway  define a water channel and the combination of the second tube  and the additive passageway  define an additive channel. An outlet tube  has one end connected to the mixing passageway  of the manifold. The other end of outlet tube  may optionally be connected to a bite valve .","A check valve  is disposed in the water channel, preferably adjacent the manifold . Check valve  prevents reflux of water and\/or water and additive mixture into the first tube  and the water  in container . Similarly, a check valve  is disposed in the additive channel, preferably adjacent the manifold , to prevent reflux into the additive container .","An adjustable flow regulator ,  controls flow in the water passageway  and the additive passageway . In the embodiment of , adjustable flow regulator ,  comprises a pair of independently operated threaded valves that can be rotated to fully open (full flow) or completely block (no flow) the water and additive passageways , . In addition, the adjustable flow regulator ,  is infinitely adjustable between full flow and no flow. Another embodiment of a flow regulator (not shown) comprises a single spool valve or similar type valve to control flow through the two passageways , . In this embodiment, pushing in the valve would open the water passageway only, a further push would open both the water and additive passageways.","Additive  in container  may be a liquid, solid or gel. An exemplary, but not exhaustive, list of additives includes a beverage, a beverage concentrate, electrolytes, flavorings, carbohydrates, vitamins, aspirates, medications and dietary supplements. In the embodiment shown in , the additive container  is attached to the first tube  by a hook connector  extending from the base of container . Additive container  may be located further from manifold  by extending the tube .","It is contemplated that additive container  will not be reused. That is, a plurality of additive containers  containing different additives are available and can be connected to and disconnected from the apparatus , depending on the additive that is needed. When the additive  is depleted, or it is desired to use another additive, the additive container  is detached and another additive container is attached. In one embodiment, the tube  is removably connected to the additive container . Such removable connections are known in the art and include, for example, barb connections, screw on connections (e.g., Leur lock, threaded) or connectors that use push-on type connections. In another embodiment, the tube  is permanently connected to additive container  and removably connected to manifold . With the exception of water  and additive , all the components of apparatus  may be made of known plastic materials.","To use apparatus , an individual sucks on the optional bite valve  to draw water  and additive  into mixing passageway  and outlet tube . In the embodiment of , flow through either the water passageway  or additive passageway  is controlled by adjustable flow regulator , . When both passageways ,  are open, the act of sucking on the bite valve  simultaneously draws fluid from both containers , . Assuming additive  is a flavoring, then a flavored drink is automatically produced when the additive  and water  mix in the mixing passageway  of the manifold . The resulting drink mix travels through the outlet tube  and the bite valve . The concentration of additive  in the drink mix may be altered by adjusting flow regulator , .","The connectors used to fix tubes ,  to manifold  are shown in the Figs. as barb connectors, however, other connectors may be used, such as connectors that screw on (e.g., Luer lock, threaded) or connectors that use push-on type connections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-6","FIG. 4"],"b":["50","20","40","52","50","52","52","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":["60","20","38","32","30","40","24","70","50","38","70","52","52","70"]},"In the embodiment of , the ratio of additive  to water  is dictated by the volumetric flow rate through each passageway , . The flow rates are dependent upon the fluid viscosity of the water  and additive  and the fluidic resistance of passageways , ; tubes , ; check valves , ; and restrictive orifice . Because the flow rates in manifold  are fixed for a given additive , manifold  has the advantage of maintaining a fixed concentration of additive to water for a given assembly. On the other hand, it is contemplated that the user may desire to change from a low viscosity additive (such as an electrolyte) to a higher viscosity additive (such as a carbohydrate) and mix the new additive with water at a different ratio. In such a case, a different size restrictive orifice may be used in combination with the new additive to create the fluidic resistance necessary to obtain the desired concentration of the new additive to water.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Throughout the Figures, reference numerals that are the same refer to the same features.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
