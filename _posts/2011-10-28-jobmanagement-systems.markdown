{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to job-management systems. In particular, job-management systems for adding employment seeking features to a computer application are described.","Known systems for organizing one's job search are not entirely satisfactory for the range of applications in which they are employed. Existing job-management systems often fail to intuitively manage a user's job search, as they often lack automatic storage of job-related data and require a user to manage job data in a stand-alone application.","Many job-management systems operate as stand-alone applications. Because users often conduct the bulk of their job-seeking within web browser windows, e-mail clients, or other applications of general utility, they often neglect to use the stand-alone system. As these applications are often at the center of a user's daily activities, using them to perform job-seeking tasks is often more convenient than opening a separate, standalone job-management system.","Additionally, users accomplish a large share of employment tasks in a web or e-mail context. As a result, stand-alone job-management systems may be unnecessary and inconvenient. Because users often neglect to use stand-alone job-management systems, they often fail to properly track job-search related tasks. As a result, users often manage their job search poorly.","Additionally or alternatively, stand-alone applications often fail to adequately remind users of upcoming related tasks and recommend open positions. Because job-seeking is often conducted through web and e-mail contexts, reminders and recommendations conveyed through a standalone program may go unnoticed. Missing these reminders and recommendations may result in inadvertent forfeiture of a desired employment position.","Thus, there exists a need for job-management systems that improve upon and advance the design of known job-management systems. Specifically, there exists a need for job-management systems that; directly interface with the other computer applications commonly used for job seeking purposes, such as web browsers and e-mail clients. Providing job-seeking features in this context would improve the user's job-management, and would assist in the user in ultimately receiving a job. Examples of new and useful job-management systems relevant to the needs existing in the field are discussed below.","Computer implemented job-management systems for adding employment seeking features to computer applications showing job data and receiving input. Systems may include a data storage system, instruction data including computer readable instructions, and a processor configured to execute the instruction data. In some examples, the instruction data may include an interface component for interfacing with from the computer application to capture input and job data and displaying a user interface. In some examples, the instruction data may include a storage component for storing the input and job data to the data storage system. Some examples may include a retrieval component for retrieving saved data from the data storage system and an interface component including computer executable instructions for entering the retrieved saved data into the form. In some examples the computer application may be configured to receive communication input and to send the communication input to an employer contact.","The disclosed job-management systems will become better understood through review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the figures. The detailed description and figures provide merely examples of the various inventions described herein. Those skilled in the art will understand that the disclosed examples may be varied, modified, and altered without departing from the scope of the inventions described herein. Many variations are contemplated for different applications and design considerations; however, for the sake of brevity, each and every contemplated variation is not individually described in the following detailed description.","Throughout the following detailed description, examples of various job-management systems are provided. Related features in the examples may be identical, similar, or dissimilar in different examples. For the sake of brevity, related features will not be redundantly explained in each example. Instead, the use of related feature names will cue the reader that the feature with a related feature name may be similar to the related feature in an example explained previously. Features specific to a given example will be described in that particular example. The reader should understand that a given feature need not be the same or similar to the specific portrayal of a related feature in any given figure or example.","With reference to , a first example of a computer implemented job-management system, system , will now be described. As  shows, system  includes a processor , system memory , local storage , an input controller , an output controller , and a network controller . Processor , system memory , local storage , input controller , output controller , and network controller  may collectively be referred to as a computing device . Computing device  may be incorporated within a variety of consumer electronic devices, such as personal media players, cellular phones, smart phones, personal data assistants, global positioning system devices, and the like.","Processor  may be any type of processing device for executing software instructions, but will conventionally be a microprocessor device. System memory  may include both read-only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, both read-only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM) may store software instructions to be executed by processor . Processor  additionally allows executed instruction data to communicate with other devices directly and indirectly connected to processor . Processor  may, for example, allow instruction data to read and write from local storage  and allow a user to control executed applications via input controller .","Processor  and system memory  are connected, either directly or indirectly, through a bus or alternate communication structure to one or more peripheral devices. These devices include, but are not limited to, local storage , input controller , output controller , network controller .","Local storage  includes any locally-connected devices in which processor  may store and retrieve computer data without accessing a computer network. Local storage  may include, for example, a hard disk drive, a removable optical disk drive, a removable magnetic disk drive, or a flash memory card.","Input controller  is configured to communicate instructions from various input devices, which may include, but are not limited to, a keyboard , a mouse , and a touchscreen . Processor  may use received instructions to control executed instruction data. Output controller  may include, for example, a monitor , an integrated display, television, printer, stereo, or speakers. Processor  and output controller  allow executed instruction data to render output to devices connected via output controller .","As  illustrates, processor  is connected to network controller  to communicate with a computer network . As  shows, computer network  includes connection to computer network , which is the internet in this example. Network controller  is configured to communicate with any local- or wide-area networks, however. Network controller  may communicate via wired connections, wireless connections, or any combination thereof.","Network controller  may also communicate using one or more communication protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the Internet Protocol (IP), and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). These protocols are well known in the art, and thus will not be discussed here in more detail. Network controller , for the purposes of this disclosure, is not limited to a single attached device; network controller  may, for example, include separate wired and wireless network interfaces through which processor  may simultaneously or separately communicate with computer network .","It should be appreciated that, in addition to the input, output and storage peripheral devices specifically listed above, the computing device may be connected to a variety of other peripheral devices, including those that perform input, output and storage functions, or some combination thereof. For example, the computing device  may be connected to a digital music player, such as an IPOD\u00ae brand digital music player or IPHONE or Droid brand smartphone available from Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. As known in the art, this type of digital music player can serve as both an output device for a computer (e.g., outputting music from a sound file or pictures from an image file) and a storage device.","In addition to a digital music player, computing device  may be connected to or otherwise include one or more other peripheral devices, such as a telephone. The telephone may be, for example, a wireless \u201csmart phone.\u201d As known in the art, this type of telephone communicates through a wireless network using radio frequency transmissions. In addition to simple communication functionality, a \u201csmart phone\u201d may also provide a user with one or more data management functions, such as sending, receiving and viewing electronic messages (e.g., electronic mail messages, SMS text messages, etc.), recording or playing back sound files, recording or playing back image files (e.g., still picture or moving video image files), viewing and editing files with text (e.g., Microsoft Word or Excel files, or Adobe Acrobat files), etc. Because of the data management capability of this type of telephone, a user may connect the telephone with computing device  so that their data maintained may be synchronized.","Of course, still other peripheral devices may be included with or otherwise connected to a computing device  of the type illustrated in , as is well known in the art. In some cases, a peripheral device may be permanently or semi-permanently connected to computing device . For example, with many computing devices, processor , local storage , and a display are semi-permanently encased in a single housing.","Still other peripheral devices may be removably connected to computing device , however. Computing device  may include, for example, one or more communication ports through which a peripheral device can be connected to processor  (either directly or indirectly through a bus). These communication ports may thus include a parallel bus port or a serial bus port, such as a serial bus port using the Universal Serial Bus (USB) standard or the IEEE 1394 High Speed Serial Bus standard (e.g., a Firewire port). Alternately or additionally, computing device  may include a wireless data \u201cport,\u201d such as a Bluetooth\u00ae interface, a Wi-Fi interface, an infrared data port, or the like.","It should be appreciated that a computing device employed according various examples of the invention may include more components than computing device  illustrated in , fewer components than computing device , or a different combination of components than computing device . Some implementations of the invention, for example, may employ one or more computing devices that are intended to have a very specific functionality, such as a digital music player or server computer. Some implementations of the invention may alternately or additionally employ computing devices that are intended to be capable of a wide variety of functions, such as a desktop or laptop personal computer. These computing devices may have any combination of peripheral devices or additional components as desired.","As  shows, system memory  stores computer executable instructions defining a computer application . As  illustrates, computer application  instructs processor  to communicate with computer network  via network controller  to retrieve job data  from an online employment resource . As  shows, computer application  displays job data  within an application interface . In the example illustrated in , computer application  is a web browser used to retrieve job data  from an employment website on the World Wide Web. Computer application  renders job data  within a browser window 's rendering window  contained in application interface . The online employment resource currently loaded in rendering window  is the current online employment resource.","Although computer application  is a web-browser in the example illustrated in , other applications commonly used in employment searching may serve as the computer application. E-mail applications, for example, may be used. Web-based e-mail applications, such as Gmail, are also considered for use.","Turning to , computer application  also presents a job application form  requesting user input in response to job data . Form  is displayed within rendering window 's depiction of the current online employment resource. In website-based examples, form  may be on a different webpage than some or all relevant job data .","As  shows, job data  may include any of the information from online employment; resources relating to an employment position. Most job data  that relates to an employment position will be retrieved from a single online employment resource, but this is not required. Job data relating to an employment position often includes duties and responsibilities, qualifications, title of the position, name and location of the employer, the corresponding online employment resource, and other information commonly found in a job posting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["194","195","192","194","195","194","195","196"]},"While computer application  is generally used when operating system , computer application  is not an element of system . Rather, system  interfaces with computer application  (or another application commonly used in employment searching) showing job data and a receiving user input in response to the displayed job data. In some examples, tools such as a plug-in interface or application programming interface (API) allow system  to easily interface with computer application . Such tools, however, are not required. As an example, systems that run separately alongside computer application  and that are configured to automatically interface with computer application  are equally within this disclosure.","As  illustrates, system memory  also stores instruction data  configured to be executed by processor . Instruction data  may have been retrieved from local storage  or from computer network  prior to execution. For example, some disclosed systems may store instruction data on a local hard drive or on data storage accessible via the internet before execution. In the example illustrated in , instruction data  defines a web-browser plugin stored on local storage , moved to system memory , and executed by processor  to interface with computer application  as a browser plugin.","As  shows, instruction data  includes an interface component , a storage component , a retrieval component , an organization component , a reminder component , and a recommendation component . Processor  executes instruction data  to add employment seeking features to a computer application. Processor  may, for example, execute instruction data  as a standalone application, as a plug-in executed within the computer application, or as a web application stored online until execution.","Interface component  includes computer executable instructions for interfacing with computer application . Interface component  allows system  to interact and communicate with computer application . For example, interface component  provides a data connection with computer application , whereby system  may capture form input  and job data . After this information is captured, it may be used by any of system 's components.","As  illustrate, interface component  displays a user interface  within application interface . In the example illustrated in , interface component  includes a toolbar  displayed in browser window . User interface  may additionally include other elements, such as a pop-up toolbar  or a dialog .","User interface  may also include a confirmation element displayed individually or within another element. Such a confirmation element may receive user confirmation to store employment search related data. For example, user interface  includes confirmation element  below toolbar .","As  shows, user interface  may include a supplemental form . Supplemental form  requests supplemental input  potentially corresponding to job data . Supplemental input  may be stored along with job data. Supplemental form  may be displayed, partially or wholly, within one or more of user interface 's elements.","Supplemental form  may request, for example, scheduling data . As  shows, scheduling data  may include a reminder time when a user desires to be reminded about a future scheduled task on a reminder date. Scheduling data  may also include notes corresponding to the scheduled task. Scheduled tasks often relate to an employment search, but this is not specifically required. Examples of scheduled tasks may include following up with an employer or scheduling an employment interview. In some examples, scheduling data  may include multiple reminder times when a user would like to be notified multiple times before a task is due.","As  illustrates, instruction data  includes a storage component  including computer executable instructions for storing saved data to a data storage system. The data storage system may include, for example, local storage  or remote storage  connected through a computer network. Storage component  may store the saved data after form input has been entered into form , for example: upon submission of form , as a user enters data in form , or after interface component  receives user confirmation.","Saved data may include captured data and data entered into supplemental form(s), and may include, for example, job data , form input , supplemental input , scheduling data , and other data acquired over the course of an employment search. Storage component  stores the saved data for use in future employment seeking tasks.","Instruction data  additionally includes organization component , which includes computer executable instructions for using job data to index the saved data. For example, organization component  may be used to index saved data according to selected criteria, which may include job field, job title, employer, or other relevant information. Organization component  may also index saved data according to supplemental input.","Instruction data  also includes retrieval component  including computer executable instructions for retrieving saved data from the data storage system to be used in employment seeking tasks. For example, retrieval component  may retrieve data corresponding to previous employment tasks associated with a previous online employment resource, such as job data, form input entered by a user in the job application form associated with a previous online employment resource, supplemental input, scheduling data, and other relevant information. This retrieved data associated with a previous online employment resource may be used, for example, to automatically complete form input on a job application form associated with a current online employment resource, saving time and effort.","In some examples, the retrieved saved data may include a file attachment, such as file attachment . In some examples, retrieval component  communicates retrieved data as a file attachment when the data was not stored as such. For example, the form input  corresponding to cover letter  may be retrieved as a file attachment despite die fact that; form  requested it as standard text input.","Reminder component  uses scheduling data  retrieved from the data storage system by retrieval component  to communicate a notification at a selected time. The scheduling data  may correspond to user input entered into a supplemental form, similar to scheduling data  illustrated in . When the reminder time arrives, reminder component  communicates a notification relating to an upcoming scheduled task to a user. This notification may include, for example, job data, form input due date(s), reminder dates, or other relevant information. Reminder component  may notify via a dialog window, an e-mail, a text message, an audio clip, or any other additional or alternative form of electronic communication. In relevant examples, providing notifications within commonly used applications, such as web browsers or e-mail clients, a user is more likely to receive proper and timely notification.","Recommendation component  uses data retrieved from the data storage system to recommend employment prospects and job-management related tasks. If a user, for example, has saved data corresponding to several engineering positions, recommendation component  may recommend an additional or alternative engineering position to the user via a notification (as described in the previous paragraph). Retrieval component  may connect to computer network  to retrieve job data corresponding to other employment positions and tasks and relate the job data with the retrieved data to generate recommended job information, which corresponds to recommended employment positions, employment tasks, and other recommended information. By integrating job recommendation functionality with commonly used applications, such as web browsers or e-mail clients, users are more likely to receive proper notification of recommended information.","System  is not particularly tailored to interface with a particular employment resource. For example, system  may interface with common internet employment resource websites, such as Seek.com.au, Monster.com, and the like. System  may additionally implement resource-specific features to interface more fully or more elegantly with that particular resource. However, disclosed job-management systems are not limited to those that implement such resource-specific features.","In some examples, including systems that interface with web browsers and e-mail applications, the computer application may receive communication input and send communication input to an employer contact. In this context, communication input may refer to any information that may be sent to an employer contact, including the body of an e-mail or form input.","The disclosure above encompasses multiple distinct inventions with independent utility. While each of these inventions has been disclosed in a particular form, the specific embodiments disclosed and illustrated above are not to be considered in a limiting sense as numerous variations are possible. The subject matter of the inventions includes all novel and non-obvious combinations and subcombinations of the various elements, features, functions and\/or properties disclosed above and inherent to those skilled in the art pertaining to such inventions. Where the disclosure or subsequently filed claims recite \u201ca\u201d element, \u201ca first\u201d element, or any such equivalent term, the disclosure or claims should be understood to incorporate one or more such elements, neither requiring nor excluding two or more such elements.","Applicant(s) reserves the right to submit claims directed to combinations and subcombinations of the disclosed inventions that are believed to be novel and non-obvious.
