{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.","The invention relates in general to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) type optical switches and in particular to a MEMS optical switch using a thermal actuator.","Optical MEMS is a fairly new subject with many switch designs appearing in the past 5-6 years. Most MEMS optical switches work by actuating a slider in and out of the optical path between one or several input and output optical fibers. The slider acts in one of two ways. First, it could serve to block the light from entering the output optical fiber. Second, the slider could contain a reflector the redirects the light to the output fiber. Due to design and fabrication limitations, these switches are often very optically inefficient.","Many of these limitations can be overcome by directly actuating the input and\/or output optical fibers in and out of line with each other to make for more efficient optical transfer. The major advantage of the moving fiber type optical switch is that the optical efficiency is greater than the moving reflector type switches. The surfaces used for micro-optical mirrors often are not very reflective and the input and output fibers must be placed at great distances from the reflector surface which further increases losses.","U.S. Patent Publication 2002\/0102061 ('061) discloses an optical switch that is fabricated on a substrate and switches planar waveguides into and out of alignment with each other. A heat source (such as electrical resistance heating) may be used to provide heat to the movable structure. The heat causes thermal expansion of the movable structure and resulting movement of the waveguide into or out of alignment with another waveguide.","The '061 device uses waveguides. In general, optical fibers are more optically efficient than fabricated waveguides, optical fibers are cheaper to make than fabricated waveguides and optical fibers (larger diameter) can carry more power than waveguides. Also, in the '061 device, the movable waveguide is integrated into the thermal actuator. Because optical properties of materials are temperature dependent, the waveguides of the '061 device may be adversely affected by temperature increases in the thermal actuator.","It is an object of the invention to interrupt the optical power transfer between input and output optical fibers by directly actuating the fibers in and out of line with each other.","It is another object of the invention to provide an optical switch wherein the optical fibers are discrete from the thermal actuator, to thereby minimize adverse temperature effects.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","In a moving fiber type optical switch, two optical fibers are placed in alignment channels on a chip surface. The optical fibers face each other and can be offset, depending on whether or not optical power transfer is desired in the unpowered state. An actuator for at least one of the optical fibers acts to push the fibers in or out of line with each other so that optical switching takes place.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","10","10","12","10","12","10","1","12","1","10","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["50","30","32","50","14","14","24","50","24","14","24","26","24","30","32","30","32","24","30","32","50"]},"Each optical fiber ,  has a corresponding thermal actuator. The thermal actuator for fiber  includes anchors , v-beams , , and yoke . The thermal actuator for fiber  includes anchors , v-beams ,  and yoke . Metal plating  on top of anchors  functions as an electrical contact to supply electrical power from a power supply (not shown) to the v-beams. The middle portions of v-beams ,  are connected to yoke  and the middle portions of v-beams ,  are connected to yoke . Anchors , v-beams , , , , and yokes ,  are fabricated from a wafer using known MEMS fabrication techniques. Such techniques include DRIE and LIGA.","When optical switch  is in the on state, fiber  will be aligned with fiber  so that signals from fiber  will pass to fiber . Alignment of fibers ,  is accomplished by applying electrical power across the four anchors . Electrical current flows through v-beams ,  and , . As a result of resistance heating, the v-beams expand. Because the v-beams are anchored, the result of expansion is displacement of the v-beams and corresponding yokes in a direction toward respective optical fibers , . Yoke  contacts fiber  and pushes it in a downward direction as seen in FIG. . Yoke  contacts fiber  and pushes it in an upward direction as seen in FIG. . The net result of the displacement of the yokes ,  is that the fibers ,  become longitudinally aligned such that a signal from one fiber can pass through to the other fiber.","Turning off optical switch  results in fibers ,  returning to the positions shown in FIG. . Optical switch  is turned off by cutting power to anchors . The v-beams contract as they cool, causing the yokes ,  to move back to the positions shown in FIG. . The yokes ,  are not connected to fibers , . However, as the yokes ,  move away from fibers , , the elasticity of fibers ,  causes the fibers to spring back to the unaligned or off position shown in FIG. . The switch  may be repeatedly turned on and off by respectively applying and cutting power to anchors  through plating .","Many variations of the power switch  shown in  are possible and are included in the scope of the invention. In switch , each of the thermal actuators is shown with two v-beams ,  and , , respectively, However, a single v-beam could be used with each thermal actuator. A single v-beam would reduce the force applied by the yoke to the fiber. Also, more than two v-beams could be used with each thermal actuator to increase the force applied by the yoke to the fiber.","Another variation is to use a single thermal actuator to move only one of the fibers. That is, one of the fibers would remain fixed in both the on and off states of the switch. The fixed fiber would always be in the aligned position and would not require a thermal actuator. The other fiber would be movable from an out of line position to an aligned position by a thermal actuator.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
