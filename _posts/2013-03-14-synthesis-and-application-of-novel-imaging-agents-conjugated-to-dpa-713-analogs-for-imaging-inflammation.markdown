title: Synthesis and application of novel imaging agents conjugated to DPA 713 analogs for imaging inflammation
abstract: The present invention provides analog compounds of DPA-713 which specifically bind the translocator protein (TSPO), which is upregulated in activated leukocytes, some malignant tumors and tissues involved in steroid biogenesis. These compounds are linked via a linking moiety to a variety of imaging agents, including, for example, near infra-red dyes. The compounds of the present invention are useful for both pre-clinical near-IR fluorescence imaging (NIRF) and use in optically-guided interventions including NIRF endoscopy. Methods of use in diagnosis and treatment of TSPO related disease are also provided.

The immortalized J774 murine macrophage-like cell line was cultured in RPMI1640+20% FBS+1% penicillin+ streptomycin media in 8-well chamber slides (Fisher Scientific) to approximately 80% confluence. The cells were then stimulated with 1 ng\/mL of LPS (Sigma, 055:B5) for 24 hours prior to addition of the probes of the present invention to 40 nM final concentration. Wells that received blocking compounds contained either 1 \u03bcM (R,S)-PK11195 (Sigma) or 1 \u03bcM DPA-713 conjugated to the IR dye. The cells were exposed to the fluorescent probes and blocking compounds for either 1 hour or 24 hours prior to exposing to 1 ng\/mL of Hoechst 33342 dye (Invitrogen), followed by washing twice briefly with PBS, pH 7.5. The chambers were then removed and the slide mounted with Dako Cytomation aqueous mounting media and a glass coverslip. The cells were visualized using a Nikon 80i upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-QilMc darkfield CCD camera and processed using Nikon Image Software on an adjacent workstation. The dyes were excited using either a Nikon Intensilight C-HGFI lamp (IRDye680 and Hoechst) or a Sutter Instruments Co. (Novato, Calif.)

The 50% inhibition of [H]PK11195 binding is then determined and reported as the IC().","Cell lines and Tumor Models. Generation of MDA-MD-231-LMD-PSMA cells. LV-PSMA is a VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus encoding PSMA which was packaged in 293T cells. LMD-PSMA cells were generated in-house by repetitive lentiviral transduction of a cell line isolated from a lung metastasis derived MDA-MB-231 xenograft in a female NOD-SCID mouse. PSMA expression was evaluated by western blot analysis with 7E11-05 (1:200 dilution). No differences in growth of morphology were observed in cell culture between the parental LMD cells and PSMA transduced LMD-PSMA cells. Six-to-eight week old female NOD SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with 5\u00d710MDA-MB-231-LMD (a lung metastasis-derived subline of parental MDA-MB-231 behind the right forearm and 5\u00d710MDA-MB-231-LMD-PSMA (the same cell line with Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) stably knocked in via lentiviral vector) injected behind the right forearm. The xenografts were allowed to grow until the PSMA xenograft was at least 3 mm in diameter while the \u2212LMD xenograft had reached 6-8 mm in diameter.","Prostate lines PC-3 PIP (PSMA stable transfected) and PC-3 flu (empty vector transfected) cells were originally a gift from Warren B. Heston (Cleveland Clinic Foundation). PC-3 is androgen insensitive and constituitively expresses TSPO. LNCaP cells were originally procured from the ATCC (Manassas, Va.) and do not express TSPO when grown as xenografts within intact male mice. Intact male athymic nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 2\u00d710PC-3 PIP cells behind the right forearm and 2\u00d710PC-3 flu cells behind the left forearm and were allowed to grow for 14 days until they reached 1 cm in longest diameter. Mice bearing LNCaP xenografts were inoculated with 5\u00d710cells in Matrigel (1:1, vol:vol) (Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and were allowed to grow for a year before they reached 1 cm in diameter. The mice were then used in imaging experiments as described below.","Serial in vivo NIRF imaging in TSPO+MDA-MB-231 LMD\u00b1PSMA and PC-3 PIP and -flu tumor xenograft bearing mice. MDA-MB-231 LMD lines: one mouse was imaged serially at 1 hour post-tracers, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours post-tracers using a Pearl Impulse Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) with dedicated 710 and 800 nm emission filters. All images were scaled to the same maximum using the manufacturer's software to facilitate direct comparison of all timepoints. The remaining mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation along the indicated timepoints, they were imaged ex vivo with their body cavity exposed and their tissues were then harvested and frozen over dry ice for cryosectioning followed by ex vivo microscopy described above.","PC-3 PIP and -flu xenograft bearing mice. Two mice bearing similar pairs of 1 cm tumors were injected intraperitoneally with either 8 nmol of the inventive probe DPA-713-IRDye680LT or 8 nmol of the inventive probeDPA-713-IRDye680LT+20 mg\/kg of unlabeled DPA-713 competitor. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane gas (2% in oxygen) and imaged at 1 hour and 24 hours post-injection using the Pearl Impulse imager using the 680 absorption\/710 emission channels (DPA-713-IRDye680LT). PIP\/flu and LNCaP-bearing mice were imaged using the inventive probe DPA-713-IRDye800CW at 1 hour post-injection using a Perkin Elmer IVIS 200 instrument set to absorb at 790 nm and emit at 810 nm. Images were visualized and processed using the manufacturer's Living Image software.","Ex vivo DPA-713-IRDye680LT microscopy. The mice used in the in vivo NIRF studies (PC-3 analog xenografts and MDA-MB-231 analog xenografts) were sacrificed at the end of their studies and their tumors were collected and frozen on dry ice for cryosectioning to 20 microns on charged glass slides (VWR). The sections were then probed with both anti-TSPO Ab (Novus Biologicals NBP1-45769, 1:70) labeled directly with Lissamine sulfonyl chloride (Aldrich) according to the known method and anti-CD68 Ab (Abcam ab53444, 1:40) and lastly with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, 1 ng\/mL). Both antibodies were added simultaneously in a 10% FBS in PBS solution applied directly to the freshly thawed sections and allowed to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. The sections were washed twice at room temperature for 5 minutes each with PBS prior to the addition of sheep-anti-rat-FITC (Abcam ab6848-1, 1:250) in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes. The secondary antibody solution was removed and the slides were bathed in Hoechst solution (PBS) for 1.5 minutes at room temperature before being washed twice as before with PBS. The slides were then mounted in Dako Cytomation aqueous mounting media with a glass coverslip and viewed 30 minutes later using a Nikon 80i upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-QilMc darkfield CCD camera and excited by a Nikon Intensilight C-HGFI lamp.

LPS was then added to each well for 24 hours to stimulate the cells. Both DPA-713-IRDye680LT and DPA-713-IRDye800CW (40 nM each) were then added to each well with or without an excess of competing unlabeled PK11195 or DPA-713. The cells were returned to the incubator for either 1 hour or 24 hours. The solutions were then removed, the nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 and the cells were briefly washed before mounting and viewing under a fluorescence microscope.  shows the uptake of the IRDye680LT analog at 1 and 24 hours of incubation, while panels G-I shows the uptake of the IRDye800CW analog after 24 hours of incubation. There was almost no observable signal from the IRDye800CW analog after 1 hour of incubation, likely due to the inherently lower sensitivity of the detector at this wavelength. The tracer localization for both analogs is perinuclear and granular in appearance and is consistent with the gross distribution pattern of TSPO expression in other mononuclear cell-derived lines. Co-administration of 1 \u03bcM unlabeled TSPO-specific ligand (R,S)-PK11195 along with 40 nM DPA-713-IRDye680LT resulted in widespread although incomplete blocking of tracer uptake at 1 hour (panel B). Co-administration of 1 \u03bcM unlabeled DPA-713 along with the same concentration of tracer resulted in partial but incomplete blocking of tracer uptake (panel C) at 1 hour. After 24 hours of incubation with both tracer and blocking agents, (R,S)-PK11195 no longer blocked DPA-713-IRDye680LT uptake (panels E, H) although the presence of 1 \u03bcM unlabeled DPA-713 virtually eliminated binding of both analogs (panels F, I).","In vivo NIRF imaging of DPA-713-IRDye680LT in TSPO+MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and TSPO+PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts. NOD-SCID mice were inoculated subcutaneously with a parental MDA-MB-231 and a stably transfected MDA-MB-231-PSMA (expressing prostate-specific membrane antigen) cell line, both of which constituitively express TSPO. In our experience, cell lines ectopically expressing PSMA harbor more macrophages and are more vascular than their parental lines. This difference in macrophage density was the target for comparison between this otherwise isogenic tumor line. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with 6 nmol of DPA-713-IRDye680LT when the xenografts had reached \u22674 mm in diameter. The mice were imaged after 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-probe injection, followed by ex vivo imaging of the tumors at 24 hours.  shows the in vivo uptake in a mouse bearing an 8 mm PSMA+ xenograft on one side (left arrowhead) and a 3 mm parental xenograft on the other. Probe uptake in the larger xenograft is visible 1 hour following peritoneal injection and continues through 24 hours after injection while background uptake clears. The smaller parental xenograft displays no observable uptake until the fur and skin are removed at 24 hours post-injection (24 h*). The larger, PSMA expressing xenograft is visibly brighter than the smaller parental tumor.","Prostate tumors that have become androgen insensitive constituitively express TSPO, including the PC-3 cell line. Athymic nude mice bearing two subcutaneous xenografts each consisting of one PC-3 PIP (PSMA+ stable transfected, macrophage and vasculature enriched) and PC-3 flu (PC-3 transfected with empty vector) were injected intraperitoneally with 8 nmol of DPA-713-IRDye680LT when the tumors reached 4-8 mm in diameter. One mouse was injected with tracer only and one mouse received tracer co-injected with 20 mg\/kg of unlabeled DPA-713. The mice were imaged in vivo at 1 hour post-injection and again at 24 hours post-injection.  shows the distribution of fluorescent signal at these two time points. At 1 hour post-injection, only the macrophage enriched PC-3 PIP tumor is clearly visible (arrowhead) in both dorsal and ventral views. Neither tumor takes up the fluorescent probe when unlabeled DPA-713 is co-administered. By 24 hours post-injection, fluorescence intensity is now distributed at the periphery of both tumors in the tracer-only mouse and is strongly retained by TSPO+ kidneys. The mouse co-injected with unlabeled DPA-713 displays neither tumor nor kidney uptake. Additionally, the unbound probe has cleared from the peritoneal space.","Ex vivo microscopy. Both MDA-MB-231 LMD xenografts were removed, frozen and sectioned onto charged glass for analysis of cell-specific localization of the inventive DPA-713-IRDye680LT probe at 24 hours post-injection. The sections were subsequently probed with antibodies to delineate the presence of CD68 expressing mononuclear cells, which are known to upregulate TSPO expression when activated, as well as an antibody to delineate all TSPO expression within the tissue.  demonstrates that at 24 hours post-injection, DPA-713-IRDye680LT is selectively retained by CD68-expressing macrophages, despite the presence of TSPO-expressing epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Cells negative for CD68 and TSPO expression are also devoid of DPA-713-IRDye680LT. This ex vivo data supports the results shown in , which demonstrate that TSPO-specific uptake of DPA-713-IRDye680LT is blocked at early (1 hour) timepoints by TSPO-specific ligand PK11195 but not at late (24 hour) time points. Autoblockade is effective at both early and late timepoints, demonstrating specificity of binding as well as indicating TSPO-independent trapping at late timepoints. This heterogeneity in TSPO-targeted probe binding has been reported by others although the identity of any other target(s) has not been elucidated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["9","9","9","9","9"]},"All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein.","The use of the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
