Typically, sensors (or sensor nodes) in a sensor network collect and store data so the data can subsequently be accessed. In this way, the sensor network can be viewed as a distributed database. An important requirement of a sensor network is that data collected by sensors in the network can be disseminated to end users.","One approach for retrieving data in a sensor network is for a user to query an individual sensor or a group of sensors for data collected by the sensor(s). The desired data can then be routed across the network from the sensor(s) to the user. However, sensors in a sensor network typically have very limited storage, bandwidth and\/or computational power, and are often prone to failure, especially in situations where a sensor network is used to monitor emergency or disaster scenarios, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, and\/or landslides. Due to these limitations, the foregoing approach may be infeasible or may incur unacceptable delay for certain applications.","Another approach is to use local data storage units (or data sinks) to collect data. A data storage unit can typically store a relatively large quantity of data collected by nearby sensors, and may respond directly to a querying node. A local data storage unit can be used to collect sensor data more effectively. However, in failure-prone sensor networks, valuable data that is collected by the sensors may still be lost before reaching a data storage unit. Therefore, it is desirable to efficiently collect and recover data in a failure-prone sensor network.","Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter provide methods, systems, and media for forming linear combinations of data. Methods for forming a linear combination of data include: receiving at a device a first codeword, wherein the first codeword includes a linear combination of at least a first data unit including data, and a second data unit including data; encoding at the device the first codeword and a third data unit including data to form a second codeword, wherein the second codeword includes a linear combination of at least the first data unit, the second data unit, and the third data unit; and transmitting from the device the second codeword.","In some embodiments, systems for forming a linear combination of data include: a device that: receives a first codeword, wherein the first codeword includes a linear combination of at least a first data unit including data, and a second data unit including data; encodes the first codeword and a third data unit including data to form a second codeword, wherein the second codeword includes a linear combination of at least the first data unit, the second data unit, and the third data unit; and transmits the second codeword.","In some embodiments, computer-readable media are provided containing computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method for forming a linear combination of data, the method includes: receiving at a device a first codeword, wherein the first codeword includes a linear combination of at least a first data unit including data, and a second data unit including data; encoding at the device the first codeword and a third data unit including data to form a second codeword, wherein the second codeword includes a linear combination of at least the first data unit, the second data unit, and the third data unit; and transmitting from the device the second codeword.","Methods, systems, and media for forming linear combinations of data are provided. Using various embodiments, data collected by sensors in a sensor network can reach one or more data storage units in the sensor network and be recovered in an efficient manner, even when sensors in the network fail. In some embodiments, computing devices in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network can encode and transmit blocks of a file, so that a file can be distributed within the P2P network effectively.","In some embodiments, a sensor network can include sensors that take measurements of the surrounding environment and record the measurements as data units. The sensors can also encode one or more data units into one or more codewords, and exchange the data units and\/or codewords with other sensors in the sensor network. Upon receiving a codeword from another sensor, a sensor in the sensor network can further encode the received codeword with another data unit or codeword that is stored at the sensor to form a new codeword. The number of data units that is encoded in the new codeword can, therefore, be greater than the number of data units that is encoded in the received codeword. The sensor network can also include one or more data storage units. A data storage unit can receive data units and\/or codewords from one or more sensors in the sensor network and may decode the received codewords to recover data units that have been encoded.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","102","102","102","100","102","102"],"i":["a","b","c","d","b","c","d"]},"Sensor network  can also include one or more data storage units (e.g., data storage unit , ). A data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit ) can have a larger storage capacity than a sensor in the sensor network (e.g., sensor ). A data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit ) can be configured to communicate with one or more sensors (e.g., sensors , ). For example, a sensor (e.g., sensor ) that is in communication with a data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit ) can be configured to automatically send all obtained data to the data storage unit. A data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit ) can also query the sensors (e.g., sensor ) to retrieve data from the sensors. Because sensors (e.g., sensors , ) that are in communication with a data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit ) can also communicate with other sensors (e.g., sensor ), a data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit ) can indirectly receive data from sensors (e.g., sensor ) that do not have a direct communication link with the data storage unit.","In some embodiments, sensors (e.g., sensor ) can have computational power to manipulate data in transit (e.g., data from sensor to data storage unit ). For example, a sensor can compress or recode data to increase delivery efficiency. In some embodiments, sensors in a network may have no information on the location of the data storage units and\/or the topology of the network, in which case a sensor can randomly choose one or more neighboring sensors for sending or receiving data in an attempt to deliver data to a data storage unit in the network.","Sensors in network  can encode one or more data units into codewords using erasure codes, including optimal erasure codes such as Reed-Solomon codes or erasure codes based on sparse bipartite graphs such as Tornado or Luby Transform (LT) codes. In some embodiments, a codeword is formed as a linear combination of data units and\/or other codewords. In some embodiments, exclusive-or (XOR) based codes can be used to form a linear combination of data units and\/or codewords. For example, bitwise XOR operations can be performed on data units to form a portion of a codeword (another portion can be a coefficient used for identifying the data units, as described below). In these embodiments, the portion of the codeword formed can have substantially the same size as the data units encoded. In this document, the number of data units used to form a codeword is referred to as the degree of the codeword.","Sensors in network  can exchange data units and\/or codewords with neighboring sensors. This can be done at, for example, predetermined time intervals. As a result, although a sensor (e.g., sensor ) may initially only have data units generated by itself, the sensor can obtain data units and\/or codewords generated by other sensors (e.g., sensors , ) over time. Therefore, data recorded by a sensor (e.g., sensor ) in network  can be duplicated at other sensors (e.g., sensor ) and recovered even if the sensor (e.g., sensor ) fails. In addition, sensors in network  may utilize source coding techniques to reduce the amount of data to be delivered by compressing the data in space and\/or time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C"],"b":["2","2","100","102","1","102","2","2","102","2","1","202","102","202","1","2","102","102","102","104"],"i":["b ","c ","b ","c ","b","b ","d ","b. "]},"A codeword can include a coefficient that describes and identifies the data unit(s) from which the codeword is formed. For example, each sensor in network  can have a unique identifier (ID), and can attach this ID to a data unit generated by the sensor. A codeword that is formed from i data units can include i of these IDs to identify each of the i data units. In some embodiments, sensor network  encodes a single data unit to form a codeword, and a single ID can be included in the coefficient to identify the data unit. In this case, as shown in , the coefficient can include a first bit \u201c1\u201d (at reference numeral ), indicating that the codeword includes only one data unit, and log(N) bits specifying which data unit makes up the codeword, where N is the total number of data units.","In some embodiments, sensor network  can encode one or more data units to form a codeword. In these embodiments, coefficient in a codeword may be constructed using two different formats as illustrated respectively by . When the number of data units forming the codeword is low (in particular, less than N\/log(N)), less space is consumed by listing the IDs of the data units. In this case, the coefficient can be constructed in the format as shown in , where the first bit  can indicate the particular format. The first bit  can be followed by a number of bits  (e.g., 7 bits) indicating the number of data units encoded in the codeword. The remaining bits  can store the IDs of the data units.","When the number of data units forming the codeword is greater than N\/log(N), less space is consumed by reserving a bit for each of the N possible data units. In this case, as shown in , the coefficient can include a first bit  indicating the particular format being used, followed by a number of bits  (e.g., 7 bits) indicating the number of data units encoded in the codeword. Bits  can be followed by N bits  where a \u201c1\u201d bit signifies the presence of a particular data unit and a \u201c0\u201d bit specifies the absence of a particular data unit. When the number of data units forming the codeword is equal to N\/log(N), either format shown in  or  can be used. The ways of constructing a coefficient illustrated in , B, and C are only presented as examples, and various other suitable approaches can be used.","Referring back to , sensors in network  can take measurements and generate new data units in successive time periods. In this case, the size of the coefficients can become significant for codewords encoded from a relatively large number of data units. To reduce coefficient overhead across successive time periods, clustering may be used. A cluster can be a set of codewords across several time periods. Codewords can all refer to a single coefficient in the cluster, thereby eliminating redundant coefficients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["350","1","9","1","3","10","11","1","2","4","352","354","12","3","1","13","5","4","5","6","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","102","100","402","102","404","102","102","100","406","102","408","102","100","400","400","410","400","410","100"],"i":["b","b ","b ","c","b ","b "]},"Upon receiving codewords from sensors (e.g., sensors , ), data storage units (e.g., data storage unit ) can decode the received codewords and recover the original data units that form the codewords. In some embodiments, a data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit ) can first recover data units from codewords that are formed from only one data unit. Then, if it is found that a codeword is formed from recovered data units and only one other data unit that has not been recovered, that data unit can be recovered. For example, if the codeword is encoded by performing XOR on data units, the data unit can be recovered by also performing XOR on the codeword and the recovered data units.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","102","102","102","102","104","104","502","502","504","506","500","508","1","3","1","1","3","1","3","1","3","5","5","500","504","508","506","500","510","500","504","500","512"],"i":["a","b","c","d ","a ","b"]},"Sensors in network  can be configured so that codewords generated by the sensors start with degree 1, but gradually increase in terms of their degree over time. The result is that data storage unit(s) (e.g., data storage unit ) of network  receive codewords of increasing degree over time, as is illustrated by .  is a diagram illustrating the first codewords , received by data storage unit . These codewords, sent respectively from sensors and , are each formed from a single data unit (e.g., X or X) as shown. At a later time, shown in , codewords , received by data storage unit are each formed from two data units (e.g., X and X, or X and X).","In sensor network , generating codewords with gradually increasing number of data units encoded can improve the recovery of data units.

Each value of Tindicates a period of time from some initial point in time after which codewords of degree i can be generated. For example, in some embodiments, before the end of a period T, a sensor will only generate codewords with a degree of 1. After the end of period Tand before the end of period T, however, the sensor will generate codewords with a degree of 2.","When a codeword of a degree i is received by a sensor before the end of a period T, the codeword will be passed on to a neighboring sensor without modification. When a codeword of a degree i is received by a sensor after the end of a period T, the sensor can perform an XOR operation on the codeword with its own data unit prior to passing the degree-increased codeword on to a neighboring sensor. In the event that the codeword already contains the data unit of the sending sensor, the codeword can be passed on without modification. Such a codeword may then be passed on from sensor to sensor without modification until a sensor whose data unit is not encoded into the codeword is encountered.","In this manner, codewords generated by the sensors \u201cgrow\u201d in terms of their degree as they travel en-route to a data storage unit. Values Tto Tcan be chosen so that codewords that arrive at a data storage unit (e.g., data storage unit in network ) follows a desired degree distribution. For example, if the degree distribution of equation (3) is desired, values Tto Tcan be chosen as Kto Kaccording to equations (1) and (2). In this case, if a data storage unit receives one codeword per time unit, it can receive degree 1 codewords for the first Ktime units, followed by degree 2 codewords until time K, and so on. If there are multiple sink nodes, or that a sink node receives codewords from multiple sensors, such that multiple codewords are received per time unit, then the values of Kmay be scaled to achieve the desired effect.","In a sensor network that generates codewords of increasing degree, sensors can also take measurements and generate new data units in successive time periods. As discussed above, clustering of codewords can be used to allow more data to be saved in each sensor. In this case, because codewords of all time periods in a cluster can share the same coefficient, they can be \u201cgrown\u201d to a higher degree (i.e., encoded with an addition data unit) together, for example, when a codeword of the most recent time period in the cluster is grown.

Initially, one or more seeding devices in the network possess the file. To distribute the file to a larger group of computing devices in the network, a seeding device can partition the file into multiple blocks (or data units) and randomly distribute the data units to a number of other devices, which can then encode received data units into codewords and exchange codewords with one another. Upon receiving one or more codewords, a computing device that desires the file can also decode the codewords using data units and\/or codewords that have already been received and\/or decoded. For example, upon receiving a codeword encoded from data units X, X and X, a computing device that has previously received a codeword encoded from X and X can use the two received codewords to recover data unit X. Using data unit X, a later received codeword encoded from X and X can then be decoded to recover data unit X. As another example, if a computing device has already received and\/or decoded all the data units that make up a file except X, it may request any codeword that is encoded from X from other peers in the network and decode the codeword to obtain X.
