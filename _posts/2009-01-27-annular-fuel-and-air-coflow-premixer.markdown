{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT REGARDING GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. DE-FC26-05NT42643 awarded by the Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The subject invention relates generally to combustors. More particularly, the subject invention relates to fuel nozzle fuel and air premixers.","Combustors typically include one or more fuel nozzles that introduce a fuel or a mixture of fuel and air to a combustion chamber where it is ignited. Mixing of fuel and air prior to combustion allows for lower flame temperatures than at a stoichiometric condition, resulting in a reduction of nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions. Typically, fuel flows through a nozzle and fuel jets are injected into a cross flow of air flowing axially along the nozzle. Injecting fuel into the cross flow, however, produces low speed recirculation zones of fuel-air mix downstream of the fuel jets. With many fuels having high flame speeds and short blow off times, such as fuels that are high in Hcontent, flameholding is likely to occur in the recirculation zones, resulting in damage to the nozzle and other combustor components. A fuel nozzle premixer that reduces flow anomalies such as recirculation would be well received in the art.","According to one aspect of the invention, a premixer for a combustor includes an annular outer shell and an annular inner shell. The inner shell defines an inner flow channel inside of the inner shell and is located to define an outer flow channel between the outer shell and the inner shell. A fuel discharge annulus is located between the outer flow channel and the inner flow channel and is configured to inject a fuel flow into a mixing area in a direction substantially parallel to an outer airflow through the outer flow channel and an inner flow through the inner flow channel.","According to another aspect of the invention, a combustor for a turbomachine includes a plurality of premixers. Each premixer includes an annular outer shell and an annular inner shell defining an inner flow channel inside of the inner shell and located to define an outer flow channel between the outer shell and the inner shell. A fuel discharge annulus is located between the outer flow channel and the inner flow channel and is configured to inject a fuel flow into a mixing area in a direction substantially parallel to an outer airflow through the outer flow channel and an inner flow through the inner flow channel.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, a method of premixing air and fuel in a combustor includes flowing an outer airflow along an outer airflow channel toward a mixing area. An inner airflow is flowed along an inner airflow channel toward the mixing area. Fuel is injected into the mixing area from a fuel discharge annulus located between the inner airflow channel and the outer airflow channel. The fuel is injected into the mixing area in a direction substantially parallel to the inner airflow and the outer airflow. The inner airflow, the outer airflow, and the fuel are mixed in the mixing area.","These and other advantages and features will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the drawings.","The detailed description explains embodiments of the invention, together with advantages and features, by way of example with reference to the drawings.","Shown in  is en embodiment of a combustor  including at least one premixer . As shown in , the premixer  includes an outer shell  and an inner shell . The inner shell  and outer shell  may be substantially annular in shape and, as shown in , the outer shell  and the inner shell  may be substantially concentric about a premixer axis . The inner shell  is disposed inside of the outer shell  such that an outer air passage  is defined between the inner shell  and the outer shell .","A plurality of struts  extend inwardly from the outer shell  to the inner shell  to support the inner shell  inside of the outer shell . Each strut  is hollow, or includes at least one inlet air passage  that extends therethrough. The inlet air passage  extends from an outer shell exterior  to an inner shell interior , thus allowing an inner airflow  to flow from the outer shell exterior  to the inner shell interior . The inner shell  includes a cap  at an upstream end  to direct the inner airflow  entering the inner shell interior  toward a downstream end  of the inner shell  substantially along the premixer axis . Further, an outer airflow  flows through the outer air passage  past the plurality of struts  toward the downstream end . The inner shell  includes a plurality of fuel passages  disposed and configured to guide a fuel flow  from a fuel source (not shown) to a fuel discharge annulus  where the fuel flow  is injected into a mixing area . The fuel passages  are disposed between an inner wall  and an outer wall  of the inner shell  and extend from the upstream end  to the downstream end .","In some embodiments, as shown in , the discharge annulus  comprises a plurality of discharge holes  in a tip  of the inner shell , while in other embodiments, as shown in , the discharge annulus  may comprise a continuous discharge slit  extending perimetrically around the tip . Referring again to , the discharge annulus  is configured to discharge the fuel flow  into the mixing area  substantially parallel to the premixer axis , and substantially parallel to both the inner airflow  and the outer airflow . The fuel flow  mixes with the inner airflow  and the outer airflow  in the mixing area . Since the fuel flow  is injected substantially parallel to the inner airflow  and the outer airflow , a probability of a recirculation zone forming is reduced, thus reducing incidence of operational issues with the combustor such as flameholding.","To further ensure a smooth flow of both the inner airflow  and the outer airflow  into the mixing area , the struts  are disposed such that they are at a distance sufficiently upstream of the discharge annulus  so that any flow disturbances caused by the struts  are dampened out before the inner airflow  and the outer airflow  reach the mixing area . Further, the struts  may have an aerodynamically streamlined shape to minimize flow disturbances.","In another embodiment, as shown in , the plurality of struts  are configured to connect the fuel source to the plurality of fuel passages  via a plurality of strut fuel guides . The fuel flow  is guided from the fuel source through the plurality of struts fuel guides  and into the fuel passages  where it then is discharged from the discharge annulus  into the mixing area . In this embodiment, the inner shell  is opened at both the upstream end  and the downstream end , so that both the inner airflow  and the outer airflow  flow substantially axially from the upstream end  toward the downstream end  thus reducing flow disturbances.","Shown in  is yet another embodiment of a premixer . In this embodiment, a plurality of outer air passage inlets  are disposed at the outer shell exterior  and in some embodiments are disposed such that the outer airflow  enters the outer air passage  in a substantially radial direction. The outer air passage  is curved from the radial direction to an axial direction, thus turning the outer airflow  from a radially-directed flow to an axial directed flow before it enters the mixing area . Similarly, a plurality of fuel passage inlets  are disposed upstream of the outer air passage inlets . The fuel passage inlets  direct the fuel flow  toward the discharge annulus . Because the fuel passage inlets  are disposed upstream of the outer air passage inlets , the fuel passages  do not cross the outer air passages , thus struts  are not required. Constructing the premixer  without utilizing struts  further alleviates potential flow disturbances thereby improving premixer and combustor operability.","While the invention has been described in detail in connection with only a limited number of embodiments, it should be readily understood that the invention is not limited to such disclosed embodiments. Rather, the invention can be modified to incorporate any number of variations, alterations, substitutions or equivalent arrangements not heretofore described, but which are commensurate with the spirit and scope of the invention. Additionally, while various embodiments of the invention have been described, it is to be understood that aspects of the invention may include only some of the described embodiments. Accordingly, the invention is not to be seen as limited by the foregoing description, but is only limited by the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The subject matter which is regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the claims at the conclusion of the specification.
