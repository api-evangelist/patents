{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under a contract awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a circuit to sequentially turn on and off a series connected string of electronic devices with a minimum switching delay while limiting the voltage drop across each device.","2. Description of Related Art","The ability to operate insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) at high voltage, and thereby benefit from their high frequency capability, is limited by their specified voltage ratings. Previous art methods for operating IGBTs in series, where the voltage across the IGBTs is higher than the maximum voltage rating of each IGBT, include the use of a voltage clamp circuit across each IGBT, and a turn-on and turn-off sequence circuit that forces the system voltage to be applied across the IGBTs in a controlled order.","In operation, as the voltage across each IGBT increases, the corresponding voltage clamp circuit clamps the voltage to a maximum value. The process of the prior art uses a short, fixed delay to ensure that each IGBT is turned on or off before the next device in the series string is operated. This delay compensates for variations in the turn-on time of each IGBT but must be longer than the slowest IGBT turn-on time expected. This turn-on and turn-off delay method requires that the ratings of the voltage clamp circuit be larger than necessary and extends the total operating time needed to operate all the IGBTs in the series string.","When solid state switching devices, such as IGBTs, transistors or SCRs (silicon controlled rectifiers), are operated in series, they do not all turn on or turn off at the same time. Unless provisions are made for limiting the voltage drop across each device, the first device to turn off must support the entire system voltage until the other devices turn off. If, during this period, the system voltage is greater than the device voltage rating, the device will fail. The same holds true when the devices are turned on. The last device to be turned on will be subjected to the full system voltage and, if it is greater than the device rating, it will fail.","The invention is a ripple gate drive circuit that includes a plurality of transistors having their power terminals connected in series across an electrical potential. A plurality of control circuits, each associated with one of the transistors, is provided. Each control circuit is responsive to a control signal and an optical signal received from at least one other control circuit for controlling the conduction of electrical current through the power terminals of the associated transistor. The control circuits are responsive to a first state of the control signal for causing each transistor in series to turn on sequentially and responsive to a second state of the control signal for causing each transistor in series to turn off sequentially.","Referring to , a ripple gate drive circuit  includes a first transistor , a second transistor  and a third transistor  having their power terminals connected in series across a power source V. Connected in series with the power terminals of transistors  to  is a load L. The conduction state of transistors  to  can be selectively controlled to enable load L to receive power from power source V.","Ripple gate drive circuit  includes a first clamp circuit , a second clamp circuit  and a third clamp circuit  connected between the power terminals of first transistor , second transistor  and third transistor , respectively. Each clamp circuit  to  is configured to limit the voltage drop across its respective transistor  to  during conduction in order to avoid damage thereto. In one embodiment, transistors  to  are insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Since suitable circuit configurations for implementing the functions of clamp circuits  to  are well-known in the art, details regarding one or more circuit configurations for clamp circuits  to  have not been included herein.","Control terminals of transistors  to  are connected to receive a binary drive signal from a first control circuit , a second control circuit  and a third control circuit , respectively. Desirably, the electrical components of first control circuit  receive power from a low level power supply V which also includes a ground COM which is connected as necessary to the components of first control circuit  and to the node formed by the connection of the power terminals of first transistor  and second transistor . Similarly, the electrical components of second and third control circuits  and  desirably receive electrical power from low level power supplies V and V which also include grounds COM and COM which are connected as necessary to the components of second and third control circuits  and , respectively. COM is connected to the node formed by the connection of the power terminals of second transistor  and third transistor  whereas COM is connected to the other power terminal of third transistor .","First control circuit  includes a fiber optic transmitter , fiber optic receivers  and , a first logic circuit  and a first drive circuit . Second control circuit  includes fiber optic transmitters  and , fiber optic receivers ,  and , a second logic circuit  and a second drive circuit . Lastly, third control circuit  includes a fiber optic transmitter , fiber optic receivers  and , a third logic circuit  and a third drive circuit .","In first control circuit , fiber optic transmitter  either blocks or forwards supply V. Instead of being directly connected COM, however, the electrical return path of fiber optic transmitter  is connected COM through first transistor . Similarly, in third control circuit , fiber optic transmitter  either blocks or forwards power supply V and is connected COM via third transistor . However, in second control circuit , fiber optic transmitter  either blocks or forwards power supply V and is connected COM via fiber optic transmitter  and second transistor .","Fiber optic transmitter  has an optical output that is optically coupled to an input of fiber optic receiver  of second control circuit . Fiber optic transmitter  has an optical output that is coupled to an optical input of fiber optic receiver  of third control circuit . Fiber optic transmitter  has an optical output that is coupled to an optical input of fiber optic receiver  of first control circuit . Lastly, fiber optic transmitter  has an optical output that is coupled to an optical input of fiber optic receiver  of second control circuit .","First logic circuit  implements a logical OR on the electrical outputs of fiber optic receivers  and . The digital signal output by first logic circuit  is coupled to an input of first drive circuit  which amplifies the digital signal and supplies it as a digital drive signal to a control terminal of first transistor . Second logic circuit  implements a logical AND function on the electrical outputs of fiber optic receivers  and  and implements a logical OR on the result of this logical AND function with the electrical output of fiber optic receiver . The digital signal output by second logic circuit  is coupled to an input of second drive circuit  which amplifies the digital signal and supplies it as a digital drive signal to a control terminal of second transistor . Third logic circuit  logically AND's the electrical output of fiber optic receivers  and . The digital signal output by third logic circuit  is coupled to an input of third drive circuit  which amplifies the digital signal and supplies it as a digital drive signal to a control terminal of third transistor .","The logical functions performed by logic circuits ,  and  can be performed by any suitable arrangement of logic gates. Hence, the simplified illustration of the logic function performed by each logic circuit ,  and  is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Similarly, the amplification functions performed by drive circuits ,  and  can be implemented in any suitable manner, such as a pair of transistors connected in a push-pull configuration and, therefore, the simplified illustration of an amplifier block in each drive circuit ,  and  is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Moreover, the descriptions of low level power supplies V, V, V and V (discussed hereinafter) as being separate power supplies and grounds COM, COM, COM and COM (discussed hereinafter) as being separate grounds are not to be construed as limiting the invention.","Fiber optic receivers ,  and  of control circuits ,  and , respectively, have optical inputs coupled to optical outputs of fiber optic transmitters ,  and , respectively. Fiber optic transmitters ,  and  receive electrical power from low level power supply V, the electrical return path of fiber optic transmitter  and the electrical return path of fiber optic transmitter , respectively. Fiber optic transmitter  also has its electrical return path connected to a ground COM of low level power supply V via the power terminals of a gate control transistor . Gate control transistor  has a control input coupled to receive a gate control signal from an external source (not shown). The operation of ripple gate drive circuit  will now be described.","Starting from a condition where transistors ,  and  are turned off, or not conducting, in response to gate control transistor  receiving the gate control signal, electrical current flows from low level power supply V COM via fiber optic transmitters  to  and gate control transistor . In response to this flow of electrical current, fiber optic transmitters  to  output optical signals to the optical inputs of fiber optic receivers ,  and , respectively. In response to these optical signals, fiber optic receivers ,  and  output corresponding electrical signals to logic circuits ,  and , respectively. Since first logic circuit  implements a logical OR function, in response to receiving the electrical signal from fiber optic receiver , first logic circuit  outputs a digital signal to first drive circuit . First drive circuit  amplifies this digital signal and outputs it as the digital drive signal to the control terminal of first transistor . In response to receiving this digital drive signal, first transistor  turns on, or commences conducting current.","In response to first transistor  conducting current, fiber optic transmitter  commences conducting current from low level power supply V COM via first transistor . In response to this flow of current, fiber optic transmitter  outputs an optical signal to the optical input of fiber optic receiver .","In response to receiving optical signals from fiber optic transmitters  and , fiber optic receivers  and , respectively, output corresponding electrical signals to the logical AND function of second logic circuit . In response to receiving these electrical signals, the logical AND function of second logic circuit  outputs a resultant logical AND signal to an input of the logical OR function of second logic circuit . It should be noted that the logical AND function of second logic circuit  delays the turn-on of second transistor  from the onset of the gate control signal until first transistor  turns on.","In response to receiving this logical AND signal, the logical OR function of second logic circuit  outputs a digital signal to second drive circuit . Second drive circuit  amplifies this digital signal and outputs it as the digital drive signal to second transistor . In response to receiving this digital drive signal, second transistor  turns on, or commences conducting current.","In response to second transistor  conducting current, fiber optic transmitters  and  commence conducting current from low level power supply V COM via second transistor . In response to this flow of current, fiber optic transmitters  and  output optical signals to inputs of fiber optic receivers  and  of third and first drive control circuits  and , respectively.","In response to receiving optical signals from fiber optic transmitters  and , fiber optic receivers  and  output electrical signals to the logical AND function of third logic circuit . In response to receiving these electrical signals, the logical AND function of third logical circuit  outputs a digital signal to an input of third drive circuit . Third drive circuit  amplifies this digital signal and outputs it as the digital drive signal to the control terminal of third transistor . In response to receiving this digital drive signal, third transistor  commences conducting current. It should be noted that the logical AND function of third logic circuit  delays the turn-on of third transistor  from the onset of the gate control signal until second transistor  is conducting.","In response to third transistor  conducting current, fiber optic transmitter  commences conducting current from low level power supply V COM via third transmitter . In response to this flow of current, fiber optic transmitter  outputs an optical signal to the input of fiber optic receiver . In response to this optical signal, fiber optic receiver  outputs an electrical signal to the logical OR function of second logic circuit  whereupon the turn-on of second transistor  is reinforced.","Thus, as can be seen, first, second and third transistors ,  and  turn on sequentially in a controlled manner to supply electrical power from power source Vto load L. The use of optical connections between control circuits ,  and  minimizes the delay in the sequential turning on of first, second and third transistors ,  and  from the onset of the gate control signal and avoids cross-talk between control circuits ,  and\/or .","At a suitable time, when it is desired to terminate the supply of electrical power to load L, the binary state of gate control signal changes whereupon gate control transistor  terminates conducting thereby causing fiber optic transmitters  to  to terminate conducting electrical current. In response to terminating this flow of electrical current, fiber optic transmitters  to  terminate supplying optical signals to the inputs of fiber optic receivers ,  and , respectively. In response to terminating the optical signal received by optic receiver , the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  changes state whereupon the logical AND function of third logic circuit  is not satisfied and the output of third logic circuit  changes state. In response to this change in state, third drive circuit  terminates the digital drive signal to the control terminal of third transistor  whereupon third transistor  turns off, or terminates conducting current. In response to third transistor  turning off, electrical current terminates flowing through fiber optic transmitter  whereupon fiber optic transmitter  turns off thereby terminating the optical signal output by fiber optic transmitter  to fiber optic receiver .","Recall that changing the state of the gate control signal terminates the optical signal output by fiber optic transmitter  to fiber optic receiver . In response to terminating this optical signal, the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  changes state whereupon the logical AND function of second logic circuit  is not satisfied and the logical AND signal output by the logical AND function of second logic circuit  changes state. In response to the change of state of the logical AND signal and the termination of the electrical signal output by fiber optic receiver , the logical OR signal output by second logic circuit  changes state. In response to the change in state of the logical OR signal, second drive circuit  terminates the digital drive signal to the control terminal of second transistor  whereupon second transistor  turns off, or terminates conducting current. As can be seen, the turning off of second transistor  from the termination, or change in state, of the gate control signal is delayed until third transistor  turns off.","In response to second transistor  turning off, electrical current terminates flowing through fiber optic transmitters  and  whereupon fiber optic transmitters  and  turn off thereby terminating the optical signals output by a fiber optic transmitter  and  to fiber optic receivers  and , respectively. In response to terminating the optical signal received by fiber optic receiver , the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  received by the logical AND function of third logic circuit  changes state thereby reinforcing the turn-off of third transistor .","In response to terminating the optical signal received by fiber optic receiver , the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  received by the logical OR function of first logic circuit  is terminated. Recall that changing the state of the gate control signal terminated the optical signal output by fiber optic transmitter  to fiber optic receiver . In response to terminating this optical signal, the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  is terminated. Since first logic circuit  implements a logical OR function, the termination of the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  in the presence of the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  does not terminate the digital drive signal supplied to first transistor  from first drive circuit . However, when the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  is terminated and the output of fiber optic receiver  changes state in response to terminating the optical signal output by fiber optic transmitter , the output of the logical OR function of first logic circuit  changes state whereupon the digital drive signal supplied to the control terminal of first transistor  terminates. In response to this termination, first transistor  turns off, or terminates conducting electrical current across its power terminals.","In response to first transistor  turning-off, the flow of electrical current through fiber optic transmitter  terminates. In response to terminating this electrical current, the optical signal received at the input of fiber optic receiver  from fiber optic transmitter  terminates whereupon the electrical output of fiber optic receiver  changes state thereby reinforcing the turn-off of second transistor .","Thus, as can be seen, in response to terminating the gate control signal, third transistor , second transistor  and first transistor  sequentially terminate conducting electrical current across the power terminals thereof in a controlled manner.","Similar ripple gate drive circuits can be constructed having more than three transistors. As in the three-transistor device, a control circuit is associated with each transistor. The first control circuit has a subsequent control circuit; each intervening control circuit has a preceding and a subsequent control circuit, and the final control circuit has a preceding control circuit.","The logic circuit of the first control circuit is responsive to the logical OR combination of the control signal and an optical signal received from the subsequent control circuit for controlling when the transistor associated with the first control circuit turns on and off. The logic circuit of each intervening control circuit is responsive to the logical AND combination of the control signal and an optical signal received from the previous control circuit. The logical AND combination is logically OR'ed with an optical signal received from the subsequent control circuit for controlling when the transistor associated with each intervening control circuit turns on and turns off. The logic circuit of the final control circuit is responsive to the logical AND combination of the control signal and an optical signal received from the previous control circuit for controlling when the transistor associated with the final control circuit turns on and turns off. The control circuits are responsive to a first state of the control signal for causing each transistor in series to turn on sequentially and responsive to a second state of the control signal for causing each transistor in series to tun off sequentially.","The present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment.
