{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to wireless networks and, more particularly, to a system and method for implementing coordinated resource allocations.","Distributed antenna systems consist of a base station (also known as a Radio Element Control or a Baseband Unit) and one or more remote transceivers (also known as Radio Elements or Remote Radio Heads). These components provide endpoints with wireless network access. To aid the distributed antenna system in distinguishing between the various wireless transmissions to and from the various endpoints, each endpoint may have one or more unique resource blocks assigned thereto. Each resource block may comprise a unique combination of a subcarrier or subcarriers and a time slot or time slots.","Within a distributed antenna system, the remote transceivers are distributed around different locations while being connected via a wired connection (e.g., optical fiber) to the base station. While there may be multiple remote transceivers, from the perspective of an endpoint there is only one entity, the base station. Each remote transceiver transmits essentially the same core data, and the endpoint combines multiple signals from multiple remote transceivers into a single communication.","The base station communicates with the remote transceivers using, for example, the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) standard. The CPRI standard allows in-phase\/quadrature (I\/Q) data to be transmitted from the base station to the remote transceivers. The remote transceivers use the I\/Q data to form the transmissions that are sent to any endpoints connected thereto. The remote transceivers are also able to communicate with the base station using the CPRI standard. This allows the remote transceivers to relay data received from the endpoints and to communicate control information, such as signal quality, to the base station.","In accordance with a particular embodiment, a method for implementing coordinated resource allocations includes establishing one or more connections between a first base station and one or more remote transceivers. The method also includes establishing one or more wireless connections with one or more endpoints via at least one of the one or more remote transceivers. The one or more wireless connections use a first channel. The method further includes determining a schedule that assigns a first number of resource blocks to each endpoint of the one or more endpoints. The method additionally includes receiving one or more neighboring transceiver schedules determined by one or more neighboring base stations. Each neighboring transceiver schedule indicating a different number of resource blocks assigned to each neighboring remote transceiver connected to the respective neighboring base station. The method also includes determining one or more time slots and one or more subcarriers within the first channel to assign to each resource block for each endpoint of the one or more endpoints based on the schedule and the one or more neighboring transceiver schedules. The method further includes determining a power distribution for each resource block for each endpoint of the one or more endpoints.","Technical advantages of particular embodiments may include increasing the uplink and downlink capacity of a distributed antennae system. Another technical advantage of particular embodiments may include using neighboring transceiver schedules when determining the time slots and subcarriers to assign to each endpoint. Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some or none of the enumerated advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","120","120","140","140","120","100"],"i":["d","c"]},"Base station  may also assign particular resource blocks to particular remote transceivers  for use in communicating with endpoints . The resource blocks may be assigned based on a locally determined schedule determining the number of resource blocks to assign to each endpoint and one or more neighboring transceiver schedules identifying the number of resource blocks neighboring base stations have assigned to each of their respective remote transceivers. In assigning the resource blocks, base station  may determine the time slots and\/or subcarriers that are to be individually assigned to endpoints . The resource blocks may be assigned so as to attempt to avoid causing interference with neighboring remote transceivers under the control of neighboring base stations. In certain embodiments, the assignment of resource blocks may involve a relatively low communication overhead (e.g., neighboring base stations may only communicate the number of resource blocks assigned to their remote transceivers and periodically send center point information) and a computationally efficient and easy to implement algorithm.","Distributed antenna system  may be coupled to network  via base station . Distributed antenna system  provides wireless coverage for endpoints  over a large geographic area. For example, a single base station (e.g., base station ) and a plurality of remote transceivers (e.g., remote transceivers ) may be used to provide wireless coverage for an entire building, a city block, a campus, or any other area. Because remote transceivers  are distributed over a geographical area, the distance between an endpoint and each remote transceiver  may be different. In particular embodiments, the signal quality between an endpoint and a remote transceiver may generally increase as the endpoint gets closer to the remote transceiver. Particular embodiments may take advantage of this increased signal quality by increasing the transmission power for the subcarriers associated with the signal having the better quality. Because a remote transceiver has a finite amount of transmission power, an increase in power for a particular subcarrier may be balanced by a corresponding decrease in power of another subcarrier.","In certain scenarios, a particular geographic area may be covered by multiple distributed antenna systems. For example, multiple base stations, each controlling their own respective set of remote transceivers, may be deployed to provide wireless service in large areas where the number of remote transceivers is more than a single base station can manage. In such a scenario, the wireless service provider operating distributed antenna system  may wish for the separate distributed antenna systems to use the same channel, or range of channels. Because each base station only controls the resources used by its own remote transceivers, there is a risk of interference from neighboring remote transceivers. Certain embodiments may attempt to mitigate this risk by assigning a remote transceiver block (\u201cRT block\u201d) of resources to each remote transceiver. The RT blocks may be shifted from a default center position based on the neighboring center points of neighboring remote transceivers to reduce the amount of overlapping resource blocks.","Depending on the embodiment, distributed antenna system  may use any of a variety of wireless technologies or protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.16m or 802.16e, or long term evolution (LTE)) for communications between remote transceivers  and endpoints . In certain instances, multiple remote transceivers  may appear to endpoints  as a single entity\u2014an extension of base station . The multiple remote transceivers  may attempt to send the same core data to endpoints  and may potentially receive the same data from endpoints . The differences in how the data is sent or received may be the result of the respective distances and\/or transmission power of each remote transceiver  to a particular endpoint.","Depending on the embodiment, distributed antenna system  may use any of a variety of different wired technologies or protocols (e.g., CPRI) for communications between remote transceivers  and base station . In particular embodiments, base station  may be configured to adjust the power, either directly (e.g., be incorporating the power distribution in the I\/Q samples that are sent to the remote transceivers) or indirectly (e.g., providing power distribution values to each remote transceiver from which the remote transceivers can determine their respective power distribution), that each remote transceiver applies to its transmissions. By selectively increasing or decreasing the transmission power for particular subcarriers (associated with particular endpoints) at particular remote transceivers, base station  may be able to more efficiently use the available wireless resources.","In certain embodiments, base station  may be configured to determine the number and location of resource blocks that are assigned to endpoints . The location of a resource block may refer to its subcarrier and time slot. For example, the available frequencies of one or more channels may be divided into a number of subcarriers and the amount of time per frame may be divided into a number of time slots. A resource block may comprise one or more of the divided subcarriers and one of the divided time slots. Thus, the location of a resource block may refer to the combination of its subcarrier and time slot. The resource blocks may be assigned in a manner to reduce the amount of interference. This assignment may be based, in part, on reducing the amount of overlapping resource blocks between remote transceivers  and neighboring remote transceivers. By assigning resources blocks in such a manner, base station  may be able to reduce the amount of interference and\/or increase the overall data throughput of wireless system .","Depending on the embodiment, base station  may use signal quality information from the various remote transceivers to determine the number of resource blocks to assign to each endpoint and\/or the power distribution for each subcarrier for each remote transceiver . The signal quality information may include the received uplink power strength, the maximal usable modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level, the Carrier to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (CINR) of the wireless connection. In particular embodiments, uplink sounding may be used to estimate the channel gain and interference strength between endpoints  and remote transceivers . In some embodiments, the signal strength may be used to determine the location of an endpoint within the coverage area of a particular remote transceiver.","Network  may be any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals, data, and\/or messages, including signals, data or messages transmitted through WebPages, e-mail, text chat, voice over IP (VoIP), and instant messaging. Network  may include one or more LANs, WANs, MANs, PSTNs, WiMAX networks, global distributed networks such as the Internet, Intranet, Extranet, or any other form of wireless or wired networking. Network  may use any of a variety of protocols for either wired or wireless communication.","Base station  may include any combination of hardware, software embedded in a computer readable medium, and\/or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored (e.g., firmware) to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for the wireless exchange of packets in distributed antenna system . Base station  may be configured to determine and distribute an allocation of resources (e.g., number and location of resources blocks and power allocation) to each remote transceiver . Depending on the embodiment, base station  may apply the power distribution to the data before it is sent to the remote transceivers for transmission or base station  may allow each remote transceiver  to individually apply the power distribution.","Remote transceivers  may include any combination of hardware, software embedded in a computer readable medium, and\/or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored (e.g., firmware) to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for the wireless exchange of packets with endpoints  in distributed antenna system . In some embodiments, remote transceivers  receive data from base station  that may already include the power distribution determinations made by base station . In particular embodiments, each remote transceiver  may adjust the transmission power of the core data received from base station . The adjustments may be made based on one or more control signals sent from base station  specifying the transmission power for each subcarrier, or plurality of subcarriers, at each respective remote transceiver . The one or more control signals may also be used to receive the resource block allocation.","Endpoints  may comprise any type of wireless device able to send and receive data and\/or signals to and from base station  via remote transceivers . Some possible types of endpoints  may include desktop computers, PDAs, cell phones, laptops, and\/or VoIP phones. Endpoints  may provide data or network services to a user through any combination of hardware, software embedded in a computer readable medium, and\/or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored (e.g., firmware). Endpoints  may also include unattended or automated systems, gateways, other intermediate components or other devices that can send or receive data and\/or signals.","The following example may help illustrate particular features of certain embodiments. For purposes of this example, assume that base station  only controls two remote transceivers, remote transceivers and . Further assume that endpoints and are both located in the area served by remote transceivers and . To simplify the scenario, assume that the scheduling algorithm at base station  allocates the same number of resource blocks in a frame to each of endpoints and . Further assume that the magnitude of the channel gain between remote transceiver and endpoint is twice that of remote transceiver and endpoint ; and that the magnitude of the channel gain between remote transceiver and endpoint is twice that of remote transceiver and endpoint . Then, based on these assumptions, base station  may allocate \u2154 of remote transceiver 's power to the subcarriers used by endpoint and \u2153 to the subcarriers used by endpoint (as opposed to the even \u00bd and \u00bd distribution of a standard distributed antenna system). Similarly, base station  may allocate \u2154 of remote transceiver 's power to the subcarriers used by endpoint and \u2153 to the subcarriers used by endpoint ","Although  illustrates a particular number and configuration of endpoints, connections, links, and nodes, distributed antenna system  contemplates any number or arrangement of such components for communicating data. In addition, elements of distributed antenna system  may include components centrally located (local) with respect to one another or distributed throughout distributed antenna system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"Distributed antenna system  includes base station  and remote transceivers .

Base station may comprise a processor (e.g., similar to processor ) that is able to make several different determinations based on the received signals from remote transceivers and . For example, the processor may be able to determine signal quality, interference levels, signal strength, and\/or any other parameters or features associated with the wireless connections between the endpoint and remote transceivers and . This information may be used, for example, to determine an efficiency of data transmission (e.g., the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) being used by the endpoint) and\/or data throughput. The data throughput may be used in determining the number of resource blocks to assign to the endpoint at each respective remote transceiver .","The signal information may also be used by the processor to determine a sector location of an endpoint. The sector location identifying within which sector  the endpoint is located. One way in which the sector location of an endpoint may be determined is by comparing the received signal strength (e.g., measured in dB) from an endpoint at, for example, remote transceivers , , and . For example, if the received signal strength at remote transceiver is much, much greater than the received signal strength at remote transceiver which is greater than the received signal strength at remote transceiver (e.g., >>>>), then the processor may determine that the endpoint is within sector . As another example, if the received signal strength at remote transceiver is greater than the received signal strength at remote transceiver which is greater than the received signal strength at remote transceiver (e.g., >>), the processor may determine that the endpoint is within sector . In some embodiments, the processor may use one or more threshold values to distinguish between signal strengths that are greater than; much greater than; and much, much greater than one another.","In some embodiments, the processor may calculate the difference in signal levels using an equation, such as, d=10*log(P\/P); where dis the difference in signal levels between a first remote transceiver and a second remote transceiver; Pis the signal level at the first remote transceiver and Pis the signal level at the second remote transceiver. Once the difference in signal levels has been determined for each relevant combination of remote transceivers for a particular endpoint, the difference in signal levels for the endpoint may be summed together and used to determine the location of the resource blocks assigned to that endpoint. For example, with respect to remote transceiver , the processor of base station may, for each endpoint connected thereto, determine the difference in the signal level received from the respective endpoint at remote transceiver compared with remote transceiver , and at remote transceiver compared with remote transceiver . The processor may then add together the resulting differences in signal levels for each endpoint. The resulting sum for each endpoint may be used to create an ordered list in which the first endpoint in the list has the highest total and the last endpoint in the list has the lowest total. The processor may then allocate resource blocks to the endpoints starting at the top of the sorted list. The processor may begin by allocating the resources blocks around the center point of the RT block associated with remote transceiver to the endpoints at the top of the list. As the processor works its way down the list, it may allocate resource blocks to the \u201cleft\u201d or the \u201cright\u201d of the center point based on the sector location of the corresponding endpoint.","In certain embodiments, the signal quality information may be stored in memory (e.g., similar to memory ) and may be used by the processor to determine a schedule. The schedule may assign a particular number of resource blocks to each endpoint at each respective remote transceiver. In some embodiments, such as where coverage map  is for an LTE wireless network, a resource block may comprise twelve subcarriers and a timeslot having a duration of 0.5 ms. The resource blocks may be assigned to ensure that each endpoint receives an adequate number of resources. The number of resource blocks assigned to each endpoint may vary depending on the number of endpoints, the relative signal qualities associated with the endpoints, policies being used by the respective base station  (e.g., resource fare or rate fare), the size of the licensed channel available to base station  and\/or any other factors (e.g., a QoS level subscribed to by the endpoint) used in determining the number of resource blocks to assign to a particular endpoint.

In some instances, a less precise general location may be used to determine the coverage area within which an endpoint is located. Based on the determined coverage area within which an endpoint is located and the number of resource blocks assigned to the endpoint, base station may be able to determine the number of resource blocks being used by remote transceivers , , and .

Intercell interference may most likely occur where overlapping resource blocks are being used by two adjacent remote transceivers (e.g., remote transceivers and ) that are controlled by two different base stations (e.g., base stations and ). When base station is assigning resource blocks to remote transceiver , base station may recognize that there may be a greater likelihood of interference caused by remote transceivers , , , and because these remote transceivers are adjacent to remote transceiver . Accordingly, the processor of base station may attempt to assign the locations of resource blocks for remote transceiver so as to minimize the amount of overlap with the resource blocks assigned to the neighboring remote transceivers .","In certain instances, the resource blocks assigned to a particular remote transceiver, such as remote transceiver , may be arranged as an RT block.

The shift amount may be based on the neighboring center points of the neighboring RT blocks.","In some embodiments, base station may estimate the center points of the neighboring RT blocks assigned to neighboring remote transceivers. In some scenarios, the neighboring center points may be estimated based on historical center point information received from the neighboring base stations . The historical center point information may be received less frequently than the information regarding the number of resource blocks assigned to neighboring remote transceivers. In certain embodiments, the historical center point information may comprise an average center point associated with the neighboring RT blocks.

For example, endpoints in sector may be assigned resource blocks that do not overlap with the resource blocks assigned to the endpoints within the coverage area of remote transceiver ","Once the location (subcarriers and time slots) of the resource blocks have been determined, the processor of base station may determine the allocation of power to different subcarriers at remote transceivers , , and may be determined based on channel response information associated with each endpoint at each respective remote transceiver , , and . In particular embodiments, base station may allocate more power to the resource blocks for those endpoints having better channel quality at a particular remote transceiver . Depending on the embodiment, there may be at least three components used to determine channel response: path loss, shadowing, and multipath. In contrast with shadowing and multipath effects (which are often random processes) path loss is the most dominant component in the channel response. Path loss may be a function of the distance between an endpoint and a remote transceiver. The closer an endpoint is to a particular remote transceiver, the higher the channel gain is between the endpoint and the remote transceiver. In a distributed antenna system, the varying distances between an endpoint and each remote transceiver  may result in varying path losses and channel gains between remote transceivers  and a particular endpoint.","In particular embodiments, the closer an endpoint is to a remote transceiver, the greater the power that will be allocated to the subcarriers associated with the endpoint. Conversely, the farther an endpoint is from a remote transceiver, the less power that will be allocated to subcarriers associated with the endpoint. This may allow each remote transceiver  to more efficiently use their available transmission power. The non-uniform power distribution to different subcarriers could enhance the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the endpoint by increasing the received signal strength from the closer remote transceivers  while the loss of signal strength due to the reduced power from a more distant remote transceiver may be insignificant.","In particular embodiments, remote transceivers , , and may measure the average received power of the subcarriers allocated to the endpoints coupled thereto. This information may then be delivered to base station over a CPRI control channel via wired connections , , and . Base station may use the measured uplink power to approximate the downlink channel response between remote transceiver , , and and the respective endpoints. This estimation may be used by base station to determine the power distribution which base station  may then send to remote transceivers  using the CPRI control channel via wired connections , , and ","In some embodiments, remote transceivers , , and may send their own respective I\/Q data along with I\/Q data received from the upstream remote transceiver. Base station may use the individual I\/Q samples to estimate the received downlink power at the endpoint (e.g., it may be proportional to the determined uplink power). Using this estimated power, base station may determine and apply an amount of amplification or attenuation to the download signal. This may be done without adjusting the phase of the download signal.

Depending on the embodiment and\/scenario, base station could use any of a variety of strategies to apply power distribution. For example, base station may use a strategy similar to maximum ratio combination (MRC).

The wireless connections are established via one or more of the plurality of remote transceivers. As indicated above, the wireless connections may be within the first channel. The first channel may comprise a particular range of licensed frequencies. The first channel may also comprise frames having a known length of time. The licensed frequency of the first channel may be divided into subcarriers and the length of time of each frame may be divided into timeslots. In general, the combination of a subcarrier and a timeslot may be referred to as a resource block, and the particular subcarrier and timeslot of a particular resource block may be referred to as a location of the particular resource block. Thus, determining a location of a resource block may refer to determining the subcarrier and timeslot of the resource block.","While each endpoint, from its perspective, may have established a single wireless connection with a single base station, each endpoint may actually be sending and receiving communications from a number of remote transceivers. When an endpoint receives multiple wireless signals from multiple remote transceivers, it may perform various techniques for deriving the core data from the wireless signals. For example, in some embodiments an endpoint may combine two or more wireless signals from two or more remote transceivers (each wireless signal comprising the same core data).","At step , a schedule assigning a first number of resource blocks to each endpoint is determined. The greater the number of resource blocks assigned to a particular endpoint, the greater the data throughput for that respective endpoint. In certain embodiments, the number of resource blocks assigned to each endpoint may vary between the different remote transceivers connected to the base station. The number of resource blocks assigned to a particular endpoint may be based on a balance between providing the endpoint with a particular service level, while maintaining a particular service level for the remaining endpoints connected to the base station via the remote transceivers. This balancing act may be done based on one or more of a variety of policies such as resource fare policies or rate fare policies. In some embodiments, different endpoints may be provisioned differently than other endpoints. For example, if a customer has paid for a higher quality of service, the corresponding endpoint may receive a greater number of resource blocks than would be assigned if the customer had only paid for a standard or lower quality of service.","In certain embodiments, the base station may receive signal quality indications from which the base station may be able to determine the relative quality, strength, and\/or efficiency of a wireless connection. This information may be used in determining the number of resource blocks to assign to a particular endpoint.","At step , the number of resource blocks assigned to each remote transceiver is determined. The number of resource blocks assigned to each remote transceiver may be determined based on the general location of the endpoints and the schedule determined at step . For purposes of the step , the general location may be less precise than, for example the sector location (e.g. determined at step ). For example, the general location may identify the coverage area within which the respective endpoint is located. The general location of the endpoints may be used to determine which coverage areas of which remote transceivers the endpoints are within. Using the schedule, the base station may be able to determine the number of resource blocks that are assigned to each remote transceiver based on which endpoints are within the coverage area of which remote transceivers. The number of resource blocks assigned to each remote transceiver, when added together, will equal the total number of resource blocks available in the first channel. The number of resource blocks determined at step  and  may be determined without any scheduling information from neighboring base stations.","At step , information based on the determined schedule is transmitted to one or more neighboring base stations. The overhead associated with transmitting the information to neighboring base stations may be reduced by only sending the information to neighboring base stations with remote transceivers that directly border, or are adjacent to, the remote transceivers controlled by the transmitting base station. In certain embodiments, the transmitted information may comprise the number of resource blocks assigned to each remote transceiver, as determined at step .","At step , the base station may receive neighboring transceiver schedules determined by neighboring base stations. The neighboring transceiver schedule may comprise information indicative of the number of resource blocks that have been assigned to a particular remote transceiver. The received neighboring transceiver schedule may be received from the same neighboring base stations to which the current base station transmitted the information based on its determined schedule.","At step , one or more center points are determined. In particular embodiments, each center point may correspond to a center of the remote transceiver resource block assigned to each remote transceiver within the first channel. Each remote transceiver resource block may be based on the number of resource blocks assigned to the endpoints connected to the respective remote transceiver. For example, if the first channel comprises 24 resource blocks, and the resource blocks are assigned evenly between three remote transceivers (e.g., each remote transceiver is assigned 8 resource blocks), then the first center point, associated with the first remote transceiver, may be between the 4th and 5th resource block, the second center point, associated with the second remote transceiver, may be between the 12th and 13th resource block, and the third center point, associated with the third remote transceiver, may be between the 20th and 21st resource block.","At step , the neighboring center point for neighboring remote transceivers is determined. In some embodiments the neighboring center points may be determined based on the neighboring transceiver schedules. In particular embodiments, the neighboring center points for neighboring remote transceivers may be determined from the actual center points used by neighboring remote transceivers. For example, neighboring base stations may periodically transmit an average center point based on previous center points used for their remote transceiver resource blocks. The neighboring center point information may be received less frequently than the neighboring transceiver schedules. In some embodiments, the neighboring center points for neighboring remote transceivers may be determined from a combination of previously used center points and the number of resource blocks assigned to each neighboring remote transceiver as indicated in the received neighboring transceiver schedules.","At step , the center points of the local remote transceiver blocks are shifted. The amount of shift may be based on a combination of the locally determined center point (step ) along with the determined neighbor center point for neighboring remote transceivers (step ). Shifting the center points may help to reduce the amount of overlapping resource blocks used between neighboring remote transceivers. This may reduce the amount of interference created between neighboring remote transceivers.","At step , the location of each endpoint is determined. The location of each endpoint may be determined through any of a variety of different means. For example, endpoint locations may be determined through GPS, triangulation, simple lexical comparison, pre-measurement, or a combination of the above. Simple lexical comparison may determine the location of a particular endpoint by comparing the signal strength from the particular endpoint at each of the remote transceivers. A comparison of the relative signal strength may be used by the base station to determine a sector within the coverage area of a particular remote transceiver within which the endpoint is located.","At step , timeslots and subcarriers to be assigned to each resource block for each endpoint are determined. The assigned subcarrier and timeslot for a resource block may generally be referred to as the location of the resource block. In certain embodiments, the location of the resource blocks may be based in part on the location of an endpoint. For example, if an endpoint is determined to be located within a sector that is adjacent to a neighboring remote transceiver, then the base station may attempt to assign resource blocks that do not overlap with the resource blocks used by the neighboring remote transceiver. The location of the resource blocks for a particular endpoint at a particular remote transceiver may be based on the shifted center point of the respective local RT block determined at step .","In some embodiments, the resource blocks may be assigned based on a difference in signal levels determined using an equation, such as, d=10*log(P\/P); where dis the difference in signal levels between a first remote transceiver and a second remote transceiver; Pis the signal level at the first remote transceiver and Pis the signal level at the second remote transceiver. Once the difference in signal levels has been determined for each relevant combination of remote transceivers for a particular endpoint, the difference in signal levels for the endpoint may be summed together and used to determine the location of the resource blocks assigned to that endpoint. For example, the sum may be used to sort the endpoint in an ordered list comprising the plurality of endpoints. The list may be sorted such that the first endpoint in the list has the highest total difference in signal levels and the last endpoint in the list has the lowest total. Resource blocks may then be allocated to the endpoints, the resource blocks closest to the shifted center point (step ) may be allocated to the endpoint at the top of the sorted list, and each endpoint further down the list may be allocated resource blocks that are progressively farther away from the shifted center point. Whether the allocated resource blocks are to the \u201cleft\u201d or the \u201cright\u201d of the shifted center point may depend on the sector location of the corresponding endpoint.","At step , a power distribution for each resource block for each endpoint is determined. The power distribution may be such that different resource blocks for different endpoints at different remote transceivers are assigned different transmission powers based on the distance between the endpoint and the remote transceiver. The power distribution may be based, at least in part, on the signal quality between the remote transceivers and the endpoint. The power distribution may indicate the amount of amplification each remote transceiver is to use when transmitting wireless communications to each of the endpoints. In certain embodiments, the better (e.g., stronger, clearer, more efficient) a wireless signal is between a remote transceiver and an endpoint, the greater the amount of power the remote transceiver will use to communicate with the endpoint; conversely the worse a wireless signal is, the less power the remote transceiver will use to communicate with the endpoint.","In certain embodiments, once the base station has made its determination for how each remote transceiver is to allocate power among the plurality of endpoints, the base station may apply the power distribution to the data before it is sent to the remote transceivers for transmission to the endpoint. In some embodiments the power distribution may be communicated to the remote transceivers and the remote transceivers may apply the amplification to the data.","At step , the center point, after the shift determined at step , is transmitted to neighboring base stations. The shifted center point may be transmitted on a much less frequent basis than the frequency with which the information based on the schedule is transmitted at step . For example, steps  through  may be repeated several times between each execution of step . The shifted center point may be transmitted so that neighboring base stations may be able to estimate the position of the center point of the local base station. In some instances, the transmitted shifted center point may be an average of multiple shifted center points.","Some of the steps illustrated in  may be combined, modified or deleted where appropriate, and additional steps may also be added to the flowchart.
