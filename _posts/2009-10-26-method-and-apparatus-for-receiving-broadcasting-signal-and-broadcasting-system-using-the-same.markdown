Moreover, connection between the broadcast receiving apparatus  and the display apparatus  is not limited to the cable type. The broadcast receiving apparatus  and the display apparatus  may be connected over a wireless network using local area wireless communication such as zigbee communication, bluetooth communication and Wlan communication.","According to an embodiment, the image of a broadcasting channel and the image of a data broadcasting service that are selected by a user may be simultaneously displayed on one screen in the display apparatus . For this, the broadcast receiving apparatus  may combine the image signal of a broadcasting channel that is received from the broadcast transmitting apparatus  with application data that are received from the data server , process the broadcasting signal and the application data so as to be displayed on one screen, and output the processed signal and data to the display apparatus .","Moreover, the application data that are received from the data server  may be for displaying a banner image, which is used for an advertisement, in the display apparatus . For example, the application data may be the Java Xlet application for displaying text-based banner advertisements on the screen of the broadcasting channel, in the display apparatus .","In order for the broadcast receiving apparatus  receive the application data for the data broadcasting service from the data server  without changing a broadcasting channel that is currently being viewed, the application data may be transmitted to the broadcast receiving apparatus  through a dedicated data channel independent of the broadcasting channels.","That is, the broadcast transmitting apparatus  allocates an external broadcasting signal to a plurality of preset broadcasting channels and transmits the allocated signal to the broadcast receiving apparatus . The data server  transmits the application data to the broadcast receiving apparatus  through the separate dedicated data channel independent of the broadcasting channels. Therefore, the broadcast receiving apparatus  may simultaneously receive the application data for the data broadcasting and the broadcasting signal of a broadcasting channel that a user is currently viewing.","Accordingly, the user requests a data broadcasting service while viewing a selected broadcasting channel, and thus, it may use the data broadcasting service that is provided by the data server  of the head end apparatus  while continuously viewing the broadcasting channel without the change of a broadcasting channel.","In , the broadcast receiving apparatus  is included as a separate apparatus in the outside of the display apparatus . According to another embodiment, however, the broadcast receiving apparatus  may be included in the inside of the display apparatus  and be implemented as one set.","According to an embodiment, the broadcasting system in  may be used for providing a data broadcasting service in limited spaces such as hotels and hospitals, for example, a specific building.","Hereinafter, a general broadcasting service using external broadcasting signals and a hotel broadcasting system that provides a data broadcasting service in hotels will be exemplified as an embodiment.","That is, the broadcast receiving apparatus  and the display apparatus  may be disposed in the guest rooms of hotels. The head end apparatus  may receive broadcasting signals from the outside over satellites or cables, and transmit application data for data broadcasting of hotels and the received broadcasting signal to a plurality of broadcast receiving apparatuses  that are disposed in the guest rooms.","According to an embodiment, the data broadcasting service in hotels may be a service that provides specific information to users by using banners. For example, the data broadcasting service may be a service for displaying both advertisement sentences or information to be provided to the guests in hotels and the images of a broadcasting panel in a banner type on a screen.","Moreover, the data broadcasting service in hotels may include various services, for example, Pay Per View (PPV) services, room services, hotel-related information services, reservation services, checkout information services, entertainment services and game services, that may be provided in hotels, other than the banner advertisement service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","111","112","120","121"]},"Referring to , the first and second broadcasting transmission units  and  may receive different kinds of contents from the outside, and more specifically, may receive broadcasting signals from different broadcasting providers or receive broadcasting signals over different communication networks.","For example, the first broadcasting transmission unit  may receive broadcasting signals, including content that is provided to the users of hotels without pay, from the outside and transmit the received signal to the broadcast receiving apparatus . The first broadcasting transmission unit  may include a converter and a transcoder for processing the received broadcasting signal.","Moreover, the first broadcast transmitting apparatus  may include an encryption unit and a modulator for processing broadcasting signals that are provided from a specific broadcasting provider (for example, a broadcasting provider for providing pay content).","The second broadcasting transmission unit  may receive external broadcasting signals including content that is provided to users with pay and transmit the received signal to the broadcast receiving apparatus .
