The inherent scale and orientation at which these active pixels are described is determined automatically. A local description of the pixels may be formed using one or more of median filterbank descriptors, shape descriptors, edge flow descriptors, spectral descriptors, mutual information, or local texture descriptors. One embodiment of the system provides a framework that allows computation of these descriptors at multiple scales. In addition, supervised learning and classification can be used to obtain a prediction for each pixel for each class of lesion or retinal anatomical structure, such as optic nerve head, veins, arteries, and\/or fovea. A joint segmentation-recognition method can be used to recognize and localize the lesions and retinal structures. In one embodiment of the system, this lesion information is further processed to generate a prediction score indicating the severity of retinopathy in the patient, which provides context determining potential further operations such as clinical referral or recommendations for the next screening date. In another embodiment of the system, the automated detection of retinal image lesions is performed using images obtained from prior and current visits of the same patient. These images may be registered using the disclosed system. This registration allows for the alignment of images such that the anatomical structures overlap, and for the automated quantification of changes to the lesions. In addition, system may compute quantities including, but not limited to, appearance and disappearance rates of lesions (such as microaneurysms), and quantification of changes in number, area, perimeter, location, distance from fovea, or distance from optic nerve head. These quantities can be used as image-based biomarker for monitoring progression, early detection, or evaluating efficacy of treatment, among many other uses.","Retinal diseases in humans can be manifestations of different physiological or pathological conditions such as diabetes that causes diabetic retinopathy, cytomegalovirus that causes retinitis in immune-system compromised patients with HIV\/AIDS, intraocular pressure buildup that results in optic neuropathy leading to glaucoma, age-related degeneration of macula seen in seniors, and so forth. Of late, improved longevity and \u201cstationary\u201d, stress-filled lifestyles have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of patients suffering from these vision threatening conditions. There is an urgent need for a large-scale improvement in the way in which these diseases are screened, diagnosed, and treated.","Diabetes mellitus (DM), in particular, is a chronic disease which impairs the body's ability to metabolize glucose. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes, in which damaged retinal blood vessels become leaky or occluded, leading to vision loss. Clinical trials have demonstrated that early detection and treatment of DR can reduce vision loss by 90%. Despite its preventable nature, DR is the leading cause of blindness in the adult working age population. Technologies that allow early screening of diabetic patients who are likely to progress rapidly would greatly help reduce the toll taken by this blinding eye disease. This is especially important because DR progresses without much pain or discomfort until the patient suffers actual vision loss, at which point it is often too late for effective treatment. Worldwide, 371 million people suffer from diabetes and this number is expected to grow to half a billion by 2030. The current clinical guideline is to recommend annual DR screening for everyone diagnosed with diabetes. However, the majority of diabetics do not get their annual screening, for many reasons, including lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of insurance, or lack of education. Even if the patients have knowledge and experience, the number of clinicians screening for DR is an order of magnitude less than that required to screen the current diabetic population. This is as true for first world countries, including America and Europe, as it is for the developing world. The exponentially growing need for DR screening can be met effectively by a computer-aided DR screening system, provided it is robust, scalable, and fast.","For effective DR screening of diabetics, telescreening programs are being implemented worldwide. These programs use fundus photography, using a fundus camera typically deployed at a primary care facility where the diabetic patients normally go for monitoring and treatment. Such telemedicine programs significantly help in expanding the DR screening, but are still limited by the need for human grading, of the fundus photographs, which is typically performed at a reading center.","Methods and systems are disclosed that provide automated image analysis allowing detection, screening, and\/or monitoring of retinal abnormalities, including diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, cytomegalovirus retinitis, and hypertensive retinopathy.","In some embodiments, the methods and systems can be used to conduct automated screening of patients with one or more retinal diseases. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by first identifying interesting regions in an image of a patient's eye for further analysis, followed by computation of a plurality of descriptors of interesting pixels identified within the image. In this embodiment, these descriptors are used for training a machine learning algorithm, such as support vector machine, deep learning, neural network, naive Bayes, and\/or k-nearest neighbor. In one embodiment, these classification methods are used to generate decision statistics for each pixel, and histograms for these pixel-level decision statistics are used to train another classifier, such as one of those mentioned above, to allow screening of one or more images of the patient's eye. In one embodiment, a dictionary of descriptor sets are formed using a clustering method, such as k-means, and this dictionary is used to form a histogram of codewords for an image. In one embodiment, the histogram descriptors are combined with the decision statistics histogram descriptors before training image-level, eye-level, and\/or encounter-level classifiers. In one embodiment, multiple classifiers are each trained for specific lesion types and\/or for different diseases. A score for a particular element can be generated by computing the distance of the given element from the classification boundary. In one embodiment, the screening system is further included in a telemedicine system, and the screening score is presented to a user of the telemedicine system.","The methods and systems can also be used to conduct automated identification and localization of lesions related to retinal diseases, including but not limited to diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, or cytomegalovirus retinitis.","The methods and systems can also be used to compute biomarkers for retinal diseases based on images taken at different time intervals, for example, approximately once every year or about six months. In one embodiment, the images of a patient's eye from different visits are co-registered. The use of a lesion localization module allows for the detection of lesions as well as a quantification of changes in the patient's lesions over time, which is used as an image-based biomarker.","The methods and systems can also be used to conduct co-registration of retinal images. In one embodiment, these images could be of different fields of the eye, and in another embodiment these images could have been taken at different times.","The methods and systems can also be used to enhance images to make it easier to visualize the lesions by a human observer or for analysis by an automated image analysis system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["19000","19001","19010","19014","19004","19008","19106","19001"]},"The systems and methods disclosed herein include an automated screening system that processes automated image analysis algorithms that can automatically evaluate fundus photographs to triage patients with signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other eye diseases.

At these numbers, it is recognized that automation is not simply a cost-cutting measure to save the time spent by the ophthalmologists, but rather it is the only realistic way to screen such large, growing, patient population.","The critical need for computerized retinal image screening has resulted in numerous academic and a few commercial efforts at addressing the problem of identifying and triaging patients with retinal diseases using automatic analysis of fundus photographs. For successful deployment, automated screening systems may include one or more of the following features:","i. High Sensitivity at a Reasonably High Specificity","For automated telescreening to gain acceptance among clinicians and administrators, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity should be high enough to match trained human graders, though not necessarily retina experts. Studies suggest that sensitivity of 85%, with high enough specificity, is a good target but other sensitivity levels may be acceptable.","ii. Invariance to the Training Data","Many prior approaches work by using algorithms that learn, directly or indirectly, from a set of examples of already graded fundus images. This training data could have a key influence on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm. An algorithm whose behavior varies significantly between datasets is not preferred in some embodiments. Instead, in some embodiments, the computerized screening algorithm performs well on cross-dataset testing, that is, the algorithm generalizes well, when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Hence, what is sometimes desired is a system that can generalize in a robust fashion, performing well in a cross-dataset testing scenario.","iii. Robustness Against Varying Conditions","In a deployed setup, an algorithm does not have control over the make or model of the camera, the illumination, the skill-level of the technician, or the size of the patient's pupil. Hence, in some embodiments, a computerized retinal disease screening system is configured to work in varying imaging conditions.","iv. Scalability to Massive Screening Setups:","In some embodiments, a screening system processes and grades large, growing databases of patient images. The speed at which the algorithm performs grading can be important. In addition, testing time for a new image to be screened remains constant even as the database grows, such that it does not take longer to screen a new test image as the database size increases as more patients are screened. What is sometimes desired is a method that takes a constant time to evaluate a new set of patient images even as the database size grows.","v. Interoperability with Existing Systems and Software:","In some embodiments, the system does not disrupt the existing workflow that users are currently used to. This means that the system inter-operates with a variety of existing software. What is sometimes desired is a system that can be flexibly incorporated into existing software and devices.","Customized methods for low-level description of medical image characteristics that can lead to accuracy improvement is another potential feature. Furthermore, approaches that leverage information such as local scale and orientation within local image regions in medical images, leading to greater accuracy in lesion detection could also provide many benefits.","In addition, the availability of an effective biomarker, a measurable quantity that correlates with the clinical progression of the disease and greatly enhances the clinical care available to the patients. It could also positively impact drug research, facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies. It will be a greatly added benefit if the biomarker is based only on images, which would lead to non-invasive and inexpensive techniques. Because retinal vascular changes often reflect or mimic changes in other end organs, such as the kidney or the heart, the biomarker may also prove to be a valuable assay of the overall systemic vascular state of a patient with diabetes.","Lesion dynamics, such as microaneurysm (MA) turnover, have received less attention from academia or industry. Thus, a system that improves the lesion detection and localization accuracy could be beneficial. Furthermore, a system and method for computation of changes in retinal image lesions over successive visits would also be of value by leading to a variety of image-based biomarkers that could help monitor the progression of diseases.","Certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the systems and methods have been and are described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages or features may be achieved in accordance with any particular embodiment. Thus, for example, those skilled in the art will recognize that the systems and methods may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves one advantage\/feature or group of advantages\/features as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages\/features as may be taught or suggested herein.","In some embodiments, the systems and methods provide for various features of automated low-level image processing, which may include image enhancement or image-level processing blocks.","A. Image Enhancement","In some embodiments, the system may also make it easier for a human or an automated system to evaluate a retinal image and to visualize and quantify retinal abnormalities. Retinal fundus images can be acquired from a wide variety of cameras, under varying amounts of illumination, by different technicians, and on different people. From an image processing point of view, these images have different colors levels, different dynamic ranges, and different sensor noise levels. This makes it difficult for a system to operate on these images using the same parameters. Human image graders or experts may also find it a hindrance that the images often look very different overall. Therefore, in some embodiments, the image enhancement process applies filters on the images to enhance them in such a way that their appearance is neutralized. After this image enhancement processing, the enhanced images can be processed by the same algorithms using identical or substantially similar parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["29000","29016","29002","29004","29202","19014","19004","19008","29004","19014","19004","19008","29000","29006","29008","29008","29204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0137"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["19014","19004","19008","100","800","100","802","106"]},"In one embodiment, the images are first subjected to an edge-preserving bilateral filter such as the filter disclosed in Carlo Tomasi and Roberto Manduchi, \u201cBilateral Filtering for Gray and Color Images,\u201d in 1998, 1998, 839-846; and Ben Weiss, \u201cFast Median and Bilateral Filtering,\u201d in (TOG), vol. 25, 2006, 519-526.

Image-Level Processing","1. Image-Level Fundus Mask Generation","Typically, retinal fundus photographs have a central circular region of the eye visible, with a dark border surrounding it. Sometimes information pertaining to the patient, or the field number may also be embedded in the corners of the photograph. For retinal image analysis, these border regions of the photograph do not provide any useful information and therefore it is desirable to ignore them. In one embodiment, border regions of the retinal photographs are automatically identified using morphological filtering operations as described below.","In one embodiment, the input image is first blurred using a median filter. A binary mask is then generated by thresholding this image so that locations with pixel intensity values above a certain threshold are set to 1 in the mask, while other areas are set to 0. The threshold is empirically chosen so as to nullify the pixel intensity variations in the border regions, so that they go to 0 during thresholding. In one embodiment, this threshold is automatically estimated. The binary mask is then subjected to region dilation and erosion morphological operations, to obtain the final mask. In one embodiment, the median filter uses a radius of 5 pixels, and, the threshold for binary mask generation is 15 for an 8-bit image with pixel values ranging from [0,255], though other radii and thresholds can be used. The dilation and erosion operations can be performed using rectangular structuring elements, such as, for example, size 10 and 20 pixels respectively.  and  show two different retinal image types, and  and  show embodiments of fundus masks for these two images generated using the above described embodiment.","2. Optic Nerve Head Detection","In some embodiments, it may be beneficial to detect the optic nerve heard (ONH) within a retinal image. A ONH can be robustly detected using an approach that mirrors the one for lesions as described in section below entitled \u201cLesion Localization\u201d. In another embodiment, multi-resolution decomposition and template matching is employed for ONH localization.","In one embodiment, the ONH localization is performed on a full resolution retinal fundus image, or a resized version of the image, or the image (full or resized) processed using one or more morphological filters that can be chosen from minimum filter or maximum filter, dilation filter, morphological wavelet filter, or the like. An approximate location of the ONH is first estimated in the horizontal direction by filtering horizontal strips of the image whose height is equal to the typical ONH diameter and width is equal to the image width, with a filter kernel of size approximately equal to the typical ONH size. The filter kernel can be: a circle of specific radius, square of specific side and orientation, Gaussian of specific sigmas (that is, standard deviations), ellipse of specific orientation and axes, rectangle of specific orientation and sides, or a regular polygon of specific side. The filtered image strips are converted to a one-dimensional signal by collating the data along the vertical dimension by averaging or taking the maximum or minimum or the like. The largest N local maxima of the one-dimensional signal whose spatial locations are considerably apart are considered as likely horizontal locations of the ONH since the ONH is expected to be a bright region. In a similar fashion, the vertical position of the ONH is approximated by examining vertical image strips centered about the N approximate horizontal positions. This ONH position approximation technique produces M approximate locations for the ONH.","In one embodiment, the approximate sizes or radii of the possible ONHs can be estimated by using a segmentation algorithm such as the marker-controlled watershed algorithm. In one embodiment the markers are placed based on the knowledge of the fundus mask and approximate ONH location. In another embodiment, typical ONH sizes or radii can also be used as approximate ONH sizes or radii.","In one embodiment, these approximate locations and sizes for the ONH can be refined by performing template matching in a neighborhood about these approximate ONH locations and choosing the one location and size that gives the maximum confidence or probability of ONH presence.","In another embodiment, the ONH position can be estimated as the vertex of the parabola approximation to the major vascular arch.","3. Image Size Standardization","Different retinal fundus cameras capture images at varying resolutions and field of view. In order to process these different resolution images using the other blocks, in one embodiment the images are standardized by scaling them to have identical or near identical pixel pitch. The pixel pitch is computed using the resolution of the image and field of view information from the metadata. In one embodiment, if a field of view information is absent, then the pixel pitch is estimated by measuring the optic nerve head (ONH) size in the image as described in the section above entitled \u201cOptic Nerve Head Detection.\u201d In one embodiment, an average ONH size of 2 mm can be used. The image at the end of size standardization is referred to as I. The fundus mask is generated for Iand can be used for further processing. In another embodiment, the diameter of the fundus mask is used as a standard quantity for the pitch. The diameter may be calculated as described in the section above entitled \u201cImage-Level Fundus Mask Generation\u201d or in the section below entitled \u201cEncounter-Level Fundus Mask Generation.\u201d","4. Noise Removal","Fundus images usually have visible sensor noise that can potentially hamper lesion localization or detection. In order to reduce the effect of noise while preserving lesion and vessel structures, in one embodiment a bilateral filter may be used, such as, for example, the filter disclosed in Tomasi and Manduchi, \u201cBilateral Filtering for Gray and Color Images\u201d, and Weiss, \u201cFast Median and Bilateral Filtering.\u201d Bilateral filtering is a normalized convolution operation in which the weighting for each pixel p is determined by the spatial distance from the center pixel s, as well as its relative difference in intensity.

These images will have certain similar characteristics that can be utilized for various tasks, such as image segmentation, detection, or analysis. However, the images possibly may have different fields of view or illumination conditions.","In particular, medical or retinal images captured during a patient visit are often captured using the same imaging set-up. The set of these images is termed an \u201cencounter\u201d of that patient on that date.

Encounter-Level Fundus Mask Generation","Many medical images such as those acquired using ultrasound equipment and those of the retina have useful information only in a portion of the rectangular image. In particular, most retinal fundus photographs have a central circle-like region of the eye visible, with the remainder of the photograph being dark. Information pertaining to the patient or the field number may be embedded in the regions of the photograph that do not contain useful image information. Therefore, before analysis of such photographs, it is desirable to identify regions of the photographs with useful image information using computer-aided processes and algorithms. One benefit of such identification is that it reduces the chances of false positives in the border regions. Additionally, this identification can reduce the analysis complexity and time for these images since a subset of pixels in the photographs is to be processed and analyzed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0160"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 1"],"b":["19014","19004","19008","74802","74804","74806","74808","74810","74812"],"sup":["(1)","(2) ","(N)"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0161"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","sup":["(1),r","(2),r ","(N),r "],"b":["74814","74816","74818","74818","74820","74824","74822","74828","74826"]},"In particular, for retinal images, prior techniques to determine fundus masks include processing one retinal image at a time, which are based on thresholding the pixel intensities in the retinal image. Although these image-level fundus mask generation algorithms may be accurate for some retinal fundus photographs, they could fail for photographs that have dark fundus regions, such as those shown in . The failure of the image-level fundus mask generation algorithm as in  and  is primarily due to the pixel intensity thresholding operation that discards dark regions that have low pixel intensities in the images shown in  and .","The drawbacks of image-level fundus mask generation can be overcome by computing a fundus mask using multiple images in an encounter, that is a given visit of a given patient. For example, three or more images in an encounter may be used if the images in the encounter have been captured using the same imaging hardware and settings and hence have the same fundus mask. Therefore, the encounter-level fundus mask computed using data from multiple images in an encounter will be more robust for low pixel intensities in the regions with useful image information.","Embodiments of encounter-level fundus masks generated using multiple images within an encounter are shown in , J, K, and L. It can be noted that in , pixels with low intensity values that are within the fundus regions are correctly identified by the encounter-level fundus mask shown in , unlike in the image-level fundus masks shown in .","In one embodiment, the fundus mask generation algorithm validates that the images in an encounter share the same fundus mask by computing the image-level fundus masks and ensuring that the two masks obtained differ in less than, for example, 10% of the total number of pixels in each image by logically \u201cAND\u201d-ing and \u201cOR\u201d-ing the individual image-level fundus masks. If the assumption is not validated, the image-level fundus masks are used and the encounter-level fundus masks are not calculated. Median values of absolute differences that are close to zero can be identified by hysteresis thresholding, for example by using techniques disclosed in John Canny, \u201cA Computational Approach to Edge Detection,\u201d no. 6 (1986): 679-698. In one embodiment, the upper threshold is set to \u22122, and the lower threshold is set to \u22123, such that medians of the pixel values are determined to be small if they are less than 15, the same value used for thresholding pixel values during image-level fundus mask generation.","2. Lens Or Sensor Dust And Blemish Artifact Detection","Dust and blemishes in the lens or sensor of an imaging device manifest as artifacts in the images captured using that device. In medical images, these dust and blemish artifacts can be mistaken to be pathological manifestations. In particular, in retinal images, the dust and blemish artifacts can be mistaken for lesions by both human readers and image analysis algorithms. However, detecting these artifacts using individual images is difficult since the artifacts might be indistinguishable from other structures in the image. Moreover, since images in an encounter are often captured using the same imaging device and settings, the blemish artifacts in these images will be co-located and similar looking. Therefore, it can be beneficial to detect the dust and blemish artifacts using multiple images within an encounter. Image artifacts due to dust and blemishes on the lens or in the sensor are termed as lens dust artifacts for simplicity and brevity, since they can be detected using similar techniques within the framework described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0168"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 1"],"b":["19014","19004","19008","92300","92304","92302","92306","92310","92308"]},"Additional information about embodiments of each of these blocks of the lens dust detection algorithm is discussed below. In one embodiment, lens dust detection is disabled if there are fewer than three images in the encounter, since in such a case, the lens dust artifacts detected may not be reliable. Moreover, the lens dust detection uses the red and blue channels of the photographs since vessels and other retinal structures are most visible in the green channel and can accidentally align in small regions and be misconstrued as lens dust artifacts. The lens dust artifacts are detected using multiple images in the encounter as described below and indicated by a binary lens dust mask which has true values at pixels most likely due to lens dust artifacts.","In one embodiment, noise may be removed from the images in the encounter using the algorithm described in the section above entitled \u201cNoise Removal\u201d.

This approach may lead to better screening performance. Blobs can be ranked based on the determinant of Hessian score. Only the top M blobs per scale based on this determinant of Hessian based ranking are preserved in the interest region mask. Alternatively, a blob contrast number can be used to rank the blobs, where the contrast number is generated by computing mean, maximum, or median of intensity of each pixel within the blob, or by using a contrast measure including but not limited to Michelson contrast. The top M blobs per scale based on this contrast ranking are preserved in the interest region mask. Alternatively, at each scale, the union of the top M blobs based on contrast ranking and the top N blobs based on determinant of Hessian based ranking can be used to generate the interest region mask. Blobs that were elongated potentially belong to vessels and can be explicitly excluded from this mask. Blobs might be approximately circular or elongated. Approximately circular blobs may often represent lesions. Elongated blobs represent vasculature. The top blobs are retained at each scale and this is used to generate the Pmask. The resultant Pis then used to pick the detected pixels.

Local Region Descriptors","The pixels or the local image regions flagged as interesting by the method described above in the section entitled \u201cInterest Region Detection,\u201d can be described using a number or a vector of numbers that form the local region \u201cdescriptor\u201d. In one embodiment, these descriptors are generated by computing two morphologically filtered images with the morphological filter computed over geometric-shaped local regions (such as a structuring element as typically used in morphological analysis) of two different shapes or sizes and taking the difference between these two morphological filtered images. This embodiment produces one number (scalar) describing the information in each pixel. By computing such scalar descriptors using morphological filter structural elements at different orientations and\/or image scales, and stacking them into a vector, oriented morphological descriptors and\/or multi-scale morphological descriptors can be obtained. In one embodiment, a median filter is used as the morphological filter to obtain oriented median descriptors, and multi-scale median descriptors. In another embodiment, multiple additional types of local descriptors can be computed alongside the median and\/or oriented median descriptors.","As part of the automated generation of descriptors, in one embodiment, the first geometric shape is either a circle or a regular polygon and the second geometric shape is an elongated structure with a specified aspect ratio and orientation, and the system is configured to generate a vector of numbers, the generation comprising: varying an orientation angle of the elongated structure and obtaining a number each for each orientation angle; and stacking the obtained numbers into a vector of numbers.","In another embodiment, the number or the vectors of numbers can be computed on a multitude of images obtained by progressively scaling up and\/or down the original input image with a fixed scaling factor referred to as multi-scale analysis, and stacking the obtained vector of numbers into a single larger vector of numbers referred to as multi-scale descriptors.","These local region descriptors can be tailored to suit specific image processing and analysis applications such as, for example:\n\n","A.

Image-to-image registration includes automated alignment of various structures of an image with another image of the same object possibly taken at a different time or different angle, different zoom, or a different field of imaging, where different regions are imaged with a small overlap. When applied to retinal images, registration can include identification of different structures in the retinal images that can be used as landmarks. It is desirable that these structures are consistently identified in the longitudinal images for the registration to be reliable. The input retinal images (Source image I, Destination image I) can be split into two parts:\n\n","Landmarks are detected at the constant regions and are matched using different features.

By examining for blobs across multiple scales at locations with high vesselness, locations that are promising keypoints for registration can be extracted. In one embodiment, vesselness map is hysteresis thresholded with the high and low thresholds set at 90 and 85 percentiles respectively for the given image. These thresholds may be chosen based on percentage of pixels that are found to be vessel pixels on an average. The resulting binary map after removing objects with areas smaller than a predefined threshold, chosen, for example, based on the smallest section of vessels that are to be preserved, V, is used as a mask for potential keypoint locations. For example, 1000 pixels are used as the threshold in one embodiment, a value chosen based on the smallest section of vessels to be preserved.","In one embodiment, the fundus image can be smoothed with Gaussian filters of varying sigma, or standard deviation. In one implementation, the range of sigmas, or standard deviations, can be chosen based on vessel widths. For example, sigmas (\u03c3) of 10, 13, 20 and 35 pixels can be used to locate vessel branches at different scales. Scale normalized determinant of Hessian can be computed at pixel locations labeled by V thresh at each of these scales. In one embodiment, local peaks in the determinant of Hessian map, evaluated with the minimum distance between the peaks, for example, D=1+(\u03c3\u22120.8)\/0.3, are chosen as keypoints for matching.","The local image features used as descriptors in some embodiments are listed below.

In one embodiment, Euclidean distance is used to measure similarity of keypoints. In one embodiment, brute-force matching is used get the best or nearly best matches. In one embodiment, matches that are significantly better than the second best or nearly best match are preserved. The ratio of the distance between the best possible match and the second best or nearly best possible match is set to greater than 0.9 for these preserved matches. In one embodiment, the matches are then sorted based on the computed distance. The top M matches can be used for model parameter search using, for example, the RANSAC algorithm. In one embodiment, M can be 120 matches.","2. Model Estimation Using RANSAC","Some embodiments pertain to the estimation of the model for image to image registration. The RANSAC method can be used to estimate a model in the presence of outliers. This method is helpful even in situations where many data points are outliers, which might be the case for some keypoint matching methods used for registration. Some embodiments disclose a framework for model estimation for medical imaging. However, the disclosed embodiments are not limited thereto and can be used in other imaging applications.","The RANSAC method can include the following actions performed iteratively (hypothesize-and-test framework).\n\n","These two actions can be performed iteratively until the probability of finding a better CS drops below a threshold. The model that gives the largest cardinality for the CS can be taken to be the solution. The model can be re-estimated using the points of the CS. The RANSAC method used can perform one or more of the following optimizations to help improve the accuracy of estimation, and efficiency of computation, in terms of number of the iterations.\n\n","The random selection of points for building the MSS could result in degenerate cases from which the model cannot be reliably estimated. For example, homography computation might use four Cartesian points (k=4), but if three of the four points are collinear, then the model may not be reliably estimated. These degenerate samples can be discarded. Checks performed during image registration to validate the MSS can prevent or minimize the occurrence of three or more of collinear chosen points, as well as allowing the three points to be at a certain distance from each other to obtain good spatial distribution over the image.","3. Image Registration Models","Other processes for obtaining retinal image registration can be used. Customizations usable with the RANSAC method in order to compute the models are also provided.","A point on an image can be denoted as a 2D vector of pixel coordinates [x y]\u03b5. It can also be represented using homogeneous coordinates as a 3D vector [wx wy w]in projective space where all vectors that differ only by a scale are considered equivalent. Hence the projective space can be represented as =\u2212[0 0 0]. The augmented vector [x y 1]can be derived by dividing the vector components of the homogeneous vector by the last element w. The registration models can be discussed using this coordinate notation, with [x y 1], the point in the original image, and [x\u2032 y\u2032 1], the point in the \u201cregistered\u201d image.","The rotation-scaling-translation (RST) model can handle scaling by a factor s, rotation by an angle \u03c6, and translation by [tt].

Image Warping","An aspect of the image registration module may involve warping of the image to the coordinate system of the base image.  shows examples of source and destination images that are registered, warped, and overlaid on each other. In one embodiment, the computed registration models can be used to transform the pixel locations from the original image to the registered image. When transformation is applied directly, the integer pixel locations in the input image can map to non-integer pixel locations in the registered image, resulting in \u201choles\u201d in the registered image, for example, when the registered image dimensions are larger than that of the input image. The \u201choles\u201d can be filled by interpolating the transformed pixels in the registered image. Alternatively, inverse transform can be used to map registered pixel locations to the input image. For pixels that land at integer locations after inverse mapping, the intensity values can be copied from the input image, while the intensity values at non-integer pixels in input image can be obtained by interpolation.","The above approach can be applied to the invertible registration models such as RST, affine, or homography. If the non-invertible quadratic model is used, a forward transform Tcan be used to build a mapping of the integer pixel locations in the input image to the registered image. To find the pixel intensity at an integer location in the registered image, the forward mapping can be checked for any input location maps to the registered location under consideration. If such a mapping exists, the intensity value is copied. In the absence of such a value, the n-connected pixel locations in an m\u00d7m neighborhood around the registered pixel can be checked. In one embodiment, n is 8 and m is 3. In one embodiment, the closest n pixels in the input image are found, and the pixel intensity at their centroid location is interpolated to obtain the intensity value at the required pixel location. This analysis may be helpful when pixels in a neighborhood in the input image stay in almost the same relative positions even in the registered image for retinal image registration. In another embodiment, the estimated quadratic model can be used to compute the forward mapping, swapping the input and registered pixel locations, and estimating the inverse mapping {circumflex over (T)}using least squares can be used to compute the forward mapping. A mapping can be applied to the integer locations in the registered image to generate the corresponding mapping from the input image.","In some embodiments, automated image assessment can be implemented using one or more features of the automated low-level image processing, and\/or image registration techniques described above; however, using these techniques is not mandatory nor necessary in every embodiment of automated image assessment.","A. Lens Shot Image Classification","Typically multiple images of the fundus from various fields and both eyes are collected from a patient during a visit. In addition to the color fundus images, photographs of the patient's eye's lens may also be added to the patient encounter images, as illustrated in . In one embodiment, an automated DR screening system automatically and reliably separates these lens shot images from the actual color fundus images.","In one embodiment, lens shot image classification is achieved by primarily using structural and color descriptors. A given image is resized to a predetermined size. The histogram of orientations (HoG) feature is computed on the green channel to capture the structure of the image. The vesselness maps for images are computed, using for example the processes disclosed in the section below entitled \u201cVessel Extraction\u201d. The vesselness maps are hysteresis thresholded with the lower and higher thresholds set, for example, to 90 and 95 percentiles respectively to obtain a mask. The color histograms of the pixels within the mask are computed. The final descriptor is obtained by appending the color histogram descriptors to the HoG descriptors.","The order in which the images were obtained is also sometimes an indicator of an image being a lens shot image. This was encoded as a binary vector indicating absolute value of the difference between the image index and half the number of images in an encounter.","On a dataset of 10,104 images with over 2000 lens shot images on 50-50 train-test splits area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUROC) of over 0.998 were obtained.","B. Image Quality Assessment","1. General Description","In one embodiment, the system may include computer-aided assessment of the quality or gradability of an image. Assessment of image gradability or image quality can be important to an automated screening system. The factors that reduce quality of an image may include, for example, poor focus, blurred image due to eye or patient movement, large saturated and\/or under-exposed regions, or high noise. In addition, the quality of image can be highly subjective. In the context of retinal image analysis, \u201cimage characteristics that allow for effective screening of retinopathy by a human grader or software\u201d are preferred, whereas images with hazy media are flagged as being of insufficient quality for effective grading. Quality assessment can allow the clinician to determine whether he needs to immediately reimage the eye or refer the patient to a clinician depending on the screening setup employed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0264"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["179000","179016","179002","179004","179010","179014","179004","179008","179014","179004","179008","179004","179000","179006","179008","179012"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0235","num":"0265"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"],"b":["179014","179004","179008","602","600"]},"In one embodiment, the images are first processed using a Hessian based interest region and \u201cvesselness\u201d map detection technique as shown in .

This is illustrated for an example color fundus image, shown in  as grayscale, with the red channel, shown in  as grayscale, the green channel, shown in  as grayscale, and the blue channel, shown in  as grayscale.

Nakagawa, \u201cShape from Focus,\u201d 16, no. 8 (1994): 824-831. For the input image I, the sum-modified Laplacian Iat a pixel location (x, y) can be computed as\n\n()=|2()\u2212(1,)\u2212(1,)|+|2()\u2212(1)\u2212(1)|\n","A normalized histogram can be computed over the sum-modified Laplacian values in the image to be used as focus measure descriptor. In practice, Ivalues that are too low, or too high may be unstable for reliably measuring focus in retinal images and can be discarded before the histogram computation. In one embodiment, the low and high thresholds are set to 2.5 and 20.5 respectively, which was empirically found to give good results. The computed descriptor has a length of 20. In practice, computing the focus descriptors on the image obtained after enhancement and additional bilateral filtering provides better gradability assessment results.","b. Saturation Measure Descriptors","In one embodiment, the local saturation measure captures the pixels that have been correctly exposed in a neighborhood, by ignoring pixels that have been under-exposed or over-exposed. The correctly exposed pixels are determined by generating a binary mask M using two empirically estimated thresholds, Sfor determining under-exposed pixels and Sfor determining over-exposed pixels.

In another embodiment, regression analysis is conducted to obtain a number or value representing image quality. One or more quality descriptors discussed above are extracted and concatenated to get a single N-dimensional descriptor vector for the image. It is then subjected to dimensionality reduction, new dimension, M, using principal component analysis (PCA) to consolidate the redundancy among the feature vector components, thereby making quality assessment more robust. The PCA may include techniques disclosed in Herv\u00e9 Abdi and Lynne J. Williams, \u201cPrincipal Component Analysis,\u201d 2, no. 4 (2010): 433-459.

In another embodiment a support vector classifier (SVC) is trained to classify poor quality images from fair or adequate quality images. On the 125 image dataset, the adequate and fair quality images were classified from the poor quality images with accuracy of 87.5%, with an area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.90. Further improvements are expected with the incorporation of texture descriptors. In one embodiment, the descriptor vector has a length of N=140, which gets reduced to M=\u250cN\/8\u2510 after PCA. In another embodiment, the entire descriptor vector is used, without the PCA reduction, to train a support vector classifier to distinguish poor quality images from good quality ones.

The regions with high certainty of including lesions in I, as expressed by the decision statistics computed over the pixels, are labeled. In one embodiment, these regions are then matched with corresponding regions in Iwith a tolerance, for example, as specified by maximum pixel displacement which may be due to registration errors using decision statistics. In one embodiment, regions with matches to the labeled lesions with high confidence are then considered to be persistent lesions, and labeled regions with no matches are considered to be disappeared lesions. Newly appearing lesions can be found by labeling image Iand comparing those regions to corresponding regions in Ito identify newly appearing lesions.","b. Increased Reliability and Accuracy In Turnover Computation","Some factors can confound lesion turnover computation such as MA turnover computation, variation in input images, errors in image alignment, or errors in MA detection and localization. Some errors can cascade and cause the MA turnover computed to be drastically different from the actual value, which could be a failure for the tool. In some embodiments, a system that gracefully degrades when faced with the above confounding factors is desirable. At each stage, rather than making a binary decision, the probability that a blob is classified as an MA or the probability that two blobs are marked as matched MAs and hence persistent is estimated. As noted above, a blob includes a group of pixels with common local image properties and chosen by the interest region detector.  shows a patch of retina with microaneurysms.  shows the ground truth labelling for microaneurysms in the image patch shown in .  shows the detected MAs marked by disks with the corresponding confidence levels indicated by the brightness of the disk. An estimated range for MA turnover is computed rather than a single number. A larger range may represent some uncertainty in the turnover computation, nevertheless it can provide the clinician with useful diagnostic information. In one embodiment, one or more of the following is performed when confounding factors are present.\n\n","iii. Robust persistent microaneurysm classification: Probabilities can be used to represent the classification of a given blob into microaneurysm or otherwise. Persistent MAs are marked in the ground truth representation and will describe pairs of blobs with the histogram decision statistics of the pixels in the blobs along with similarity of the blobs. The labeled persistent MAs can be used to train a SVM classifier. Given a pair of putative blobs in the neighborhood after local registration refinement, the probability that these blobs are a persistent MA pair is computed.","As shown in embodiments of , the range for turnover numbers is then assessed from the blob level probabilities and persistent MA pair probabilities using thresholds identified from the ground truth.","F.

If a given encounter does not have the required number of adequate\/good quality images then the patient is flagged to be re-imaged.","3. Ways Of Creating Encounter-Level Decisions","a. Merging image-level primary descriptors","Encounter-level descriptors can be obtained by combining image-level primary descriptors, many of which are described in the sections above entitled \u201cProcessing That Can Be Used To Locate The Lesions.\u201d and \u201cFeatures that can be used for this type of automatic detection\u201d. In one embodiment, the image level descriptors include one or more types from:\n\n","In one embodiment, the encounter-level descriptors can be evaluated as the maximum value across all the image level descriptors for the images that belong to an encounter or created by concatenating eye level descriptors. In one embodiment, the computation of encounter-level descriptors for the images of the patient visit (encounter) is achieved using a method comprising (i) combining image-level descriptors to form either the image field-of-view, specific descriptors (identified from metadata or by using position of ONH as described in the section above entitled \u201cOptic Nerve Head Detection\u201d or by using the position of the ONH and macula) or eye-specific descriptors (identified from metadata or position of ONH and macula or the vector from the focus to the vertex of the parabola that approximates the major vascular arch) using operations such as maximum, average, minimum or the like, and (ii) concatenating the field-specific or eye-specific descriptors into the encounter level descriptors. These encounter-level descriptors can then be classified, for example, using classifiers described in the section below entitled \u201cDiabetic Retinopathy Screening\u201d to obtain the encounter-level decisions. Combination of image level descriptors to form encounter level descriptors is discussed in further detail in section \u201cMulti-Level Descriptors For Screening\u201d.","b. Merging Image-Level Decision Statistics","Encounter-level decisions can also be made by combining image-level decision statistics histograms using average, maximum, and minimum operations, or the like.","Methods, systems and techniques described can also be used to automate screening for various medical conditions or diseases, which can help reduce the backlog of medical images that need to be screened.

Ensemble Classifiers","In one embodiment, ensemble classifiers are employed, which are a set of classifiers whose individual predictions are combined in a way that provides more accurate classification than the individual classifiers that make them up. In one embodiment, a technique called stacking is used, where an ensemble of classifiers, at base level, are generated by applying different learning algorithms to a single dataset, and then stacked by learning a combining method. Their good performance is proved by the two top performers at the Netflix competition using, for example, techniques disclosed in Joseph Sill et al., -, arXiv e-print, Nov. 3, 2009. The individual weak classifiers, at the base level, may be learned by using algorithms such as decision tree learning, na\u00efve Bayes, SVM, or multi response linear regression. Then, at the meta level, effective multiple-response model trees are used for stacking these classifier responses.","d. Deep Learning","In another embodiment, the system employs biologically plausible, deep artificial neural network architectures, which have matched human performance on challenging problems such as recognition of handwritten digits, including, for example, techniques disclosed in Dan Cirean, Ueli Meier, and Juergen Schmidhuber, -, arXiv e-print, Feb. 13, 2012. In other embodiments, traffic signs, or speech recognition are employed, using, for example, techniques disclosed in M. D. Zeiler et al., \u201cOn Rectified Linear Units for Speech Processing,\u201d 2013. Unlike shallow architectures, for example, SVM, deep learning is not affected by the curse of dimensionality and can effectively handle large descriptors. In one embodiment, the system uses convolution networks, sometimes referred to as cony-nets, based classifiers, which are deep architectures that have been shown to generalize well for visual inputs.","B. Types Of Diseases","1. Diabetic Retinopathy Screening","a. General description","In one embodiment, the system allows screening of patients to identify signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR). A similar system can be applied for screening of other retinal diseases such as macular degeneration, hypertensive retinopathy, retinopathy or prematurity, glaucoma, as well as many others.","When detecting DR, two DR detection scenarios are often of interest: (i) detecting any signs of DR, even for example a single microaneurysm (MA) since the lesions are often the first signs of retinopathy or (ii) detecting DR onset as defined by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Control and Group, that is, the presence of at least three MAs or the presence of any other DR lesions. The publicly available Messidor dataset, which contains 1200 retinal images that have been manually graded for DR and clinically significant macular edema (CSME), can be used for testing the system. In one embodiment, the screening system, when testing for this Messidor dataset, uses >5MAs or >0 Hemorrhages (HMs) as criteria for detecting DR onset. For both of the detection scenarios, the goal is to quantify working on cross-dataset testing, training on a completely different data, or on a 50-50 test-train split of the dataset.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0389","num":"0427"},"figref":["FIG. 38","FIG. 1"],"b":["19014","19004","19008","100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114"]},"In one embodiment, two approaches can be used in the system: one for the 50-50 train\/test split and the other for the cross-dataset testing with training on one dataset and testing on another. One embodiment uses the Messidor dataset and the DEI dataset (kindly provided by Doheny Eye Institute) which comprises 100 field 2 images with four lesions diligently annotated pixel-wise (MA, HM, EX and CW), and 125 field 2 images with MAs marked. When using the system on these datasets, the annotations performed precisely, often verifying the annotations using the corresponding fluorescein angiography (FA) images. This precise annotation sets high standards for the automated lesion localization algorithms, especially at lesion-level.","b. Features that can be Used for Automatic Detection","i. Description With Dictionary Of Primary Descriptors","In this embodiment, a dictionary of low-level features is computed by unsupervised learning of interesting datasets, referred to as codewords. The dictionary may be computed by technology disclosed in J. Sivic and A. Zisserman, \u201cVideo Google: A Text Retrieval Approach to Object Matching in Videos,\u201d in 9, 2003, 1470-1477. Then an image is represented using a bag of words description, for example a histogram of codewords found in the image. This may be performed by finding the codeword that is closest to the descriptor under consideration. The descriptors for an image are processed in this manner and contribute to the histogram.","A 50-50 split implies that training is done with half the dataset and testing is done on the other half. The computation of the dictionary can be an offline process that happens once before the system or method is deployed. In one embodiment, the unsupervised learning dataset is augmented with descriptors from lesions. In an example implementation, the descriptors from lesions locations annotated on the DEI dataset are used. For this example implementation, the total number of descriptors computed is Nand N, for DEI and Messidor datasets, respectively. Then N\u2248mN, where m\u22671.0 can be any real number, with each Messidor training image contributing equally to the Ndescriptor count. In one embodiment, m is set to 1 and in another embodiment it is set to 5. The random sampling of interesting locations allows signatures from non-lesion areas to be captured. The computed N+Ndescriptors are pooled together and clustered into K partitions using K-means clustering, the centroids of which give K-codewords representing the dictionary. The K-means clustering may be performed using techniques disclosed in James MacQueen, \u201cSome Methods for Classification and Analysis of Multivariate Observations,\u201d in , vol. 1, 1967, 14.","After the dictionary computation, the bag of words based (BOW) secondary descriptors are computed. In one embodiment, for each image, the lesion descriptors  are computed. Using vector quantization, each descriptor is assigned a corresponding codeword from the previously computed dictionary. The vector quantization may be performed using techniques disclosed in Allen Gersho and Robert M. Gray, (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1992). This assignment can be based on which centroid or codeword is closest in terms of Euclidean distance to the descriptor. A normalized K-bin histogram is then computed representing the frequency of codeword occurrences in the image. The histogram computation does not need to retain any information regarding the location of the original descriptor and therefore the process is referred to as \u201cbagging\u201d of codewords. These descriptors are referred to as bag of words (BOW) descriptors.","Table 5 is comparison of embodiments of the screening methods.

This is done to scale down the impact of codewords that occur very frequently in a given dataset and that are empirically less informative than codewords that occur in a small fraction of the training dataset, which might be the case with \u201clesion\u201d codewords. In some embodiments, the inverse document frequency (idf) computation is done using the BOW descriptors of the training dataset images. In addition, during computation of document frequency, a document may be considered if the raw codeword frequency in it is above a certain threshold T. The tf-idf weighting factors computed on training dataset are stored and reused on the BOW descriptors computed on the images in the test split of Messidor dataset during testing.","In one embodiment, the system adds a histogram of the decision statistics (for example, the distance from classifier boundaries) for pixel level MA and HM classifiers.

Cytomegalovirus Screening","a. General Description","Cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) is a treatable infection of the retina affecting HIV and AIDS patients, and is a leading cause of blindness in many developing countries. In one embodiment, methods and systems for screening of Cytomegalovirus retinitis using retinal fundus photographs is described. Visual inspection of the images from CMVR patients reveals that, images with CMVR typically have large sub-foveal irregular patches of retinal necrosis appearing as a white, fluffy lesion with overlying retinal hemorrhages as seen in . These lesions have severely degraded image quality, for example, focus, contrast, normal color, when compared with images of normal retina, as shown in . A system which can effectively capture and flag the degradation in image quality can be used to screen for CMVR. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the image quality descriptors are adapted to the problem of CMVR screening, providing a new use of the image quality descriptors described herein.","b. Features that can be Used for this Type of Automatic Detection","In one embodiment, the image analysis engine automatically processes the images and extracts novel quality descriptors, using, for example, the process described in the section above entitled \u201cLens Shot Image Classification\u201d. These descriptors are then subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. They can then be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in a 5-fold cross-validation framework, using images that have been pre-graded for Cytomegalovirus retinitis by experts, for example, into two categories: normal retina, and retina with CMVR. In one embodiment, images graded by experts at UCSF and Chiang Mai University Medical Centre, Thailand are employed. The system produces a result of refer for a patient image from category retina with CMVR, and no refer for a patient image from category normal retina.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0410","num":"0448"},"figref":["FIG. 42","FIG. 1"],"b":["19014","19004","19008","100","100","106","108","110","900"]},"One embodiment was tested using 211 images graded for CMVR, by randomly splitting them into 40 different training-testing datasets. In each split, 75% of the images were used for training and the other 25% were reserved for testing. As expected, the lesion degraded, poor quality images were flagged to be positive for CMVR by the system with an average accuracy of 85%, where average area under ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.93. For many of the images, the presence of large out-of-focus, blurry, or over-\/under-exposed regions, such as shown in , F for example, resulted in the degradation of image quality causing the experts to be unsure about the presence or absence of CMVR during screening. These images, marked with category cannot determine, were excluded from the above experiments. By choosing an SVM classifier that produces an ROC curve with an AUROC close to the average of 0.93 obtained during the 40 experiments, an additional 29 images from the cannot determine category were tested. None of these images were included during training phase. The system recommended that 27 of 29 images (patients) be referred, which is acceptable given that experts too did not have consensus on CMVR status of those two images.","In one embodiment, the quality of the image is first analyzed using a \u201cgradability assessment\u201d module. This module will flag blurry, saturated or under exposed images to be of poor quality and unsuitable for reliable screening. The actual CMVR screening would then be performed on images that have passed this quality module. Both system could use the same descriptors, but one can use a support vector regressor engine trained to assess quality, and the other a support vector classifier trained to screen for CMVR. In another embodiment, additional descriptors are included, such as texture, color layout, and\/or other descriptors to the CMVR screening setup to help distinguish the lesions better.","3.

Processing On The Cloud","Image processing and analysis can be performed on the cloud, including by using systems or computing devices in the cloud. Large-scale retinal image processing and analysis may not be feasible on normal desktop computers or mobile devices. Producing results in near constant time irrespective of the size of the input dataset is possible if the retinal image analysis solutions are to be scaled. This section describes the retinal image acquisition and analysis systems and methods according to some embodiments, as well as the cloud infrastructure used to implement those systems and methods.","1. Acquisition And Analysis Workflow",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0439","num":"0486"},"figref":"FIG. 44"},"In an embodiment of cloud-based operation, the patient  image refers to the retinal data, single or multidimensional, captured from the patient using a retinal imaging device, such as cameras for color image capture, fluorescein angiography (FA), adaptive optics, optical coherence tomography (OCT), hyperspectral imaging, scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), wide-field imaging or ultra-wide-field imaging. The acquired images are stored on the local computer or computing device , or mobile device  and then transmitted to a central data center . Operators at the data center can then use traditional server-based or computing device-based , desktop-based , or mobile-based  clients to push these images to the cloud  for further analysis and processing. The cloud infrastructure generates patient-level diagnostic reports which can trickle back to the patients, for example, through the same pipeline, in reverse.","In another embodiment of cloud-based operation, the imaging setup can communicate with the cloud, as indicated by dotted lines in . The images can be pushed to the cloud following acquisition. The diagnostic results are then obtained from the cloud, typically within minutes, enabling the clinicians or ophthalmologists to discuss the results with the patients during their imaging visit. It also enables seamless re-imaging in cases where conclusive results could not be obtained using the initial images.","In another embodiment of cloud-based operation, data centers store images from thousands of patients . The data, for example, may have been collected as part of a clinical study for either disease research or discovery of drugs or treatments. The patient images may have been acquired, in preparation for the study, and then pushed to the cloud for batch-processing. The images could also be part of routine clinical workflow where the analysis is carried out in batch mode for several patients. The cloud infrastructure can be scaled to accommodate the large number of patient encounters and perform retinal analysis on the encounters. The results can be presented to the researchers in a collated fashion enabling effective statistical analysis for the study.","2. Image Analysis On The Cloud",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0444","num":"0491"},"figref":"FIG. 45","b":["19014","459500","459004","459008","459016"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0028","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0028-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0029","list-style":"none"},"li":["First, the client logs-in to the web-server  and requests credentials for using the cloud infrastructure. Following this authorization action, the client can access the various components of the cloud infrastructure.","During authorization, the client can send the number of encounters or images it plans to process in a run. Based on this number, the web-server initializes the components of the cloud, for example,","Input  and output  message queues: These queues are fast, reliable and scalable message queuing services which act as an interface between client and the cloud. Messages in input queue indicate which encounters are ready for analysis, while those in output queue indicate which encounters have been analyzed on the cloud.","Cloud storage : Can comprise a distributed network of hard disks (magnetic or solid-state), concurrently accessible via high-bandwidth connections to the worker machines. They can provide high security features, such as data encryption and firewalls, to guard against unauthorized access. They can also provide reliability, by, for example, redundant data storage across the network, against hardware and data failures allowing for disaster recovery.","Auto scaling group : Can comprise of a group of worker machines or computing devices which can process the images in an encounter. For example, each worker machine  can comprise of 32 or more, multi-core, 64-bit processors with high computing power and access to high-speed random access memory (RAM). The number of worker machines in the group is automatically scaled, that is, new machines are created or old ones terminated, depending on the cloud metrics.","Worker machine image : Software that powers each worker machine. New machines created 459418 can be loaded with a machine image to transform them into worker machines ","Cloud metrics : Component that monitors the number of encounters being processed by the existing machines, the number of encounters waiting to be processed in the input queue, and the current load on the worker machines. Auto scaling group uses this information to scale the number of worker machines.","After authorization, the client can perform some preliminary processing of the retinal images, which may include resizing or image enhancement.","The pre-processed images from an encounter are then uploaded to cloud storage, a corresponding encounter entry, which may contain image metadata, is made in the database , and a message object is pushed to the input message queue to let the worker machines know that the encounter is ready for processing. In batch-processing mode, the images are pushed to the cloud in multiple software threads for faster uploads. After pushing the messages to the input queue, the client polls the output message queue for encounters that have been processed.","Once started, the worker machines poll the input message queue in anticipation of encounters to process. Once a message appears in the queue, they delete the message, access the database entry corresponding to that encounter, and download the images for that encounter to local memory. They then start processing and analyzing the images for retinal diseases. Each worker machine, can process multiple images or encounters simultaneously depending on the number of processor cores it has. During processing, the worker machines can save intermediate data to the cloud storage. Depending on the load each machine is handling and the number of messages, or encounters, waiting to be processed in the input message queue, the auto scaling component  can automatically start new worker machines, load the required machine image, and initialize them to start pulling messages from the input queue and to start processing the encounters. The auto scaling component can also terminate machines if it thinks that computing power is left idle, in view of the volume of the new messages in the input queue.","After processing the images from an encounter, the worker process writes necessary data or images back to cloud storage, updates the corresponding encounter entry in the database with diagnostic results, and pushes a message to the output queue to let the client know that an encounter has been processed. If an error occurs during processing of an encounter, the encounter updates the database encounter entry indicating the error, and re-pushes the message back to the input queue, for another worker process to process the encounter. However, if the message has been re-pushed more than a couple of times, indicating that the encounter data itself has some problem, the worker process can delete the message from the input queue and push it to the output queue after updating the corresponding database entry.","Once a message appears in the output queue, the client deletes it from the queue and accesses the corresponding entry in the database to know the analysis results, or errors, if any, for an encounter. The results are then formatted and presented to the client. In batch-processing mode, the results for the encounters in the run can be collated into a spreadsheet for subsequent analysis by the client."]}}}},"3. Use Of Amazon Web Services","In one embodiment, the cloud operation described above has been implemented using Amazon Web Services\u2122 infrastructure, and the cloud storage is implemented using Simple Storage Service (S3). The input and output message queues may be implemented with Simple Queue Service (SQS). The web-server is hosted on a t1-micro Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instance. The database is implemented with the Relational Database Service (RDS) running a MySQL database instance. Each worker machine is a c3.8xlarge EC2 instance with 32-processors and 60 GB of RAM. The cloud metrics are obtained using Cloud Watch. The scaling of EC2 capacity (automatic creation and termination of worker machines) is done using Amazon Auto Scaling. The software that runs on each of the worker machines is stored as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).","C. New And Other Image Modalities","1. Widefield And Ultra-Widefield Images","Widefield and ultra-widefield retinal images capture fields of view of the retina in a single image that are larger than 45-50 degrees typically captured in retinal fundus images. These images are obtained either by using special camera hardware or by creating a montage using retinal images of different fields. The systems and methods described herein can apply to widefield and ultra-widefield images.","2. Fluorescein Angiography Images","Fluorescein angiography involves injection of a fluorescent tracer dye followed by an angiogram that measures the fluorescence emitted by illuminating the retina with light of wavelength 490 nanometers.
