{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/950,034 entitled \u201cTERMINAL-BASED SERVER FOR LOCATION TRACKING\u201d filed Sep. 24, 2004 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/532,100 entitled \u201cTERMINAL-BASED SERVER FOR LOCATION TRACKING\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2003, the entireties of which are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention is related to location tracking of mobile devices, and more specifically, a server-based solution for location tracking applications.","Cellular telephone manufactures strive to continually provide new and innovative services in an attempt to keep existing customers and draw in new customers in an industry that is already very competitive. Location based services enable personalized services to be offered based on a person's (or item of the person) location. Services include, for example, security reporting, fleet and resource management, location based information, vehicle tracking, person-to-person location, and messaging applications.","Location-based information services allow subscribers to access information for which the information is filtered and tailored based on the location of the requesting user. Service requests may be initiated on demand by subscribers, or automatically, when triggering conditions are met, and may be a singular request or result in multiple deferred responses. Examples of location based information services include the following: navigation to guide the user to his or her destination; city sightseeing to describe historical sights, find restaurants, the airport, bus terminal, etc.; location dependent content broadcast, that support broadcasting content to a user in a certain geographical area; and mobile yellow pages for finding telephone numbers and addresses.","Public communication systems are highly standardized so that device manufacturers, such as cell phone manufacturers, can take advantage of economies of scale by manufacturing different devices using the same communication interfaces for all their customers. Thus, mobile communication devices that work with a first network can also be used with a second network that adheres to the same standardized architecture and signaling protocols as the first network. Standardization has the further advantage that communication networks can easily pass information, such as cellular phone calls or data messages, between themselves if the interface between the networks is standardized.","The basic components of a standards-based location services (denoted LCS\u2014LoCation Services) architecture include an LCS client and an LCS server. The LCS server is a software and\/or hardware component that consists of a number of location service components and bearers needed to service the LCS clients. An example of a location service bearer might be a software application for fleet resource management. The LCS server may receive location information requests, process the requests, and send back responses to the received requests. The LCS server supports location based services in parallel with other telecommunication services such as speech, data, messaging, other teleservices, user applications and supplementary services and therefore enable the market for services to be determined by users and service providers.","An LCS client is a software and\/or hardware component that interacts with the LCS server for obtaining location information for one or more Mobile Stations within a specified set of parameters. LCS clients subscribe to LCS in order to obtain location information. LCS clients may or may not interact with human users, and may be responsible for formatting and presenting data and managing the user interface (dialogue).","The LCS client and server use LCS messages to exchange information, and each LCS message contains a set of parameters. The LCS messages may comprise a location service request and\/or a location service response. The location service request can be of two types: an immediate request that receives an immediate response; and a deferred type, whose response time is delayed (or event-driven) and a response to which can include one or more service responses. A location service request report provides the result of a deferred location service request from the LCS server to the LCS client. The report is provided using a dialog between the client and the server that is initiated by the server.","One disadvantage of current LBS (locations based service) systems is that they are constructed so that the network based LCS must send a message to the mobile station, requesting that the mobile report its position. Thus, at least two messages are required every time a mobile reports its location to the network, one message from the network to the mobile and a response from the mobile to the network. In communication networks that may provide services to many millions of customers, such as cellular networks, it is desirable to reduce communications signaling to the greatest extent possible. Excess signaling can choke the network and cause reduced service quality for all customers.","One implementation provides a similar proprietary mobile-based GPS (Global Positioning System) solution based on a proprietary protocol (MPTP-Mobile Positioning Telematics Protocol). Recent products also provide assistance data capability, but in an indirect manner, as they are relatively independent of the underlying wireless network. Such an implementation, however, besides being proprietary, also has implications on location accuracy and reporting latency performance.","Current LCS implementations do not provide the capability to place a mobile terminal in tracking mode for autonomous periodic or event-driven location reporting to the network. Tracking involves \u201cdeferred\u201d location reporting at the occurrence of event triggers that are defined in the location tracking request message. For example, a location-tracking request may be to provide location reports every ten minutes for a period of two hours; the event trigger in this case is realized by a timer that triggers every ten minutes for the duration of two hours. One realization of a location server is the GMLC (Gateway Mobile Location Center) as defined in GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) (using the control plane of the wireless network). However, tracking (\u201cmultiple reports\u201d) is currently not supported in the wireless radio network (for clients external to the radio network), and GMLC-based tracking supports limited triggers. The GMLC can be requested to provide periodic location reports to the client, but each report has to be individually generated by a GMLC request to the wireless network, such that the signaling overhead is costly and only tracking based on periodic reporting is possible.","What is needed is an improved location server implementation.","The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The present invention addresses open issues with current solutions for LBS (Location Based Services) tracking applications. In one embodiment the location server supporting an open API (Application Programming Interface) (e.g., MLP-Mobile Location Protocol) resides in the mobile terminal instead of on the core network. Conventional implementations (e.g., MLP and 3GPP\/3GPP2 specifications) only envisage the location server as residing on the wireless network and communicating with an external client.","In support thereof, the present invention disclosed and claimed herein, in one aspect thereof, comprises a mobile terminal system that includes a mobile communications component that communicates wireless signals, and a location services component that includes a location services (LCS) server that facilitates the determination of positioning information. It is a cost-effective system that facilitates the use of location tracking applications as a service in the mobile terminal.","In another aspect of the present invention, a terminal-based server of the mobile terminal makes possible the autonomous generation and reporting by the terminal of \u201cdeferred\u201d location reports which results in bandwidth efficiencies and reduced latencies as compared to a network server solution. With autonomous reporting, signaling between the network and the mobile device is reduced because, for example, an instruction is not needed from the network each time the mobile reports its location. Thus, application of the terminal-based server greatly reduces signaling overhead over the traditional, standardized location reporting methods.","In yet another aspect thereof, the terminal-based LCS server is more versatile than a network server in the types of trigger events that can be supported. For instance, while network servers are capable of supporting timer-triggered reporting, it is impractical for them to support triggers based on terminal location or speed. A terminal server, on the other hand, is able to easily calculate velocity from the terminals on-board GPS receiver.","In still another aspect of the present invention, the invention takes advantage of the capabilities within a wireless network to improve the speed and accuracy of the location determination. For example, the terminal can request and obtain A-GPS (Assisted Global Positioning System) assistance data from the network and use the data over its validity period (2-3 hours typically) for fast, accurate, power-efficient and autonomous location determinations.","In another aspect thereof, the disclosed invention uses an open standards interface and is more tightly integrated with the wireless network than existing solutions. For example, the disclosed terminal-based server solution can use MO-LR (Mobile Originated-Location Request) and MT-LR (Mobile Terminated-Location Request) signaling to report location information, whereas existing terminal-based location software solutions rely on SMS (Short Message Service) or higher level packet-data applications to report location. The use of MO-LR and MT-LR allow not only faster location determination, but also support different mobile-based location technologies, tailor assistance data to the mobile terminal's capabilities, simplifies billing, and can potentially increase QoS (Quality-of-Service) capabilities.","In still another aspect thereof, there is provided a method that enables a bandwidth-efficient, versatile and low-latency terminal-based location tracking applications using the OMA\/LIF MLP (Open Mobile Alliance\/Location Interoperability Forum Mobile Location Protocol) protocol and terminal-based location technologies, with or without network assistance. In operation, a location client sends a location-tracking request (together with associated trigger parameters such as periodicity of location reports) to the location server either in the terminal or connected to the terminal. The request is sent using the open OMA\/LIF-MLP protocol. After authenticating the client, the implementation can, depending on the location technology employed (e.g., Assisted-GPS), obtain the relevant assistance data from the wireless network and activate the triggers in the location request. Subsequently, at each trigger event the LCS server together with the mobile terminal autonomously generate a location report and sends it to the client. The location report may be sent using MLP or through the wireless network signaling protocol. (Note that MLP messages pass transparently through the wireless network over its User Plane while signaling messages are sent over the Control Plane and are non-transparent to the wireless network). Essentially, the method is a push-based rather than a pull-based solution.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The present invention is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the present invention.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d and \u201csystem\u201d are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","Under some embodiments of the disclosed invention, full-fledged tracking is possible, however, using currently standardized signaling, but with a different implementation that requires implementing the location server functionality in the mobile terminal (using the User Plane and, optionally, the Control Plane) for these applications and GMLC (Gateway Mobile Location Center) remains unchanged and functions as originally envisaged. Tracking is fully supported and with reduced bandwidth overhead. Further reasons for supporting an LCS (LoCation Services) server in a mobile terminal include proven business case, revenues from terminal feature activation, Assistance Data Delivery, User Plane Traffic\/GMLC processed requests, fully supported by current 3GPP & OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) standards, and is particularly applicable for market segments targeted by push-to-talk. The disclosed invention only requires AGPS (Assisted Global Positioning System) terminal API (Application Programming Interface) support of MLP (Mobile Location Protocol). Minimally, even a subset of MLP messages may be sufficient. An alternative implementation can include the GMLC as subclient. The Le connects the location client and location server. The defacto standard is the OMA\/LIF MLP API application layer protocol, which is simple and secure, and based on existing and well-known Internet technologies such as HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol), SSL\/TLS (Secure Socket Layer\/Transparent LAN Service) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).","Location reporting triggers include timer-based (periodic or otherwise), absolute area (e.g., fixed location and given radius), relative location (e.g., to last reported location), emergency call, speed, manual, and all reports with or without user alert.","Location tracking solutions can be employed in a variety of applications but in particular, for enterprise customers that are in the same category as \u201cPush-to-Talk\u201d customers, including but not limited to, workforce management and security in the following areas: professional security, personal safety, lone worker protection, transportation and logistics, construction and maintenance, asset management, health, outdoor, travel and sports. Customers can consist of companies and service organizations that want to ensure the safety and security of corporate workforce and private people, generate immediate cost savings by streamlining operations and processes, improve productivity and efficiency by enabling mobile workforce management and communication and gain a competitive advantage.","The needed standards capabilities are already in place. In addition, some aspects such as USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) and USAT (USIM Application Toolkit) may provide features that benefit from the disclosed architecture.","A technical specification for LCS can be found in document 3G TS 23.271 V2.0.0 (2000-December), entitled \u201c3GPP Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects, Functional Stage 2 Description of LCS (Release 4)\u201d, and in document 3GPP TS 22.071 V4.5.0 (2003-September), entitled \u201c3GPP Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects, Location Services (LCS), Service Description, Stage 1 (Release 4)\u201d, of both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a system  of the present invention. The system  includes a mobile communications component  that facilitates the communication of wireless signals. Associated therewith is a location services component  that interfaces to the mobile communications component  to provide positioning information in a cellular network. The system  can be embodied as a mobile terminal (e.g., a cellular telephone) that includes both the mobile communications component  and the location services component . A location request signal can be received by the system  at the mobile communications component , and processed thereby in accordance with the location services component  to provide a location report.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a process of location tracking in accordance with the present invention. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the one or more methodologies shown herein, e.g., in the form of a flow chart, are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance with the present invention, occur in a different order and\/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention.","The disclosed architecture enables a bandwidth-efficient, versatile and low-latency terminal-based location tracking applications using OMA\/LIF MLP and terminal-based location technologies, with or without network assistance. At , a location client sends a location-tracking request (together with associated trigger parameters such as periodicity of location reports) to the location server, which location server is associated with the mobile terminal either in the terminal or connected to the terminal. The request is sent using the open OMA\/LIF MLP. At , the location server authenticates the client. At , after authenticating the location client, the implementation may, depending on the location technology employed (e.g., Assisted-GPS), obtain the relevant assistance data from the wireless network. At , the location server activates one or more of the triggers in the location request. Subsequently, at each trigger event, the location server together with the terminal autonomously generates a location report, as indicated at . At , the server sends the report to the client. The location report may be sent using MLP or through the wireless network signaling protocol. Note that MLP messages pass transparently through the wireless network over its User Plane, while signaling messages are sent over the Control Plane and are non-transparent to the wireless network. Essentially, the method is \u201cpush-based\u201d rather than a \u201cpull-based\u201d solution. At , the location client receives the report and processes the report. There process then reaches a Stop block.","Referring now to , there is illustrated signal flow of a system  where an LCS server is embodied in a mobile terminal  in accordance with the present invention. The system  includes the traditional network entities; the wireless mobile terminal  that communicates with a core network (CN)  (which can also be a radio access network (RAN)) over an air interface . The core network  interfaces to a GMLC LCS server  via a GMLC CN\/RAN interface . The GMLC LCS server  then interfaces to an external LCS client  via an external interface (denoted Le) .","Conventionally, a location request from the LCS client  is processed by sending the request for single or multiple reports to the GMLC LCS server , which server  forwards a request for single reports only to the core network . The core network  forwards the request plus assistance data for single reports only over the air interface  to the terminal . The terminal , which can be AGPS capable, although this is not required, sends a single location report back to the core network . The network  then forwards the single location report to the GMLC LCS server , which location report (in single or multiple deferred reports) is forwarded to the LCS client .","Since the mobile terminal  now includes the LCS server, reporting can take different routes. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the location request\/report bypasses the GMLC LCS server  entirely. By including at least an LCS server, the terminal  can receive a location request  (for single or multiple reports directly from the LCS client , which client  can also be a mobile terminal. In response, the terminal  sends an MO-LR (Mobile Originated-Location Request) assistance data request (periodic)  to the network  over the air interface . The network  processes the MO-LR request , and communicates assistance data (periodic)  back to the terminal  over the air interface . The terminal  then transmits a location report (single or deferred multiple)  directly back to the LCS client .","Referring now to , there is illustrated alternative signal flow of a system  where an LCS server is embodied in a mobile terminal  in accordance with the present invention. In this alternative signal path, the location request  is transmitted directly to the LCS server of the mobile terminal  bypassing the GMLC LCS server  entirely, but the report takes a path back through the GMLC LCS server  to the LCS client . The terminal  receives the location request  (for single or multiple reports) directly from the LCS client . In response, the terminal  sends the MO-LR assistance data request (periodic)  to the network  over the air interface . The network  processes the MO-LR request , and communicates assistance data (periodic)  back to the terminal  over the air interface . The terminal  then transmits a location report (single or deferred multiple)  back to the core network . The network  forwards the location report  to the GMLC LCS server , which then forwards the location report  to the LCS client . (Note that the location reports  of  and location reports  comprise the same report information, but can include different routing information according to the routing path between the various entities.)","Referring now to , there is illustrated alternative signal flow of a system  where an LCS server is embodied in a mobile terminal  in accordance with the present invention. In this alternative signal path, a location request  is passed through the GMLC LCS server , but the report takes the direct path back to the LCS client , bypassing the server . Here, the LCS client  sends the location request  (for single or multiple reports) to the GMLC LCS server . The GMLC LCS server  then transmits the location request  directly to the terminal , bypassing the core network . In response, the terminal  sends the MO-LR assistance data request (periodic)  to the network  over the air interface . The network  processes the MO-LR request , and communicates assistance data (periodic)  back to the terminal . The terminal  then transmits the location report (single or deferred multiple)  directly back to the LCS client .","Referring now to , there is illustrated alternative signal flow of a system  where an LCS server is embodied in a mobile terminal  in accordance with the present invention. In this alternative signal path, a location request  is forwarded and returned through the GMLC LCS server . Here, the LCS client  sends the location request  (for single or multiple reports) to the GMLC LCS server .

The terminal  then transmits the location report (single or deferred multiple)  back to the core network . The network  forwards the location report  to the GMLC LCS server , which then forwards the location report  to the LCS client . Note that MO-LR uses terminal to RAN MO-LR messages and a subset of MT-LR (Mobile Terminated-Location Request) procedures.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a block diagram of a mobile device  suitable for providing location services in accordance with the present invention. The device  includes a processor  for controlling all onboard operations and processes. A memory  interfaces to the processor  for temporary storage of data and one or more applications  being executed by the processor . The applications  include the LCS server and related applications  for providing LCS services from the mobile terminal  in accordance with the present invention. A communications component  interfaces to the processor  to facilitate wired\/wireless communication with external systems. The communications component  interfaces to a location component  (e.g., GPS transceiver) that facilitates location detection of the terminal . Note that the location component  can also be included as part of the communications component .","The device  includes a display  for displaying content downloaded in accordance with the present invention, and for displaying text information related to operating and using the device features. A serial I\/O interface  is provided in communication with the processor  to facilitate serial communication (e.g., USB, and\/or IEEE 1394) via a hardwire connection. This supports updating and troubleshooting the device , for example.
