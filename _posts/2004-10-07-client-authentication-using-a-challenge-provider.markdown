title: Client authentication using a challenge provider
abstract: A system for providing secured access to an application service includes a challenge provider that uses a first cryptographic technique to provide a challenge to a client seeking access to an application service. The client uses a second cryptographic technique to generate a response, and provides the response to an authentication service. The authentication service grants the client access to the application service only if the challenge and response are authenticated using a first authentication technique complementary to the first cryptographic technique and a second authentication technique complementary to the second cryptographic technique, respectively.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to French Application No. 04291338.4, filed on May 28, 2004, and titled CLIENT AUTHENTICATION USING A CHALLENGE PROVIDER, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The disclosure relates to securing access to an application service.","Various application services may be available to a client in an enterprise environment. The client may access one or more of those application services using a conventional login, as provided, for example, by the secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol. Conventionally, the login to each application service may require a separate login or separate administration of authentication information or security settings.","Moreover, mobile clients such as mobile telephones or personal digital assistants are becoming pervasive. Mobile clients generally offer less abundant system resources than do conventional fixed clients. Consequently, SSL and other conventional authentication systems may not be suited ideally for implementation within a mobile client.","In one general aspect, a system for providing secured access to an application service includes a challenge provider that uses a first cryptographic technique to provide a challenge to a client seeking access to an application service. The client uses a second cryptographic technique to generate a response, and provides the response to an authentication service. The authentication service grants the client access to the application service only if the challenge and response are authenticated using a first authentication technique complementary to the first cryptographic technique and a second authentication technique complementary to the second cryptographic technique, respectively.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the challenge provider may be configured as physically separate from the authentication service. The authentication service may reside within a middleware service that connects the client and the application service. A mapping service also may be included to map identification information to one or more cryptographic keys.","The client may include a secure storage circuit and a secure execution circuit to generate the response based on the challenge and the second cryptographic technique. A smart card may be used to embody the secure storage circuit and the secure execution circuit. The challenge provider may be used to provide the client with an interface module to interface with the smart card. For example, the interface module may communicate the challenge to the smart card and also may communicate the response to the authentication service.","In one aspect, the challenge provider selects the interface module from one or more available interface modules. For example, the challenge provider may provide the interface module based on a version and\/or type of the client. More specifically, the challenge provider may provide the interface module based on a version and\/or type of the smart card of the client. The challenge provider may digitally sign the interface module provided to the client.","An administrative service also may be provided. The administrative service may instruct the challenge provider regarding providing the challenge. The challenge provider may be used to centrally control access of more than one client to more than one application service using more than one authentication service.","These general and specific aspects may be implemented using a method, a system, or a computer program, or any combination of systems, methods, and computer programs. Other features will be apparent from the following description, including the drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","Referring to , a generalized system  provides a client  with secured access to an application service  using a challenge provider  and an authentication service . The authentication service  authenticates the client  to the application service  based on a challenge provided to the client  by the challenge provider . Exemplary components of the system  are described in greater detail below.","The client  generally may include any device, system, and\/or piece of code that relies on another service to perform an operation and that communicates using a wired or wireless communication path. For example, the client  may include a fixed or a mobile device  such as a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pen-based computer, a notebook computer, or a workstation. The client  also may include a Web browser, an email client, a synchronization client (e.g., a calendar synchronization client, a task list synchronization client), an instant messaging (IM) client, a business productivity application (e.g., a word processor, a spreadsheet), and\/or an operating system or operating system kernel residing on a fixed or a mobile device.","The client  additionally may include a secure storage function and a secure execution function. The client  may use the secure storage and secure execution functions, for example, to provide confidentiality, user authentication, application authentication, transaction authentication, and\/or nonrepudiation. The client  may generate or interpret secure messages based on data encryption techniques, or may digitally sign a message.","To provide secure storage and secure execution, the client  may include specialized security hardware and software having a separate physical identity. For example, the secure storage and secure execution functions of the client  may include a memory and a processor that are not shared but are used only for secure execution and for secure storage related to the secure execution. The memory and processor may reside within a secured physical casing separated from other portions of the client . Secured software and data (e.g., cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic keys and certificates) may be stored and executed using the memory and processor secured within the physical casing to prevent observation or modification by an eavesdropper. The client  may include, for example, a SIM toolkit browser that may integrate with a wireless identity module (WIM) of the challenge provider , the authentication service , or the application service . The secure storage and secure execution functions of the client  also may include a random number generator (RNG) and\/or an internal clock mechanism. The internal clock mechanism may be used, for example, to time stamp a secure message.","In one such implementation, the client  includes a smart card or other suitable processor and\/or memory card (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) token, a GSM SIM, and\/or a UMTS SIM (USIM)) that is capable of providing secure storage and secure execution. The smart card may be defined, for example, by standards such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7816-X, the ISO and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 14443-1 specification, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute specification for GSM SIMs, and\/or the Europay International, Master Card International, and Visa International (EMV) specification for payment systems. The smart card may decrypt received secure messages, encrypt requests or replies to form outgoing secure messages, and may communicate using the secure messages. The secure messages may include voice and\/or non-voice data.","In another aspect, the secure storage and secure execution functions of the client  may be implemented using, for example, general resources of the client through tamper resistant software (TRS) that is resistant to observation and modification. The TRS may employ interleaving of its operations, and the TRS code may be self-encrypting, self-decrypting, and\/or self-modifying. The TRS may be configured to store secrets dispersed through multiple memory structures, and to process those secrets only through multiple operations. Each TRS implementation may include a unique code sequence and\/or cryptographic key, and the correct performance of a TRS code sequence may depend on the mutually correct execution of many other TRS code sequences.","The client  may employ a one-way cryptographic method (i.e., the encrypted output cannot be decrypted) that, for example, may be useful for authentication or to verify a validation. A one-way cryptographic function produces a fixed size number (e.g., a hash value) for an input of any length, where, additionally, it is infeasible computationally to determine the input from the hash value. Slightly different inputs to a one-way cryptographic function typically will produce substantially different outputs. One-way cryptographic functions include, for example, the secure hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-1, or SHA-256) and the message digest algorithms (e.g., MD4, MD5, or Ripe-MD).","The client  also may employ two-way cryptographic methods (i.e., the encrypted outputs can be decrypted) that are symmetric and\/or asymmetric. In a symmetric cryptographic method, a shared key is employed that is used both to encrypt and to decrypt a message. The shared key may be used once to secure a given message and discarded, or the security token  may store the shared key for repeated use. In either event, the shared key may be communicated to the challenge provider  or the authentication service  using conventional key exchange methods. Symmetric cryptographic methods include, for example, the data encryption standard (DES), the 3DES (triple DES), the Blowfish encryption algorithm, the international data encryption algorithm (IDEA), and\/or the advanced encryption standard (AES).","In an asymmetric cryptographic method, (e.g., the Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) method, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), digital signature algorithm (DSA), or Elgamal cryptography), a key-pair is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. The key-pair includes a public key for encrypting a message (but that provides no decryption benefit) and an associated private key for decrypting the message. Asymmetric cryptographic methods also may be used to create a digital signature. The digital signature may authenticate that a message author actually is the person or device that the message author claims to be and that the message has not been modified after being sent. Similar to encryption, a private key is used to create a digital signature while a message recipient uses an associated public key to authenticate the digitally signed message. For example, the client  may retain the private key used to digitally sign a message, but may make the public key available by publication to the challenge provider  or the authentication service  to verify the digital signature. A public key infrastructure (PKI) may certify to the challenge provider  or the authentication service  that the public key associated with the message corresponds to the source claimed by the message. The PKI fills a role similar to that of a notary public who witnesses the correct identity of a signer of a paper document. The PKI may include, for example, a certification authority or a web of trust.","Whether symmetric or asymmetric, the secure storage and secure execution functions, may be used exclusively to store and apply one or more secret cryptographic key. As a result, a third party eavesdropper is prevented from listening or observing communications or operations of the client  to intercept the secret cryptographic key.","The client  may format a message using any appropriate standard protocol for wired or wireless applications. The formatted message may include a form that a user of the client  may use to submit information to or make a request of the application service .","The application service  generally may include, for example, any device, system, and\/or piece of code configured to perform an operation requested by a client  (e.g., a cellular telephone, a PDA, a Web browser, or another service). The application service  may include a customer relationship management (CRM) service, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) service, an email service, an accounting service, a resource management service, a synchronization service (e.g., a calendar synchronization service, a task list synchronization service), a print service, a file access service, an instant messaging (IM) service, an operating system, an operating system kernel, an authentication service, an authorization service, and\/or any combination of these or other services. The application service  may include a fixed device, such as, for example, a desktop computer, a workstation, a mini-computer or a mainframe. The application service  also may include a mobile device, such as a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pen-based computer, or a notebook computer.","The application service  may include or access additional services. For example, the application service  may include or access a database service, such as, for example, a reliable database management system (RDBMS) or an SAP R\/3 system. The database service may include, for example, enterprise information related to application services, users, and\/or customers.","The application service  further may include various mechanisms for delivering voice and\/or non-voice data, such as, for example, the short message service (SMS), the wireless application protocol (WAP), the transport connection protocol (TCP), the Internet protocol (IP), the World Wide Web, one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wireless LANs (WLAN), and\/or one or more wide area networks (WANs). The application service  also may include analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks, e.g., public switched telephone networks (PSTN), integrated services digital networks (ISDN), various types of digital subscriber lines (xDSL), advance mobile telephone service (AMPS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), general packet radio service (GPRS), code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband CDMA (WCDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), radio, cable, satellite, and\/or other delivery mechanisms for carrying voice or non-voice data.","The challenge provider  may employ cryptographic methods similar and complementary to those employed by the client . The challenge provider  also may include a secure storage function and a secure execution function. The secure storage and secure execution functions of the challenge provider  may be used to provide, for example, confidentiality, user authentication, application authentication, transaction authentication, and\/or nonrepudiation. The challenge provider  may control access to the application service  by providing to the client  a challenge required to obtain authentication by the authentication service . In one aspect, the challenge provider  may provide the challenge to the client  only after the challenge provider  performs an initial authentication of an identity of the client . For example, to obtain the challenge, the client  may provide the challenge provider  with an identification certificate, password, and\/or other form of identification. In addition, the challenge provider  may be accessible to the client  only via a secure communication connection (e.g., a point-to-point, non-public communication link).","The challenge provider  may be configured to control access of more than one client  to more than one application service  using more than one authentication service . Hence, the challenge provider  may centrally control access to an array of application services  using an array of authentication services . For example, the challenge provider  may provide a challenge that a client  may use to access more than one application service  using only a single password or other identifier (e.g., a personal identification number (PIN), a password, or a biometric indicator). To provide increased security, the challenge provider  may be configured to refuse communication with a client  after a predetermined number of failed authentication attempts. The challenge provider  also may include an internal clock and may be configured, for example, to refuse communication with a client  after a predetermined number of failed access attempts within a predetermined period of time.","To provide secure storage and secure execution, the challenge provider  may include a SIM or other specialized security hardware or software similar to client  described above. For example, the challenge provider  may include a wireless identity module (WIM) (e.g., a Giesecke & Devrient STARSIM browser system) that may integrate with the SIM toolkit browser of the client . In another aspect, the challenge provider  may be implemented using, for example, resources of an authentication service (e.g., authentication service ) or of an enterprise service (e.g., application service ) through tamper resistant software (TRS) similarly as was described above with respect to the client . The challenge provider  may be mobile or fixed, and may or may not communicate directly with the client  or the authentication service .","The authentication service  generally may include, for example, any device, system, and\/or piece of code configured to secure access to the application service  by the client . The authentication service  may employ cryptographic methods similar and complementary to those employed by the client  and\/or the challenge provider . The authentication service  may employ a first cryptographic technique to authenticate that the client  was challenged by the challenge provider . Having authenticated that the client received a valid challenge from the challenge provider , the authentication service  may employ a second cryptographic technique to authenticate that the client actually is the person or device that the client  claims to be. In addition to authenticating identity, the authentication service  may be configured to provide, limit, or deny access to the application service  based upon a privilege or status of the client . For example, a system administrator may be provided with extensive access to the application service, while a standard user may be provided with more limited access.","The authentication service  also may be configured to employ one or more protocols to guarantee freshness of a response provided by the client . For example, a replay counter technique may be used to prevent an eavesdropper from intercepting a correct response and then submitting the correct but no-longer fresh response to the authentication service  to access the application service . The replay counter technique may be based upon one or more time stamps included in the response.","In any event, the authentication service  provides secure execution and\/or secure storage functions similar generally to those of the client  and challenge provider  previously described. For brevity, therefore, the description of the secure execution and secure storage functions is not repeated here, but is incorporated by reference. The authentication service  authenticates the client  using symmetric and\/or asymmetric data encryption methods. The cryptographic methods of the authentication service  may be selected to operate seamlessly with the cryptographic methods of the client  and the challenge provider .","One or more other services may be included in the components of system , and these components (hereinafter the system services) may be included as part of one or more other services. For example, the system services may include or be included in a general-purpose or a special-purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer, a PDA, or a device specifically programmed to perform certain tasks), a Local Area Network (LAN), and\/or a Wide Area Network (WAN). The response to and execution of instructions received by any or all of the system services may be controlled by, for example, a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the services to interact and operate as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","115","105","205","105","115","105","105","105","140","210","140","105","115","215","140","105","105","215","220","105","110","225","110","230"]},"Referring to , a generalized system  secures access to an application service  using a challenge provider  and an authentication service . System  is similar generally to system  of .","The client  includes an interface module  and a smart card  that are configured to communicate together. The system  includes middleware  configured to link the client  and the application service . The middleware  may include, for example, an access server  (e.g., a web server) and a gateway . The access server  and the gateway  may or may not be integrated together. The middleware  also includes the authentication service  and a mapping service . System  includes additionally an administrative service  configured to manage one or more aspects of a security infrastructure. System  may employ elements of public key cryptography and the administrative service  may include a public key infrastructure (PKI). For brevity, this description focuses on those aspects of system  additional to the system of . Exemplary components of system  are described in greater detail below.","The client  is analogous to the client  of . However, client  is shown to include an interface module (e.g., interface module  provided by the challenge provider ) and a smart card . The interface module  is configured to facilitate communication between the smart card  and the challenge provider  and\/or between the smart card  and the authentication service . The interface module  may comprise, for example, a browser plug-in, a ActiveX component, a Java applet, and\/or other software and\/or hardware components. The smart card  may correspond generally to the smart card described with respect to client  of . In any event, the client  may include a hardware device configured physically to receive the smart card  and to enable operation of the smart card . The client  also may include, for example, a Web browser, an email client, a synchronization client (e.g., a calendar synchronization client or a task list synchronization client), an IM client, a business productivity application (e.g., a word processor or a spreadsheet program), an operating system or operating system kernel, and\/or a virtual private network (VPN) (e.g., based on the IP security (IPsec) protocol).","The client  may be arranged to operate within or in concert with one or more other systems, such as, for example, analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g., PSTN, ISDN, xDSL, AMPS, GSM, GPRS, CDMA, WCDMA, and UMTS), radio, cable, satellite, and\/or other delivery mechanisms for carrying voice or non-voice data. Other mechanisms may include SMS, WAP, TCP, IP, the World Wide Web, one or more LANs (e.g., a WLAN) and\/or one or more WANs.","The challenge provider  generally is analogous to the challenge provider  of . In one aspect, the challenge provider  may include a secure server (e.g., a secure web application server) with associated software to function as described previously. In addition to the challenge, the challenge provider  may provide the client  with the interface module  as, for example, an ActiveX component, a Java Applet, and\/or some other type of executable software component. The challenge provider  may provide the interface module  based on information that the client  does not include yet the interface module  or that a version of the interface module  currently held by the client  is outmoded or inappropriate. Additionally, the challenge provider  may provide the interface module  based on information indicating a hardware and\/or software configuration of the client . The challenge provider  may provide the interface module  to the client  based on information determined by the challenge provider  and\/or based on externally provided information, such as, for example, an externally provided administrative instruction. The challenge provider  may encrypt or digitally sign the interface module  provided to the client .","The middleware  may be configured to connect the client  and the application service . The middleware , for example, may include the access server  and the gateway . The access server  communicates with the client  using the hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) and\/or any other suitable communication protocol or service, such as, for example, TCP\/IP, SMS, WAP, PSTN, ISDN, xDSL, AMPS, GSM, GPRS, CDMA, WCDMA, TDMA, or UMTS. The gateway  manages user logon data, session contexts and time-outs. The gateway  also communicates with the access server  and with the application service  and may employ one or more of the protocols described with respect to the access server  and\/or any other appropriate public or proprietary communication protocol. More specifically, the gateway  may communicate with the application service  using one or more communication protocols configured to provide secure network communication, such as, for example, the secure socket layer (SSL), transport layer security (TLS), secure HTTP (S-HTTP), Kerberos, SECUDE, secure multipurpose internet mail extensions (S\/MIME), security assertion markup language (SAML), cryptographic message syntax standard (PKCS), secure internet message access protocol (IMAPS), and\/or secure post office protocol (POPS).","The authentication service  resides within the middleware , for example, as a component of the gateway . The authentication service  may include, for example, an application programming interface (API) and\/or dynamic link library (DLL) for interfacing and operating with the middleware  (e.g., with the gateway ). The authentication service  verifies the response of the client  to the challenge of the challenge provider . Specifically, the client  communicates the response to the authentication service  via the access server  and the gateway . The authentication service  may provide secure storage and secure executions functions using software and\/or hardware components similar generally to those described with respect to the challenge provider . The authentication service  also may provide more than one method of authentication for a given user. For example, the authentication service  may prefer to authenticate a user using an authentication certificate but may provide alternative and\/or additional authentication based upon a password or biometric if the authentication certificate is unavailable.","A mapping service  also is included to map the client identifier of client  to one or more associated cryptographic keys. The mapping service  may be included in the middleware , for example, as part of the authentication service , and\/or as a component of the application service . The mapping service  may include a database (e.g., a relational database) for storing and retrieving identification information and\/or authentication credentials such as cryptographic keys or certificates. The database may reside and operate within secure storage and\/or secure execution functions of the mapping service . The secure storage and secure execution functions may be similar to those described with respect to the challenge provider  and the authentication service .","In one implementation, the mapping service  maps authentication credentials using components of the middleware , but maps identification information using components of the application service . For example, the mapping service  maps authentication credentials used by the authentication service  to authenticate a user. Successful authentication of the user \u201ctriggers\u201d the mapping service  to map the identification information using components of the application service . For example, the mapping service  may use the application service  to map a user identification provided by mobile client  (a less trusted device) to a user or client identification used by a trusted system such as the application service  and\/or other backend or middleware systems. The application service  may include a database (e.g., a relational database) used by the mapping service  to store and retrieve the identification information. The database may reside and operate within secure storage and\/or secure execution functions of the application service .","The administrative service  may manage one or more aspects related to securing access to the application service . The administrative service , for example, may communicate with one or more devices of the system  using an end-to-end secured communication. The administrative service  may store, alter, validate, revoke, or generate security credentials, such as certificates or cryptographic keys used by the system . The administrative service  may include a public key infrastructure (PKI) configured to certify that a public key associated with a communication corresponds to an alleged source of the communication. The administrative service  also may include a policy management service configured to effectuate a state change in a device of system  based on a change in a security-related policy (e.g., a security-related policy of the application service ). The administrative service , for example, may instruct access to be limited or denied based upon a privilege or status of the client .","Additionally, the administrative service  may instruct the challenge provider  regarding provision of the interface module  to the client . For example, the administrative service  may control the version of the interface module  to be provided and\/or the timing or interval at which an already installed interface module  is updated or replaced.","One or more other services may be included in the components of system , and\/or these components (hereinafter the system services) may be included as part of one or more other services. For example, the system services may include or be included in a general-purpose or a special-purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer, a mobile device, or a device specifically programmed to perform certain tasks), at least one Local Area Network (LAN), and\/or at least one Wide Area Network (WAN). Either way, the response to and execution of instructions received by any or all of the system services may be controlled by, for example, a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the services to interact and operate as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","315","305","305","405","315","315","315"]},"In addition to the challenge (C, C\u2032), the challenge provider  also may provide the interface module  (IM) to the client . The interface module  may be provided based on a communication (not shown) of the administrative service , as was described generally with respect to  above.","Upon receiving the challenge and the interface module  (IM), the client  may install the interface module  (IM). Once installed, the interface module  (IM) provides the challenge information C to the smart card  (step ). The smart card  transforms the challenge information C using a second cryptographic technique to generate C*. For example, the smart card  may digitally sign the challenge information C, may encrypt the challenge information C, and\/or may apply a hashing algorithm to the challenge information C. The smart card  communicates the transformed challenge information C* to the interface module  and also provides a client and\/or user identifier (UID) (step ). The UID may include, for example, a digitally signed certificate, a personal identification number (PIN), a password, and\/or a biometric indicator.","The interface module  provides a response to the authentication service  via the access server  and the gateway  (step ). The response may include, for example, the challenge information C, the transformed challenge information C\u2032 and C*, and the client identifier UID. Based, for example, on the identifier CP_ID of the challenge provider  (part of the challenge information C) or the client identifier UID, the authentication service  provides identification information ID_Info to the mapping service  (step ). The mapping service  uses the identifier CP_ID of the challenge provider  to provide to the authentication service  a cryptographic key K\u2032 of the first cryptographic technique used by the challenge provider  (step ). In addition, the mapping service  uses the client identifier UID to provide to the authentication service  a cryptographic key K* of the second cryptographic technique used by the client  (e.g., used by the smart card  of the client ) (step ).","The authentication service  authenticates the response of the client  by using the keys K\u2032 and K* to authenticate respective portions of the response. Specifically, the authentication service  authenticates C\u2032, contributed by the challenge provider , using the key K\u2032 and a first authentication technique complementary to the first cryptographic technique. Authentication of C\u2032 using K\u2032 is described below in greater detail. In addition, the authentication service  authenticates C*, contributed by the client , using the key K* and a second authentication technique complementary to the second cryptographic technique. The authentication of C* is similar in material respects to authentication of C\u2032. For brevity, therefore, the authentication of C* is not discussed in additional detail.","To authenticate C\u2032, the first authentication technique may verify that C\u2032 corresponds to a valid and expected output of the true challenge provider . In this aspect, the first authentication technique presumes that the input C is known (e.g., that C is included in the response) and that the cryptographic process expected of the true challenge provider  (e.g., application of the first cryptographic technique using K\u2032) also is known. Specifically, the first authentication technique may use K\u2032 and the first cryptographic technique to encrypt or hash C to produce C\u2033. The value of C should equal that of C\u2032 if the challenge provider  is authentic and not an imposter. In short, the authentication service  authenticates C\u2032 if it is the same as C\u2033.","To authenticate C\u2032 in another aspect, the first authentication technique verifies that the known input C may be derived using C\u2032, for example, by decrypting C\u2032 to produce C. Specifically, the first authentication technique uses a two-way cryptographic process associated with the true challenge provider  (e.g., application of the first cryptographic technique using the key K\u2032) to decrypt C\u2032 and produce C\u2033. If C\u2033 and C are the same, the authentication service  authenticates C\u2032. If, however, the value of C\u2033 does not equal C, then it is presumed that C\u2032 was generated by an imposter rather than the true challenge provider , and authentication is denied.","In another aspect, the first authentication technique may recognize C\u2032 as a digitally signed version of C. The first authentication technique may use K\u2032, a public key associated with the true challenge provider , and the first cryptographic technique to authenticate the digital signature of C\u2032 in a conventional manner.","Additional to authenticating C\u2032 and C*, the authentication service  also may verify the freshness of the response provided by the client . For example, the authentication service  may verify that C\u2032 was created and\/or provided within a predetermined period of time based on the time stamp information (T_Stamp) of the challenge information. If the authentication service  determines that C\u2032 is not fresh, the authentication service may refuse to authenticate the response of the client . Alternatively, or in addition, the authentication service  may determine freshness based on time stamp information provided by the smart card  in the response.","Once the response is authenticated, the authentication service  authenticates the client  to the application service  via the gateway  (step ). Although not shown, authentication may trigger the mapping service  to determine a back-end identifier UID\u2032 based on the client identifier UID. The mapping service  may communicate the back-end identifier UID\u2032 to the other system services as needed or appropriate.
