{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of, and incorporates by reference, the entire disclosure of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/250,239 filed on Nov. 30, 2000.","The United States Government may have rights in this invention pursuant to National Science Foundation grants IRI-9530546 and IRI-9618854.","Differentiation among malignant lymphomas and leukemias affects how aggressively patients are treated, which medications are appropriate, and what levels of risk are justified. As more differentiated treatments become available, it has become increasingly important to distinguish among subclasses of blood pathologies. Nonetheless, discriminating among known pathologies may be difficult. As an example, mantle cell lymphoma (\u201cMCL\u201d) is often misdiagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (\u201cCLL\u201d) or as follicular center cell lymphoma (\u201cFCC\u201d).","The classical morphological description of MCL is a monotonous proliferation of small to medium sized lymphoid cells with scant cytoplasm, variably irregular and indented nuclei, dispersed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. The immunophenotype is CD5 positive B cells which are FMC7 antigen positive with moderately bright surface membrane immunoglobin light chain expression, CD2d negative and usually CD10 negative. The lack of CD23 expression differentiates this entity from typical CLL, however confusion between these two can arise when CLL loses CD23 during disease progression.","The classical morphological description of typical CLL cells is small lymphocytes containing round nuclei with coarsely condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm. The immunophenotype for CLL is CD5 positive antigen expression on B cells with CD23 antigen positivity, low density surface membrane immunoglobulin restricted light chain positivity and CD10 negative. This immunophenotype is considered the diagnostic gold standard for CLL. However, atypical CLL may be associated with deviations in immunophenotype that lead to a misdiagnosis as mantle cell lymphoma.","The classical morphological description of FCC cells is small to medium sized lymphoid cells with markedly angulated and cleaved nuclei, coarse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. The classic immunophenotype consists of CD5 negative B cells with positive CD10 expression and moderately bright expression of surface membrane immunoglobulin light chain expression.","The subtle visual differences exhibited by these pathologies give rise to a significant number of false negatives during routine screening. When suspicious cells are detected, subsequent evaluation of specimens by even experienced pathologists may be inconclusive. In these cases a diagnosis is not rendered until the specimen has been immunophenotyped. Additional testing is expensive, time-consuming, and often requires fresh tissue which may not be readily available. Because it would be impractical to immunophenotype every specimen, it would be useful to reduce the frequency of false negatives and improve discrimination among commonly confused lymphoproliferative disorders without resort to immunophenotyping. The timely diagnosis of, for example, MCL is of extreme importance since it has a more aggressive clinical course.","There remains a need for diagnostic tools to assist in discriminating among pathologies with similar characteristics and different courses of treatment.","The systems described herein include tools for computer-assisted evaluation of objective characteristics of pathologies. A diagnostic system arranged according to the teachings herein provides computer support for those tasks well suited to objective analysis, along with human decision making where substantial discretion is involved. Collaborative diagnosis may be provided through shared access to data and shared control over a diagnostic tool, such as a telemicroscope, and messaging service for clinicians who may be at remote locations. These aspects of the system, when working in cooperation with one another, may achieve improved diagnostic accuracy or early detection for pathologies such as lymphoma.","A system described herein may include a microscope that provides an image of a biological specimen in digital form, the microscope responsive to a control signal to change a parameter used to obtain the image of the biological specimen, the parameter including at least one of an objective lens, a focus, a light level, and a specimen position. The system may include a database that includes one or more pathology profiles associated with one or more pathologies, the one or more pathology profiles derived from images of one or more other biological specimens having one or more pathologies. The system may further include a decision support system that processes the image from the microscope to obtain an image profile, the image profile including descriptive data of the image, the decision support system comparing the image profile to the one or more pathology profiles in the database to identify one or more of the one or more pathologies that are candidates for a pathology associated with the biological specimen; and the system may include a client interface through which one or more remote users receive the image of the biological specimen and provide input to the system including at least one of generating the control signal to the microscope, communicating with other ones of the one or more remote users, and controlling operation of the decision support system. The one or more pathologies may include hematological disorders.","In the system, the microscope may employ an auto-focusing algorithm that retains a history of one or more previous auto-focus settings. The system may further include an archival system which provides unsupervised image feature extraction and automated management of images of additional biological specimens for addition to the database. The decision support system may be trained using a ground truth database of images having independently confirmed pathologies. The pathologies may be independently confirmed using at least one of immunophenotyping, molecular studies, or gene expression. The decision support system may compare the image profile to one of the one or more pathology profiles by quantitatively comparing a derived measure of shape, texture, and area for the image profile to a derived measure of shape, texture, and area for the one of the one or more pathology profiles. The derived measure of shape may be a plurality of elliptical Fourier coefficients for an outline of a shape of one or more components of the biological specimen. The derived measure of texture may be calculated using a multiscale simultaneous autoregressive model.","A method as described herein may include providing a database that includes one or more pathology profiles associated with one or more cells having one or more pathologies, the pathology profile for each pathology including a shape measure derived from a shape of one or more cells associated with the pathology, a texture measure derived from a texture of the one or more cells associated with the pathology, and an area measure derived from an area of the one or more cells associated with the pathology; receiving an image of a cell in digital form; processing the received image to obtain a query vector that includes a shape measure of the cell in the received image, a texture measure of the cell in the received image, and an area of the cell in the received image; and comparing the query vector to the one or more pathology profiles in the database to obtain a quantitative measure of similarity between the cell in the received image and one of the one or more cells having one or more pathologies.","The method may further include suggesting a diagnosis for the cell in the received image based upon the quantitative measure of similarity. Comparing the query vector to the one or more pathology profiles may further include calculating, for each pathology profile in the database, a weighted sum of a difference between each of the shape measure, the texture measure, and the area for the pathology profile and the shape measure, the texture measure, and the area for the query vector. The one or more pathologies may include one or more hematological disorders. Processing the received image may further include: converting the image from a red-green-blue representation to a luminance-chrominance representation; locating a plurality of coordinates of an outer boundary of at least one of the cell or one or more constituent components of the cell; and characterizing the outer boundary with a plurality of elliptical Fourier coefficients. Processing the received image may further include selecting a plurality of overlapping windows within the received image and, for each one of the plurality of overlapping windows, calculating a texture at a plurality of resolutions. The method may further include applying a multiscale simultaneous autoregressive model.","In another aspect, a system as described herein includes: database means for providing a database that includes one or more pathology profiles associated with one or more cells having one or more pathologies, the pathology profile for each pathology including a shape measure derived from a shape of one or more cells associated with the pathology, a texture measure derived from a texture of the one or more cells associated with the pathology, and an area measure derived from an area of the one or more cells associated with the pathology; imaging means for receiving an image of a cell in digital form; processing means for processing the received image to obtain a query vector that includes a shape measure of the cell in the received image, a texture measure of the cell in the received image, and an area of the cell in the received image; and comparing means for comparing the query vector to the one or more pathology profiles in the database to obtain a quantitative measure of similarity between the cell in the received image and one of the one or more cells having one or more pathologies.","A computer program product as described herein may include: computer executable code for providing a database that includes one or more pathology profiles associated with one or more cells having one or more pathologies, the pathology profile for each pathology including a shape measure derived from a shape of one or more cells associated with the pathology, a texture measure derived from a texture of the one or more cells associated with the pathology, and an area measure derived from an area of the one or more cells associated with the pathology; computer executable code for receiving an image of a cell in digital form; computer executable code for processing the received image to obtain a query vector that includes a shape measure of the cell in the received image, a texture measure of the cell in the received image, and an area of the cell in the received image; and computer executable code for comparing the query vector to the one or more pathology profiles in the database to obtain a quantitative measure of similarity between the cell in the received image and one of the one or more cells having one or more pathologies.","In another aspect, a method as described herein may include: providing a database that includes one or more pathology profiles associated with one or more pathologies, the pathology profile for each pathology including a shape, a texture, and an area for one or more images of biological specimens that carry the pathology; providing a decision support system for comparing a new specimen to the one or more pathology profiles and identifying a pathology from the one or more pathology profiles associated with the new specimen; and providing a server that includes a client interface through which a user may submit the new specimen to the decision support system from a remote location in a network, the server providing a result from the decision support system to the user at the remote location.","The server may be further configured to share the result and the image among a plurality of users, and to forward electronic communications between two or more of the plurality of users. The electronic communications may include at least one of instant messaging, audio, text, or electronic mail. The method may further include providing a microscope that provides an image of a biological specimen in digital form, the microscope responsive to a control signal to change a parameter used to obtain the image of the biological specimen, the parameter including at least one of an objective lens, a focus, a light level, and a specimen position; and providing a user interface through which one or more of a plurality of users, connected to the client interface through a data network, receive the image of the biological specimen and generate the control signal to the microscope. One of the plurality of users may have a token that provides to the one of the plurality of users exclusive control over the control signal to the microscope. The decision support system may compare a measure of shape, a measure of texture, and an area of the new specimen to a measure to a measure of shape, a measure of texture, and an area of each of the one or more pathology profiles.","The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the invention will be appreciated more fully from the following further description thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"To provide an overall understanding of the invention, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described, including a system for collaborative, computer-aided discrimination among lymphoproliferative pathologies.

The internetwork  may include a cable network, a wireless network, and any other networks for interconnecting clients, servers and other devices.","As depicted, one of the imaging devices  may be connected to one of the clients , one of the servers , the hub  of the LAN , or directly to one of the providers , and may include suitable hardware and software for connecting to the intemetwork  through any of the above devices or systems. One of the imaging devices  that may be used in the systems herein is a high-resolution color video camera, such as an Olympus OLY-750 coupled to a Coreco, Occulus data acquisition board. This imaging device  may be used to gather images for the image database, as described in more detail below. Another one of the imaging devices  may be a robotic microscope, such as an Olympus AX70, allowing electronic control over a specimen stage, a light level, an objective lens, and a focus, as well as parameters of digitization such as rate and resolution. This imaging device  may be used to obtain a query image. More generally, the term \u2018imaging device\u2019 as used herein should be understood to include cameras, microscopes, or any other device for capturing and\/or providing an image in electronic form, and should further be understood to include to include a mass storage device or other device for providing a previously captured electronic image.","An exemplary client  includes the conventional components of a client system, such as a processor, a memory (e.g. RAM), a bus which couples the processor and the memory, a mass storage device (e.g. a magnetic hard disk or an optical storage disk) coupled to the processor and the memory through an I\/O controller, and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory, such as modem, digital subscriber line (\u201cDSL\u201d) card, cable modem, network interface card, wireless network card, or other interface device capable of wired, fiber optic, or wireless data communications. One example of such a client  is a personal computer equipped with an operating system such as Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT, Unix, Linux, and Linux variants, along with software support for Internet communication protocols. The personal computer may also include a browser program, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, to provide a user interface for access to the Internet . Although the personal computer is a typical client , the client  may also be a workstation, mobile computer, Web phone, television settop box, interactive kiosk, personal digital assistant, or other device capable of communicating over the Internet . As used herein, the term \u201cclient\u201d is intended to refer to any of the above-described clients , as well as proprietary network clients designed specifically for the systems described herein, and the term \u201cbrowser\u201d is intended to refer to any of the above browser programs or other software or firmware providing a user interface for navigating the Internet  and\/or communicating with the medical image processing systems.","An exemplary server  includes a processor, a memory (e.g. RAM), a bus which couples the processor and the memory, a mass storage device (e.g. a magnetic or optical disk) coupled to the processor and the memory through an I\/O controller, and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory. Servers may be organized as layers of clusters in order to handle more client traffic, and may include separate servers for different functions such as a database server, a file server, an application server, and a Web presentation server. Such servers may further include one or more mass storage devices such as a disk farm or a redundant array of independent disk (\u201cRAID\u201d) system for additional storage and data integrity. Read-only devices, such as compact disc drives and digital versatile disc drives, may also be connected to the servers. Suitable servers and mass storage devices are manufactured by, for example, Compaq, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. As used herein, the term \u201cserver\u201d is intended to refer to any of the above-described servers .","Focusing now on the internetwork , one embodiment is the Internet. The structure of the Internet  is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and includes a network backbone with networks branching from the backbone. These branches, in turn, have networks branching from them, and so on. The backbone and branches are connected by routers, bridges, switches, and other switching elements that operate to direct data through the internetwork . However, one may practice the present invention on a wide variety of communication networks. For example, the internetwork  can include interactive television networks, telephone networks, wireless data transmission systems, two-way cable systems, customized computer networks, interactive kiosk networks, or ad hoc packet relay networks.","One embodiment of the internetwork  includes Internet service providers  offering dial-in service, such as Microsoft Network, America OnLine, Prodigy and CompuServe. It will be appreciated that the Internet service providers  may also include any computer system which can provide Internet access to a client . Of course, the Internet service providers  are optional, and in some cases, the clients  may have direct access to the Internet  through a dedicated DSL service, ISDN leased lines, T1 lines, digital satellite service, cable modem service, or any other high-speed connection to a network point-of-presence. Any of these high-speed services may also be offered through one of the Internet service providers .","In its present deployment as the Internet, the internetwork  consists of a worldwide computer network that communicates using protocols such as the well-defined Transmission Control Protocol (\u201cTCP\u201d) and Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) to provide transport and network services. Computer systems that are directly connected to the Internet  each have a unique IP address. The IP address consists of four one-byte numbers (although a planned expansion to sixteen bytes is underway with IPv6). The four bytes of the IP address are commonly written out separated by periods such as \u201cxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\u201d. To simplify Internet addressing, the Domain Name System (\u201cDNS\u201d) was created. The DNS allows users to access Internet resources with a simpler alphanumeric naming system. A DNS name consists of a series of alphanumeric names separated by periods. For example, the name \u201cwww.umdnj.edu\u201d corresponds to a particular IP address. When a domain name is used, the computer accesses a DNS server to obtain the explicit four-byte IP address. It will be appreciated that other internetworks  may be used with the invention. For example, the intemetwork  may be a wide-area network, a local area network, or corporate area network.","To further define the resources on the Internet , the Uniform Resource Locator system was created. A Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) is a descriptor that specifically defines a type of Internet resource along with its location. URLs have the following format:\n\n","In an exemplary embodiment, a browser, executing on one of the clients , retrieves a Web document at an address from one of the servers  via the intemetwork , and displays the Web document on a viewing device, e.g., a screen. A user can retrieve and view the Web document by entering, or selecting a link to, a URL in the browser. The browser then sends an http request to the server  that has the Web document associated with the URL. The server  responds to the http request by sending the requested Web document to the client . The Web document is an HTTP object that includes plain text (ASCII) conforming to the HyperText Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d). Other markup languages are known and may be used on appropriately enabled browsers and servers, including the Dynamic HyperText Markup Language (\u201cDHTML\u201d), the Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d), the Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (\u201cXHML\u201d), and the Standard Generalized Markup Language (\u201cSGML\u201d).","Each Web document may contains hyperlinks to other Web documents. The browser displays the Web document on the screen for the user and the hyperlinks to other Web documents are emphasized in some fashion such that the user can identify and select each hyperlink. To enhance functionality, a server  may execute programs associated with Web documents using programming or scripting languages, such as Perl, C, C++, or Java. A server  may also use server-side scripting languages such as ColdFusion from Allaire, Inc., or PHP. These programs and languages perform \u201cback-end\u201d functions such as transaction processing, database management, content searching, and implementation of application logic for applications. A Web document may also include references to small client-side applications, or applets, that are transferred from the server  to the client  along with a Web document and executed locally by the client . Java is one popular example of a programming language used for applets. The text within a Web document may further include (non-displayed) scripts that are executable by an appropriately enabled browser, using a scripting language such as JavaScript or Visual Basic Script. Browsers may further be enhanced with a variety of helper applications to interpret various media including still image formats such as JPEG and GIF, document formats such as PS and PDF, motion picture formats such as AVI and MPEG, and sound formats such as MP3 and MIDI. These media formats, along with a growing variety of proprietary media formats, may be used to enrich a user's interactive and audio-visual experience as each Web document is presented through the browser. The term \u201cpage\u201d as used herein is intended to refer to the Web document described above, as well as any of the above-described functional or multimedia content associated with the Web document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","200","202","204","202","200","204","200","202","206","200","110","200","200","102"]},"The presentation server  provides an interface for one or more connections to the intenetwork , thus permitting more than one of the clients  () to access the site at the same time.

Other suitable servers are known in the art and are and may be adapted to use with the systems described herein, such as, for example, an iPlanet Enterprise Server 4.0 from the Sun\/Netscape Alliance. The presentation server  may also use, for example, Microsoft's NET technology, or use a Microsoft Windows operating system, with a \u201cfront end\u201d written in Microsoft Active Server Page (\u201cASP\u201d), or some other programming language or server software capable of integrating ActiveX controls, forms, Visual Basic Scripts, JavaScript, Macromedia Flash Technology multimedia, e-mail, and other functional and multimedia aspects of a page. Typically, the front end includes all text, graphics, and interactive objects within a page, along with templates used for dynamic page creation. The presentation server  maintains one or more connections to the Internet . Where there is substantial network traffic, the connections are preferably provided by a tier one provider, i.e., one of the dozen or so national\/international Internet backbones with cross-national links of T3 speeds or higher, such as MCI, UUNet, BBN Planet, and Digex.","A client  () accessing an address hosted by the presentation server  will receive a page from the presentation server  containing text, forms, scripts, active objects, hyperlinks, etc., which may be collectively viewed using a browser.
