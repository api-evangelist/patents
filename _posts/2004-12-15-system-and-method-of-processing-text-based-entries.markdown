{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to integration of electronic devices and services, such as those onboard a vehicle and, more particularly, to a system and method of analyzing and identifying text information and making the identified text information available for use in applications.","Electronic devices are frequently employed onboard automotive vehicles. Automotive vehicles includes a number of electronic controllers and related devices that typically employ sensors and control modules that communicate data via proprietary communication protocol(s) on a dedicated vehicle data communication bus. Additionally, many automotive vehicles are also equipped with various infotainment devices, such as an audio radio tuner, a compact disk (CD) or digital versatile disk (DVD) player, a television, and a navigation system. These devices may be individually coupled to a multimedia bus, which is typically separated from the vehicle original equipment manufacturer (OEM) data communication bus.","In addition to the onboard integrated devices, various wireless consumer electronic devices may also be utilized in the vehicle. For example, cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as personal organizers and computers, and digital music players, such as an MP3 player, brought into a vehicle by a passenger may communicate with each other or one or more devices integrated in the vehicle via wire or wireless (e.g., Bluetooth) data communication link(s).","These and other mobile consumer devices offer multiple sources of text and other information that becomes available onboard the vehicle. With the increased availability and integration of device services, some of this information can be useful in providing a wide variety of enhanced tasks and\/or objectives. For example, it may be desirable for a vehicle navigation system to provide customized navigation services based on personal information that may become available from various different sources. Much of the text data available in conventional consumer devices is in the form of untagged text (e.g., notes to self or calendar entries), and hence is not readily available. To be able to use this text information, such text needs to be uploaded to the vehicle in an identifiable format. However, manually accessing this text information can be time consuming and distracting.","As future vehicles become even more intelligent and electronic devices and services are further integrated into the vehicle or brought onboard, the total functionality offered by such devices and services will grow. Additionally, different devices employ various text formats, commonly referred to as pro forma, which define a particular type of text information. The use of different text pro formas may be problematic in that it is difficult to process a wide variety of text information when different text formats are available. As a consequence, text information that is available may not be fully utilized.","Accordingly, it is desirable to provide for a system and method of analyzing text information such that the text information may be understood and employed, such as for vehicle related services. In particular, it is desirable to provide for such a system and method that makes the text information available to other devices and services onboard the vehicle to provide for enhanced integration of electronic systems. For example, it is desirable to provide for enhanced integration and operation of various electronic devices and services such as PDAs, cell phones, and navigation systems which are commonly employed onboard vehicles.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for identifying text information and making such information available for one or more applications. The system includes an electronic device communicating text information and an application for performing a function. The system also includes memory storing known text formats and a processor for processing the text information. The processor compares the text information to the known text formats and determines a text format of the text information. The processor also tags the text information according to the determined text format and further makes the tagged text information available to the application.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for identifying text information and making such text information available for one or more applications. The method includes the steps of providing an application for performing one or more functions, storing known text formats in memory, and providing text information made available by an electronic device. The method also includes the step of processing the text information, including comparing the text information to the known text formats and determining a text format of the text information. The method further includes the steps of tagging the text information according to the determined text format and making the tagged text information available to the application.","The system and method of the present invention advantageously analyzes text information and makes the text information available for applications, such as those implemented in connection with services onboard a vehicle. By determining the text format of text information, the text information can be employed to make more intelligible decisions for use with available applications.","These and other features, advantages and objects of the present invention will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art by reference to the following specification, claims and appended drawings.","Referring to , the cockpit of a vehicle  is generally illustrated having an integrated electronics system, also referred to herein as an infotainment system, according to one embodiment.

To manage the complexity of the in-vehicle infrastructure resulting from integrated use of a plurality of electronic devices and services, an application programming interface (API) is employed in conjunction with the text format data containing the text formats to analyze and determine the text format type and to make the determined text information available for one or more applications.","In the embodiment shown and described herein, the text format storage and text processing is implemented in the VCSI host platform  which serves as a processor. One example of a VCSI host platform used for communicating data within a vehicle is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10\/695,717; 10\/696,078; 10\/696,473; 10\/696,597 and 10\/696,692 all filed on Oct. 29, 2003, all commonly assigned to the assignee of the present application. The entire disclosures of each of the aforementioned patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference. While the text format storage and text processing implemented herein is described in connection with the VCSI host platform , it should be appreciated that the text format storage and text processing may be implemented (stored and executed) in any of a variety of electronic devices, preferably having processing capability and memory for storing the text format database and executing the text processing routine, including initiating any corresponding actions (e.g., executing an application using the determined text).","Referring to , vehicle  is generally illustrated in a driving scenario employing the text processing of the present invention for use in an airport travel related application, according to one example. The vehicle , equipped with electronics system and HMI , communicates via antenna  and cellular wireless communication with a communication tower . The communication tower , in turn, may communicate information with various remote communication systems. This may include a wired telephone connection to an airport , a cellular network connection to a shuttle bus , a wired telephone connection to a parking complex , and a wired telephone connection to one or more airlines . Additionally, the communication tower  may communicate with a metropolitan traffic service  and a weather service , both via wired telephone connections. Thus, the vehicle  is capable of communication information with various remote communication systems.","In the example given, text information acquired, such as by e-mail, calendar entries, to-do lists, or other sources, may be analyzed and employed in the airport travel related application to perform various functions. These functions may include polling airlines for flight times, polling a navigation system on the vehicle  to determine time needed to travel to the airport , and polling the airport  and\/or parking complex  for the time needed to park the vehicle , check-in to the airport, get through security, and get to the airport gate. When a user's calendar application determines it is time to depart for the airport , the application may notify the user. When the user starts the vehicle , the vehicle  may report its position and status information to the airline , airport , fueling station, drive-thru restaurant and other destinations. If it is determined that a passenger with a reservation is not able to make a particular airline flight, the airline  may acquire that information in time to fill the reserved seat. If the passenger arrives before the scheduled flight time, the airline  can be notified to hold the reserved seat. This will save the passenger and the airline time, money and anxiety, and may avoid wasted trips. In this example, the vehicle  utilizes several electronic devices and services such as a navigation system with route guidance, a cellular telephone or other wireless network technology, and a variety of information (e.g., calendar, itinerary information, etc.) residing on one or more portable devices, such as a PDA or cellular phone.","The text processing routine  looks at text strings found in personal information management (PIM) data, such as that commonly presented in personal calendar entries, to-do lists, e-mails, etc., to determine context (e.g., meeting, flight, doctor appointment, etc.) and to initiate one or more applications based on the data (information). Context is defined as a category (type) of information. Each context generally has a unique set of parameters. Some of the parameters may be unique to the individual user. In some cases, the user may be prompted for input if the data found in the original text string is insufficient. Once context has been determined, the data is compared to a text format pro forma(s) (such as an XML schema) to determine what data is needed to initiate one or more applications. The text format(s) generally includes patterns of predetermined characters, such as ASCII characters. The text processing routine  may look to the source of personalization information to determine which applications to initiate and whether or not to use default values.","XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is generally an ideal choice of text communication language because various industries use XML schemas to define standard parameters necessary for interaction with others. These and other text format schemas can serve as a pro forma that help conceptualize data and link such data with related services. If the text data is tagged based on definitions used by a given industry, the text messages sent will be compatible with the service provider. In the example of a mass transit flight application, the airline industry typically communicates text in a standard XML schema that is readily recognized throughout that industry. This includes the communication of text in a predetermined standard text format.","Once a personal calendar or other source for personal information has been accessed or uploaded into the vehicle , a context agent reviews the text information contained therein. The text information is compared against one or more text format pro formas (XML schema) to determine the type of entry and what is needed before contacting the airline and\/or other related service providers. For example, if the entry contains text that describes a flight number, departure time\/date, and\/or airline name, the text processing system can conclude that this text is a flight and run any necessary applications. The electronics system can then verify flight departure time and gate information, make a parking reservation, check weather, and do anything else the individual user needs done.","If there is inadequate text data to determine context, the context agent can narrow the scope to possible context and prompt the driver for clarification or connect to one or more off-board sources to determine the proper context. For example, if the text entry appears to have a flight time or number and the name of an airline, the text processing system can contact the airline to verify that the flight exists and fill in the rest of the text data from the response.","According to the above-described airline travel application, examples of text data that may be useful for service applications in such a travel scenario include the following: airline name, flight number, time of departure, arrival time, confirmation number, gate, terminal, flight destination, check list, parking area, route, estimated time of arrival (ETA), vehicle status, as well as other text fields. For each type of industry, there may exist various required fields of text data that are necessary to complete the information. These fields of text data may be provided in a standard text format accepted by that industry. Known text formats may be loaded into the memory  and stored in the text format database . Whenever the vehicle , any device, or service processes an application involving another device or service, any new text formats may be downloaded into the text format database  and processed by the text processing routine .","Referring to , the text processing routine  is generally illustrated for analyzing text information, tagging identified text information, and applying the tagged text information to one or more applications. The text processing routine  begins at step  and proceeds to acquire a text string in step . A string of text may be acquired via various electronic devices (including services) available onboard and off the vehicle . For example, a text string may be acquired from an e-mail message, a calendar entry, a to-do list, textual or voice translated communications, and other sources of text information that are available.","When a text string includes identification of its text format, the identified text format provided is used. In this situation, the text may already be tagged or may subsequently be tagged to identify its text format. When no such text format is provided, the text processing routine  performs a routine  to determine the text entry type as explained in connection with the flow diagram in . Following determination of the text entry type, text processing routine  performs a routine  to check for the completeness of the determined text entry type as explained in connection with the flow diagram shown in . Thereafter, text processing routine  initiates (enters) an appropriate tree application pursuant to routine  for the determined text entry type. The entry tree application may include applying the tagged data to one or more applications, such as that shown in the flow diagram in .","The routine  for determining entry type is illustrated in greater detail in . Routine  begins at step  and proceeds to receive the text string in step . The data in the text string is then parsed based on delimiters (e.g., XML schema) in step . The delimiters may look for recognizable format types and break the text into parts. Following the parsing of the text string data, the delimited elements of the parsed text data are compared to defined text data types in step . This includes comparing the text element types to the known text formats stored in database . According to one embodiment, the comparison may be achieved by use of pattern recognition. Whenever a service or application(s) is employed which has a new text format, the new text format may be downloaded into the text format database  and used to compare to future parsed text elements.","Once the text data has been compared to defined data format types, routine  assigns tags (e.g., XML tags) to the text data in step . The assigned tags identify the text format associated with the text string. Examples of a tag may include a label or parameter name, which may be applied in XML or other software language.","Proceeding to decision step , routine  checks whether a sufficient number of minimum fields have been acquired to determine the type of text identified. If the minimum number of fields have been acquired, routine  returns the tagged data and entry type in step , before returning to the text processing routine  in step .","If the minimum number of fields have not been acquired to determine the type of text identified, routine  proceeds to step  to re-parse the text data based on patterns. The patterns may include time, date, name, e-mail address and any other data that may relate to available services or applications. The re-parsed text elements are then compared to the defined text format types set forth in the text format database.","The system and method of the present invention uses the analysis of predefined ASCII characters, according to one embodiment, to find values that are missing for a number of parameters (or variables) needed by available services. For instance, in the flight scenario the application (service) needs to know the flight number, flight time, airline, etc. These parameters have no values initially, but are registered as parameters related to an available service. The text processing system recognizes the text pattern and associates the recognized text pattern with one of these parameters. Then, the parameter (with appropriate value assigned) is made available to the application (service).","According to one example, if the following context information is determined: FLIGHT_NUMBER=\u201c \u201d, after evaluating the text in a calendar entry, the text processing system can determine FLIGHT_NUMBER=\u201c2374.\u201d Likewise, if the determined context is a flight, the text processing system can look for capitalized names and find that AIRLINE=\u201cNorthwest.\u201d These and other elements are passed to the application (service). They might also be represented in the following format \u201cAIRLINE (Northwest)\u201d in XML.","Next, in step , tags are assigned to the re-parsed data elements. At this point, routine  again checks for whether there have been a minimum number of fields acquired to determine the type identified. If a minimum number of fields have been acquired, routine  returns the tagged text data and entry type in step , before returning to the text processing routine  in step . If the minimum number of fields have not been acquired, routine  will prompt the user for an entry type in step . This may include asking a user to enter the text entry type or may include providing multiple text entry type selections for a user to choose from. If the user enters the entry type, the tagged text data and entry type are returned in step  before returning to the text processing routine  in step .","Once the text entry type is determined, routine  is performed as shown in . Routine  begins with step  and proceeds to receive the text data and entry type in step , and then compares text elements to the text format pro forma in step . This may include comparing text elements to an XML schema or other known text format pro forma(s). Routine  then identifies any known missing data in step . For example, in an airline travel application, more data may be required to launch the application. This missing data can be acquired from other sources or from the user.","Routine  proceeds to decision step  to determine if the missing text data can be acquired. If the missing text data can be acquired, routine  proceeds to step  to connect to the appropriate type tree application before returning in step . If the missing text data cannot be acquired, routine  proceeds to prompt the user for the required data in step . Once the user provides the required data, routine  connects to the appropriate type tree application in step  before returning to the text processing routine  in step .","One example of an appropriate type tree application is provided in routine  illustrated in . Routine  begins at step  and proceeds to receive the tagged text data in step . Next, routine  determines any missing text data in step  and then checks personalization data for desired services and\/or providers in step . In the example shown, routine  proceeds to contact an airline or other preferred provider to get any missing data in step . The acquired missing data is then presented to the user in step .","Routine  determines whether there are other services employing useful applications that are desired and, if not, returns in step . If other services are desired, routine  prompts the user for input in step . Following input from the user, routine  contacts the desired service(s) and transfers the requests in step , before returning to text processing routine  in step .","Accordingly, the system and method of the present invention advantageously analyzes text information and determines the text format corresponding to the text information. By determining the type of text format corresponding to the text information, the system and method can make the text information available to other applications, thereby providing for a more integrated system, which is particularly useful on a vehicle. While the system and method have been described in connection with use onboard a vehicle , it should be appreciated that the system and method of the present invention may also be employed off-board vehicles.","It will be understood by those who practice the invention and those skilled in the art, that various modifications and improvements may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit of the disclosed concept. The scope of protection afforded is to be determined by the claims and by the breadth of interpretation allowed by law."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
