title: System and method for probabilistic relational clustering
abstract: Relational clustering has attracted more and more attention due to its phenomenal impact in various important applications which involve multi-type interrelated data objects, such as Web mining, search marketing, bioinformatics, citation analysis, and epidemiology. A probabilistic model is presented for relational clustering, which also provides a principal framework to unify various important clustering tasks including traditional attributes-based clustering, semi-supervised clustering, co-clustering and graph clustering. The model seeks to identify cluster structures for each type of data objects and interaction patterns between different types of objects. Under this model, parametric hard and soft relational clustering algorithms are provided under a large number of exponential family distributions. The algorithms are applicable to relational data of various structures and at the same time unify a number of state-of-the-art clustering algorithms: co-clustering algorithms, the k-partite graph clustering, and semi-supervised clustering based on hidden Markov random fields.

The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.","1. Introduction","Most clustering approaches in the literature focus on \u201cflat\u201d data in which each data object is represented as a fixed-length attribute vector [38]. However, many real-world data sets are much richer in structure, involving objects of multiple types that are related to each other, such as documents and words in a text corpus, Web pages, search queries and Web users in a Web search system, and shops, customers, suppliers, shareholders and advertisement media in a marketing system.","In general, relational data contain three types of information, attributes for individual objects, homogeneous relations between objects of the same type, heterogeneous relations between objects of different types. For example, for a scientific publication relational data set of papers and authors, the personal information such as affiliation for authors are attributes; the citation relations among papers are homogeneous relations; the authorship relations between papers and authors are heterogeneous relations. Such data violate the classic independently and identically distributed (IID) assumption in machine learning and statistics and present huge challenges to traditional clustering approaches. An intuitive solution is that we transform relational data into flat data and then cluster each type of objects independently. However, this may not work well due to the following reasons.","First, the transformation causes the loss of relation and structure information [14]. Second, traditional clustering approaches are unable to tackle influence propagation in clustering relational data, i.e., the hidden patterns of different types of objects could affect each other both directly and indirectly (pass along relation chains). Third, in some data mining applications, users are not only interested in the hidden structure for each type of objects, but also interaction patterns involving multi-types of objects. For example, in document clustering, in addition to document clusters and word clusters, the relationship between document clusters and word clusters is also useful information. It is difficult to discover such interaction patterns by clustering each type of objects individually.","Moreover, a number of important clustering problems, which have been of intensive interest in the literature, can be viewed as special cases of relational clustering. For example, graph clustering (partitioning) [7, 42, 13, 6, 20, 28] can be viewed as clustering on singly-type relational data consisting of only homogeneous relations (represented as a graph affinity matrix); co-clustering [12, 2] which arises in important applications such as document clustering and micro-array data clustering, can be formulated as clustering on bi-type relational data consisting of only heterogeneous relations.","Recently, semi-supervised clustering [46, 4] has attracted significant attention, which is a special type of clustering using both labeled and unlabeled data. Therefore, relational data present not only huge challenges to traditional unsupervised clustering approaches, but also great need for theoretical unification of various clustering tasks.","2. Related Work","Clustering on a special case of relational data, bi-type relational data consisting of only heterogeneous relations, such as the word-document data, is called co-clustering or bi-clustering. Several previous efforts related to co-clustering are model based [22, 23]. Spectral graph partitioning has also been applied to bi-type relational data [11, 25]. These algorithms formulate the data matrix as a bipartite graph and seek to find the optimal normalized cut for the graph.","Due to the nature of a bipartite graph, these algorithms have the restriction that the clusters from different types of objects must have one-to-one associations. Information-theory based co-clustering has also attracted attention in the literature. [12] proposes a co-clustering algorithm to maximize the mutual information between the clustered random variables subject to the constraints on the number of row and column clusters. A more generalized co-clustering framework is presented by [2] wherein any Bregman divergence can be used in the objective function. Recently, co-clustering has been addressed based on matrix factorization. [35] proposes an EM-like algorithm based on multiplicative updating rules.","Graph clustering (partitioning) clusters homogeneous data objects based on pairwise similarities, which can be viewed as homogeneous relations. Graph partitioning has been studied for decades and a number of different approaches, such as spectral approaches [7, 42, 13] and multilevel approaches [6, 20, 28], have been proposed. Some efforts [17, 43, 21, 21, 1] based on stochastic block modeling also focus on homogeneous relations. Compared with co-clustering and homogeneous-relation-based clustering, clustering on general relational data, which may consist of more than two types of data objects with various structures, has not been well studied in the literature. Several noticeable efforts are discussed as follows. [45, 19] extend the probabilistic relational model to the clustering scenario by introducing latent variables into the model; these models focus on using attribute information for clustering. [18] formulates star-structured relational data as a star-structured m-partite graph and develops an algorithm based on semi-definite programming to partition the graph. [34] formulates multi-type relational data as K-partite graphs and proposes a family of algorithms to identify the hidden structures of a k-partite graph by constructing a relation summary network to approximate the original k-partite graph under a broad range of distortion measures.","The above graph-based algorithms do not consider attribute information. Some efforts on relational clustering are based on inductive logic programming [37, 24, 31]. Based on the idea of mutual reinforcement clustering, [51] proposes a framework for clustering heterogeneous Web objects and [47] presents an approach to improve the cluster quality of interrelated data objects through an iterative reinforcement clustering process. There are no sound objective function and theoretical proof on the effectiveness and correctness (convergence) of the mutual reinforcement clustering. Some efforts [26, 50, 49, 5] in the literature focus on how to measure the similarities or choosing cross-relational attributes.","To summarize, the research on relational data clustering has attracted substantial attention, especially in the special cases of relational data. However, there is still limited and preliminary work on general relational data clustering.","Most clustering approaches in the literature focus on \u201cflat\u201d data in which each data object is represented as a fixed-length attribute vector.

Model Formulation","A probabilistic model is herein proposed for relational clustering, which also provides a principal framework to unify various important clustering tasks including traditional attributes-based clustering, semi-supervised clustering, co-clustering and graph clustering. The proposed model seeks to identify cluster structures for each type of data objects and interaction patterns between different types of objects. It is applicable to relational data of various structures. Under this model, parametric hard and soft relational clustering algorithms are provided under a large number of exponential family distributions. The algorithms are applicable to various relational data from various applications and at the same time unify a number of state-of-the-art clustering algorithms: co-clustering algorithms, the k-partite graph clustering, Bregman k-means, and semi-supervised clustering based on hidden Markov random fields.","With different compositions of three types of information, attributes, homogeneous relations and heterogeneous relations, relational data could have very different structures.  show three examples of the structures of relational data.  refers to a simple bi-type of relational data with only heterogeneous relations such as word-document data.  represents a bi-type data with all types of information, such as actor-movie data, in which actors (type 1) have attributes such as gender; actors are related to each other by collaboration in movies (homogeneous relations); actors are related to movies (type 2) by taking roles in movies (heterogeneous relations).  represents the data consisting of companies, customers, suppliers, share-holders and advertisement media, in which customers (type 5) have attributes.","A relational data set as a set of matrices is reprsented. Assume that a relational data set has m different types of data objects, x={x}, . . . , x{x}, where ndenotes the number of objects of the jth type and xdenotes the name of the pobject of the jtype. The observations of the relational data are represented as three sets of matrices, attribute matrices {F\u2208}, where ddenotes the dimension of attributes for the jtype objects and Fdenotes the attribute vector for object x; homogeneous relation matrices {S\u2208}, where Sdenotes the relation between xand x; heterogeneous relation matrices {R\u2208}, where Rdenotes the relation between xand x. The above representation is a general formulation. In real applications, not every type of object has attributes, homogeneous relations and heterogeneous relations. For example, the relational data set in  is represented by only one heterogeneous matrix R, and the one in  is represented by three matrices, F, Sand R. Moreover, for a specific clustering task, not use all available attributes and relations are used after feature or relation selection pre-processing.","Mixed membership models, which assume that each object has mixed membership denoting its association with classes, have been widely used in the applications involving soft classification [16], such as matching words and pictures [39], race genetic structures [39, 48], and classifying scientific publications [15].","A relational mixed membership model is provided to cluster relational data (referred to as mixed membership relational clustering or MMRC).","Assume that each type of objects Xklatent classes. The membership vectors for all the objects in Xare represented as a membership matrix \u039b\u2208[0,1]such that the sum of elements of each column \u039bis  and \u039bdenotes the membership vector for object x, i.e., \u039bdenotes the probability that object xassociates with the glatent class. The parameters of distributions to generate attributes, homogeneous relations and heterogeneous relations are expressed in matrix forms. Let \u0398\u2208denote the distribution parameter matrix for generating attributes Fsuch that \u0398denotes the parameter vector associated with the glatent class. Similarly, \u0393\u2208denotes the parameter matrix for generating homogeneous relations S; \u03b3\u2208denotes the parameter matrix for generating heterogeneous relations R. In summary, the parameters of MMRC model are \u03a9={{\u039b}, {\u0398}, {\u03b3}}.","In general, the meanings of the parameters, \u0398, \u039b, and \u03b3, depend on the specific distribution assumptions. However, in Section 4.1, it is shown that for a large number of exponential family distributions, these parameters can be formulated as expectations with intuitive interpretations.","Next, the latent variables are introduced into the model. For each object x, a latent cluster indicator vector is generated based on its membership parameter \u039b, which is denoted as C, i.e., C\u2208{0,1}is a latent indicator matrix for all the jtype objects in X.","Finally, we present the generative process of observations, {F}{S}, and {R}follows:","1. For each object x\n\n","2. For each object x\n\n","3. For each pair of objects xand x\n\n","4. For each pair of objects xand x\n\n","In the above generative process, a latent indicator vector for each object is generated based on multinomial distribution with the membership vector as parameters. Observations are generated independently conditioning on latent indicator variables. The parameters of condition distributions are formulated as products of the parameter matrices and latent indicators, i.e.,\n\n(,\u0398,\n\n((|()\u0393\n\nand\n\n(,\u03b3(|()\u03b3.\n","Under this formulation, an observation is sampled from the distributions of its associated latent classes. For example, if Cindicates that xis with the glatent class and Cindicates that xis with the hlatent class, then (C)\u03b3C=\u03b3. Hence, Pr(R|\u03b3implies that the relation between xand xis sampled by using the parameter \u03b3.","With matrix representation, the joint probability distribution over the observations and the latent variables can be formulated as follows,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Pr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03a8","\u03a9"],"mo":"\u2758"}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Pr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},{"mi":"\u039b","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}],"mo":"|"}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Pr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"F","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},"mo":"|","mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"\u0398","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mi":"Pr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"S","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}],"mo":"|"}}},"mi":"T"},{"mi":"\u0393","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"="},"mo":")"},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mi":"Pr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"R","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"ij"}},{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}}],"mo":"|"}}},"mi":"T"},{"mi":"\u03a5","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"ij"}},{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},"mo":")"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"i":["C",",{F",",{R","Pr","C","Pr","F","C","Pr","F","C","Pr","S","|C","C","Pr","S","|C","C"],"sup":["(j)","m","(j)","m","(ij)","m","(j)","(j)","n",{"sub2":"j"},"(j)","(j)","(j)","(j)","n",{"sub2":"j"},"(j)","(j)","(j)","(j)","(j)","T","(j)","(j)","n",{"sub2":"j"},"(j)","(j)","T","(j)","(j)","(ij)"],"sub":["j\u22121","j=1","i,j=1","p=1",".p","p=1",".p",".p","p,q=1","pq",".p",".q"]},"4. Algorithm Derivation","In this section, the parametric soft and hard relational clustering algorithms based on the MMRC model are derived under a large number of exponential family distributions.","4.1 MMRC with Exponential Families","To avoid clutter, instead of general relational data, relational data similar to the one in ) may be employed, which is a representative relational data set containing all three types of information for relational data, attributes, homogeneous relations and heterogeneous relations. However, the derivation and algorithms are applicable to general relational data. For the relational data set in ), there are two types of objects, one attribute matrix F, one homogeneous relation matrix S and one heterogeneous relation matrix R. Based on Eq.(1), we have the following likelihood function,\n\n(\u03a9|\u03a8)=(|\u039b)(|\u039b)()()\u0393)()\u2003\u2003(2)\n","One goal is to maximize the likelihood function in Eq. (2) to estimate unknown parameters.","For the likelihood function in Eq.(2), the specific forms of condition distributions for attributes and relations depend on specific applications. Presumably, for a specific likelihood function, a specific algorithm should be derived. However, a large number of useful distributions, such as normal distribution, Poisson distribution, and Bernoulli distributions, belong to exponential families and the distribution functions of exponential families can be formulated as a general form. This advantageous property facilitates derivation of a general EM algorithm for the MMRC model.","It is shown in the literature [3, 9] that there exists bijection between exponential families and Bregman divergences [40]. For example, the normal distribution, Bernoulli distribution, multinomial distribution and exponential distribution correspond to Euclidean distance, logistic loss, KL-divergence and Itakura-Satio distance, respectively. Based on the bijection, an exponential family density Pr(x) can always be formulated as the following expression with a Bregman divergence D,\n\n()=exp(\u2212())\u0192(),\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere \u0192(x) is a uniquely determined function for each exponential probability density, and \u03bc is the expectation parameter. Therefore, for the MMRC model under exponential family distributions:\n\n()=exp(\u2212())\u0192()\u2003\u2003(4)\n\n((())=exp(\u2212(()))\u0192()\u2003\u2003(5)\n\n(())=exp(\u2212(,())\u0192()\u2003\u2003(6)\n","In the above equations, a Bregman divergence of two matrices is defined as the sum of the Bregman divergence of each pair of elements from the two matrices. Another advantage of the above formulation is that under this formulation, the parameters, \u0398, \u039b, and \u03b3, are expectations of intuitive interpretations. \u0398 consists of center vectors of attributes; \u0393 provides an intuitive summary of cluster structure within the same type objects, since \u0393implies expectation relations between the gcluster and the hcluster of type 1 objects; similarly, \u03b3 provides an intuitive summary for cluster structures between the different type objects.

Since it is straightforward to apply the algorithm derivation to a relational data set of any structure, Algorithm 1 is proposed based on the input of a general relational data set. Despite that the input relational data could have various structures, EF-MMRC works simply as follows: in the E-step, EF-MMRC iteratively updates the posterior probabilities that an object is associated with the clusters (the Markov chain in Section 4.2); in the M-step, based on the current cluster association (posterior probabilities), the cluster representatives of attributes and relations are updated as the weighted mean of the observations no matter which exponential distributions are assumed.","Therefore, with the simplicity of the traditional centroid-based clustering algorithms, EF-MMRC is capable of making use of all attribute information and homogeneous and heterogenous relation information to learn hidden structures from various relational data. Since EF-MMRC simultaneously clusters multi-type interrelated objects, the cluster structures of different types of objects may interact with each other directly or indirectly during the clustering process to automatically deal with the influence propagation. Besides the local cluster structures for each type of objects, the output of EF-MMRC also provides the summary of the global hidden structure for the data, i.e., based on \u0393 and \u03b3, we know how the clusters of the same type and different types are related to each other. Furthermore, relational data from different applications may have different probabilistic distributions on the attributes and relations; it is easy for EF-MMRC to adapt to this situation by simply using different Bregman divergences corresponding to different exponential family distributions.","Algorithm 1 Exponential Family MMRC Algorithm\n\n","Method:\n\n","If we assume O(m) types of heterogeneous relations among m types of objects, which is typical in real applications, and let n=\u0398(n) and k=\u0398(k), the computational complexity of EF-MMRC can be shown to be O(tmnk) for t iterations. If the k-means algorithm are applied to each type of nodes individually by transforming the relations into attributes for each type of nodes, the total computational complexity is also O(tmnk).","4.4 Hard MMRC Algorithm","Due to its simplicity, scalability, and broad applicability, k-means algorithm has become one of the most popular clustering algorithms. Hence, it is desirable to extend k-means to relational data. Some efforts [47, 2, 12, 33] in the literature work in this direction. However, these approaches apply to only some special and simple cases of relational data, such as bi-type heterogeneous relational data.","As traditional k-means can be formulated as a hard version of Gaussian mixture model EM algorithm [29], the hard version of MMRC algorithm is presented as a general relational k-means algorithm (Algorithm 1 is herein referred to as \u201csoft EF-MMRC\u201d), which applies to various relational data.","To derive the hard version MMRC algorithm, soft membership parameters \u039bare omitted in the MMRC model (Cin the model provides the hard membership for each object). Next, the computation of the posterior probabilities in the E-step is changed to a reassignment procedure, i.e., in the E-step, based on the estimation of the current parameters, cluster labels, {C}, are reassigned to maximize the objective function in (9). In particular, for each object, while fixing the cluster assignments of all other objects, each cluster is assigned to find the optimal cluster assignment maximizing the objective function in (9), which is equivalent to minimizing the Bregman distances between the observations and the corresponding expectation parameters. After all objects are assigned, the re-assignment process is repeated until no object changes its cluster assignment between two successive iterations.","In the M-step, the parameters are estimated based on the cluster assignments from the E-step. A simple way to derive the update rules is to follow the derivation in Section 4.3 but replace the posterior probabilities by its hard versions. For example, after the E-step, if the object xis assigned to the gcluster, i.e., C=1, then the posterior Pr(C)=1|F,S,R,{tilde over (\u03a9)}=1 and Pr(C)=1|F,S,R,{tilde over (\u03a9)}=0 for h\u2260g.","Using the hard versions of the posterior probabilities, the following update rule is derived:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0135"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00022","num":"00022"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":"\u0398","mrow":[{"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"g"},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":":","msubsup":{"mi":["C","gp"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}},"mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":"F","mrow":[{"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"p"},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}]}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"msub":{"mi":["n","j"]}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["C","gp"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}}]},"mo":"."}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"27"}}]}}}}},"In the above update rule, since \u03a3Cis the size of the gcluster, \u0398is actually updated as the mean of the attribute vectors of the objects assigned to the gcluster.

In the data, actors are related to each other by collaboration (homogeneous relations); actors are related to movies by taking roles in movies (heterogeneous relations); movies have attributes such as release time and rating (note that there is no links between movies). Hence the data have all the three types of information. A data set of 20000 actors and 4000 movies is formulated. Experiments were run with k=200. Although there is no ground truth for the data's cluster structure, it may be observed that most resulting clusters that are actors or movies of the similar style such as action, or tight groups from specific movie serials. For example, Table 4 shows cluster 23 of actors and cluster 118 of movies; the parameter \u03b3shows that these two clusters are strongly related to each other. In fact, the actor cluster contains the actors in the movie series \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d. Note that if we only have one type of actor objects, we only get the actor clusters, but with two types of nodes, although there are no links between the movies, we also get the related movie clusters to explain how the actors are related.","7. Conclusions","A probabilistic model is formulated for relational clustering, which provides a principal framework to unify various important clustering tasks including traditional attributes-based clustering, semi-supervised clustering, co-clustering and graph clustering. Under this model, parametric hard and soft relational clustering algorithms are presented under a large number of exponential family distributions. The algorithms are applicable to relational data of various structures and at the same time unify a number of state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.
