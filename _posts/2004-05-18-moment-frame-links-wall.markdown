{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to hysteretic damping for structures used in light-framed constructions, and in particular to a lateral bracing system constructed to provide a high degree of energy dissipation through hysteretic damping along with high initial stiffness so that energy is dissipated at low force thresholds within a light-framed construction.","2. Description of the Related Art","Shear stresses due to natural phenomena such as seismic activity and high winds can have devastating effects on the structural integrity of light-framed constructions. Lateral forces generated during such natural phenomena may cause the top portion of a wall to move laterally with respect to the bottom portion of the wall, which movement can result in damage or structural failure of the wall and, in some instances, collapse of the building.","In constructions such as residences and small buildings, lateral bracing systems were developed to counteract the potentially devastating effects of shear stress on the structural integrity of light-framed constructions. Although various designs are known, typical lateral bracing systems include vertical studs spaced from each other and affixed to horizontal top and bottom plates. The bottom plate is typically anchored to the floor diaphragm or foundation. The bracing system typically further includes sheathing affixed to the studs, upper plate and\/or lower plate to increase structural performance under lateral forces. The sheathing used may be oriented strand board (OSB) or plywood, but fiberboard, particleboard and drywall (gypsum board) are also used.","Alternatively or additionally, light-framed construction wall sections may include lateral bracing systems in the form of prefabricated shearwalls. Shearwalls within wall sections of light-framed constructions provide lateral stability and allow the lateral forces in the wall sections to be transmitted from the upper portions of the wall through the shearwalls to the floor diaphragm or foundation of the building where they are dissipated without structural effect on the wall or building.","Many conventional lateral bracing systems perform well initially under lateral loads, but yield and fail upon the repetitive lateral loads which often occur during significant seismic activity and high winds. Upon appreciable yield or failure of the lateral bracing system, the entire system must be replaced.","It is known to provide conventional high strength walls that are capable of withstanding significant lateral loads that occur during seismic and other events. However, such walls place high demands on foundation anchorage and the foundation itself. Namely, the holdown bolts and foundation must also be made strong enough to withstand the large forces transmitted from the wall as they are dissipated through the holdown bolts and into the foundation. Therefore, while stronger walls conventionally perform better under the seismic activity and other loads, conventional design requirements attendant stronger walls cascade throughout the entire structure, requiring stronger foundation anchorage and stronger foundations.","A further difficulty with conventional lateral bracing walls is that the corners of such walls tend to bind against their support surfaces under lateral loads.  shows a conventional shearwall  mounted at its bottom on a support surface  and at its top to a pair of top plates . A lateral force F as shown will result in a downward force F at point A and an upward force F at point B. Under high lateral loads, these upward and downward loads can damage the wall  and\/or the support structures above and below the wall.","It is, therefore, an advantage of the present invention to provide a lateral bracing structure having high initial stiffness.","It is another advantage of the present invention to provide a lateral bracing system including controlled and predictable deflection and load bearing characteristics of the wall member and controlled and predictable yield of the yield links.","It is a still further advantage of the present invention to provide a lateral bracing system where failure is limited to the yield links, which are easily replaced, thereby restoring the lateral bracing system to its full load bearing capacity.","It is another advantage of the present invention to provide a lateral bracing system capable of fitting between conventionally located wall studs, and which can be isolated from gravity loads.","These and other advantages are provided by the present invention, which in embodiments relates to a lateral bracing system for use in constructions such as light framed constructions. The lateral bracing includes a structural moment frame supported between an underlying support surface such as a building foundation and an upper support surface such as a top plate. The moment frame may be pivotally affixed to the underlying support surface by a pivot coupling, such as for example a pin joint. The moment frame may similarly be affixed to the upper support surface by a second pivot coupling.","The lateral bracing system may further include a pair of yield links affixed between the frame and the underlying surface, one such yield link on each side of the moment frame. The yield link is provided to yield under a lateral load applied to the structural frame. Upon such yielding, the pivot couplings allow the structural frame to pivot to dissipate stress from within the structural frame. The yield links have a yield point below that of the moment frame, and will yield under lateral forces exerted on the lateral bracing system before the moment frame. Thus, damage to the moment frame is prevented by allowing the moment frame to pivot and dissipate the energy within the moment frame which could otherwise damage the moment frame if it were allowed to build up beyond the yield point of the moment frame.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a second pair of yield links may be provided between the moment frame and the upper support surface to improve the rigidity of the structure while still allowing the links to yield prior to damage to the structural moment frame. In embodiments including one or two pairs of yield links, in the event the links are damaged upon yielding, the lateral bracing system may be restored to its virgin integrity and load bearing capabilities simply by removing and replacing the yield links. The structural frame need not be replaced.","In another alternative embodiment of the present invention, the lateral bracing system may consist of a vertical column element coupled to a horizontal beam element with a moment resisting joint. This moment resisting joint could consist of a central hinge, for example defined by a mounting element, with a pair of exterior yielding links, one on either side of the central hinge. The bending strength of the column and beam could be designed to exceed the moment capacity of the yielding links, thus restricting damage in a lateral event to the links only. Furthermore, the beam could be configured to either run over the top of the column, or frame into the side of the column, without impacting the performance of the connection via the yielding links.","Additionally, the moment resisting joint between the beam and column alleviates the need for a similar connection at the column base, at, for example, the foundation or lower floor. This means that forces that would otherwise be transmitted to the foundation or floor are drastically reduced, and energy dissipation of a lateral event would be contained within the frame and not rely on a yielding connection to the surrounding structure. Such a beam\/column configuration may be used in a variety of applications, such as for example at the structural opening at garage fronts in light frame constructions, or around windows in light frame constructions. In such an installation a column element could also be placed on either side of the beam element allowing for two energy dissipating joints in the assembly, each containing a pair of yielding links.","The present invention will now be described with reference to , which in embodiments of the invention relate to a lateral bracing system having high initial stiffness and including yield links capable of effectively dissipating shear stresses generated within the lateral bracing system under lateral loads. It is understood that the present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the invention to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents of these embodiments, which are included within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details.","Referring now to , there is shown a lateral bracing system  including a moment frame  and yield links . Moment frame  is a structural frame including a substantially flat planar diaphragm  bounded along each of its longitudinal edges by framing members . Diaphragm  and framing members  may each be formed of 7-gauge sheet steel (0.1875 inches). Other gauges, such as for example 10-gauge sheet steel, and other materials, such as for example sawn and\/or engineered lumber may be used in alternative embodiments. Additionally, instead of the diaphragm and framing members being separate pieces, the moment frame  may instead by formed of a single rolled steel section having a C-shape or Z-shape in a horizontal cross-section. While framing members are shown only along the two vertical edges of diaphragm , it is understood that the framing members may additionally extend around the top and\/or bottom edges of the diaphragm  in alternative embodiments.","Diaphragm  is mounted to a sill plate  by a pair of right angle brackets , formed for example of \u00bd inch thick steel plate. Each of the right angle brackets  includes a first section mounted on sill plate  as by welding and\/or bolting, and each bracket  includes a second portion extending up from the sill plate which are juxtaposed to each other in a spaced and parallel relation. The second portions of each of brackets  are spaced so as to receive a lower portion of diaphragm  therebetween. The diaphragm  may be fixed to the brackets  by a pivot coupling such as a pin joint formed by pin  () fixed within a hole formed in each of the second portions of bracket  and the lower portion of diaphragm . The pin joint allows pivoting of the moment frame under an applied lateral load. As explained hereinafter, the top of the moment frame may also be mounted to its support surface by a pin joint allowing pivoting of the moment frame under lateral loads.","The pin joint fixedly mounts the diaphragm  to the brackets  and sill plate , but prevents stress between the diaphragm and the brackets by allowing the diaphragm to pivot with respect to the brackets. Thus, together with the yield links (explained hereinafter), the pin joint prevents damage to the moment frame , by allowing the moment frame to pivot, thereby preventing the build-up of large sheer stresses within the moment frame  that would otherwise occur if the moment frame were constrained from pivoting.","The bottom portion of diaphragm  has edges which slope upward from a neutral longitudinal axis of diaphragm  to framing members  as shown in , ,  and A. The slope prevents contact or binding of portions of lateral bracing system  against the sill plate upon pivoting of the lateral bracing system under lateral loads. Such contact could otherwise damage the moment frame, sill plate and\/or the underlying surface. The angle of the slope may vary in alternative embodiments, from greater than zero degrees and higher from the horizontal, and from about 2\u00b0 to about 5\u00b0 in further embodiments. It is also contemplated that the bottom portion of the diaphragm  have no slope, but rather be horizontal to sill plate . Such an embodiment is shown for example in . In such an embodiment, the bottom edge of the diaphragm may be flush against or slightly spaced from the sill plate.","Sill plate  is in turn affixed to an underlying surface by anchors  as explained hereinafter. In embodiments of the invention, sill plate  may be formed of \u00bd-inch thick steel. It is understood that both sill plate  and right angle brackets  may be formed of thicknesses other than \u00bd-inch, and\/or materials other than steel, in alternative embodiments of the invention.","Yield links  are provided to dissipate shear stresses within lateral bracing system  generated by lateral loads, and to prevent the moment frame  from being damaged due to such sheer stresses. The lateral bracing system  exhibits high stiffness and rigidity for sheer stresses within the system below a threshold level. However, yield links  have a yield capacity below bending strength of moment frame , and will yield under lateral forces exerted on the lateral bracing system before moment frame .","A lateral force on bracing system  will result in upward and downward forces in the framing members  and along the longitudinal edges of the moment frame , as well as shear stresses within the moment frame around the neutral longitudinal axis of the moment frame. The upward and downward forces are transmitted to and borne by the yield links . However, at lateral forces above a predetermined threshold, the yield links will yield, allowing the moment frame to pivot around the pin joint(s) and dissipating the shear stresses from within the moment frame. The pivoting allowed by the pin joint(s) and the yielding of the yield links thus prevents damage to the moment frame which may have occurred if the shear stresses within the moment frame were allowed to exceed the yield point of the moment frame. As explained hereinafter, the yield links  have a design allowing them to yield stably under both tension yield and compression yield.","Embodiments of the present invention preferably include a pair of yield links , one on either side of moment frame . For ease of description, only one of the yield links  will be described hereinafter. However, it is understood that the yield links are identical to each other in embodiments of the present invention, and the following description applies to both yield links. It is understood that the yield links may not be identical to each other in alternative embodiments of the present invention. Moreover, it is contemplated that lateral bracing system  includes only one yield link  on either side of moment frame  in alternative embodiments of the invention.","A yield link  is preferably formed of a yield member  mounted to the lateral bracing system by an upper mount  and a lower mount . The yield member  may have ends which are threaded, so as to mate with threads within the upper and lower mounts ,  to affix the yield member to the mounts. In such an embodiment, the threads at opposite ends of yield member  may be oppositely facing so that the distance between mounts  and , and the forces within yield link , may be adjusted by rotating yield member . It is understood alternatively that yield member  may be affixed to upper and lower mounts ,  as by welding, bolting, gluing and\/or other affixation mechanisms.","Upper and lower mounts ,  are preferably formed of steel. Yield member  may be formed of mild steel, such as for example ASTM A36 steel. Other materials exhibiting stable yielding qualities and good energy absorption may alternatively be used for yield member , including other metals such as for example copper and bronze, and various polymers.","In embodiments of the present invention, a casing (not shown) may be provided around yield member  so that yield member  and the casing together form an element with not only stable tension yielding behavior, but also stable compression yielding behavior because of the prevention of buckling by the casing. The casing in such an embodiment may be formed of various materials, such as concrete, a variety of polymers, or wood. An embodiment where the casing is formed of wood is described in applicant's co-pending patent application Ser. No. 10\/848,346 entitled \u201cBUCKLING RESTRAINED BRACED FRAME\u201d which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Whether formed of yield member  by itself, or as part of a buckling restrained element, the yield member  will yield stably, controllably and predictably in tensile yields and\/or compression yields upon application of lateral loads above a threshold level. The threshold level at which the yield member will yield may also be controlled and predictable based on the configuration of the yield link. The thickness of the steel from which the yield member  is formed, as well as the length of the yield member, may be optimized by computer modeling to provide the desired performance and yield characteristics for yield links .","If the moment capacity of the joints is known by virtue of the link yield capacity and the physical geometry of the section, then the moment frame can be sized to exhibit elastic behavior even while the full inelastic strength of the links are being taxed. In one embodiment, yield member  may be formed of 1 inch diameter steel, and the upper and lower mounts may be separated a distance of 6 inches. However, it is understood that the desired configuration of the yield links may vary in alternative embodiment.","Moreover, although yield link  is shown including a straight length of circular steel in the figures, it is understood that yield link  may have various configurations in different embodiments of the present invention, with a provision that the yield link stably under lateral loads applied to lateral bracing system . For example, in one embodiment, the straight yield member  may be replaced by a length of steel having a variety of configurations that will allow yield link  to stably yield under lateral loads above predictable levels. The yield member  may include bends or a helix. It may also have cross-sectional shapes other than round in alternative embodiments, such as for example that shown in , discussed hereinafter.","Upper mount  may be affixed to frame member  as by welding, bolting, gluing and\/or other affixation mechanisms. Lower mount  may be affixed to sill plate  by mounting plates , which may be steel plates affixed to opposed sides of lower mount . Mounting plates  may in turn be bolted to a U-shaped channel  by a pin joint including pin  fixed within holes formed in opposed mounting plates  and opposed sidewalls of U-shaped channel . The pin joint allows pivoting of yield link  with respect to the U-shaped channel  and sill plate  to prevent generation of sheer stresses between yield link  and U-shaped channel .","It is understood that lower mount  may be affixed to sill plate , either directly or indirectly, by other mechanisms in alternative embodiments of the present invention. For example, in one such alternative embodiment, the mounting plates  may be omitted, and a hole formed through the lower mount so as to allow the lower mount to be affixed to the U-shaped channel  by pin . Moreover, it is understood that the pin joint may be omitted in an alternative embodiment, so that the lower mount  is affixed to the sill plate  without the ability to freely pivot with respect to the sill plate. It is further understood that the upper mount  may be affixed to the frame member  by a pin joint between the upper mount and the frame member instead of or in addition to the pin joint mounting the lower mount  to the sill plate .","An alternative embodiment of a yield link in accordance with the present invention is shown in . The yield link  according to this embodiment may be formed from one or more flat plate elements  that are affixed at one end to the frame member  by bolts, welding, gluing and\/or other affixation means, and at the opposite end to the sill plate  by bolts, welding, gluing and\/or other affixation means. The flat plate element(s) may have a constant cross-sectional shape, or the element(s) may have a central tapered midsection  similar to a milled steel coupon sample. A buckling restraint stiffener  as shown may further be provided. The buckling restraint stiffener  may be affixed to the frame member  as by bolting, welding, gluing and\/or other affixation means. The buckling restraint stiffener shown has a corrugated cross-section, but it is understood that other cross-sections may be provided to effectively restrain the flat plate element  from buckling under compressive loads.","Sill plate  is mounted on an underlying support surface  by means of anchors . In the embodiment shown, the underlying support surface  comprises a concrete foundation, but it is understood that underlying support surface  may be any surface on which a conventional lateral bracing system may be located, for example, a floor diaphragm on the building foundation or a floor diaphragm on a top plate of a lower floor. Anchors  may be conventional anchors for mounting a wall section to underlying support surface , and depending on the nature of support surface , anchors  may be for example strap anchors, mud sill anchors, retrofit bolts, foundation plate hold downs, straps, ties, nails, screws, framing anchors, plates or a combination thereof.","The bracing system  may be attached to one or more top plates , as by bolts fitting through the top plates and into moment frame . It is understood that the bracing system  may be affixed to top plates  by other mechanisms in alternative embodiments.","One such alternative embodiment for affixing bracing system  to top plates  is shown in . The embodiment shown in  is substantially similar to the embodiments disclosed with respect to , with the exception that moment frame  is affixed to top plates  via a pivot coupling such as a pin joint. In particular, the moment frame may be affixed to the top plates by a pair of right angle brackets  similar in structure and operation to right angle brackets . A pin  is received within aligned holes formed through brackets  and a top portion of diaphragm  to affix the moment frame  to top plates . The pin joint allows pivoting of lateral bracing system  with respect to top plates  without generating sheer stresses in the diaphragm  or top plates . Thus, upon yielding of the yield links as previously explained, damage to the moment frame is prevented by allowing the moment frame to pivot and dissipate the energy within the moment frame which could otherwise damage the moment frame if it were allowed to build up beyond the yield point of the moment frame.","In embodiments, the top portion of diaphragm  has edges which slope downward from a neutral longitudinal axis of diaphragm  to framing members  as shown in . The slope prevents contact or binding of portions of lateral bracing system  against top plates  upon pivoting of the lateral bracing system under lateral loads.","As is further shown in , the aligned holes formed in respective brackets  for receiving pin  have an oblong shape. This shape significantly or entirely prevents vertical loads from top plates  from being transmitted to lateral bracing system . Thus, only lateral loads are transmitted. As explained hereinafter, the decoupling of vertical loads allows for easier control and predictability of the yield links performance.","As seen in , the diaphragm  has longitudinal edges and framing members  which slope inward from bottom to top, for example, 2 to 10 degrees from vertical. It is understood that the edge may be vertical (i.e. 0 degree slope) in alternative embodiments. It is understood that the embodiments described with respect to  above, and  below may have similarly sloped edges.","A further alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in . The embodiment shown in  is similar to the embodiments described above with respect to , with the exception that a second pair of yield links  are provided. Yield links  are mounted between moment frame  and top plates , and are structurally and operationally similar to yield links . Yield links  and  together with framing members  define a structural frame providing high initial stiffness and stable, controlled and predictable yielding under lateral forces above a predetermined threshold level. The addition of the second pair of yield links improves the rigidity of the structure while still allowing the links to yield prior to damage to the structural moment frame. It is understood that yield links  may be omitted in alternative embodiments leaving only yield links  at the top of the moment frame.","The width of the lateral bracing system  may be such that it fits in between support studs formed in a wall. Thus, a plurality of lateral bracing systems according to the present invention may be provided within a wall to greatly enhance the ability of the wall to withstand lateral loads and sheer stresses. In one embodiment, the width of the lateral bracing system may be approximately 14 inches. However, the width may be greater than or less than 14 inches in alternative embodiments. Moreover, the lateral bracing system  need not fit between support studs in alternative embodiments.","In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention described above with respect to , lateral bracing system  has sufficient stiffness and rigidity to provide a high degree of resistance to deflection under applied lateral loads. However, at lateral loads above a controllable and predictable level, the structure of the present invention provides for stable yielding of the yield links and deflection of the moment frame. In this way, the applied lateral loads are hysteretically dampened from the system, and a high degree of energy is dissipated, thereby preventing damage to the moment frame .","Moreover, the energy dissipation provided by the yield links described above allows the lateral bracing system  to be designed to withstand lower sheer forces in comparison to conventional systems of similar dimensions. This translates into lower design forces for the anchors and underlying support surface as well. Thus, the reduction in design forces within lateral bracing system due to the yield links \/\/ cascades throughout the entire design.","Furthermore, isolating the vertical loads with the pin joints at the top and\/or bottom of the lateral bracing system allows for easy and predictable control of various parameters of the lateral bracing system, including for example the initial stiffness of the lateral bracing system, the amount of deflection the top of the wall may undergo, the amount of force required before the yield links will yield, and peak anchor bolt demands. Moreover, the energy dissipation and stable yielding of the yield links allow the system  to withstand repeated deflection under lateral loads without failure.","In the event the links are damaged upon yielding, the lateral bracing system may be restored to its virgin integrity and load bearing capabilities simply by removing and replacing the yield links. The structural frame remains intact and need not be replaced.","In embodiments of the present invention discussed thus far, the lateral bracing system  has been comprised of a moment frame having yield links affixed to either side. In further embodiments of the present invention, the lateral bracing system  may be formed of a vertical column affixed to a horizontal beam by a moment resisting joint comprised of a central mounting element and yield links on either side of the mounting element. The moment resisting joint provides moment and displacement resistance between the beam and column, while allowing stable yield upon high lateral forces. Such embodiments are shown and described hereinafter with reference to .","Referring to , there is shown a lateral bracing system  including a vertical column  affixed to a horizontal beam  by a moment resisting joint  comprised of a central mounting element  and yield links . Although referred to as a vertical column and a horizontal beam, it is understood that the column and beam may be affixed to each other by a moment resisting joint at angles other than 90\u00b0 in alternative embodiments. The moment resisting joint includes yield links , for example as shown and described above with reference to . In the embodiment shown, an end of the beam is mounted onto the side of the column via an end plate . In such an embodiment, the pair of yield links  may be provided on top and bottom horizontal flanges of the beam  between the beam and the end plate. However, as explained hereinafter, the beam may alternatively be on top of the column so that an end of the column is mounted to a flange of the beam via an end plate. In such embodiments, the yield links  would be provided on respective vertical flanges between the column and the end plate.","As seen in , the beam  may include a central diaphragm with sloping edges as shown and as described above. A central point of the diaphragm may be affixed to end plate  via a mounting element . The mounting element  may be no more than a welded seam, such as shown in . However, it is understood that the central diaphragm of the beam may be affixed to the end plate by other types of mounting elements, such as for example a pair of brackets having a pin joint () or a pair of brackets or plates not having a pin joint, but instead simply affixing the diaphragm to the end plate as by bolts, welds, gluing and\/or other affixation means (). The end plate  is in turn affixed to a vertical flange of the column  via bolts , welding, gluing and\/or other affixation means. The yield links shown in  are those described above with respect to . However, it is understood that any configuration of yield link described herein may be used in the embodiments described with reference to .","In order to provide greater load-bearing capabilities at the joint between the column and beam, stiffeners  may be welded, bolted, glued and\/or otherwise affixed to the central diaphragm and flange of the column . As seen in , the stiffeners  are structural pieces that extend perpendicularly from the opposed surfaces of the central diaphragm and flange on both the front and back surfaces of the diaphragm. Four such stiffeners are shown in . The stiffeners may extend partly across the column diaphragm as shown, or entirely across the diaphragm.  shows an alternative system to improve the load-bearing capabilities at the joint between the column and beam. As shown therein, the portion  of the vertical flange in contact with the end plate  may be made thicker. This may be done by removing the top portion of the flange and replacing it with a thicker member, or otherwise fortifying the top portion of the flange. The portion  may be used instead of or in addition to the stiffeners . It is further understood that the stiffeners  and\/or thicker portion  may be omitted in embodiments of the present invention.","The moment resisting joint shown in  provides high initial stiffness and resistance to relative movement between the column  and the beam  under lateral loads, but provides stable yielding under lateral loads above a controllable level. In particular, bending strength of the column and beam could be designed to exceed the moment capacity of the yield links. Thus, the yield links  yield under lateral loads before bending or deformation of the column or beam, and any damage is limited to the yield links which may be easily removed and replaced. Furthermore, the beam could be configured to either run over the top of the column, or frame into the side of the column, without impacting the performance of the connection via the yielding links.","Additionally, the moment resisting joint between the beam and column alleviates the need for a similar connection at the column base, at, for example, the foundation or lower floor. This means that forces that would otherwise be transmitted to the foundation or floor are drastically reduced, and energy dissipation of a lateral event would be contained within the frame and not rely on a yielding connection to the surrounding structure. Such a beam\/column configuration may be used in a variety of applications, such as for example at the structural opening at garage fronts in light frame constructions, or around windows in light frame constructions. In such an installation a column element could also be placed on either side of the beam element allowing for two energy dissipating joints in the assembly, each containing of a pair of yielding links.","In embodiments of the invention, it is understood that the portion of the central diaphragm which affixes to the sill plate () or endplate () need not have sloping edges. Such an embodiment is shown in . In this embodiment, the central diaphragm of the beam may affix to the endplate as by a mounting element  in the form of a plate which is bolted to the central diaphragm and welded to the endplate. It is understood that the mounting element  may be affixed to both the central diaphragm and endplate by bolting, welding, gluing and\/or other mounting means in alternative embodiments. As best seen in , a slight space may be left between the end of the beam  and endplate  to allow rotation between the beam and column upon high lateral loads and yielding of the yield links without binding between the column and beam. It is understood that the moment frame  of  may also be affixed at its top or bottom with a configuration as shown and described with respect to .","Although the invention has been described in detail herein, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments herein disclosed. Various changes, substitutions and modifications may be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as described and defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will now be described with reference to the figures, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 13 through 15","FIGS. 10-12"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
