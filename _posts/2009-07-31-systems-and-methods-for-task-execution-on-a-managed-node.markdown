{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to out-of-band updates and more particularly to systems and methods for task execution on a managed node over an out-of-band channel.","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and\/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as, but not limited to, financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.","Many information handling systems are currently used for and\/or include devices for wireless communications. For example, an information handling system may be cell phone, smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and\/or another similar portable wireless device that may be used for wireless communication via, for example, a carrier. As another example, the information handling system may be a computer, laptop, notebook, or other device that may include one or more wireless cards for wireless communications via any number of different wireless communication protocols, e.g., wireless LAN (WLAN), wireless WAN (WWAN), Bluetooth, Ultra Wide-Band, global positioning system (GPS), etc.","With the introduction of out-of-band (OOB) management technologies, it is becoming possible to perform management tasks on the information handling system without the knowledge or approval of the end user. While the capabilities provide some advantages, concerns of battery life preservation for the information handling system remain. Furthermore, certain tasks, e.g., a BIOS flash task, may be non-recoverable if an error such as, for example, the powering off of the information handling system due to low battery life occurs.","In accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure, a management controller for managing execution of a task on a managed node coupled to the management controller is provided. The management controller may be configured to determine at least one execution policy for a task, schedule the task for execution, receive system information data from the managed node, based at least on the received system information, determine if the received system information complies with the at least one execution policy, and if the received information complies with the at least one execution policy, forward the task from the management controller to the managed node for execution.","In accordance with other embodiments of the present disclosure, a method for managing execution of a task on a managed node is provided. The method may include, determining, by a management controller communicatively coupled to the managed node, at least one execution policy for the task, scheduling, by the management controller, a task for execution, receiving system information from the managed node, based at least on the received system information, determining, by the management controller, if the received system information complies with the at least one execution policy, and if the received system information complies with the at least one execution policy, forwarding the task from the task server to the managed node for execution.","In accordance with other embodiments of the present disclosure, an information handling system may include a processor, memory coupled to the processor, and a management controller coupled to the processor. The management controller may be configured to determine at least one execution policy for a task, schedule the task for execution, receive system information data from a managed node communicatively coupled to the information handling system, based at least on the received system information, determine if the system information complies with the at least one execution policy, and if the received system information complies with the at least one execution policy, forward the task to the managed node for execution.","Preferred embodiments and their advantages are best understood by reference to , wherein like numbers are used to indicate like and corresponding parts.","For purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes. For example, an information handling system may be a personal computer, a network storage device, or any other suitable device and may vary in size, shape, performance, functionality, and price. The information handling system may include random access memory (RAM), one or more processing resources such as a central processing unit (CPU) or hardware or software control logic, ROM, and\/or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the information handling system may include one or more disk drives, one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output (I\/O) devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, and\/or a video display. The information handling system may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","120","100","102","120"]},"Management node  may be a server (e.g., a network management server), database, or other information handling system that may be remotely coupled to managed node  via one or more channels . Management node  may include a processor , memory , and a management controller . Processor  may comprise any system, device, or apparatus operable to interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data, and may include, without limitation, a microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor (DSP), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other digital or analog circuitry configured to interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data.

In some embodiments, memory  may store program instructions, task(s) , policy(ies)  data, and\/or other data.","Management controller  may include any system, device, apparatus, firmware, and\/or application (e.g., a program of instructions executable by a processor, for example, processor ) configured to receive, generate, and\/or profile tasks (e.g., determine characteristics of the generated or received tasks) for execution by a task server  coupled to controller , wherein each task  may include one or more corresponding policies  associated with task . Details of the one or more policies are described in greater detail below. For purposes of this disclosure, a task may include a software update, a firmware update, a security patch, an operating system update, a network update, a multimedia download and\/or installation, and\/or other suitable updates, downloads, fixes, etc., for managed node .","Management controller  and\/or task server , in generating and\/or profiling task , may determine a run time for task . In one embodiment, the run time may be an estimation. In the same or alternative embodiments, the run time may be established by executing task  and determining the time period required to complete task  (e.g., by determining an average based on several executions of task ). Task  and its determined run time may be stored in memory .","In some embodiments, the run time may also be provided by a vendor who generated a particular task . A vendor-provided task  may be provided to management node  and stored, for example, in memory . Upon execution of vendor-provided task , processor  may access vendor-provided task  from memory , and may provide the vendor-provided task  to management controller  and\/or task server .","Task server  may be coupled to or integrated with management controller  and may be any system, device, apparatus, firmware, and\/or (e.g., a program of instructions executable by a processor) configured to create and\/or receive one or more policies  associated with each task . For example, task server  may determine the time needed to execute task , the available network bandwidth between management node  and managed node , and\/or the type of task (e.g., a security patch task, a firmware update task, a software update task, etc.). Based at least on the determination made by task server , one or more policies may be generated for each task .","Task server  and\/or an administrator of management node  may also create one or more policies  based on the criticality of task . For example, if task  is a critical security patch, a policy  may be created to allow task  to run on managed node  even if the battery life of the managed node  would be depleted upon completion of the executed task. The one or more policies may subsequently be stored in memory .","In some embodiments, management controller  and\/or task server  may calculate the network bandwidth between management node  and managed node . The calculated network bandwidth may be used to determine how long it may take to send a scheduled task  to managed node  and as such, a total execution time of scheduled task .","Managed node  may be coupled to management node  via channels  (e.g., in-band channels and\/or out-of-band channels) and may be configured to receive and\/or execute tasks from management node . In some embodiments, managed node  may be an information handling system. For example, managed node  may be a portable information handling system (e.g., a tablet computer, a notebook computer, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), etc.).","Managed node  may include processor , memory , management system , and battery . Processor  may comprise any system, device, or apparatus operable to interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data, and may include, without limitation, a microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor (DSP), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other digital or analog circuitry configured to interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data. In some embodiments, processor  may interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data, for example, data stored in memory  and\/or another component of system . Processor  may output results via graphical user interfaces (GUIs), websites, and the like via a display, over channels  (e.g., out of band channels and\/or in-band channels), and\/or over a network port.","Memory  may be coupled to management system  and\/or processor  and may comprise any system, device, or apparatus operable to retain program instructions or data for a period of time. Memory  may include random access memory (RAM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), a PCMCIA card, flash memory, or any suitable selection and\/or array of volatile or non-volatile memory configured to retain data after power to managed node  is turned off. In some embodiments, memory  may store program instructions and\/or other data.","Management system  coupled to processor  may be any system, device, apparatus, firmware, and\/or application (e.g., a program of instructions executable by a processor) configured to determine, among other things, information regarding managed node . For example, management system  may determine an estimated availability (e.g., battery life of battery ) and\/or network connectivity information of managed node . In some embodiments, management system  may be an out-of-band management controller. In the same or alternative embodiments, management system  may be a set of instructions of an operating system executed by processor  on managed node .","Management agent  may be coupled to or integrated with management system  and may be any system, device, apparatus, firmware, and\/or (e.g., a program of instructions executable by a processor, for example, processor ) configured to collect data requested by, for example, management controller  of management node . In some embodiments, management agent , separately or combined with management system  may determine various information regarding managed node  and provide the information to management node . For example, management agent  and\/or management system  may determine an estimated availability time, network connectivity information, and\/or other information related to managed node  and may forward the information as requested by management node  via channel(s) .","To determine the estimated availability time of managed node , management system  and\/or management agent  may, for example, determine the capacitance rating of battery  and\/or the current consumption of managed node . Management system  may determine the amount of battery life remaining in terms of the number of minutes of battery life remaining, percentage of battery life remaining, and\/or other appropriate metric.","In the same or alternative embodiments, management system  and\/or management agent  may use an operating system (OS) running on managed node , and in particular, may use an interface of the OS (e.g., application programming interface, API) to determine the battery life data of battery . Any other suitable techniques to determine the battery life data may also be used.","Management system  and\/or management agent  may also receive a request from management node , for example, from management controller  and\/or task server , to determine how long managed node  is likely to stay coupled to a network. Management agent  may prompt a user of managed node  via, for example, a user interface. Alternatively, management agent  may use historical data maintained and stored in memory  that provides average usage data, network data, and\/or other network connectivity data of managed node . For example, the historical data may include physical location information for managed node  with location sensing capabilities. The physical location information may enable management controller  to determine if network connectivity is available for the physical location. As another example, the historical data may include network information (e.g., DHCP server MAC, network domain, wireless network identification, etc.). The network connectivity information may be forwarded via channel(s)  to management node .","Battery  may include any system, device, or apparatus configured to store electrochemical, electromechanical, or other forms of energy and may provide electrical energy to one or more components of managed node . In some embodiments, battery  may be a rechargeable battery, meaning that its electrochemical energy may be restored by the application of electrical energy (e.g., a lead and sulfuric acid battery, nickel cadmium (NiCd) battery, nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery, lithium ion (Li-ion) battery, lithium ion polymer (Li-ion polymer) battery, smart battery, or any combination of the foregoing, or any other suitable battery).","In operation, after one or more tasks are created and\/or received from a vendor by management controller  and\/or task server , and after one or more policies are determined for each task  by management controller  of management node , a particular task  may be scheduled on task server  for managed node . Management controller  and\/or task server  may query management system  and\/or management agent  of managed node  via channel(s)  for the estimated availability time of managed node  (e.g., battery life data), network connectivity information, and\/or other information relating to managed node . Upon receiving the requested information, management controller  and\/or task server  may determine whether or not to execute the scheduled task  by comparing the requested information with associated policy or policies  of the scheduled task . For example, if the task  is a software update and takes approximately 45 minutes to execute, the policy may require that the battery life of battery  to be greater than 90 minutes, such that managed node  may still be functional after the scheduled task  is executed.","If the determined requested information satisfies one or more policies  for the scheduled task  to be executed, management controller  may retrieve the scheduled task  from memory  and communicate the scheduled task  to management agent  via channel(s)  such that the task  can be executed, e.g., by processor .","If the requested information fails to meet the standards set forth by one or more policies  for the scheduled task  to be executed, task server  may reschedule the task  in a queue, such that at a later time (e.g., when sufficient battery life and\/or network bandwidth is\/are available), the scheduled task  may be communicated to management agent  of managed node  for execution.","In some embodiments, even if the requested information does not meet the policy(ies)  for the scheduled task , a corresponding policy  associated with the scheduled task  may allow for the communication of the scheduled task  to managed node  for execution. For example, if the scheduled task  is a critical security patch, and the execution of the security patch may leave managed node  with low battery life, task server  may nonetheless communicate the task  to managed node  for execution.","It is noted that all or any portion of the requested information from managed node , including, for example, estimated availability time and\/or network connectivity information, separately or combined with network bandwidth data determined by management controller  and\/or task server  may be used to determine whether to send task  to managed node . For example, the information received and collected by management controller  and\/or task server  may be compared with one or more policies  associated with task .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","120","202","112","114","108","112","108","120"]},"In some embodiments, a vendor-created task may include the execution time of the task. Task server  and\/or management controller  may retrieve the execution time stored, for example, at memory . Alternatively, management controller  and\/or task server  may estimate the execution time. For example, the management controller  and\/or task server  may execute the task and determine an execution time based on the time required to complete execution. In other embodiments, management controller  and\/or task server  may execute the task multiple times and determine an average execution time.","In the same or alternative embodiments, task server  and or management controller  may calculate the network bandwidth between management node  and managed node . The calculated network bandwidth may be used to determine the time required to send the task to managed node . The time calculated send time may also be used to determine a total execution time needed to execute task  on managed node .","At step , one or more policies  may be established for task . In some embodiments, the one or more policies  may define a minimum availability time required of managed node  (e.g., minutes of battery life remaining, a percentage of battery life remaining, or other appropriate metric) that is acceptable to execute the task (e.g., to allow a managed node  to be functional for some time period after the execution of the task). In the same or alternative embodiments, the one or more policies  may indicate that a task is to be executed, even if the life of battery  is expected to be depleted upon completed execution of the task (e.g., a critical task such as a security patch that is immediately required and\/or needed by managed node ).","At step , management controller or task server  may schedule the task for execution on managed node . At step , upon the scheduling of the task, management controller  and\/or task server  may request system information from managed node . In some embodiments, the system information may include an estimated availability time of managed node  (e.g., battery life data of battery ). Managed node  may directly communicate with battery  to determine the battery life data and\/or may use an application programming interface (API) to determine the battery life data associated with battery .","In the same or alternative embodiments, the system information may include network connectivity information of managed node . The network connectivity information may be directly provided by a user of managed node  via a user interface and\/or may include historical information gathered by management system  and\/or management agent .","In some embodiments, managed node  may automatically communicate to management node , and in particular, management controller  various system information of managed node . For example, automatic communication of battery life data, network connectivity information, and\/or other system-related information may be performed at a predetermined time interval. Alternatively, battery life data, network connectivity information, and\/or other system-related information may be automatically communicated in connection with at an event, for example, a power up sequence of managed node  (e.g., waking from sleep mode, waking from hibernation mode, or booting from a full powered down mode, etc.). The automatic data provided by managed node  may allow management node  to dynamically communicate pending or upcoming tasks scheduled for execution by managed node .","At step , if the information related to managed node  does not comply with the policy  associated with the scheduled task  (e.g., the determined battery life is less than that required for execution of the task ), method  may proceed again to step , where the task may be rescheduled for a later time. If the received information related to managed node  complies with the one or more policies  associated with the scheduled task  (e.g., the determined battery life is equal to or greater than that required for execution of the task ), method  may proceed to step .","At step , in response to a determination that the received system information from managed node  complies with the one or more policies  associated with the schedules task , the scheduled task  may be retrieved from memory  and communicated to managed node  via channel(s)  (e.g., an out-of-band channel), where the scheduled task  may be managed by management agent  and\/or executed by processor .","Although  discloses a particular number of steps to be taken with respect to method , method  may be executed with greater or lesser steps than those depicted in . In addition, although  discloses a certain order of steps to be taken with respect to method , the steps comprising method  may be completed in any suitable order. In addition, steps - may be repeated, independently and\/or collectively, as often as desired or required by a chosen implementation.","The present disclosure provides systems and methods for out-of-band execution of tasks on a managed node. The systems and methods for executing these tasks may be performed statically, e.g., by determining the battery life data of a battery, network connectivity information, network bandwidth data, etc., and based on the received data, determining whether or not to execute the task. The systems and methods for executing tasks on the managed node may also be performed dynamically, e.g., by receiving battery life data and\/or network connectivity information from the managed node at a predetermined time or event, and based on the received data, determine if any pending or upcoming task can be forwarded for execution.","Although the present disclosure has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions, and alterations may be made hereto without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the present embodiments and advantages thereof may be acquired by referring to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numbers indicate like features, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
