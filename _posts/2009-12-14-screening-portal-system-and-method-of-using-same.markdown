The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to techniques for screening objects for target substances. More particularly, the present invention relates to techniques for collecting samples from objects to screen for the presence of target substances, such as explosive materials.","2. Background of the Related Art","Explosive devices pose a significant threat to persons and\/or property. In an effort to prevent the unauthorized use of explosive devices, steps are often taken to locate explosive materials, such as C4, TNT, dynamite, fuels, chemicals, casted and\/or other volatile materials, before they can be used to cause any damage. In many cases, such explosive materials are hidden or stored to prevent detection. Detectors have been developed to identify the presence of explosive materials as described, for example, in US Patent\/Application No. 20060271211, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,978,657, 6,948,325, 6,617,591, and 6,477,907. In some cases, only trace amounts of explosive materials may be present. Preconcentrators have been developed for collecting trace amounts of materials as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,299,711, 6,345,545, RE38797, 6,617,591, 6,604,406, 6,572,825, 6,523,393, 5,854,431, 6,085,601, 5,854,431 and 6,978,657, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Techniques have also been developed for screening individuals for the presence of certain materials. In some cases, portals have been developed to perform the screening on humans as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,334,365, 5,915,268 and Kevin L. Linker, \u201cLarge-Volume Sampling and Preconcentration,\u201d 3Explosives Detection Technology Symposium and Aviation Security Technology Conference, Atlantic City, N.J., Nov. 26-27, 2001, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Despite the development of techniques for detecting certain materials, there remains a need to provide advanced systems and methods for screening for target substances, such as explosive or other materials. It may be desirable to provide a system and\/or portal that may be easily assembled, disassembled and\/or transported between locations for performing screening operations. It may be further desirable to have systems and\/or portals that optimize the screening operations. Such optimization may involve, for example, optimized sample removal, optimized efficiency and\/or optimized comfort for the object. Preferably, such techniques involve one or more of the following, among others: low cost design and operation, quick operation, high quality sampling, non-contact operation, replaceability of components, optimized air flow, lightweight design, quick assembly\/disassembly, accurate detection, additional functions, modularity, replaceable components and\/or parts, trace detection capabilities, etc.","Presently preferred embodiments of the invention are shown in the above-identified Figures and described in detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1C","b":["100","102","100","104","106","108","102","102","104"],"i":["a,b,c","a,b,c ","a,b,c ","a,b,c ","a,b,c "]},"As shown in , the system has a portal with an inflatable bladder and a frame .

The collector  includes a collector housing  with a first stage preconcentrator and a collection blower  therein. The housing  has a collector passage  in fluid communication with the portal via collection duct  for receiving samples therefrom. The passage  extends from the portal to the first stage preconcentrator and to the collection blower  for the flow of air as shown by the directional arrows. Samples are drawn into collection duct  via vent  from the portal ","Injection duct  passes the recycled air from the collection blower  back into the portal via nozzles . The recycled air may optionally also be passed into the inflation bladder via injection duct  for inflation thereof. Preferably the recycled air is sufficiently cleansed prior to being passed back into the inflation bladder . The preconcentrator may be used to remove contaminants, such as the samples removed from the object, from the recycled air. Other devices, such filters may be used alone or in combination with the preconcentrator to remove such contaminants.","The sample(s) received from the portal passes to the first stage preconcentrator via the passage . Examples of a first stage preconcentrators are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,854,431 and RE38797, and depicted in  (preconcentrators ). The first stage preconcentrator captures a portion of the sample passing therethrough to form a test sample . The remainder of the air passing through the first stage preconcentrator continues through collector passage  to collection blower . The collection blower  may be used as a fluid pump for drawing fluid from the portal . The collection blower  may also be used to generate air flow into the portal . Air generated by the collection blower  is passed through a blower passage  and back to the portal ","The collection blower  is fluidly connected to the inflatable bladder via blower passage  extending to duct . The inflatable bladder has an inner chamber  and an outer chamber . The blower passage  is fluidly connected with the inner chamber  of the inflatable bladder for providing air flow thereto as indicated by the directional arrows. Air is released from the inner chamber  and into the test space via nozzles .","The configuration of  provides a collection blower  that is capable of generating air flow into, and recycling air received from, the inner bladder . It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that one or more fluid sources, such as a pump, blower or other means, may be used for providing air into the portal and\/or receiving air therefrom.","As the air carrying samples pass through the first stage preconcentrator , a portion of the air and samples are collected to form the test sample . Once formed in the first stage preconcentrator , the test sample  may be passed to the detector  via preconcentrator passage  extending from the preconcentrator to the detector .","The detector  includes a housing  containing a second stage preconcentrator , a sensor  and a bladder blower . The detector  is fluidly connected to the portal via inflation duct . Preconcentrator passage  establishes fluid communication between the first stage preconcentrator and a second stage preconcentrator  for passage of the test sample  from the first stage preconcentrator to second stage preconcentrator . The second stage preconcentrator  further concentrates the test sample  by collecting select samples from the test sample  to form a concentrated test sample . An example of a second stage preconcentrator is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,345,545, and depicted in .","The preconcentrators used herein are preferably configured to collect and\/or absorb samples on a mesh and thermally desorb them to the detector. By way of example, the preconcentrator may flow at about 300-500 liters per second. Such flow may be adjusted within this range or to other levels as needed to adequately screen the object. As shown in , a two stage preconcentrator may be used. The first stage of  may have about a 23 cm inlet, and the second state about a 1.2 cm inlet. The two-stage preconcentrator may be used as an impedance matching between large volume sampling requirements and the detector. In some cases, a one stage preconcentrator having about a 15 cm inlet may be used. The thermal desorption used is preferably direct heating utilizing alternating current (AC), but a deep cycle battery for direct current (DC) direct heating may also be used. The operation of preconcentrators are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,299,711, 6,345,545, RE38797, 6,604,406, 5,854,431, 6,617,591, 6,572,825, 6,523,393, 5,854,431, 6,085,601 and 6,978,657, previously incorporated herein.","Sensor  is operatively connected to second stage preconcentrator  for sensing parameters of the concentrated test sample . The sensor  may be any sensor capable of detecting whether the concentrated test sample  contains the target substance. The sensor  may be one or more sensors, gauges, detectors or other device capable of measuring one or more parameters, such the SMITHS DETECTION\u2122 400B (commercially available at www.smithdetection.com) capable of detecting explosive material (e.g., TNT, RDX, PETN, HMX, etc.) and ICX NOMADICS\u2122 system (commercially available at www.icxt.com) capable of high vapor detection (e.g., peroxide). One or more sensor  may be positioned at various locations for sensing various parameters. The sensor  receives and analyzes the concentrated test sample  to determine whether the test sample contains the target substance. Some sensors, such as the high vapor detection systems may be used to detect certain materials without a preconcentrator. The sensor  may also measure parameters, collect data or otherwise receive information relating to the tests sample, environment, object or other items. Information collected by the sensor  may be passed to the electronics .","A bladder blower  may also optionally be provided in the detector . A bladder passage  extends from inflation duct  to fluidly connect bladder blower  to the outer chamber  of the inflatable bladder . The bladder blower  passes air to the outer chamber  to inflate the inflatable bladder and\/or maintain its shape. Optionally, the collection blower  and\/or other means may be used to inflate and\/or deflate the inflatable bladder ","Electronics  are used to operate the system . Electronics  are housed in electronics housing . The electronics housing  has circuitry  and a computer  therein for operating the system . The circuitry  may be used to provide power and\/or communication signals about the system . The computer  may be used to collect and analyze data from detector , the system and\/or other sources. As shown, the computer  is provided with a scanner  for collecting information about the object . For example, the scanner  may provide biometric scans, ID scans, etc. The computer may also be provided with a processor  for analyzing the information. The computer  may operate independently and\/or in combination with other processors and\/or computers to perform various functions, such as collecting data, storing data, providing displays, providing reports, etc.","The collector , detector  and electronics  are depicted as being housed in separate housings , ,  stacked with connectors  therebetween for securing the housings in place. Preferably, these components are stacked with the heaviest container at the bottom. It will be appreciated that the collector, detector and electronics may be positioned in one or more housings about the portal for operation therewith. The housings , ,  may be shipping cases for transporting the contents. Optionally, the housings may be provided with wheels, handles or other items to facilitate operation and\/or transport. Preferably, these components and the portal are modular and therefore transportable and\/or replaceable.","The portal may be provided with various apparatuses to perform additional functions. For example, the portal is provided with a light  for illuminating the portal and a camera  for collecting images of the object .","As shown in , air flows from the collector  through passage  and into the inner chamber  of the inflatable bladder . The air is directionally released into the test space via nozzles . The air is preferably directed from the nozzles  downward through the test space such that the air passes over an object  to remove samples therefrom.","The air may be selectively directed from the collection blower  through the portal . The blower  may be used to provide compressed air to the test space . The blower  may be used to provide a continuous flow of air through the portal and over the object . Preferably, large volume air flow is provided at a high velocity sufficient to remove samples from the object . Air is preferably directed downward through the test space as indicated by the arrows. Samples, such as hair, lint and other material are removed by the air flow and gravitational forced, and transported therewith toward the bottom of the portal for removal into the collector  via vent . The air and samples exit the test space via collection duct  and into collector . By way of example, samples may be removed at a rate of about 300-500 liters per second, or at other rates as needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 4B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["120","118","104","118","112","118","104","102","118","108","112","102","104","118","120","131","108","112","108"],"i":["b ","b ","b ","a,b,c ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b","b ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["5","108","108","118","106","108","586","108","106","588","590","590","118","104","250","592","118","586","594","596","586","596","594","588","594","586","594","597","594","108","100","102","102","100"],"i":["b ","b","b","b ","b ","b ","a,b,c ","a,b,c.
