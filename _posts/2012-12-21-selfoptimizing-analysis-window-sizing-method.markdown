title: Self-optimizing analysis window sizing method
abstract: A method of selecting an optimal window length in a digital processing system includes receiving a digital signal and analyzing the signal with a group of Hanning windows having different sizes. The windows being arranged so that they can be scaled to be comparable. The digital signal is windowed with each selected window and a transform is computed. The transformed signal is scaled and corrected. A metric is computed from the resulting signal for each window. The metrics are compared and the window size is selected based on agreement with a user defined metric. The specific window function, shift and scaling are such that the resulting analysis is mathematically equivalent across different window sizes.

The FFT typically follows the window analysis. This is the case, for example, in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) which is a widely used front-end for a variety of applications including automatic speech recognition (ASR). It is often necessary to arbitrarily choose an analysis window size that is a compromise between the desire for good time-domain and frequency-domain resolution. In order to handle a wide range of input time-scales, it is sometimes necessary to use multiple analysis window sizes in parallel. But this approach creates a new problem\u2014the resolution of ambiguous results. In other words, one has to decide which FFT size is appropriate for a given input data record. A related technique is spectrogram combining where STFTs are combined in such a way that the choice of best FFT size is made at each grid point in the time and frequency plane. An important step toward solving the comparison problem is the assurance that the various SIFT representations are in some way \u201cequivalent\u201d. One possible definition of \u201cequivalent\u201d is the existence of an orthonormal linear transformation relating one analysis at a given window size to another at a different window size. This definition has relevance from a number of different viewpoints\u2014from linear subspace analysis to statistical methods including the PDF projection theorem. See \u201cThe PDF Projection Theorem and the Class-Specific Method\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 51, No. 3 (March 2003). There is a trivial case where two analyses are related by a permutation and thus equivalent. Consider a time-series where the total number of samples T is divisible by Nand N. If we analyze with a rectangular window function and use no overlap between processing windows, the two analyses with window sizes Nand Nare permutations of the same input samples. Unfortunately, when a non-rectangular window function is used and the processing windows are overlapped, there is in general no permutation or orthonormal transformation relating the two analyses.","Thus, there is a need for a method that will allow comparisons between windowed data having different lengths when non-rectangular window functions are used.","A first object of the invention is to determine the most appropriate analysis window sizes for an incoming signal.","A second object is to provide a method of analysis for a signal having pulses of unknown duration.","Accordingly, there is provided a method of selecting an optimal window length in a digital processing system includes receiving a digital signal and analyzing the signal with a group of Hanning windows having different sizes. The windows being arranged so that they can be scaled to be comparable. The digital signal is windowed with each selected window and a transform is computed. The transformed signal is scaled and corrected. A metric is computed from the resulting signal for each window. The metrics are compared and the window size is selected based on agreement with a user defined metric. The specific window function, shift and scaling are such that the resulting analysis is mathematically equivalent across different window sizes.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description, drawings and claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","14","16","16","18","18","20","22","24","26"]},"The method of this invention is particularly designed for acoustic data; however it can also be applied to other types of data, such as that associated with seismic, radar and radio signals.","The mathematics behind this method is given in the following text.

This statistic summarizes the useful information in the transform output bins. An example of a statistic is to compute the mean square bin amplitude, and\/or to locate the largest bin amplitude.

Therefore, it is possible to create a statistic in block  that has the same output statistics under noise only hypothesis no matter what the window size N. As provided above, this statistic is comparable among the different windowing function lengths and transforms because of the windowing function parameters and the scaling.

Searching for the optimal Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size on a given digitized input signal is tantamount to pulse length estimation. This method was demonstrated utilizing synthetic data that consisted of 768 samples of independent, identically distributed, Gaussian noise plus a short Hanning-weighted sinusoidal pulse of random frequency and starting time. The pulse length of the short pulse, denoted by P, was 96, 192, or 384 samples. The signal to noise ratio was quite low, and the pulse was difficult to find visually in the time-series. In order to maintain detectability at short pulse lengths, the amplitude was varied to the P-dependent value 15Pat the peak of the Hanning-shaped envelope.","The following procedure was performed to form a detection statistic that has identical noise-only distribution independent from the analysis window size.
