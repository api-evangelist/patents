In particular, the various embodiments relate to optimizing bandwidth usage in remote visualization.","Remote visualization solutions allow end-users of a graphical desktop to interact with graphical applications from a remote machine (e.g., a thin client).","Thin client viewers receive images over the network, which are rendered to give end-users the impression that they are using an application locally on their computer or workstation.","There are a number of remote visualization applications available at present. Some of them, such as the exported display feature of X11, Citrix Presentation Server (Citrix is a trade mark of Citrix Systems, Inc.), or Terminal Services (i.e., Remote Desktop Services) from Microsoft Corporation, use a specialized protocol to transmit messages to connected viewers or to display information in the case of X11. Alternatives, including Virtual Network Computing (VNC), comprise a server that monitors for any modifications and transmits a compressed image reflecting such modifications from the server back to one or more clients (i.e., end-stations).","One major limitation of all of these known approaches is bandwidth saturation. This is especially true in the case of VNC, for which the number of connected end-stations (e.g., client \u2018viewers\u2019) to a single computing device may be large. As a server identifies changes to such computing device, it must distribute these changes to each of the connected end-stations. Although specialized algorithms have been developed to decimate and compress updated information that must be sent to end-stations, the server still must transmit the resultant data block to each end-station in order to keep the display of each end-station in sync with the server.","As the number of end-stations or the number of required data updates increases, network bandwidth resources become saturated with such updates, resulting in a lower throughput for each connected end-station.","It is an aim of the various embodiments described herein to utilize limited bandwidth in an efficient way. Specifically, the bandwidth may be used to send regions \u201cof interest\u201d of the display in high quality via a reliable transport protocol, while regions \u201cof non-interest\u201d (i.e., the regions that are not determined to be \u201cof interest\u201d) may be sent in lower quality via a less reliable transport protocol, capitalizing on any data dropping capabilities inherent in such transmission protocol if available bandwidth is exceeded.","According to a first aspect of the various embodiments, a method is provided for transmitting an image for remote display. The method may be used for optimizing bandwidth in remote visualization. The method may comprise determining a region of interest and a region of non-interest of the image; sending data relating to the region of interest via a reliable priority data stream; and sending data relating to the region of non-interest via a less reliable non-priority data stream. The priority data stream may be a high quality and\/or high speed data stream, while the non-priority data stream may be a lower quality and\/or lower speed data stream.","According to a second aspect of the various embodiments, a system is provided for transmitting an image for remote display. The system may be used for optimizing bandwidth in remote visualization. The system may comprise a server configured for generating the image; a client configured for displaying the image; a selector configured for determining a region of interest and a region of non-interest of the image; a reliable priority transmission apparatus operatively coupling the server to the client, wherein the priority transmission apparatus is configured for sending data relating to the region of interest; and a less reliable non-priority transmission apparatus operatively coupling the server to the client, wherein the non-priority transmission apparatus is configured for sending data relating to the region of non-interest.","According to a third aspect of the various embodiments, a computer program product is provided that may be loadable into the internal memory of a digital processing system (e.g., a computer), wherein the computer program product may comprise software code portions for carrying out the aforementioned method when the computer program product is run on the digital processing system.","According to a fourth aspect of the various embodiments, a method for providing a service to a customer over a network is provided. The method may comprise determining a region of interest in the image; sending the data relating to the region of interest via a reliable priority data stream; and sending the data relating to other regions (i.e., regions of non-interest) via a less reliable non-priority data stream. The priority data stream may be a high quality and\/or high speed data stream, while the non-priority data stream may be a lower quality and\/or lower speed data stream.","The various embodiments may permit determination of regions of interest and\/or regions of non-interest of an image in various ways, including via automatic selection (e.g., through the use of image-based algorithms), via an application programming interface of one of a plurality of graphics applications that generate the image, or via manual selection by a user.","Furthermore, the various embodiments may send regions of interest via a reliable transmission protocol, and such protocol may transmit the regions of interest at a high image quality and\/or at a high update frequency (i.e., refresh rate). Conversely, the various embodiments may send regions of non-interest via a less reliable transmission protocol, and such protocol may transmit the regions of non-interest at a lower image quality and\/or at a lower update frequency.","Referring to , a remote visualization system  is provided as known in the prior art. A server system  is provided on which a plurality of graphics applications  are executed. The plurality of graphics applications  generate an image  on a server display .","A plurality of remote client systems (i.e., client viewers) , , and  are connected to the server system  via a network . The remote client systems , , and  respectively comprise local client displays , , and  and input devices , , and . The remote client systems , , and  can view the server image  on the respective local client displays , , and . A remote client system , ,  can interact with the plurality of server graphics applications  on the client display , ,  via the input device , , .","A remote visualization adapter (RVA) software module  is installed on a windowing system  of the server system . An image frame buffer  is constantly updated by the windowing system  and by the plurality of graphics applications .","Referring to , a remote visualization system  according to an exemplary embodiment is provided that optimizes bandwidth usage. As with the remote visualization system  of , the remote visualization system  may comprise a server system  on which a plurality of graphics applications  may be executed. The plurality of graphics applications  may generate an image , and the image  may be displayed on a server display . A remote visualization adapter (RVA) software module  may be installed on a windowing system  of the server system . An image frame buffer  may be constantly updated by the windowing system  and by the plurality of graphics applications .","A remote client system (i.e., client viewer system)  may be connected to the server system  via a network. The client viewer system  may comprise an input device  and may run a windowing system . The remote client system  may be a viewer that may view the server image  on a local client display . The client viewer system  may interact with the plurality of server graphics applications  on the client display  via the input device .","The server system  may be run on any information processing system (e.g., a desktop computer, server, etc.) capable of providing the functionality necessary for its implementation. Similarly, the client viewer system  may be run on any information processing system (e.g., a workstation computer, thin client, etc.) capable of providing the functionality necessary for its implementation. An exemplary data processing system for implementing the server system  and\/or the client viewer system  is described herein with reference to . It is important to note that a given information processing device may be used for the server system  at one time and may be used for the client viewer system  at another time\u2014i.e., a given information processing device may function as both the server system  and the client viewer system .","The RVA  of the server system  illustrated in  may comprise a region of interest selector  and a data stream selector . The remote visualization system  may send image data from the server system  to the client viewer system  via a first (priority) data stream  and a second (non-priority) data stream .","The first (priority) data stream  may be a reliable, high quality, and\/or high speed data stream that may be sent from the server system  to the client viewer system  via a priority transmission apparatus. Such priority transmission apparatus may operatively couple the server system  to the client viewer system  and may comprise a wired channel, a wireless channel, or a combination of both. The first (priority) data stream  may be an uncompressed\/raw image stream or a compressed image stream using lossless or almost lossless techniques sent via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The second (non-priority) data stream  may be a less reliable, lower quality, and\/or lower speed data stream that may be sent from the server system  to the client viewer system  via a non-priority transmission apparatus. Such non-priority transmission apparatus may operatively couple the server system  to the client viewer system  and may comprise a wired channel, a wireless channel, or a combination of both. The second (non-priority) data stream  may be a highly compressed image stream using, e.g., lossy techniques sent via User Datagram Protocol (UDP).","The region of interest selector  may identify regions \u201cof interest\u201d in the server image , and the data stream selector  may send such regions of interest from the server system  to the client viewer system  via the first (priority) data stream . Other regions of the image  may be sent as regions \u201cof non-interest\u201d from the server system  to the client viewer system  via the second (non-priority) data stream .","Superior update frequency and\/or update quality may be provided for the first (priority) data stream  as compared to the second (non-priority) data stream .","Selection of regions of interest may be carried out by different methods or by a combination of methods. According to an exemplary embodiment described with reference to , regions of interest may be determined at the server system . According to another exemplary embodiment described with reference to , regions of interest may be determined at the client viewer system .  both illustrate the remote visualization system  of  with further components implementing the functionality of determining regions of interest either at the server system  () or at the client viewer system  (). Components common to both embodiments have the same reference numbers.","Referring to , an exemplary embodiment of the remote visualization system  is provided in which regions of interest are determined at the server system . As is the case with the embodiment of , the RVA  of the server system  may comprise a region of interest selector  and a data stream selector . The region of interest selector  according to this embodiment may comprise an image monitor  that may monitor the image  at the server system  and may identify changed regions of the image . Changed regions generally may be rectangular regions of the image  in which content is modified.","The image monitor  of the region of interest selector  may examine each changed region and may split it, examining it for regions of interest. Regions of interest may be selected at the transmitting (server) end in various ways. Image-based algorithms may be used to automatically select regions of interest based on certain parameters or conditions. Such algorithms may select regions of interest based on change in the image  from a previous frame; rate of change in the image  or portions thereof; one or more user-defined parameters; and\/or seed points (which may be used in accordance with, e.g., a Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) standard).","Moreover, regions of interest may be selected via an application programming interface (API) of one of the plurality of graphics applications  that generate the image . Specifically, such API may be used by one of the plurality of graphics applications  to select regions of interest in the image . For example, such API may be used to mark regions of interest for a user based on a user's application interaction, preferences, etc.","Furthermore, regions of interest may be selected manually and dynamically by a user at the transmitting (server) end of the connection, e.g., by a user choosing a specific window or part of a window or by always selecting the active window. Such region of interest determination by a user may be via a pointer mechanism, such as a mouse, on the display. For example, the server system  may select the area around a user's mouse pointer as a region of interest, or the server system  may select the area of the screen where the pointer is most often positioned as a region of interest. Alternatively, the user may manually select a region of interest by dragging the mouse.","The RVA  may use the data stream selector  to update the client viewer system  with the regions of interest via the first (priority) data stream  (having higher speed, quality, and\/or reliability).","The RVA  may use the data stream selector  to update the client viewer system  with the regions of non-interest (which may be the regions of the image  that are not determined to be regions of interest) via the second (non-priority) data stream  (having lower speed, quality, and\/or reliability).","Referring to , another exemplary embodiment of the remote visualization system  is provided in which regions of interest are determined at the client viewer system . According to this embodiment, the RVA  of the server system  may comprise a region of interest selector  based on a client feedback monitor . The remote visualization system  according to this embodiment may comprise a third data stream in the form of a reliable low bandwidth feedback stream . The feedback stream  may be sent from the client viewer system  to the server system  via a feedback transmission apparatus. Such feedback transmission apparatus may operatively couple the client viewer system  to the server system  and may comprise a wired channel, a wireless channel, or a combination of both.","According to the exemplary embodiment described with respect to , the windowing system  of the client viewer system  may comprise an image\/input monitor  and a feedback provider  for providing appropriate client activity feedback to the server system  via the feedback stream . Such feedback may include information regarding determined regions of interest and\/or regions of non-interest. For instance, the image\/input monitor  may determine (e.g., periodically) whether a user is hovering over (e.g., with an input device such as a mouse) or otherwise interacting with a section of the image , and based on the user activity the feedback provider  may send feedback indicating regions of interest and\/or regions of non-interest to the server system  via the feedback stream . Subsequently, the client feedback monitor  of the server system  may examine the information provided by the feedback stream  so that the client feedback indicating regions of interest and\/or regions of non-interest may be processed by the server system . Consequently, appropriate image updates may be sent to the client viewer system .","The regions of interest at the receiving (client) end may be determined in various ways. It may be based on image-based algorithms at the client viewer system  that may be used to automatically select regions of interest based on certain parameters or conditions (previously described herein). Moreover, regions of interest may be selected manually and dynamically by a user at the receiving (client) end of the connection. For example, it may be based on a radius extending from a client mouse pointer positioned on the image . The embodiment may also comprise a way to gradually improve image updates delivered to the client viewer system  based on a static mouse pointer\u2014i.e., once the client mouse pointer stops moving and becomes statically positioned on the image , the region of interest around the pointer may expand (e.g., radially) to provide further high quality updates.","When multiple clients are connected to a single desktop system (i.e., there are multiple client viewer systems ) and regions of interest are determined at the receiving (client) end, the clients may have distinct regions of interest depending on the different conditions on each of the client viewer systems  and their relation to the region of interest criteria. Accordingly, each client viewer system  may use the priority data stream  and the non-priority data stream  for separate and distinct image updates. The client feedback monitor  may record the region of interest data for each client viewer system  and may use the saved information to select for each client viewer system  the appropriate updates to send and the appropriate data stream (priority data stream  or non-priority data steam ) to use for such updates.","The exemplary embodiments described herein with reference to  may be used independently or in combination with each other. Moreover, other available algorithms may be used for selecting regions of interest in accordance with the described exemplary embodiments.","Referring to , an exemplary system for implementing the server system  and\/or the client viewer system  referred to herein with reference to  is described. The server system  and\/or the client viewer system  may assume the form of a data processing system  suitable for storing and\/or executing program code. The data processing system  may comprise at least one central processing unit  that may be coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements via a system bus . The memory elements may comprise local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories. The cache memories may provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from the bulk storage during execution.","The memory elements may comprise system memory  in the form of read only memory (ROM)  and\/or random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS)  may be stored in ROM . System software  may be stored in the RAM , including operating system (OS) software . Software applications  also may be stored in the RAM .","The data processing system  also may comprise a primary storage apparatus , such as a magnetic hard disk drive, and a secondary storage apparatus , such as a magnetic disk drive or an optical disk drive. The drives and their associated computer-readable media may provide non-volatile storage of computer-executable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the data processing system . Software applications may be stored on the primary storage apparatus , the secondary storage apparatus , and\/or the system memory .","The data processing system  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers via a network interface (i.e., network adapter) .","Input\/output (I\/O) devices  may be coupled to the data processing system  either directly or through I\/O controllers. A user may enter commands and information into the data processing system  through input devices such as a keyboard, pointing device, or other input devices (for example, microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like). Output devices may include speakers, printers, etc. A display device  also may be connected to the system bus  via a graphics card .","The description herein relates to remote visualization solutions. However, the selection of a region of interest and corresponding selection of reliable and less reliable data streams also may be applied in other fields in which images are transmitted remotely. For example, principles of the various embodiments described herein may be applied in the field of digital point-to-point (P2P) or point-to-multipoint (P2MP) video, such as video on demand and video conferencing systems. In such video applications, automatic selection of a region of interest at the transmitting end may be used, e.g., using motion detection techniques already employed in MPEG compression. The video stream portions \u201cof interest\u201d (i.e., priority portions) may be sent using a reliable transmission protocol (e.g., TCP), while the video stream portions \u201cof non-interest\u201d in the background of the overall images (i.e., non-priority portions) may be sent using a transmission protocol of lower reliability (e.g., UDP).","The processes for using regions of interest for optimizing bandwidth usage in remote visualization solutions or in other fields such as P2P video are described below with reference to the various flow diagrams.","Referring to , a flow diagram of a process  at a server is provided according to an exemplary embodiment. The process  may be used for transmitting regions of interest and\/or regions of non-interest of an image. In step , a server may generate a region of an image for transmission to a client. In step , it may be determined whether the region of the image is a region of interest. As described herein, regions of interest may be determined by an automatic selection process at the server or at the client with an appropriate feedback mechanism to the server. Alternatively, regions of interest may be manually determined via a user through the use of an input mechanism. Such manual determination may be at the server or may be at the client with an appropriate feedback mechanism to the server.","If in step  it is determined that the region of the image is a region of interest, then in step  data updates relating to the region of interest may be transmitted to the client via a reliable (priority) data stream. Conversely, if it is determined that the region of the image is not a region of interest (i.e., the region is a region of non-interest), then in step  data updates may be transmitted to the client via a less reliable (non-priority) data stream.","Referring to , a flow diagram of a process  at a server is provided according to an exemplary embodiment. The process  may be used for determining the regions of interest and\/or regions of non-interest of an image that are to be sent for transmission and for transmitting such regions. In step , the image to be transmitted may be generated as a result of monitoring (e.g., periodically) the overall image. In step , it may be determined whether there are any changed regions in the image. If in step  it is determined that there are no changed regions, then the process  may loop back via branch  to step  so that monitoring may continue.","If in step  it is determined that there are changed regions, then in step  it may be determined for each changed region whether such changed region includes a region of interest. If such changed region includes a region of interest, then in step  updates of such changed region may be transmitted to the client via a reliable (priority) data stream. Conversely, if such changed region does not include a region of interest, then in step  updates of such changed region may be transmitted to the client via a less reliable (non-priority) data stream. Then, via branch  the process  may loop back to step  so that monitoring may continue.","Referring to , a flow diagram of a process  at a client for selecting regions of interest of an image and for transmitting information regarding such regions of interest to a server in accordance with an exemplary embodiment is provided. The process  may be used in conjunction with an embodiment of a remote visualization system implementing a client feedback mechanism (see the exemplary embodiment described herein with reference to ). In step  the client may receive a region of the image. In step , the client may display the received region on screen. In step , the client may examine the received region and may select any regions of interest from the received region. In step , the client may transmit the information regarding the newly selected regions of interest to the server.","The methods described herein may be provided as a technical service to a client over a network. For example, the methods may be provided as a middleware implementation, a database optimization, application maintenance, or facilities hosting.","The various embodiments described herein may reduce bandwidth usage and may enhance usability on high latency networks such as satellite networks. Moreover, the various embodiments may allow for control of bandwidth over each connection on which they are implemented in expensive networks such as satellite networks. For example, thresholds may be set for the low priority data stream.","The various embodiments may assume the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment, or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements.","The various embodiments may be implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.","Furthermore, the various embodiments may assume the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system.
