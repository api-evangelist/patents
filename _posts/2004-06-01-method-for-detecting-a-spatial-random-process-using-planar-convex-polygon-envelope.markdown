title: Method for detecting a spatial random process using planar convex polygon envelope
abstract: A method is provided for automatically characterizing data sets containing data points, which may be produced by measurements such as with sonar arrays, as either random or non-random. The data points for each data are located within a Cartesian space and a polygon envelope is constructed which contains the data points. The polygon is divided into grid cells by constructing a grid over the polygon. A prediction is made as to how many grid cells would be occupied if the data were merely a random process. The prediction takes one of two forms depending on the sample size. For small sample sizes, an exact Poisson probability method is utilized. For large sample sizes an approximation to the exact Poisson probability is utilized. A third test is utilized to test the adequacy of the Poisson based model is adequate to assess the data set as either random or non-random.

Naval sonar systems require that signals be classified according to structure; i.e., periodic, transient, random or chaotic.","Research has revealed a critical need for highly sparse data set time distribution analysis methods and apparatus separate and apart from those adapted for treating large sample distributions. It is well known that large sample methods often fail when applied to small sample distributions, but that the same is not necessarily true for small sample methods applied to large data sets. Very small data set distributions may be defined as those with less than about ten (10 measurement (data) points.","One reference is entitled \u201cEnhanced System And Method For Processing Signals To Determine Their Stochastic Properties\u201d, U.S. Pat. No. 5,966,414, issued 12 Oct. 1999, to the present inventor, which is discussed below briefly. More generally, theoretical and practical statistical considerations are contained in standard reference works such as P. J. Hoel et al., , and , Houghton-Mifflin, 1971. The theoretical framework of elementary stochastic (Poisson) processes is known, although the application of the theory in practice is often cumbersome. A variety of methods such as spectral analysis are available to the undersea warfare analyst for processing signals.","The term \u201crandomness\u201d encompasses different meanings in science and engineering. In engineering applications, Cartesian coordinate distributions may be thought of as \u201cpurely random\u201d if they conform to a \u201cwhite noise\u201d structure, regardless of the underlying generating mechanism that produced the \u201cnoise.\u201d Our use of the term \u201crandom\u201d (or \u201crandomness\u201d) is defined in terms of a \u201crandom process.\u201d as measured by a probability distribution model, namely a nearest-neighbor stochastic (Poisson) process. One may think of pure randomness in a pragmatic manner as a distribution for which no function, mapping, or relation can be constructed that provides meaningful insight into the underlying structure; for example, no prediction model can be generated. Also, we must distinguish the terms \u201cstochastic randomness\u201d from \u201cdeterministic randomness (chaos)\u201d as generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,781,460, F. J. O'Brien, Jr., et al. and\/or other of the related applications cited above or patents cited hereinafter. For instance, the present invention is utilized for classifying the statistical characteristics of a signal as \u201crandomness\u201d while other patents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,781,460, F. J. O'Brien, Jr., et al., may be utilized for identifying \u201cchaos.\u201d","Examples of exemplary patents related to the general field of the endeavor of analysis of sonar signals include:","U.S. Pat. No. 5,675,553, issued Oct. 7, 1997, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a method for filling in missing data intelligence in a quantified time-dependent data signal that is generated by, e.g., an underwater acoustic sensing device. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, this quantified time-dependent data signal is analyzed to determine the number and location of any intervals of missing data, i.e., gaps in the time series data signal caused by noise in the sensing equipment or the local environment. The quantified time-dependent data signal is also modified by a low pass filter to remove any undesirable high frequency noise components within the signal. A plurality of mathematical models are then individually tested to derive an optimum regression curve for that model, relative to a selected portion of the signal data immediately preceding each previously identified data gap. The aforesaid selected portion is empirically determined on the basis of a data base of signal values compiled from actual undersea propagated signals received in cases of known target motion scenarios. An optimum regression curve is that regression curve, linear or nonlinear, for which a mathematical convergence of the model is achieved. Convergence of the model is determined by application of a smallest root-mean-square analysis to each of the plurality of models tested. Once a model possessing the smallest root-mean-square value is derived from among the plurality of models tested, that optimum model is then selected, recorded, and stored for use in filling the data gap. This process is then repeated for each subsequent data gap until all of the identified data gaps are filled.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,703,906, issued Dec. 30, 1997, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a signal processing system which processes a digital signal, generally in response to an analog signal which includes a noise component and possibly also an information component representing three mutually orthogonal items of measurement information represented as a sample point in a symbolic Cartesian three-dimensional spatial reference system. A noise likelihood determination sub-system receives the digital signal and generates a random noise assessment of whether or not the digital signal comprises solely random noise, and if not, generates an assessment of degree-of-randomness. The noise likelihood determination system controls the operation of an information processing sub-system for extracting the information component in response to the random noise assessment or a combination of the random noise assessment and the degree-of-randomness assessment. The information processing system is illustrated as combat control equipment for submarine warfare, which utilizes a sonar signal produced by a towed linear transducer array, and whose mode operation employs three orthogonally related dimensions of data, namely: (i) clock time associated with the interval of time over which the sample point measurements are taken, (ii) conical angle representing bearing of a passive sonar contact derived from the signal produced by the towed array, and (iii) a frequency characteristic of the sonar signal.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,966,414, issued Oct. 12, 1999, to Francis J. O'Brien, Jr., discloses a signal processing system which processes a digital signal generated in response to an analog signal which includes a noise component and possibly also an information component. An information processing sub-system receives said digital signal and processes it to extract the information component. A noise likelihood determination sub-system receives the digital signal and generates a random noise assessment that the digital signal comprises solely random noise, and controls the operation of the information processing sub-system in response to the random noise assessment.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,781,460, issued Jul. 14, 1998, to Nguyen et al., discloses a chaotic signal processing system which receives an input signal from a sensor in a chaotic environment and performs a processing operation in connection therewith to provide an output useful in identifying one of a plurality of chaotic processes in the chaotic environment. The chaotic signal processing system comprises an input section, a processing section and a control section. The input section is responsive to input data selection information for providing a digital data stream selectively representative of the input signal provided by the sensor or a synthetic input representative of a selected chaotic process. The processing section includes a plurality of processing modules each for receiving the digital data stream from the input means and for generating therefrom an output useful in identifying one of a plurality of chaotic processes. The processing section is responsive to processing selection information to select one of the plurality of processing modules to provide the output. The control module generates the input data selection information and the processing selection information in response to inputs provided by an operator.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,963,591, issued Oct. 5, 1999, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a signal processing system which processes a digital signal generally in response to an analog signal which includes a noise component and possibly also an information component representing four mutually orthogonal items of measurement information representable as a sample point in a symbolic four-dimensional hyperspatial reference system. An information processing and decision sub-system receives said digital signal and processes it to extract the information component. A noise likelihood determination sub-system receives the digital signal and generates a random noise assessment of whether or not the digital signal comprises solely random noise, and if not, generates an assessment of degree-of-randomness. The noise likelihood determination system controls whether or not the information processing and decision sub-system is used, in response to one or both of these generated outputs. One prospective practical application of the invention is the performance of a triage function upon signals from sonar receivers aboard naval submarines, to determine suitability of the signal for feeding to a subsequent contact localization and motion analysis (CLMA) stage.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,234, issued May 28, 2002, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a method and apparatus are provided for automatically characterizing the spatial arrangement among the data points of a time series distribution in a data processing system wherein the classification of said time series distribution is required. The method and apparatus utilize a grid in Cartesian coordinates to determine (1) the number of cells in the grid containing at least-one input data point of the time series distribution; (2) the expected number of cells which would contain at least one data point in a random distribution in said grid; and (3) an upper and lower probability of false alarm above and below said expected value utilizing a discrete binomial probability relationship in order to analyze the randomness characteristic of the input time series distribution. A labeling device also is provided to label the time series distribution as either random or nonrandom.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,144,595, issued Sep. 1, 1992, to Graham et al., discloses an adaptive statistical filter providing improved performance target motion analysis noise discrimination includes a bank of parallel Kalman filters. Each filter estimates a statistic vector of specific order, which in the exemplary third order bank of filters of the preferred embodiment, respectively constitute coefficients of a constant, linear and quadratic fit. In addition, each filter provides a sum-of-squares residuals performance index. A sequential comparator is disclosed that performs a likelihood ratio test performed pairwise for a given model order and the next lowest, which indicates whether the tested model orders provide significant information above the next model order. The optimum model order is selected based on testing the highest model orders. A robust, unbiased estimate of minimal rank for information retention providing computational efficiency and improved performance noise discrimination is therewith accomplished.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,757,675, issued May 26, 1998, to O'Brien, Jr., discloses an improved method for laying out a workspace using the prior art crowding index, PDI, where the average interpoint distance between the personnel and\/or equipment to be laid out can be determined. The improvement lies in using the convex hull area of the distribution of points being laid out within the workplace space to calculate the actual crowding index for the workspace. The convex hull area is that area having a boundary line connecting pairs of points being laid out such that no line connecting any pair of points crosses the boundary line. The calculation of the convex hull area is illustrated using Pick's theorem with additional methods using the Surveyor's Area formula and Hero's formula.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,466,516, issued Oct. 5, 1999, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a method and apparatus for automatically characterizing the spatial arrangement among the data points of a three-dimensional time series distribution in a data processing system wherein the classification of the time series distribution is required. The method and apparatus utilize grids in Cartesian coordinates to determine (1) the number of cubes in the grids containing at least one input data point of the time series distribution; (2) the expected number of cubes which would contain at least one data point in a random distribution in said grids; and (3) an upper and lower probability of false alarm above and below said expected value utilizing a discrete binomial probability relationship in order to analyze the randomness characteristic of the input time series distribution. A labeling device also is provided to label the time series distribution as either random or nonrandom, and\/or random or nonrandom within what probability, prior to its output from the invention to the remainder of the data processing system for further analysis.","The above cited art, while extremely useful under certain circumstances, does not provide sufficient flexibility to measure the spatial arrangement among a very small to large number of points, objects, measurements, and the like, whereby an ascertainment of the mathematical property of randomness (or noise-degree) may be made. This improvement over the standard prior art provides the capability to use mathematical statistical methods for highly sparse data sets (e.g., <10-15 sample points). The existence of such sparse data sets requires methods appropriate for processing them reliably and validly. Moreover, the method is also applicable for larger data sets and may provide a higher degree of precision in the \u201crandom-not random\u201d decision. Consequently, those of skill in the art will appreciate the present invention which addresses these and other problems.","Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a method for classifying data sets as either random or non-random.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method capable of classifying either a large sample or a very small number of points, objects, measurements or the like.","It is another object of the present invention to determine the adequacy of the statistical model utilized for the classification.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a useful method for classifying data produced by naval sonar, radar, and\/or lidar in aircraft and missile tracking systems as indications of how and from which direction the data was originally generated.","These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the drawings, the descriptions given herein, and the appended claims. However, it will be understood that above listed objects and advantages of the invention are intended only as an aid in understanding certain aspects of the invention, are not intended to limit the invention in any way, and do not form a comprehensive or exclusive list of objects, features, and advantages.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for characterizing a plurality of data sets in a Cartesian space wherein the data sets are based on a plurality of measurements of one or more physical phenomena. The method may comprise one or more steps such as, for example, reading in data points from a first data set from the plurality of data sets, counting the data points to determine a total number N of the data points, creating a polygon envelope containing the data points of the first data set, and\/or forming a grid to partition the polygon envelope into a plurality of cells. Other steps may comprise testing for adequacy of a first prediction model and a second prediction model for predicting an expected number of the plurality of cells which contain at least one of the data points if the first data set were randomly dispersed. In one preferred embodiment the first and second prediction models are based upon Poisson probability models and so the adequacy of a Poisson probability model is tested. If adequacy of the first prediction model and the second prediction models is sufficient, then the number N is utilized to determine whether to use the first prediction model or the second prediction model by classifying the first data set as small or large. Other steps may comprise determining a measured number of the plurality of grid cells which actually contain at least one of the data points and determining a range of values utilizing the first prediction model or the second prediction model such that if the measured number is within the range of values, then the first data set is characterized as random in structure, and if the number is outside of the range of values, then the first data set is characterized as non-random. In one embodiment the data set is classified as small if N is less than approximately ten to fifteen data points.","The inventive method provides a computer-aided means to detect a spatial random in time series. The present invention describes an approach that may, in one preferred embodiment, be utilized for detecting stochastic (pure) randomness in two-dimensional space. This invention provides a novel means to determine whether the signal structure conforms to a random process (i.e., predominantly random). A specific advantageous utility of the method presently disclosed is the ability to process data distributions for small samples.","Referring now to the drawings and more specifically to , , and , there are shown three graphs which illustrate the progression of a presently preferred method operation in accord with the present invention.

The associated probability of 0.36 indicates a strong likelihood of stochastic randomness. Therefore: data conform to a random process by means of decision logic  and the Poisson model appears adequate for these data to provide a yes answer at decision block .","The primary utility of this method is in the field of signal  processing in which it is of interest to know whether the measurement structure is random in the presence of potentially highly sparse data sets. The new feature is an explicit method to handle very small samples by means of polygon envelope, which creates a more concentrated region for analysis, and, more importantly, because it effects more grid subspaces, and enhances likelihood that assumptions of Poisson model will be valid. While the present invention has been described in terms of two dimensions, it may be generalized to higher dimensions as desired.","In summary,  provides an overview of preferred method  in accord with the present invention. After producing grid  which divides convex hull  that surrounds data points , method  proceeds by predicting how many such grid cells within convex hull  would be occupied if the data were merely a random process. The prediction takes one of two forms, depending on the sample size n which is tested at  for a small or large sample. A third branch  is invoked to test the adequacy of the Poisson probability distribution, and is useful for examining individual cells and their contribution to the total quantities.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, steps, types of spaces, and size of samples, and arrangement of steps or types of test, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the apparatus and method of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
