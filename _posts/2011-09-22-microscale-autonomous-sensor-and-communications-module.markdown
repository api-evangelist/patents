{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was developed under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Sensors are being manufactured in ever decreasing sizes. For example, credit cards are issued with radio frequency identifier (RFID) tags embedded thereon that are energized when subjected to radio frequencies of certain wavelengths. In an exemplary application, a radio wave emitter that is external to the card can be configured to output radio waves at a certain frequency, which is configured to energize the RFID tag. Responsive to the RFID tag being energized, such tag can emit data by way of an antenna at a frequency that is monitored by an RFID reader. Such data can be indicative of the identity of the owner of the credit card, the account number of the credit card, an expiration date of the credit card, or the like. When the RFID tag ceases to receive energizing radio waves from the radio wave emitter, the RFID tag ceases to emit data.","In another example, an RFID tag can include a power source. In such a configuration, the RFID tag is configured to continuously (or periodically) output a signal until a charge of the battery is dissipated. In most commercial applications, the RFID tags do not include a power source, due to size constraints and costs corresponding to batteries.","In either configuration, RFID tags can be relatively small in size. Reduction in size of RFID tags, however, is limited, as RFID tags include an antenna to output data by way of radio waves. Furthermore, RFID tags are generally not autonomous, as typically RFID tags must be activated by an external energy source to output data.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Described herein are various technologies pertaining to a microscale autonomous sensor and communications module. For example, a microscale autonomous sensor and communications module may be on the order of millimeters in diameter and thickness. In an exemplary embodiment, the microscale autonomous sensor and communications module can include an energy storage device, such as a capacitor, an ultra-capacitor, or a thin-film solid-state battery. For instance, the thin-film solid state battery can be a thin-film rechargeable lithium battery, a thin-film rechargeable lithium ion battery, or the like.","The microscale autonomous sensor and communications module additionally includes an integrated circuit that comprises memory, wherein the memory includes instructions for operating the module. In an example, the integrated circuit may be a dual-sided integrated circuit that can be accessed (contacted) on either side thereof. For instance, the battery can be contacted with the integrated circuit on a first side of the integrated circuit (by way of solders or epoxy bumps). Further, the memory of the integrated circuit may comprise non-volatile memory that can retain information that is indicative of a current state of the module and\/or a parameter sensed by the module. In an example, the state of the module may be a function of an environmental parameter and\/or a previous state of the module.","The microscale autonomous sensor and communications module can further include at least one sensor that is configured to output a sensor signal that is indicative of at least one environmental parameter monitored by the sensor. Exemplary environmental parameters include temperature, existence (or lack of existence) of a chemical, electromagnetic radiation of a defined wavelength or range of wavelengths (ultraviolet, infrared, visible), humidity, pressure, or other suitable environmental parameter. In an exemplary embodiment, the sensor can be a photovoltaic cell that is configured to sense electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelengths. Furthermore, the photovoltaic cell can have a first side and a second side, and both positive and negative contacts may be on the first side of the photovoltaic cell. These positive and negative contacts can be contacted with corresponding contacts on the second side of the integrated circuit, such that the photovoltaic cell is electrically coupled to the energy storage device by way of the integrated circuit.","The microscale autonomous sensor and communications module further comprises an optical emitter that is configured to output an optical signal. In an exemplary embodiment, the optical emitter can be configured to output the optical signal based at least in part upon the sensor value output by the sensor (and therefore based at least in part upon the environmental parameter). In another exemplary embodiment, the integrated circuit can comprise executable instructions that cause the optical emitter to output an optical signal without reference to the output of the sensor. For instance, the executable instructions in the integrated circuit can cause the optical emitter to randomly output an optical signal. In another example, the executable instructions can cause the optical emitter to output an optical signal in a predefined sequence.","In an exemplary embodiment, the optical emitter can be one of a light emitting diode (LED) or a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). In an exemplary embodiment, the optical emitter can output the optical signal based at least in part upon a state of the module that is retained in non-volatile memory on the integrated circuit. In other words, the integrated circuit can receive the sensor signal output by the sensor, and the integrated circuit can generate an output signal as a function of the sensor signal. The output signal is transmitted to the optical emitter, which outputs an optical signal based at least in part upon the output signal. Therefore, in an example, if the sensor senses the environmental parameter, the integrated circuit can cause an output signal to be transmitted to the optical emitter that causes the optical emitter to output an optical signal of a particular wavelength and amplitude. Accordingly, an individual or other microscale autonomous sensor and communications module can be provided with information that indicates the existence of the environmental parameter.","As mentioned above, the integrated circuit can also take into consideration the state of the module when transmitting the output signal to the optical emitter. For instance, the integrated circuit can cause the optical emitter to output an optical signal of a first wavelength and first amplitude upon the sensor detecting a first occurrence of the environmental parameter and can thereafter cause the optical emitter to output an optical signal of a second wavelength and second amplitude upon the sensor sensing a second occurrence of the environmental parameter. Thus, the instructions in the memory may be self-modifying.","Further, the integrated circuit can be configured to monitor charge of the energy storage device and voltage generated by the photovoltaic cell and control distribution and usage of electric power between the integrated circuit, the energy storage device, the sensor, and the optical emitter. Therefore, in an exemplary embodiment, the microscale autonomous sensor and communications module can continuously operate over a relatively long period of time.","The optical emitter may have both positive and negative contacts on a same side of the optical emitter, and can be contacted with the integrated circuit by way of solders and\/or epoxy bumps adjacent to the sensor. The energy storage device can be positioned on the opposing side of the integrated circuit, such that both the optical emitter and the sensor are electrically coupled to the energy storage device by way of the integrated circuit.","Other aspects will be appreciated upon reading and understanding the attached figures and description.","Various technologies pertaining to a microscale autonomous sensor and communications module will now be described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals represent like elements throughout. Further, as used herein, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something, and is not intended to indicate a preference.","With reference now to , an exemplary microscale autonomous sensor and communications module  is illustrated. In an example, the module  may be less than 2 mm in diameter and less than 2 mm in thickness. In another example, the module  may less than 1 mm in diameter and less than 1 mm in thickness. In still yet another example, the module  may be less than 1 mm in diameter and less than 50 \u03bcm in thickness.","The module  comprises an energy storage device . The energy storage device  may be a capacitor, an ultra-capacitor, or a rechargeable thin film lithium battery, such as a rechargeable thin film lithium battery or a rechargeable thin film lithium ion battery. It is to be understood, however, that the energy storage device  may be any suitable energy storage device, and such energy storage devices are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto-appended claims.","The module  can also comprise an integrated circuit , wherein the integrated circuit includes a memory that comprises executable instructions and\/or state information pertaining to a state of the module . Accordingly, instructions executing on the integrated circuit  can modify values in the memory based at least in part upon a current state of the module . In an example, the integrated circuit  can be a dual-sided integrated circuit that can have a first side and a second side that is opposite the first side, where the first side includes at least one positive contact and one negative contact and the second side includes at least two positive contacts and at least two negative contacts. The energy storage device  can be contacted with the integrated circuit  by solders and\/or epoxy bumps on the first side of the integrated circuit . In other words, the integrated circuit  is electrically coupled to the energy storage device  by way of contacts  and .","The module  further comprises a sensor  that is electrically connected to the integrated circuit  by way of contacts  and  on the second side of the integrated circuit . The sensor  can be configured to output a sensor signal that is indicative of at least one environmental parameter pertaining to the module . This environmental parameter, for instance, can be, but is not limited to being, electromagnetic radiation of a particular wavelength, existence (or lack of existence) of a certain chemical, temperature, humidity, pressure, or other suitable environmental parameter. In an exemplary embodiment, the sensor  can be a photovoltaic cell that is configured to generate voltage responsive to receipt of electromagnetic radiation of a particular wavelength. Such wavelength may be ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays, infrared, visible light, or other suitable wavelength. The sensor  can output the sensor signal to the integrated circuit  by way of the electrical contacts  and . In an example, the electrical contacts  and  may be on a same side of the sensor . An exemplary sensor (a photovoltaic cell) that has positive and negative contacts on a same side is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/164,017, filed on Jun. 20, 2011, and entitled \u201cSOLAR CELL WITH BACK SIDE CONTACTS\u201d, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Having both positive and negative contacts on a single side of the sensor can increase a surface area of the sensor  that can be employed for detecting the environmental parameter.","The integrated circuit  can be programmed to monitor the sensor signal output by the sensor  and can generate an output signal based at least in part upon the sensor signal. Pursuant to an example, the executable instructions in the memory of the integrated circuit  can cause the integrated circuit  to receive the sensor signal and generate the output signal based at least in part upon the sensor signal. Additionally, the instructions can cause the output signal to be generated based at least in part upon a current state of the module , wherein such state can be retained in the memory of the integrated circuit . Such state information can be updated by the executable instructions as sensor signals are received from the sensor . Further, at least a portion of the memory of the integrated circuit can be non-volatile in nature, such that state information can be retained if the module  lacks sufficient power to operate the integrated circuit .","The module  can further include an optical emitter  that is electrically connected to the second side of the integrated circuit by way of electric contacts  and . In an example, the optical emitter  can be a light emitting diode (LED), a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), or other suitable optical emitter. In an exemplary embodiment, the optical emitter  can receive the output signal from the integrated circuit  and output an optical signal responsive to receipt of the output signal from the integrated circuit . For example, the output signal can be voltage at a particular level that causes the optical emitter  to output an optical signal with a particular wavelength and amplitude.","The energy storage device  can be configured to provide electric power to the integrated circuit , the sensor , and\/or the optical emitter . As shown, the energy storage device  can provide electric power to the sensor  and\/or the optical emitter  by way of the integrated circuit .","As mentioned above, in an exemplary embodiment, the sensor  can be or include a photovoltaic cell or other suitable sensor that can generate energy as a function of a renewable energy resource. For instance, the sensor  can be configured to generate voltage responsive to the sensor  receiving electromagnetic radiation of a specified wavelength. The instructions in the integrated circuit  can be configured to manage distribution of electric power amongst the energy storage device , the integrated circuit , the sensor , and\/or the optical emitter  based at least in part upon an amount of energy generated by the sensor , an amount of charge in the energy storage device , an amount of power needed to execute the instructions in the integrated circuit , and\/or an amount of energy needed to drive the optical emitter . For example, if the energy storage device  is fully charged and the sensor  generates a voltage, the integrated circuit  can utilize the voltage generated by the sensor  and direct voltage to the optical emitter , such that energy of the energy storage device  is not employed to drive the integrated circuit  or the optical emitter . In another exemplary embodiment, the integrated circuit  can monitor an amount of voltage generated by the sensor  and can ascertain that such amount of voltage is insufficient to operate the optical emitter . Accordingly, the integrated circuit  can cause the optical emitter  to be provided with electric power from the energy storage device . This allows the module  to continuously operate autonomously.","While the exemplary microscale autonomous sensor and communications module has been shown and described above as comprising an energy storage device that is separate from the integrated circuit , in an exemplary embodiment the energy storage device  can be integrated in the integrated circuit . In such an exemplary embodiment, the energy storage device  can be a capacitor that is configured to provide a relatively limited amount of power to the integrated circuit  and\/or the optical emitter .","Further, the examples set forth above indicate that the integrated circuit  causes the optical emitter  to emit an optical signal based at least in part upon an environmental condition sensed by the sensor . It is to be understood, however, that in other exemplary embodiments the integrated circuit  can be programmed with executable instructions that cause the optical emitter  to output an optical signal without reference to a signal output by the sensor . For instance, the integrated circuit can cause data received by the sensor  to be retained in non-volatile memory, while causing the optical emitter  to output an optical signal in accordance with predefined (static) program instructions.","Moreover, the microscale autonomous sensor and communications module  is shown as including a separate sensor and optical emitter. In an exemplary embodiment, the sensor  and the optical emitter  can be integrated in a single device. For instance, a GaAs cell can function as both a sensor of radiation of a certain wavelength as well as an optical emitter. Further, in another exemplary embodiment, the energy storage device , the integrated circuit , the sensor , and the optical emitter  can be fabricated on a same chip.","Referring now to , an exemplary system  that facilitates interaction between microscale autonomous sensor and communication modules is illustrated. The system  comprises a first microscale autonomous sensor and communications module  and a second microscale autonomous sensor and communications module . The first module  comprises an energy storage device , an integrated circuit , a sensor , and an optical emitter , which interact with one another as described above. The second module  likewise includes an energy storage device , an integrated circuit , a sensor , and an optical emitter , which can act in conjunction as described above.","In the example shown in , the sensor  of the second module  is configured to sense an environmental parameter, which can be any suitable environmental parameter. The integrated circuit  of the second module  receives the sensor signal output by such sensor , which (in the example shown in ) can indicate the existence of the environmental parameter. The integrated circuit  then generates an output signal based at least in part upon the sensor signal (and optionally, state of the second module ). The integrated circuit  may then direct the output signal to the optical emitter  (powered by the sensor  and\/or the energy storage device ), and the optical emitter  can output an optical signal responsive to receiving the output signal from the integrated circuit .","The sensor  of the first module  may be configured to sense electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths that include a wavelength of the optical signal output by the optical emitter  of the second module . The sensor  of the first module  can output a sensor signal that indicates the existence of the optical signal generated by the optical emitter , and such sensor signal can be received by the integrated circuit  of the first module . Based at least in part upon such sensor signal (and optionally, state information in the memory of the integrated circuit ), the integrated circuit  can generate an output signal and provide such output signal to the optical emitter  of the first module . This causes the optical emitter  to output an optical signal. Such optical signal may be detected by yet another module (not shown) or by a human eye. Therefore, it can be ascertained that information pertaining to the existence of one or more environmental parameters can be relayed between microscale autonomous sensor and communications modules described herein, as well as relayed to human beings.","Various exemplary applications where the microscale autonomous sensor and communications modules shown in  can be employed will now be described. It is to be understood that these applications are exemplary in nature, and employment of a microscale autonomous sensor and communications module is not intended to be limited by the exemplary applications discussed below. In a first exemplary application, it may be desirable to ascertain existence of a particular chemical (a chemical that corresponds to corrosion) in a set of piping utilized, for instance, in a nuclear power plant. Oftentimes, such piping is too small for automated robots to traverse the piping and monitor corrosion. Modules such as the ones described above can be equipped with sensors that are configured to sense a chemical that indicates corrosion in the piping. Responsive to detecting such chemical, the modules can be configured to output an optical signal that can inform a human of the existence of the chemical. For instance, the modules can be caused to traverse the piping and can be collected at a suitable exit point. There, optical signals emitted by the modules and\/or information retained in non-volatile memory of the modules can be reviewed to determine whether corrosion exists in the piping.","In another exemplary application, modules such as those described with respect to  can be employed in a toy. For instance, the modules can be utilized as snowflakes in a snow globe, wherein a subset of such modules are configured to output optical signals of a first wavelength and amplitude responsive to sensing electromagnetic radiation from the sun, while other modules are configured to output optical signals of a second wavelength and amplitude responsive to receiving optical signals from others of the modules. This can create an ever-changing light display that is based upon electromagnetic radiation received by certain modules in the snow globe.","In still yet another exemplary application, microscale autonomous sensor and communications modules can be employed in a floating display device (which can be, for instance, the snow globe mentioned above). For instance, the modules can be programmed with information pertaining to identities of other modules in the snow globe. Accordingly, a module can determine its position relative to another module in the snow globe due to the passing of information between modules (flashing of light of certain frequencies, etc.). Due to the knowledge of relative positions of the modules, a floating image can be created. In each of the above-described applications, the modules can communicate with one another in a \u201cswarm\u201d environment, such that modules can monitor for certain environmental parameters, can receive communications from other modules, and can output optical signals as a function of the environmental parameters, communications from the other modules, and internal states.","Now referring collectively to , manufacture of an exemplary microscale autonomous sensor and communications module is illustrated. With reference now to , a battery  is affixed to a temporary movable handle . While the handle  is shown and described as transporting the battery , it is to be understood that in other exemplary embodiments the handle  can be configured to transport some other suitable energy storage device. The handle , for instance, may be a glass wafer that can be coupled to machinery that can transport the handle  (and thus the battery  and modules connected to the battery ) laterally and vertically. As shown in , the temporary handle  is dropped in a vertical direction, causing the battery  to be in permanent physical and electrical contact with adhesive contacts  and  (solders and\/or epoxy bumps) on an integrated circuit . The integrated circuit  can reside on a silicon substrate . As shown in , the temporary handle  is then moved upward in the vertical direction, thereby allowing the integrated circuit  to be lifted off of the silicon substrate .","With reference now to , the temporary handle  is transported in a horizontal direction, such that the battery  and the integrated circuit  are positioned above a sensor  that has a plurality of adhesive contacts  and  thereon. The sensor  resides on a silicon substrate . As shown in , the temporary handle  is dropped in the vertical direction towards the sensor  until the integrated circuit  is coupled to the adhesive contacts  and , thereby permanently affixing the sensor  with the integrated circuit  and electrically contacting the sensor  with the integrated circuit . As shown in , subsequent to the sensor  being affixed to the integrated circuit , the temporary handle  is moved upwards, such that the sensor  is lifted off of the silicon substrate .","With reference now to , the temporary handle  is transported over a III-V substrate  that includes a plurality of optical emitters. The temporary handle  is moved downward to electrically (and permanently) contact with an optical emitter  by way of adhesive contacts  and . Turning now to , the temporary handle  is lifted upwards, thereby causing the emitter  to be lifted off of the III-V substrate . The module that comprises the battery , the integrated circuit , the sensor , and the optical emitter  can be removed from the temporary handle  by way of any suitable removal techniques. In an example, the battery , the integrated circuit , the sensor , and\/or the optical emitter  can be removed from their respective handles\/substrates by way of a chemical release process, a thermal release process, an optical release process, or other suitable release process.","Referring now to , a coating system  is configured to apply a protective polymer coating  to the module that includes the battery , the integrated circuit , the sensor , and the optical emitter . This polymer coating  can protect the module from certain environmental conditions. While the polymer coating  is shown as being applied subsequent to each of the components of the module being assembled together, it is to be understood that a polymer coating  may be applied after the battery  has been contacted with the integrated circuit , and again after the combination of the battery  and the integrated circuit  has been contacted with the sensor , and again after the optical emitter  has been added to the module.","With reference now to , various exemplary methodologies are illustrated and described. While the methodologies are described as being a series of acts that are performed in a sequence, it is to be understood that the methodologies are not limited by the order of the sequence. For instance, some acts may occur in a different order than what is described herein. In addition, an act may occur concurrently with another act. Furthermore, in some instances, not all acts may be required to implement a methodology described herein.","Now referring solely to , an exemplary methodology  that facilitates manufacturing a microscale autonomous sensor and communications module is illustrated. The methodology  starts at , and at , a relatively small energy storage device, such as a thin film battery is received. At , an integrated circuit is received, wherein the integrated circuit is configured with memory that comprises executable instructions for generating an output signal based at least in part upon a sensor signal.","At , the battery is coupled with the integrated circuit by way of solders and\/or epoxy bumps. At , a sensor is received, wherein the sensor is configured to output a sensor signal that pertains to an environmental parameter.","At , the sensor is electrically coupled with the integrated circuit by way of solders and\/or epoxy bumps. Accordingly, the sensor is also electrically coupled with the energy storage device by way of the integrated circuit. At , an optical emitter is received, and at , the optical emitter is electrically coupled with the integrated circuit. The optical emitter can be placed adjacent to the sensor on a first side of a dual-sided integrated circuit, and the energy storage device can be on the opposite side of the dual-sided integrated circuit. Further, in an exemplary embodiment, the resulting module can be between 100 \u03bcm and 1 mm in diameter and between 10 \u03bcm and 1 mm in thickness. The methodology  completes at .","Turning now to , an exemplary methodology  that facilitates causing an optical signal to be output in a microscale autonomous sensor and communications module is illustrated. The methodology  starts at , and at  an environmental parameter is sensed by a sensor in the microscale autonomous sensor and communications module. For instance, a photovoltaic cell can be employed to sense the environmental parameter.","At , an electric voltage is output based at least in part upon the sensed environmental parameter. In other words, the photovoltaic cell can output electric voltage upon receiving electromagnetic radiation in a particular wavelength. This electric voltage can also be referred to as a sensor signal that is output by the photovoltaic cell. At , an output signal is generated by an integrated circuit based at least in part upon the sensor signal. That is, the integrated circuit receives the sensor signal from the photovoltaic cell and outputs an output signal in accordance with executable instructions in memory of the integrated circuit and\/or a state of the module.","At , the output electric voltage is selectively directed to a battery, the integrated circuit, and\/or an optical emitter. The integrated circuit can monitor the voltage level received from the photovoltaic cell, as well as the energy level of a battery, and can cause the voltage to be selectively directed to the battery, the integrated circuit, or the optical emitter.","At , the optical emitter is caused to generate an optical signal based at least in part upon the output signal. The output signal may have a certain voltage level that causes the optical emitter to output an optical signal of a certain wavelength and amplitude (and at a certain frequency). The methodology  completes at .","It is noted that several examples have been provided for purposes of explanation. These examples are not to be construed as limiting the hereto-appended claims. Additionally, it may be recognized that the examples provided herein may be permutated while still falling under the scope of the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
