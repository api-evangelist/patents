{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT\/US2009\/56528 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/191,592, filed Sep. 10, 2008, entitled A TRANSPORTABLE BOARD FOR THE RESTRAINT OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS UNDERGOING A LUMBAR PUNCTURE PROCEDURE, which documents are hereby incorporated by reference herein to the extent permitted by law.","Lumbar punctures, or spinal taps, are indicated for a variety of reasons. In infants, lumbar puncture is indicated in any infant with symptoms suggestive of meningitis (seizures, intractable vomiting and unexplained fever), and in the evaluation of neonatal intracranial bleeding. The infant must be held firmly in the lateral decubitus or sitting position. Generally, a 22 to 25 gauge needle is inserted into the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid is collected for diagnostic testing.","In general, the lumbar puncture procedure is carried out by a physician with the aid of one or more other persons who hold the infant in a side-laying, sitting position with the back arched. This position provides the physician access to the spinal region from which the cerebrospinal fluid will be drawn. Stable, proper positioning of the patient is critical to a successful lumbar puncture. If the patient's back is over-arched, upward pressure can be exerted on the infant's diaphragm resulting in a compromise of the patient's respiratory status. Similarly, neurologic injury or unnecessary trauma can occur if the needle is inserted in the incorrect location.","Techniques that employ a device configured to position an infant patient in a clinically preferred position for conducting a lumbar puncture are described. In one or more implementations, the device includes a board, a positioning member adjustably coupled to the board, and a locking device coupled to the positioning member for locking the positioning member in a position relative to one or both of the board or the patient. The positioning member is configured to induce the patient into a clinically preferred position for performing a lumbar puncture on the patient.","This Summary is provided solely to introduce subject matter that is fully described in the Detailed Description and Drawings. Accordingly, the Summary should not be considered to describe essential features nor be used to determine scope of the claims.","Techniques for facilitating a lumbar puncture procedure are described. The techniques employ a device configured to position an infant patient in a clinically preferred position for conducting a lumbar puncture. In one or more implementations, the device includes a board, a positioning device, a board interface, and an inducing device. The board may be any flat, planar base to which a variety of positioning devices may be attached. The instant interface between the board and the patient can be a thin layer of soft material, but the board needs to have sufficient rigidity in order to stabilize the patient during the performance of the procedure. The positioning device is one or more devices that place a patient in a clinically preferred position upon the board. The board interface is the device by which the positioning device may be connected to the board. In some aspects, the board interface is adjustable so that the positioning device can be placed in multiple positions around the board. Lastly, the inducing device is the way by which the system mechanically adjusts the position of the patient into a clinically preferred position. The board and positioning members may comprise an anti-microbial material.","As used herein, a stable, clinically preferred position of the patient facilitates a successful lumbar puncture of an infant patients. As noted above, if the patient's back is over-arched, upward pressure can be exerted on the infant's diaphragm resulting in a compromise of the patient's respiratory status. Similarly, neurologic injury or unnecessary trauma can occur if the needle is inserted in the incorrect location. Accordingly, a clinically preferred position facilitates access to the proper regions of the spine without increased risk of compromising the respiratory status of the patient.","Referring to , an example lumbar puncture positioning device  is described. As shown, the device  includes a rigid board  and a positioning device or positioning members made of straps , ,  and . Board  is primarily composed of a rigid material so that it provides a hard, substantially inflexible base. In one aspect, the board has dimensions of about 12\u2033\u00d718\u2033\u00d724\u2033 and is composed of polypropylene. However, a board of any dimensions or material sufficient to contain the other elements of the system and the patient is also contemplated. Board  need not be solid or formed of material of sufficient density for repeated use. The board may be formed of thinner and lighter material such that it may be inexpensive and intended for a single use. In some aspects, the board  may comprise a plurality of segments that may be separated or folded for storage.","The positioning device is comprised of four straps , , , and  which are threaded, fed, or looped through the slits  and  in the board that serve as the board interface. In one system, the straps are made of Nylon and combine to partially surround the patient's body. The lower back of the patient is uncovered by the straps , , , and  so that the operator can access the anatomy needed to perform a lumbar puncture. In some systems, all or substantially all of the positioning device is made of inexpensive materials so that the positioning device can be affordably sold in sterilizable packaging and affordably disposed of after a single use. When positioning the patient, the sterile straps will allow a sterile field around the patient's relevant anatomy.","In the present system , the operator feeds each strap comprising the positioning device ( and ) through one of the set of board interface slits  and . Similarly, straps  and  may be fed through slits . In some aspects, the board interface device further comprises an additional anchor for the positioning device: such as a hook and loop attachment, a snap or an adhesive region. The board interface may be adjustable. The straps may also be adjustably positioned by use of hook and loop or other attachment devices for coupling the straps to the board. In the present system, the board interface is comprised of multiple slits ,  at multiple positions on the board  so that the straps , , , and  can be placed in more than one location and accommodate multiple sizes of patients. In the present system, the straps interface with the board through two sets of slits: one located at the posterior end of the patient and one located behind the neck at the anterior end of the sideways-laying patient. A single strap  or  is fed through a pair of slits  or  and anchored to the bottom side of the board .","The straps emerging from the posterior slits must be broad enough to cover a substantial amount of the patient's body. The straps taper off along their length into 1 inch straps ,  and a locking device shown as buckles , . The straps secure the patient by the operation of buckles that arrange the straps diagonally across the patient. The connection of the straps comprising the positioning device induces the patient to assume the clinically preferred position. The straps coordinate to securely position the patient.","In some aspects, the board interface comprises other devices of attaching the straps comprising the positioning device. The Figures depict a board interface comprising four or more slits, but the board interface may accommodate any number of slits so as to maximize adjustability of the positioning device. For example, the alternative slits may be placed in a concentric pattern such that the relative positions for corresponding slits are unchanged. In this manner, the board and straps may accommodate patients of a wide variety of sizes. The operator may anchor the straps to the bottom of the board by a variety of devices before they emerge through the slits. This attachment may occur by clips, snaps, buttons, ties, or loops.","Referring more particularly to , the inducing device  is shown as the straps through which tension is applied to the patient through the fastening of the straps ,  to the frontal straps , . By tightening the buckles between the broad posterior straps ,  and the frontal straps , , the patient is induced into a clinically preferred position as her shoulders and legs are bent around the point of intersection of the straps. Because the board itself is rigid and exerts an equal, or substantially equal, force back against the straps, the patient is thus effectively held immobile in the clinically preferred position.","Referring to , aspects of the system are shown. The board  is composed of primary layer  of substantially rigid, ridged cross-link closed-cell foam, with a second layer  of foam located on top of the primary layer. This second layer  of foam may have a laminated hook and loop fastener material (e.g. VELCRO-compatible) fabric top surface. In the present system, the lightweight nature of the foam board  increases the portability and versatility of this device. The foam also makes the material less expensive to produce and single use or limited use disposability affordable. The board may be formed to the dimensions described in the previous Figures but, the board can be formed to any dimension that accommodates the placement of the positioning device.","In the present system, the positioning device or positioning members are comprised of three separate foam blocks , , and . In some aspects, these blocks are composed of anti-microbial foam, though all clinically acceptable types of foam or other suitable material are contemplated. Preferably, the foam has a minimum density of 1.7 lbs\/ft, a SAG Factor of at least 2.0, permits air flow of no more than 4.0 ft\/min, a tear strength of at least 2.0 lbs\/linear inch, a tensile strength of 10.0-15.0 lbs\/in, elongation of 125-175%, resilience of at least 30% and Compression Set 90%, for 22 hours at 158\u00b0 Fahrenheit of less than 10%. As with the prior Figures, the positioning device is formed of materials that can be packaged in single use sterile packaging and produced affordably enough to be affordably disposable. When the sterile foam blocks position the patient, they create a sterile field around the anatomy to perform the lumbar puncture.","Together, the positioning device is comprised of foam blocks that surround the patient and induce the patient into a clinically preferred position. The first block  (hereinafter the \u201cPivot Block\u201d) is a foam block, shown as configured in the shape of an \u201c8\u201d, but any shape that will induce the patient into a clinically preferred position when appropriately interfaced with the board may be used. The Pivot Block's  round edge allows inducement of the patient to curl around the Pivot along their ventral side. In some aspects, for infant lumbar puncture, the Pivot Block  is about 4.5\u2033 tall, but other heights that correspond to the width of the patient are permissible. Additionally, the system may comprise a kit containing a number of Pivot Blocks in order to accommodate patients of a variety of sizes. The second block  (hereinafter the \u201cHead Block\u201d) is a foam block that is comprised out of substantially the same material as the Pivot Block  but formed to a different shape. In some aspects, the Head Block  contains a groove  for supporting the neck of the patient, which specifically supports neck flexion at a clinically recommended level. The third block  (hereinafter the \u201cLower Block\u201d) is a foam block that is comprised out of substantially the same material as the Pivot Block  and Head Block  but formed to a different shape. Because the Lower Block  is not required to induce the patient to conform to a particular position or support critical anatomy, the Lower Block  need not conform to a specific shape. Instead, Lower Block  provides a guide to position the patient's lower body in the clinically preferred position.","Conjunctively, the blocks , , and  are arranged on the board such that when a patient is placed between them, the patient must automatically assume a clinically preferred position. In some aspects, the board  has markings  which assist with placement of the blocks into the correct formation. Specifically, the Pivot Block  is placed in the center of the board, or any location where the subsequent blocks and the patient may be properly placed in relation thereto. The patient is then placed on the board and assumes the clinically preferred position by curling around the Pivot Block . The Lower Block  is then placed behind the patient's legs, thereby compressing them between the Pivot Block  and the Lower Block  in the clinically preferred position. The Head Block  is then placed around the patient's upper body, taking care to ensure that the patient's neck is placed into the neck groove . In this manner, the patient is conformed to the clinically preferred position.","In some aspects, the foam blocks ,  and  comprising the positioning device are formed from a deformable material that can be packaged inside an airtight package wherein the package can be vacuum sealed so that the packaged foam blocks are substantially smaller. Further, the board  may be formed from multiple components or otherwise jointed so that it can be folded or assembled from smaller pieces. In some aspects, both the positioning device and the board are packaged in containers small enough to ship as part of a lumbar puncture tray: such as a Covidien SENSI-TOUCH\u2122 Lumbar Puncture Tray with Safety Components. For example, for systems where the positioning device is one or more straps, the straps and board  can be folded to fit on top of the tray. In such systems, the board  and the positioning device can be formed out of materials commonly used to make disposable medical devices.","The board interface may be comprised of VELCRO hooks which are attached to both the top and bottom of the Pivot Block , Head Block , and Lower Block , along with the VELCRO-compatible fabric used as the top surface of the board. In some aspects, the SCOTCHMATE\u2014SJ3526N or SJ3527N family of nylon hooks and loop reclosable fasteners may be used. The board interface comes into play when the various blocks are placed in their appropriate positions upon the board.","In some aspects, induction to the clinically preferred position is aided by Locking Strip . Locking Strip  is shown as a piece of VELCRO-compatible fabric, formed to outline the profile of the positioning device. The Locking Strip  interfaces with the foam blocks comprising the positioning device. To facilitate the induction of the patient into the clinically preferred position, the operator secures the Locking Strip  firmly to the VELCRO-top  of the Head Block . Next, the Locking Strip  is stretched taught down to the Lower Block  and is firmly secured via its VELCRO-covered top . Finally, the Locking Strip  is stretched over the patient's body to the Pivot Block  until a moderate degree of tension is acquired. The Locking Strip  is then firmly secured to the VELCRO-compatible top  of Pivot Block  in a manner similar to the Head Block  and Lower Block , thus effectively securing the blocks around the patient and into an immobile structure which insures that the patient cannot shift out of the clinically preferred position while blocks , , and  and Locking Strip  are in place.","Referring to , another aspect is shown. The positioning device or positioning member may be primarily comprised of single device  that surrounds the patient to form a continuous point of contact. The positioning device further includes elements that support the patient and induce the patient to assume a clinically preferred position.","As with prior described systems, the positioning device interfaces with the board  at an interface . For some aspects, utilizing a rigid board, the board interface comprises straps or ties that are permanently attached to the positioning device. The straps may interface with the board by secured insertion through one or more holes or slits in the board that allow for the adjustment of the positioning device to accommodate and position variable patients. For some aspects that utilize a foam board with a fabric surface, the board interface  may be a VELCRO or other hook and loop element that will engage with the softer surface of the board as in the previous aspects.","In the present system, the positioning device can be a woven device. The woven device must be able to non-traumatically restrain the patient and be able to flexibly accommodate the patient when the device is pulled over the patient. The woven device could be formed of any variety of materials. A non-woven positioning device may similarly surround the patient utilizing a continuous point of contact. Given the continuous point of contact formed by the positioning device in the present device, the positioning device may be further formed to contain a window  so that the operator has access to the patient's lower back in order to perform the procedure.","Indicative of the present system is that the single device may constitute the positioning device and simultaneously serve as the support device and the inducing device. Several elements of the positioning device facilitate this multiple purpose. For example, where the single device is a woven device, it may be formed to have anterior, posterior, dorsal and ventral sides. The anterior and posterior sides are formed to contain elastic elements  so as to exert force on the patient and induce a clinically preferred position for a lumbar puncture. The positioning device can include additional elastic elements to help induce the clinically preferred position.","The ventral and dorsal sides of the positioning device further include semi-rigid pads  to leverage the force exerted by the elastic elements  and facilitate the induction of the clinically preferred position. The semi-rigid pads  also help the single device to support the patient as well. The continuous point of contact utilized in the present system provides generally equal support over the patient's entire body. The semi-rigid pads  provide increased support to select areas of the patient's body.","The support pads may define the lumbar access area. Further aspects may utilize non-woven single device positioning device or different materials to adjust the relative support over the patient's body. The present system envisions the utilization of different materials, tension of elastic elements, and inclusion of pads and other elements to support and induce the correct position of the patient.","Although techniques for performing a lumbar puncture procedure have been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the appended claims are not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather, the specific features and acts are disclosed as exemplary forms of implementing the claimed devices and techniques."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures.
