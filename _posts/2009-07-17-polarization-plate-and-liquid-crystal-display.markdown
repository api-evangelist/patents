{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a National Stage Entry of International Application No. PCT\/KR2009\/003963, filed Jul. 17, 2009, and claims the benefit of Korean Application Nos. 10-2008-0070110, filed on Jul. 18, 2008, and 10-2009-0046491, filed on May 27, 2009, which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention relates to a polarizer and a liquid crystal display thereof.","A liquid crystal display is a device displaying a picture by inserting liquid crystals two sheets of thin transparent substrates. In the liquid crystal display, liquid crystals change their molecular arrangement as voltage is applied via electrodes connected thereto, so that light transmission may be varied to display a picture or a color. The liquid crystal display has advantages of being low power consumption and being capable of sheeting it flat, and thus is now in the limelight of various fields.","The liquid crystal display may be classified into electrical driving scheme and optical driving scheme according to a driving scheme. A representative example of the optical driving scheme is SLM (spatial light modulator), in which the liquid crystal display is controlled by optical signals.","Meanwhile, the electrical driving scheme may be classified into passive matrix type and active matrix type depending on the presence of active elements on driving pixel electrodes.","The passive matrix type may be classified into TN-LCD (twisted nematic-LCD), STN (super twisted nematic-LCD), F-LCD (ferroelectic-LCD) and PD-LCD (polymer dispersed-LCD), according to types of liquid crystals, and the active matrix type may be classified into two terminal type and tree terminal type, according to number of terminals.","In addition, the above two terminal type generally uses MIM (metal-insulator-metal) type or diode type, and the tree terminal type generally uses thin film transistors.","The active matrix liquid crystal display has a color filter substrate (upper transparent substrate), on which common electrodes are formed; an array substrate (bottom transparent substrate), on which pixel electrode are formed; and a liquid crystal panel comprising liquid crystals interposed between said two substrates. This display is such a type that the common electrodes and the pixel electrodes drive liquid crystals by electric field applied up and down, and has excellent transmittance, aperture ratio, resolution and capability for representing moving images.","Meanwhile, to improve viewing angle characteristics, some liquid crystal displays, such as multi-domain liquid crystal display, compensation film liquid crystal display, vertical alignment liquid crystal display (VA-LCD) and in-plane switching liquid crystal display (IPS-LCD), have been developed.","The IPS mode of the above displays is suitable to large area displays such as monitors, and has an advantage that all viewing angles are wide in the left, right, top and bottom directions.","In this IPS mode, a liquid crystal panel has the upper substrate of a color filter substrate and the bottom substrate of an array substrate, which are apart from each other, and opposite to each other, and has a liquid crystal layer interposed between said upper and bottom substrates. On said upper substrate, a black matrix is formed, which serves to interrupt light leakage, in a form of matrix, and red, green and blue layers are formed, sequentially and repeatedly, at regions corresponding to pixel regions, respectively, and an overcoat layer is usually formed thereon. On said bottom substrate, common electrodes and pixel electrodes are formed, whereby the liquid crystal layer operates by horizontal electrical field with the common electrodes and the pixel electrodes.","Generally, said various liquid crystal displays have a structure as represented in . Specifically, the liquid crystal display has a liquid crystal panel comprising a liquid crystal layer () and the upper and bottom substrates (for example, a glass substrate such as a color filter substrate and an array substrate) (-, -), and also comprises the upper polarizer () formed on the upper part of said liquid crystal panel and the bottom polarizer (not represented therein) formed on the bottom part thereof.","A polarizing film (or polarizing element) (-) included in the upper or bottom polarizer comprises a iodine-based compound or a dichroic polarizing material arranged in certain direction, and protective films (-, -) for protecting the polarizing film are formed on the upper part and the bottom part. In addition, additionally functional films such as an antireflective film (-) may be formed on the polarizer.","Such a polarizer is usually attached to a liquid crystal panel via a pressure sensitive adhesive (b). Here, said upper polarizer () is not directly attached to the liquid crystal panel, but following first forming an ITO thin film (a) thereon, it is attached thereto.","The reason for forming the ITO thin film (a) between the liquid crystal panel and the upper polarizer is to solve problems such as malfunction of devices or stains by static electricity generated in procedures of preparing or using liquid crystal displays.","That is, much static electricity is often generated in a process of peeling off a release film on a pressure sensitive adhesive of the polarizer, to attach it to the outside surface of the liquid crystal panel, and also preparation or use procedures. Such generated static electricity affects arrangement of the liquid crystal layer to deteriorate quality of products or induce malfunction of devices. Therefore, to prevent this problem, static electricity is prevented by forming the ITO layer via vapor deposition processes using sputtering equipments and attaching the polarizer on the upper part of such formed ITO layer.","Demand for preventing such static electricity is important, particularly, in the above described IPS-LCD. That is, as both of pixel electrodes and common electrodes in the IPS liquid crystal panel are formed on only the array substrate of the bottom substrate, static electricity generation is particularly problematic in a process of attaching the polarizer to the outside surface of the upper substrate (color filter substrate).","However, with regard to said ITO, there are concerns about demand and supply difficulty and cost increase, and the like, due to depletion of raw materials in future. In addition, since equipments for vapor depositing ITO thin films are expensive, there is a problem that the unit cost of production increases.","Therefore, such an alternative that the ITO layer is not totally formed on the liquid crystal panel, but partially formed thereon, is practiced. Ultimately, it is required to develop techniques being capable to obtain the desired antistatic performance without using said ITO layer.","The present invention is intended to provide a polarizer which may solve problems such as malfunction of devices by static electricity and generation of electrostatic stains and has excellent physical properties such as endurance reliability under high temperature or high humidity condition and optical characteristics, without forming an ITO thin layer on a liquid crystal panel, and a liquid crystal display comprising the same.","The present invention provides, as means for solving said problem, a polarizer comprising a polarizing film or a polarizing element; a protective film formed on the upper part and the bottom part of said polarizing film or polarizing element; and a pressure sensitive adhesive layer formed on the bottom part of said bottom protective film, wherein an antistatic layer is formed on the upper or bottom part of said protective film.","The present invention provides, as other means for solving said problem, a liquid crystal display comprising a liquid crystal panel including a liquid crystal layer formed between the upper substrate and the bottom substrate, and","the polarizer, according to the present invention, that is directly attached to the upper substrate of said liquid crystal panel.","The present invention may provide a polarizer which may prevent malfunction of devices by static electricity generated in preparation or use procedures or electrostatic stains, and the like, without using the ITO layer that is conventionally formed between the upper glass substrate of a liquid crystal panel and a polarizer in a liquid crystal display for an antistatic purpose, and has excellent physical properties such as endurance reliability under high temperature or high humidity condition and optical characteristics, and a liquid crystal display thereof.","The present invention provides a polarizer comprising a polarizing film or a polarizing element; a protective film formed on the upper part and the bottom part of said polarizing film or polarizing element; and a pressure sensitive adhesive layer formed on the bottom part of said bottom protective film, wherein an antistatic layer is formed on the upper or bottom part of said protective film.","The polarizer of the present invention is described in more detail below.","The polarizer of the present invention comprises an antistatic layer (c) formed on the upper part and\/or the bottom part of protective films (-, -) as represented in the attached .","Said antistatic layer (c) may be included in the polarizer as a single layer as in , two or more layers may be formed on appropriate positions as represented in  and, if appropriate, the upper part and the bottom part of the upper and bottom protective films (-, -) may be formed at the same time as represented in . Numbers and positions for forming said antistatic layer (c) herein is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected depending on use of applying the polarizer.","The polarizing film or polarizing element included in the polarizer of the present invention may be selected from general films or elements known in this field, without particularly limiting any kind. In the present invention, for example, films or elements as prepared by containing polarizing components such as iodine or a dichroic dye in a film based on polyvinyl alcohol resin, and then elongating the film, may be used, as said polarizing film or element. Here, the polyvinyl alcohol resin which may be used includes, but does not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl acetal or saponified products of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. Polymerization degree of said polyvinyl alcohol resin may be 100 to 5,000, preferably 1,400 to 4,000. In addition, a thickness of said polarizing film or element herein may be appropriately selected depending on use of applying the polarizer. The polarizing film or element may be usually formed in a thickness of about 5 \u03bcm to 80 \u03bcm, to which the scope of the present invention is not limited.","The polarizer of the present invention may comprise protective films formed on the upper part and the bottom part of said polarizing film or element. Without particularly limiting any kind of said protective film herein, for example, cellulose film such as triacetyl cellulose; polyester film such as polyethylene terephthalate film; polycarbonate film; polyether sulfonate film; acrylic film and\/or polyolefin film such as polyethylene film, polypropylene film, polyolefin film containing cyclo or norbornene structure or ethylene-propylene copolymer film may be used.","The thickness of said protective film included in the polarizer herein is also not particularly restricted, and the film may be formed in a usual thickness.","A method of attaching the protective film to said polarizing film or element herein is not particularly limited, and, for example, the film may be attached using known adhesion means such as polyvinyl alcohol adhesives containing polyvinyl alcohol resin and a crosslinking agent, and the like.","The antistatic layer included in the polarizer of the present invention may have a surface resistance of 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less, preferably 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less and more preferably 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less. If the surface resistance of said antistatic layer is in excess of 10\u03a9\/\u25a1, it is apprehended that antistatic performance will be deteriorated. In addition, the lower limit of surface resistance in said antistatic layer herein is not particularly restricted, and may be suitably regulated in a range of, for example, 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or more. If the surface resistance of the antistatic layer herein is excessively lowered, it is apprehended that as the content of conductive materials included in the antistatic layer increases, endurance reliability under high temperature or high humidity, transparence, optical characteristics, and the like will be deteriorated, or adherence of the antistatic layer with other layers will be lowered.","However, the surface resistance of said antistatic layer is merely one example of the present invention. That is, the value of surface resistance in said antistatic layer may be suitably controlled, considering the number of forming antistatic layers or the value of surface resistance in a conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer, which is described below.","The antistatic layer of the present invention may comprise a binder resin and a conductive material. Specifically, the antistatic layer may be formed by dispersing certain conductive material in a composition being capable of forming a binder resin to prepare a coating material, and then coating said coating material on the desired position and curing it.","Any kind of the binder resin, which may be used herein, is not particularly limited, as long as it may have excellent transparence in cured state, and excellent adherence with a film (for example, polarizing film or element, protective film, and the like) included in the polarizer and effectively maintain a conductive material dispersed inside.","For example, acrylic resins, epoxy resins, urethane resins, phenol resins or polyester resins, and the like, and more preferably, acrylic resins may be used herein as said binder resin.","Specifically, it is preferred herein to use a light curable (for example, UV curable) binder resin as said binder resin.","By using such light curable type binder resin, the antistatic layer may be formed harder, whereby the conductive material included inside is maintained more stably, and thus, a problem, which causes change of surface resistance over time in the antistatic layer, may be prevented. In addition, by using the light curable type binder resin, viscosity may be easily controlled in a process of forming the antistatic layer, and by omitting an aging process, ant the like, workability and productivity may be outstandingly improved.","For example, the light curable binder resin as above herein, may be prepared by curing a resin composition comprising a multifunctional monomer or oligomer; and a photoinitiator.","As said multifunctional monomer or oligomer, for example, multifunctional acrylate, preferably, trifunctional or more multifunctional acrylate may be used, without particularly limiting any kind.","Specific examples of usable multifunctional acrylate herein may include, but do not limited to, difunctional acrylate such as 1,4-butanediol di(meth)acrylate, 1,6-hexanediol di(meth)acrylate, neopentyl glycol di(meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, neopentyl glycol adipate di(meth)acrylate, hydroxyl pivalic acid neopentyl glycol di(meth)acrylate, dicyclopentanyl di(meth)acrylate, caprolactone modified dicyclopentenyl di(meth)acrylate, ethyleneoxide modified di(meth)acrylate, di(meth)acryloxy ethyl isocyanurate, allylated cyclohexyl di(meth)acrylate, tricyclodecanedimethanol(meth)acrylate, dimethylol dicyclopentane di(meth)acrylate, ethyleneoxide modified hexahydrophthalic acid di(meth)acrylate, tricyclodecane dimethanol(meth)acrylate, neopentyl glycol modified trimethylpropane di(meth)acrylate, adamantane di(meth)acrylate or 9,9-bis[4-(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)phenyl]fluorene); trifunctional acrylate such as trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, propionic acid modified dipentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, propyleneoxide modified trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, trifunctional urethane(meth)acrylate or tris(meth)acryloxyethylisocyanurate; tetrafunctional acrylates such as digylcerin tetra(meth)acrylate or pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate; pentafunctional acrylated such as propionic acid modified dipentaerythritol penta(meth)acrylate; and hexafunctional acrylate such as dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate, caprolactone modified dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate or urethane(meth)acrylate (for example, reaction products of isocyanate monomer and trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, and the like) (for example, UA-306I or UA-306T from Kyoeisha).","In addition, as the photoinitiator which may be used in the present invention, for example, benzoin, benzoin methylether, benzoin ethylether, benzoin isopropylether, benzoin n-butylether, benzoin isobutylether, acetophenone, dimethylamino acetophenone, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, 2,2-diethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-one, 1-hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone, 2-methyl-1-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-morpholinopropan-1-one, 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl-2-(hydroxy-2-propyl) ketone, benzophenone, p-phenylbenzophenone, 4,4\u2032-diethylaminobenzophenone, dichlorobenzophenone, 2-methylanthraquinone, 2-ethylanthraquinone, 2-t-butylanthraquinone, 2-aminoanthraquinone, 2-methylthioxanthone, 2-ethylthioxanthone, 2-chlorothioxanthone, 2,4-dimethylthioxanthone, 2,4-diethylthioxanthone, benzyldimethyl ketal, acetophenone dimethyl ketal, p-dimethylamino benzoic acid ester, oligo[2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-[4-(1-methylvinyl)phenyl]propanone] and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-diphenyl-phosphine oxide may be used, without particularly limiting any kind, among which one kind or two or more kinds may be used.","The resin composition forming the binder resin herein preferably comprises said photoinitiator in an amount of 1 part by weight to 20 parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of a multifunctional monomer or oligomer. If the amount of said photoinitiator is less than 1 part by weight, it is apprehended that efficient curing reaction will be not carried out. If the amount is in excess of 20 parts by weight, it is apprehended that physical properties such as durability or transparency of the antistatic layer will be deteriorated, due to the remaining components.","In addition, the condition that said resin composition is subjected to light curing (for example, UV curing) to prepare the binder resin herein is not particularly restricted, and may be suitably controlled, considering composition of said resin composition.","As examples of conductive materials included in the antistatic layer together the binder resin as above herein, metals, metal oxides or alloy materials such as ITO (tin-doped indium oxide), AZO (antimony-doped zinc oxide), ATO (antimony-doped tin oxide), SnO, RuO, IrO, gold, silver, nickel, copper and palladium; or conductive polymers such as polyaniline, polyacetylene, polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyparaphenylene, polydienylene, polyphenylene vinylene, polyphenylene sulfide or polysulfurnitride may be used. As conductive materials herein, conductive materials in which the above described metals, metal oxides or alloy materials is vapor deposited on a surface of a core consisting of polymers as described above and the like to form a shell may be also used. Said conductive materials herein may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.","An amount of said conductive materials herein may vary with conductivity to be secured, but be controlled in an amount of 10 parts by weight to 80 parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of the aforementioned binder resin. If said amount is less than 10 parts by weight, it is apprehended that electric conductivity will not be obtained. If said amount is in excess of 80 parts by weight, it is apprehended that compatibility with the binder resin will be lowered, or transparence or durability of the antistatic layer will be deteriorated.","The present polarizer comprises a pressure sensitive adhesive layer formed on the bottom part of a bottom protective film, which serves to be capable of attaching the polarizer to a liquid crystal panel, together with the aforementioned components. Preferably, as said pressure sensitive adhesive layer, a conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer is used, which is not particularly limited thereto.","Said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive included in the present polarizer may have a surface resistance of 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less, preferably 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less. If the surface resistance of said pressure sensitive adhesive is in excess of 10\u03a9\/\u25a1, it is apprehended that antistatic performance represented in the polarizer will be lowered. The lower limit of surface resistance of said pressure sensitive adhesive herein is not particularly limited, and may be controlled in a range of, for example, 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or more, preferably more than 9.9\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1. If the surface resistance in the conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer is set extremely low, it is apprehended that physical properties such as endurance reliability and optical characteristics of liquid crystal displays will be deteriorated due to increase of antistatic amounts included in the pressure sensitive adhesive layer.","Said pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein may have the gel content, represented in the following Equation 1, of 5% to 95%, preferably 30% to 95%, more preferably 40% to 95%, and most preferably 60% to 85%.\n\nGel Content (%)=100\u2003\u2003[Equation 1]\n","wherein, A represents weight of said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive, and B represents dry weight of undissolved conductive pressure sensitive adhesive after immersing it in ethyl acetate at room temperature for 72 hours.","The term \u201cdry weight\u201d used herein refers to a weight of undissolved conductive pressure-sensitive adhesve itself obtained by drying the immersed conductive pressure-sensitive adhesve in a suitable condition after the aforementioned immersing process in order to remove ethyl acetate ingredient included therein. Here, the drying condition for removing ethyl acetate is not particularly limited, as long as drying is carried out to be capable of removing ethyl acetate included in the immersed conductive pressure-sensitive adhesve.","If the gel content of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein is less than 5%, it is apprehended that endurance reliability will be lowered, such that bubbles are generated in high temperature or high humidity condition. If it is in excess of 95%, it is apprehended that peeling or looseness phenomenon, and the like will be caused in high temperature or high humidity condition.","The components consisting of pressure sensitive adhesive layers herein are not particularly limited. For example, as said pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein, a cured product of a composition comprising a pressure sensitive base resin and an antistatic agent may be used.","Without particularly limiting any kind of the pressure sensitive base resin herein, preferably, a base resin having a weight average molecular weight (M) of 500,000 to 2,500,000, preferably 800,000 to 2,000,000 may be used. If the weight average molecular weight of said resin is less than 500,000, it is apprehended that endurance reliability will be lowered, such that bubbles or peeling phenomenon is caused in high temperature or high humidity condition. If it is in excess of 2,500,000, the adherence property will be lowered.","Preferably, said base resin used herein may have a glass transition temperature of \u221260\u00b0 C. to 15\u00b0 C. If the glass transition temperature of the base resin herein is less than \u221260\u00b0 C., it is apprehended that elastic modulus of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer will be extremely lowered. If it is in excess of 15\u00b0 C., it is apprehended that endurance reliability of the liquid crystal display will be lowered due to decrease of adherence.","For example, as the above base resin herein, a polymer of a monomer mixture comprising 90 parts by weight to 99.9 parts by weight of (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer; and 0.01 parts by weight to 10 parts by weight of a crosslinkable monomer may be used.","Without particularly limiting any kind of the (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer included in the monomer mixture herein, for example, alkyl(meth)acrylate may be used. If the alkyl group included in the monomer has much long chain, cohesive attraction of the pressure sensitive adhesive is lowered and glass transition temperature (T) and adherence are hard to control. Therefore, it is preferred to use alkyl(meth)acrylate having an alkyl group of 1 to 14 carbon atoms. Examples of such a monomer herein may include methyl(meth)acrylate, ethyl(meth)acrylate, n-propyl(meth)acrylate, isopropyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, t-butyl(meth)acrylate, sec-butyl(meth)acrylate, pentyl(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylbutyl(meth)acrylate, n-octyl(meth)acrylate, isooctyl(meth)acrylate, isononyl(meth)acrylate, lauryl(meth)acrylate and tetradecyl(meth)acrylate and use alone or in combination of two or more species thereof. It is preferred that such a (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer in the monomer mixture is included in an amount of 90 parts by weight to 99.9 parts by weight, relative to the aforementioned crosslinkable monomer. If said amount is less than 90 parts by weight, it is apprehended that the initial bond strength of the pressure sensitive adhesive will be lowered. If it is in excess of 99.9 parts by weight, it is apprehended that a problem with durability will occur due to decrease of cohesive attraction.","The crosslinkable monomer herein may give the pressure sensitive adhesive cohesive attraction and serve to control adhesive strength and endurance reliability, and the like under high temperature or high humidity condition. Examples of such a crosslinkable monomer may include one or two or more of a monomer containing a hydroxyl group, a monomer containing a carboxyl group and a monomer containing nitrogen. Examples of said monomer containing a hydroxy group may include one or two or more of 2-hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl(meth)acrylate, 6-hydroxyhexyl(meth)acrylate, 8-hydroxyoctyl(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxyethylene glycol(meth)acrylate or 2-hydroxypropylene glycol(meth)acrylate, examples of the monomer containing a carboxyl group may include one or two or more of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 2-(meth)acryloyloxy acetic acid, 3-(meth)acryloyloxy propionate, 4-(meth)acryloyloxy butyrate, acrylic acid dimmer, itaconic acid, maleic acid or maleic anhydride, and examples of the monomer containing nitrogen may include one or two or more of (meth)acrylamide, N-vinyl pyrrolidone or N-vinylcaprolactam, but each is not limited thereto. Here, each may be used alone or in combination of two or more species thereof.","In the monomer mixture, said crosslinkable monomer may be included in an amount of 0.01 parts by weight to 10 parts by weight, relative to the aforementioned (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer. If said amount is less than 0.01 parts by weight, it is apprehended that endurance reliability of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer will be lowered. If it is in excess of 10 parts by weight, it is apprehended that adherence or peeling strength will be lowered.","Said monomer mixture herein may further comprise a compound represented by the following Formula 1. Said compound may be added to give the pressure sensitive adhesive control of glass transition temperature and other functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"15.07mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08717518-20140506-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein, Rto Reach represent independently hydrogen or alkyl, and Rrepresents cyano; phenyl unsubstituted or substituted with alkyl; acetyloxy; or COR, where Rrepresents a glycidyloxy or amino unsubstituted or substituted with alkyl or alkoxyalkyl.","In definitions of Rto Rof said formula, alkyl or alkoxy means alkyl or alkoxy having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and is, preferably, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy.","Specific examples of said compound of Formula 1 may include one or two or more of a monomer containing nitrogen such as (meth)acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylamide, N-methyl(meth)acrylamide or N-butoxymethyl(meth)acrylamide; styrene monomer such as styrene or methyl styrene; glycidyl(meth)acrylate; or carbonic acid vinyl ester such as vinyl acetate, but are not limited thereto. When the above compound is included in the monomer mixture, its amount is, preferably, 20 parts by weight or less, relative to (meth) acryl ester monomer or crosslinkable monomer.

Endurance Reliability Evaluation","The prepared pressure sensitive adhesive polarizer was tailored in a size of 262 mm\u00d7465 mm (width\u00d7length) to prepare a sample. Then, the sample was attached to both sides of a glass substrate (300 mm\u00d7470 mm\u00d70.7 mm=width\u00d7length\u00d7height) in a state that optical absorption axes are crossed to prepare a specimen. The applied pressure on attaching was about 5 kg\/cm, and the attaching work was carried out in a clean room, so that bubbles or foreign materials were not caused. To examine moisture-heat resistance of the prepared specimen, said specimen was hold under a condition at a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. and a relative humidity of 90% for 1,000 hours, followed by observing whether or not bubbling or peeling was caused. Further, for thermal resistance, the specimen was hold at a temperature of 80\u00b0 C. for 1,000 hours, followed by observing whether or not bubbling or peeling was caused. Here, just prior to evaluating the specimen state, the specimen was hold at room temperature for 24 hours and evaluated. The evaluation standards were as follows.","\u25ef: no bubbling or peeling phenomenon","\u0394: slight bubbling or peeling phenomenon","x: present bubbling or peeling phenomenon","2. Electrostatic Stain Evaluation","It was observed whether or not electrostatic stains were caused, on or after a polarizer, on which the pressure sensitive adhesive was coated, was attached to a liquid crystal cell (32 inches) in a size of 32 inches (400 mm\u00d7708 mm).
