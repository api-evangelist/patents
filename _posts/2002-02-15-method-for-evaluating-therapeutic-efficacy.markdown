title: Method for evaluating therapeutic efficacy
abstract: The present invention relates to in vitro methods for evaluating compounds that better correlate with therapeutic efficiency than evaluating compounds based on potency alone. In general, the inventive method comprises: (i) determining a potency value for a compound against its target receptor; (ii) determining a desensitization value for the compound against its target receptor; and (iii) comparing the potency value with the desensitization value. If the desired action of a compound is as a receptor agonist, then the compound's desensitization value should be larger than the compound's potency value. This ensures that the concentration of a compound required for potency will not also cause the receptor to desensitize at the same time, thus in an essence nullifying the desired effect. The inventive methods are used to evaluate novel motilide compounds as well as ABT-229 and EM-574, two motilide compounds for which clinical trials have been initiated.

No. 60\/269,631, filed 15 Feb. 2001, entitled METHOD FOR EVALUATING THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY, by inventors Chris Carreras and Sue Dillon, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.","This invention was supported in part by NIH Grant No. DK57380. The United States government has certain rights in this invention.","Many potential drug candidates are withdrawn from further development because their promising in vitro results do not translate into therapeutic efficacy during clinical trials. Because the time and cost of taking a compound into clinical trials can be as much as ten years and 200 million dollars, failure of a potential drug at the clinical phase is enormous.","For potential drug candidates that act as receptor agonists, receptor desensitization may contribute to the disconnect between in vitro potency and lack of clinical efficacy. Receptor desensitization typically occurs upon continued stimulation of the receptors with agonists. When receptors are initially exposed to an agonist, the initial response usually peaks and then decreases to some tonic level. If the agonist is removed for a brief period, this state of receptor desensitization is maintained such that a second addition of the agonist provokes a diminished response. Removal of the agonist for a more extended period of time generally allows the receptors to reset its capacity for maximal response.","There are two types of desensitization: homologous and heterologous desensitization. Homologous desensitization is defined as the reduced response of a receptor induced only by the agonist that has stimulated the receptor. Heterologous desensitization is defined as the reduced response of a receptor induced by something other than the agonist for that receptor. For example, receptors for different hormones that act on a single signaling pathway may become less effective when only one of the receptors is continuously stimulated. Such heterologous desensitization may result either from modification of each receptor by a common feedback mechanism or from effects exerted at some common point in the effector pathway distal to the receptor itself.","Despite the importance of receptor desensitization, drug discovery efforts generally focus on agonist potency. However, because receptor desensitization can have a profound effect on clinical efficacy, methods for evaluating and incorporating receptor desensitization for therapeutic uses are needed and desired.","The present invention relates to in vitro methods for evaluating compounds that better correlate with therapeutic efficiency than evaluating compounds based on potency alone. In general, the inventive method comprises: (i) determining a potency value for a compound against its target receptor; (ii) determining a desensitization value for the compound against its target receptor, and (iii) comparing the potency value with the desensitization value. If the desired action of a compound is as a receptor agonist, then the compound's desensitization value should be larger than the compound's potency value. This ensures that the concentration of a compound required for potency will not also cause the receptor to desensitize at the same time, thus in an essence nullifying the desired effect.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["\u03b1","\u03b2\u03b3","i","\u03b1","\u03b2","3","3 "],"sup":["++","++","++"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sup":"2+","sub":["16","15"],"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"sub":"16 ","sup":"2+"},"The present invention relates to methods for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of potential drugs that act as receptor agonists. In a typical drug discovery effort, these compounds are primarily evaluated on their ability to elicit a response upon binding to their respective target receptors. The ability to elicit a response is also referred to as a compound's potency and is most often expressed in terms of an ECvalue, or the concentration of a compound that elicits 50% of a maximal response. Potency generally remains the primary consideration throughout the initial in vitro screening assays and sometimes throughout the preclinical evaluation assays.","However, the focus on potency can result in potential drug candidates that fail during clinical trials for lack of therapeutic efficacy. In addition to potency, desensitization should also be considered because the binding of agonists over time to their respective receptors can effectuate an increasingly diminished response. This phenomenon is an inherent part of receptor's mechanism of action. Desensitization is expressed in terms of a concentration that inhibits the original receptor response and is most often expressed in terms of an ICvalue, or the concentration of a compound that inhibits 50% of a maximal response.","Despite the recognition that potency and desensitization are part of a receptor's mechanism of action, a method that considers both potency and desensitization when evaluating a potential drug candidate is not in the prior art. The present invention provides such a method.","In general, the inventive method comprises: (i) determining a potency value for a compound against its target receptor; (ii) determining a desensitization value for the compound against its target receptor; and (iii) comparing the potency value with the desensitization value. If the desired action of a compound is as a receptor agonist, then the compound's desensitization value should be larger than the compound's potency value. This ensures that the concentration of a compound required for potency will not also cause the receptor to desensitize at the same time, thus in an essence nullifying its effect. In preferred embodiments, the potency value and the desensitization value are calculated using similar reaction conditions. For example, if a cell-free receptor assay is used to calculate the potency value, then the same system should also be used to calculate the desensitization value. Similarly, the potency value and the desensitization value should be expressed in a like manner. For example, if the potency value is expressed in terms of EC, then the desensitization value should be expressed in terms of IC; if the potency value is expressed in terms of EC, then the desensitization value should be expressed in terms of IC.","In one aspect of the present invention, the comparison of the potency value and the desensitization value is accomplished by calculating a ratio of the desensitization value to the potency value. This ratio is termed the \u201cefficacy index\u201d. A ratio of approximately equal to one indicates that the concentration required for potency is similar to the concentration required for desensitization. In other words, because the concentration required for the desired biological response is also the concentration that induces desensitization, the compound is not likely to be therapeutically effective if the desired response is receptor activation. Under these circumstances, the concentration required for the desired biological response should be well below the concentration that induces desensitization. In preferred embodiments, the efficacy index is at least 10 and more preferably at least 25. In even more preferred embodiments, the efficacy index is at least 50. An efficacy index greater than about 100 is most preferred. However, if the desired response were desensitization, the compounds whose desensitization value is about equal to the potency value or less than the potency value would be preferred.","In another aspect of the present invention, a screening method for GPCRs is provided. For GPCRs that causes a calcium ion (\u201cCa\u201d) influx upon activation (GPCRs that signal through the phosphatidyl inositol and calcium pathways such as motilin receptor and serotonin receptors (e.g., 5HT2a and 5HT2c)), the method comprises expressing a gene encoding a GPCR and expressing a gene for aequorin in a cell line. For GPCRs that do not cause a calcium ion influx upon activation in the native state, the method comprises expressing a gene encoding the GPCR with a promiscuous Gsuch as Gand a gene for aequorin in a cell line. The coexpression of a GPCR with a promiscuous Gis described in, for example, Stables et al, Analytical Biochemistry 252: 115-126 (1997) which is incorporated herein by reference.","Methods for measuring the potency value comprise exposing the cell line (expressing a GPCR and aequorin) to a test compound and measuring the resulting luminescence. Methods for measuring the desensitization value comprise pretreating the cell line to a test compound, exposing the cell line to a known agonist, and measuring the resulting luminescence. When the resulting cells are exposed to the agonists of the cloned receptor, the activated receptor causes a calcium ion influx that, in turn, causes the aequorin to emit a flash of light. The amount of light emitted is proportional to the both the number of cells used and the degree of receptor response. Methods for measuring the potency value and the desensitization value comprise exposing cells expressing a GPCR and aequorin to a test compound and measuring the resulting luminescence. Methods for measuring the desensitization value comprising exposing cells expressing a GPCR and aequorin to a test compound; removing the test compound from the cells; exposing the cells to a GPCR agonists; and measuring the resulting luminescence. Protocols for expression and receptor assays are further described in Examples 1 and 2. The potency and desensitization values are then compared and evaluated for each test compound as previously described.","Illustrative Application of the Inventive Methods","The methods of the present invention is further illustrated with specific reference to the motilin receptor. Motilin is a 22 amino acid peptide that, upon binding to the motilin receptor stimulates gastric motility. Non-peptide agonists of the motilin receptor are being evaluated as prokinetic agents for the treatment of disorders where enhanced gastrointestinal motility is indicated or desired. Illustrative examples of such disorders include but are not limited to gastroparesis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, anorexia, gall bladder stasis, postoperative paralytic ileus, scleroderma, intestinal pseudoobstruction, gastritis, emesis, and chronic constipation (colonic inertia).","A promising new class of prokinetic agents, motilides are macrolide compounds such as erythromycin and its derivatives that are agonists of the motilin receptor. Certain motilides have been shown to induce muscular contractions in the stomach and small intestines, increase esophageal peristalsis, and acceleration of gastric emptying in patients with gastric paresis. In fact, clinical trials have been initiated for several motilides including ABT-229 (1) and EM-574 (2) whose structures are shown below. \n\n","However, based upon the inventive methods, neither ABT-229 nor EM-574 would have been predicted to be good drug candidates.","The motilin receptor and aequorin were co-expressed and an efficacy index was calculated for erythromycin 6,9-enol ether 3, ABT-229 and EM-574. \n\n","The efficacy index for erythromycin 6,9-enol ether is greater than 20,000 and the efficacy index for both ABT-229 and EM-574 are each less than 10. Although erythromycin 6,9-enol ether possess the potency (ECin the nanomolar range) and the efficacy index to be a good drug candidate, the compound is unstable in acid and degrades in the stomach environment to a non-functional degradation product. ABT-229 has recently been pulled from clinical trials for lack of efficacy in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease. See Van Her Waarde et al., Aliment Pharmacol Ther 14: 453-462 (2000). Based on the efficacy index, EM-574 is predicted to suffer the same fate. The lesson of compounds like ABT-229 and EM-574 is that desensitization plays a role in determining therapeutic efficacy and that it should be considered early on in the evaluation process.","Applying the lessons of ABT-229 and EM-574, novel compounds are evaluated according to the methods of the present invention. The compounds are of the formula: \n\n\nwherein:\n\n","Many of the compounds contain one or more chiral centers.

Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, for example, 2nd Ed., ed. by Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: 1989); DNA Cloning, Volumes I and II (D. N. Glover ed., 1985); (M. J. Gait ed., 1984); Mullis et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195: (B. D. Hames & S. J. Higgins eds. 1984); (B. D. Hames & S. J. Higgins eds. 1984); (R. I. Freshney. Alan R.

Calos eds., 1987, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory); and , Vols. 154 and 155 (Wu et al. eds.).","Recombinant techniques are used to provide, in many instances, \u201cunnatural\u201d erythromycins or erythromycin derivatives that differ in one or more positions from the naturally occurring erythromycins A, B, C, or D. Although any suitable recombinant means may be used, a useful starting point is the complete 6-dEB synthase gene cluster that has been cloned in vectors and thus is amenable to genetic manipulations in and expression of the polyketide in . See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,672,491; 5,830,750; 5,843,718; 5,712,146; and 5,962,290 which are all incorporated herein by reference. Once the aglycone is formed, it is next hydroxylated and\/or glycoslyated and\/or methylated at the appropriate positions by a converter strain that possesses the desired functionalities.","A particularly useful converter strain is an eryA mutant that is unable to produce 6-dEB but can still carry out the desired conversions (Weber et al., J. Bacteriol. 164(1): 425-433 (1985). This mutant strain is able to take exogenously supplied 6-dEB and process it to erythromycin A by converting it into erythronolide B, 3-\u03b1-mycarosylerythronolide B, erythromycin D, erythromycin C, and finally to erythromycin A. An alternative route to erythromycin A is through erythromycin B where exogenously supplied 6-dEB is converted into erythronolide B, 3-\u03b1-mycarosylerythronolide B, erythromycin D, erythromycin B, and finally to erythromycin A. Other mutant strain, such as eryB, eryC, eryG, and\/or eryK mutants, or mutant strains having mutations in multiple genes can be used to make compounds having any combinations of hydroxylations at C-6 and C-12, glycosylations at C-3 and C-5, and methylation at C-3\u2033-OH. Any of these products may be used as starting materials for the practice of the present invention.","Erythromycins where the substituent at C-13 is methyl or ethyl, the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (\u201cDEBS\u201d) from can be used in a recombinant expression system described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,491 to produce the aglycone in . Optionally, the oleandolide or megalomicin polyketide synthase (\u201cPKS\u201d) genes may be used in this expression system. See PCT publications WO 01\/27284 and WO 00\/26349, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","For erythromycins where the substituent at C-13 is something other than methyl or ethyl, one can employ a technique known as chemobiosynthesis in which activated thioesters called SNAC-diketides are converted to 13-substituted 6-dEB derivatives (13-R-13-desethyl-6-dEB compounds) by fermentation of CH999\/pJRJ2 or functionally similar strains that contain a PKS in which the ketosynthase domain of module 1 has been inactivated by mutation (the KS1\u00b0 mutation). This methodology is described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 97\/02358 and WO 99\/03986 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,721 which are all incorporated herein by reference. Additional SNAC-diketide compounds and the corresponding aglyconcs are described in PCT Publication No. WO 00\/44717 which is incorporated herein by reference.","6-dEB and 6-dEB derivatives such as 13-substituted 6-dEB are converted into the desired erythromycin starting material by an appropriate converter strain. For example, any one of the post PKS products may be used as starting materials such as 13-substituted counterparts (where the ethyl group which normally exists at C-13 is replaced with another substituent) to: erythronolide B, 3-\u03b1-mycarosylerythronolide B, erythromycin D, erythromycin B, erythromycin C, and erythromycin A. In particular, 13-substituted erythromycin A can be made by fermentation with an eryA mutant that is incapable of producing 6-dEB but can still carry out the desired conversions. 13-substituted erythromycin B can be made by fermentation with an eryA mutant that is incapable of producing 6-dEB and in which the ery K (12-hydroxylase) gene has been deleted or otherwise rendered inactive. Alternatively, erythromycin B derivatives can be made in a KS1\u00b0\/eryK mutant strain of . The general method for using chemobiosynthesis for making modified 6-dEB is illustrated by Example 6 with specific reference to 13-propyl-6-dEB (13-propyl-13-desethyl-6-dEB). The general method for converting modified 6-dEB compounds to the desired hydroxylated and glycosylated form by using an eryA converter strain is illustrated by Example 7 with specific reference to converting 13-propyl 6-dEB to 13-propyl erythromycin A (13-propyl-13-desethyl-erythromycin A).","Synthetic Methods","The methods described herein are generally applicable to all erythromycins and erythromycin derivatives (e.g., erythromycins A, B, C, and D, 13-substituted erythromycins A, B, C, and D, erythronolide B, 3-\u03b1-mycarosylerythronolide B, and derivatives thereof) unless explicitly limited. As such references to specific embodiments are for the purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit in any way the scope of the present invention.","Enol ether compounds are also referred to as 6,9-enol ether erythromycins or 8,9-anhydro erythromycin 6,9-enol ethers, or dihydrofurans. The 6,9-epoxides are also referred to as epoxides or as tetrahydrofurans. Unless expressly limited these terms may refer to both the lactone (W=O) or lactam (W\u2550NR) compounds.","Enol ether compounds where W\u2550O are formed by treating an erythromycin starting material with mild acid. The corresponding epoxide is formed by reducing the carbon\u2014carbon double bond between C-9 and C-9 of the enol ether. An alternate method for forming epoxide compounds (where W\u2550O) is where the free hydroxyls of erythromycin are protected and the C-9 oxo is reduced to a sodium borohydride to a 9-dihydro-erythromycin intermediate (where C-(is \u2014CHOH\u2014). Illustrative examples of suitable protecting groups include acetyl for the C-2\u2032 and C-4\u2033 hydroxyls and a cyclic carbamate for the C-11 and C-12 hydroxyls. The hydroxyl group at C-9 is subsequently activated and displaced to form the desired epoxide product.","The enol ether and epoxide compounds (where W\u2550O) may optionally be converted into the corresponding lactams (where W\u2550NR). The enol ether or epoxide lactone is treated with potassium carbonate to from a 12-membered derivative which is treated with Martin sulfurane to form the 12-membered 12,13 epoxide. This 12,13 epoxide is reacted with NHR to form the erythromycin lactam.","Derivatives of the enol ether and epoxide lactones and lactams may be made by making the desired modifications. For example 11-oxo compounds are made by oxidizing the C-11 hydroxyl with carbodiimide and methylsulfoxide. C-12 alkoxy compounds are made by alkylating the C-12 hydroxyl group. Illustrative examples of other modifications include the demethylation and subsequent alkylation of the 3\u2032N and the modifications at the C-3\u2033 hydroxyl group. Detailed protocols of these types of modifications are provided in the Examples.","Functional Assays for Screening Orphan Receptors","The methods of the present invention can be used in screening orphan receptors. In this instance, the choice of functional assays used for screening orphan receptors is crucial to success. The assays should be as generic as possible in order to pick up a wide range of coupling mechanisms. Measurements of metabolic activation of cells using the Cytosensor microphysiometer is probably the most generic assay available, but is hampered by its low throughput. Alternative assay systems in mammalian cells focus largely on measuring changes in intracellular cAMP or Ca levels, either directly using standard methods or via the use of reporter gene assays. It is becoming increasingly important to use high throughput assay systems to allow screening of relatively large libraries of compounds and peptides in microtiter plate format; 96-well or 384-well format assays can readily be developed for measurement of cAMP levels.","For fluorescence-based assays such as Ca mobilization, 96-well fluorescent plate readers offer greater throughput over conventional fluorimeters, but, standard plate-readers only allow sequential read-out from individual wells, which limits the rate of data capture when measuring rapid responses such as Ca mobilization. The use of a charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging camera to allow simultaneous 96-well fluorescent readout in real time\u2014the FLIPR system developed by Molecular Devices\u2014can dramatically increase throughput. Since the coupling pathway for a particular receptor is difficult to predict de novo from sequence information, a variety of assay systems should be used when screening orphan receptors.","The Cytosensor Microphysiometer","The principles of microphysiometry as employed by the Cytosensor microphysiometer (Molecular Devices) have been fully described elsewhere, but essentially the approach utilizes the detection of changes in extracellular acidification rates as a generic measurement of cellular metabolic activation when receptors on the cell surface are stimulated.","Briefly, cells are immobilized in close proximity to a light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS) which acts as a highly sensitive pH detector. A low buffer capacity \u201crunning medium\u201d is perfused across the cells, and at regular time intervals the flow of the running medium is temporarily stopped. As a result, the medium surrounding the cells becomes progressively more acidic and this change in pH is detected by the LAPS. The rate of acidification during the slop-flow phase is the measured parameter. Typically, sampling of the extracellular acidification rate in this way occurs once every 1 to 2 min. depending upon the exact configuration of the assay. Most cell types can be maintained in the microphysiometer for several hours, allowing considerable time for data to be accumulated. Extracellular acidification rates are generally expressed as a percentage of basal rates immediately prior to the addition of test drug, and plotted against time (as in FIG. ). An elegant fluidics system enables the operator to control the exposure of cells, to test drugs without flow artifacts.","As shown in , the orphan receptor CRLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells, mediates a specific extracellular acidification response when challenged with 10 nM human CGRP. Each point represents the acidification response from an individual chamber of cells.","Use of Cytosensor Microphysiometer to Screen Orphan Receptors","The following protocol can be utilized to screen orphan receptors:\n\n","2. Count cells, centrifuge for 5 min at 300\u00d7g, then resuspend in running medium to a concentration of 2 to 3\u00d710cells\/100 \u03bcl.","3. Immobilize the suspension of transfected cells in agarose on a cell capsule cup assembly as follows: melt a 200 \u03bcl aliquot of agarose (cell entrapment kit, Molecular Devices, cat no. R8023) in boiling water and then bring to 37\u00b0 C. in a heating block. Mix one volume of agarose with three volumes of cell suspension, in a prewarmed tube, by pipetting the mixture up and down several times, taking care not to introduce air bubbles, and not to allow the mixture to cool below 30\u00b0 C. (below which it will solidify).","4. Transfer the cells into the microphysiometer by placing a blue spacer ring into the capsule cup, carefully spotting 10 \u03bcl of cell\/agarose mixture into the center of the ring (taking care not to allow the mixture to touch the ring otherwise it will wick away from the center of the capsule), and allowing the mixture to solidify (2 to 3 min).","5. Carefully add 1 ml of running medium to the well holding the cup and 0.2 ml to the cup itself. Add an insert, and then 0.2 ml of running medium to the insert. When the insert has sunk to the bottom of the cup, the whole assembly may then be transferred to the cytosensor.","6. Set up the cytosensor microphysiometer as per manufacturer's instructions, with parameters set as follows: total pump cycle time=1 min, 30 s; 1 minute at 50% full speed, then 30 s pump off; \u201cGet rate\u201d from 1 min 8 s to 1 min 28 s. Chamber temperatures are set to 37\u00b0 C. Allow at least 1 h for rates to stabilize before adding test ligands at 30 s into pump cycle.","The orphan G protein-coupled receptor CRLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) was identified as a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor by Aiyar et al. following analysis of HEK 293 cells stably expressing the receptor in both functional (cAMP) and radioligand binding assays. However, other groups were unable to repeat this finding and there has been some speculation that CRLR is not the authentic CGRP receptor. The cytosensor microphysiometer is an alternative assay system that can be used to demonstrate that CRLR will produce a robust, specific response to CGRP when expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells (FIG. ), confirming the findings of Aiyar et al. More recent publications are also consistent with this receptor functioning as a CGRP receptor when expressed under appropriate conditions.","Ca Mobilization","Changes in intracellular calcium levels can be routinely detected using fluorescent calcium indicator dyes such as Fluo-3 and Fluo-4. Cells are incubated with the acetoxymethyl ester form of the dye which permeates the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the dye is converted to its free acid form by cleavage of the ester portion by intracellular esterases. This conversion renders the dye cell-impermeant, thus trapping it inside the cell. Only the free acid form and not the esterified counterpart will fluoresce on binding calcium ions and this property forms the basis of the assay.","Two methods are described for analyzing Ca mobilization responses; the first involves detection via a standard fluorescent plate reader (Fluoskan Ascent, Lab-Systems) and is suitable for cells in suspension; the second involves detection via FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader: Molecular Devices), which has the ability to read all 96 wells of a microtiter plate simultaneously with data readouts every second, and is hence higher throughput. The FLIPR imagine system is configured in a semiconfocal manner, which renders it more suitable for use with adherent cells in monolayer. Sensitivity is also enhanced by eliminating background fluorescence from the fluid layer above the cells.","Ca Mobilization Measurements Using Fluoskan Ascent Fluorescent Plate Reader (Labsystems)","The following protocol can be utilized to measure calcium mobilization:","1. Prepare assay buffer: Hanks balanced salts solution (HBSS) containing 10 mM HEPES, 200 \u03bcM CaCland 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4 at 37\u00b0 C.","2. Reconstitute Fluo-3\/AM (Molecular Probes) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A stock concentration of 1 mM is appropriate.","3. 48 h after transfection lift adherent cells from flask by adding 2 ml versene (Life Technologies). Rock flask gently to ensure versene completely covers monolayer, then incubate flask for 5 to 10 min at 37\u00b0 C.","4. Add 8 ml growth medium to flask (to neutralize ethylene bis (oxyethylenitrilo) tetraacetic acid [EGTA]). Pipette solution up and down several times to prepare a homogeneous cell suspension.","5. Transfer cell suspension to a 50-ml conical tube. Pellet cells by centrifuging at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate growth medium then resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml assay buffer and repeat centrifugation process.","6. Aspirate buffer and resuspend cells in 12 ml fresh assay buffer ensuring that all clumps of cells are well dispersed. Wrap tube in foil to protect contents from light and then add Fluo-3\/AM such that final concentration of dye is 1 \u03bcM. Mix thoroughly. For certain cell types (e.g., CHO), it is necessary to include 2.5 mM probenecid in the loading buffer to prevent leakage of dye from the cells.","7. Incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 min, giving tube a swirl occasionally to prevent cells settling and clumping.","8. Add 36 ml assay buffer, mix well, and incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for a further 25 min. This should ensure complete hydrolysis of the dye.","9. Centrifuge cells as in step 6. Resuspend cell pellet in 20 ml fresh assay buffer.","10. Perform cell count, centrifuge cells as in step 6 then resuspend in assay buffer to a density of 2\u00d710cells\/ml. Cells should be used within 2 h of loading with Fluo-3.","11. Program Fluoskan reader to read a single column of eight wells repeatedly. Repeat reads on each well can he made every 3.4 s and this time frame is sufficient to allow detection of Ca mobilization responses. Set filters to 485 nm excitation and 538 nm emission.","12. Immediately before use, transfer 1.7 ml cell suspension to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube and microfuge briefly to pellet cells. Aspirate buffer and resuspend cell pellet in 1.7 ml fresh assay buffer.","13. Pipette 190 \u03bcl cell suspension into each of the 8 wells in the first column of a 96-well, clear bottom, black-walled plate (Becton Dickinson Labware) and start assay. Take six baseline readings on each well at 3.4 s intervals.","14. Using a multichannel pipette, add test ligands to all eight wells in the column, mixing three or four times, then continue reading plate for 30 readings, again at 3.4 s intervals. Restart readings as quickly as possible following addition of agonist.","15. Repeat steps 13 to 15 for remaining columns on plate. Reader can be set up such that machine will automatically assay column 2 after column 1, etc.","The plate reader will automatically produce a results sheet at the end of the plate run. Fluorescence values are listed for each well at each time point, with plate well reference across the rows (A1, A2, A3, etc.) and time points down the columns, (Note: Fluoroskan automatically inserts empty cells around each value, these cells must be taken into account when designing macros for data analysis.)","Readings are taken every 3.4 s and a 10-s delay is assumed between the sixth and seventh reading per well (i.e., last baseline reading and first reading following agonist addition). Results can be analyzed as follows:","1. Average first six readings to calculate mean baseline value.","2. Determine increase in fluorescence above baseline for each time point following agonist addition and express as a percentage of baseline value.","3. Plot data as change in fluorescence against time.","Ca Mobilization Measurements Using FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader)","The following protocol can be utilized to measure calcium mobilization:","1. 24 h after receptor transfection harvest and plate cells into poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well black-walled\/clear bottom microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson Labware) at 3\u00d710cells per well.","2. After 18 to 24 h aspirate off medium and add 100 \u03bcl of fresh EMEM containing 4 \u03bcM Fluo-3\/AM (Molecular Probes; prepare stock solution at 2 mM in DMSO containing 20% pluronic acid), 0.1% BSA, and 2.5 \u03bcM probenecid to each well and incubate for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C.","3. Aspirate medium and replace with 100 \u03bcl of the same medium, but without Fluo-3\/AM, and incubate for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C. Wash cells three times with a Denley cell washer (Labsystems) with Krebs Ringer Henscleit (KRH; 118 mM NaCl, 4.6 mM KCl, 25 M NaHCO, 1 mM KHPO, 1.1 mM glucose, 1.1 mM MgCl) containing 0.1% BSA, 2.5 \u03bcM probenecid, and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 (buffer A). After the last wash aspirate down to a final volume of 100 \u03bcl.","4. Prepare plates of potential ligands, tissue extracts, or compound libraries in 96-well polypropylene microplates at three times the final concentration in buffer A and warm to 37\u00b0 C.","5. Place microplates containing Fluo-3 loaded cells and the ligand plates in FLIPR and monitor. At initiation of the fluorescence recording read measurements every 1 s for 60 s and then every 3 s for the following 60 s. Add agonist (50 \u03bcl) to the cell plate at 10 s and use the maximum fluorescent counts above background after addition of agonist to define maximal activity for that ligand. FLIPR software normalizes fluorescent readings to give equivalent readings for all wells at zero time.","Use of Promiscuous G Proteins with Orphan Receptors","More recently, it has become possible to funnel heterologous signal transduction of GPCRs through a common pathway involving phospholipase C and Ca mobilization by co-expression of the receptor with the promiscuous G proteins G\u03b1or by co-expression with chimeric G proteins based on Gq. For example, the C3a receptor originally described as an orphan receptor, produces weak or no Ca  mobilization responses to C3a when expressed in HEK 293 cells. However, when co-expressed with G\u03b1, robust responses are seen (FIGS.  and ). Although this cotransfection approach may not be universally successful, it can be a useful technique to promote functional coupling of orphan receptors and to streamline their screening by focusing predominantly on one signal transduction system.","Determination of cAMP Levels via Use of FlashPlate TechnologycAMP Determination Using FlashPlates","The following protocol can be utilized to determine cAMP levels:\n\n","2. Add 10 \u03bcl IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; final concentration 0.5 mM) and incubate cells for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C.","3. Add 10 \u03bcl putative ligand immediately followed by 10 \u03bcl growth medium (for determination of cAMP stimulatory responses) or 10 \u03bcl forskolin (for determination of cAMP inhibitory responses) at 30 \u03bcM final concentration. Incubate for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C.","4. Terminate reaction with the addition of 10 \u03bcl ice cold 5% perchloric acid (PCA).","5. Leave for 1 h at 4\u00b0 C. to allow equilibrium to be reached before neutralizing samples with 100 \u03bcl 75 mM KOH in 50 mM sodium acetate.","6. Incubate at 4\u00b0 C. for at least 1.5 h to ensure neutralization is complete and allow sedimentation of the precipitate before transferring samples into cAMP [I] FlashPlates (NEN Life Sciences; Catalogue no. SMP001), taking care not to disturb the sediment.","7. Typically for HEK 293 Cells, transfer 10 to 40 \u03bcl of neutralized sample to FlashPlates for assay. Reconstitute kit reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions and make sample volume up to 100 \u03bcl in FlashPlates with assay buffer.","8. Add 100 \u03bcl [I] cAMP working tracer, seal plate, and incubate overnight at 4\u00b0 C. prior to counting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00139","num":"00139"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sup":"2+","sub":["16","15"],"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00140","num":"00140"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"sub":"16 ","sup":"2+"},"The assay can be used not only to screen for ligands that activate Gs- or Gi-coupled orphan receptors, but also to look for receptors that might be constitutively active. For example, elevated basal cAMP levels can be detected in HEK 293 cells expressing the orphan receptor GPR3, consistent with the constitutive activity reported for this receptor. Such receptors are amenable to screening for compounds with inverse agonist activity which reduce the elevated basal levels of activity, which can then be used as tools to explore the biology of the receptor in vivo.","A \u201chomogeneous\u201d version of the flashplate assay (SMP004) has been developed by NEN Life Sciences. In this format the cells and test substance are added directly to the flashplate, the incubation terminated by a single addition (which includes the radiolabel) and the plate then counted 2 to 24 h later at room temperature. The reduced number of pipetting steps results in a higher throughput. However, a caveat when screening tissue extracts concerns the lack of an acid precipitation step to remove excess proteinaceous material which may thus interfere with the assay.","In summary, the present invention provides methods for evaluating drug candidates whose mechanism of action is as a GPCR receptor agonist. By using the efficacy index to evaluate compounds, the risks of failure from lack of clinical or therapeutic efficacy are minimized. The methods of the present invention have been applied to motilides where both novel compounds and those currently being studied in clinical trials are evaluated.","The present invention is further described by the following examples. The examples are provided solely to illustrate the invention by reference to specific embodiments. These exemplifications, while illustrating certain specific aspects of the invention, do not portray the limitations or circumscribe the scope of the disclosed invention.","Co-Expression of a GPCR and Aequorin in a Cell Line and Potency Measurement","A gene encoding the target receptor is cloned and placed into a mammalian expression vector such as pcDNA3.1. The gene may be synthetic or naturally derived. Next, pmtAEQ, an aequorin expression plasmid available from Molecular Probes, and the receptor expression construct are transfected into HEK293 cells using a commercially available transfection kit such as Lipofectamine Plus (Gibco BRL). At this point, a stable cell line may be selected from the transfection mix using common techniques, or the heterologous mixture obtained from transient transfection may be used directly. Cells expressing aequorin and the target receptor are then harvested and soaked in a solution of phosphate buffer saline containing 0.1 g\/L CaCl, 0.1 g\/L MgCl, 36 mg\/L pyruvate, and 1 g\/L glucose (in phosphate buffer solution (\u201cPBS\u201d)) with 2.5 \u03bcM coelenterazine f and 300 uM reduced glutathione for 0.5-4 hours. The cells are washed and diluted to 500,000 cells\/mL in PBS. One hundred microliters of varying concentrations of a test agonist are placed in the wells of a 96-well white plastic assay plate. A 100 uL aliquot of cells is added to each well, and following each addition, the integrated luminescence is measured for 30-60 seconds and is taken as the agonist response. Next, 100 uL of 1% triton X-100 in PBS is injected into each well, and the integrated luminescence is measured a second time over 30-60 seconds and is taken as the triton response. A value F is calculated as equaled to the agonist response divided by the sum of the agonist response and the triton response. F is plotted versus the agonist concentration, and the data is fit to a rectangular square hyperbola to obtain the ECvalue for the compound.","Desensitization Measurement in a Cell Line Coexpressing GPCR and Aequorin","Cells expressing a target receptor and aequorin are grown, harvested and counted.

The reaction is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for a set amount of time (initially varied to determine the time dependence of desensitization). The reaction is diluted, cells are separated from the test compound by centrifugation, resuspended (in PBS containing 0.1 g\/L CaCl, 0.1 g\/L MgCl, 36 mg\/L pyruvate, and 1 g\/L glucose) and recentrifuged to wash away any remaining test compound. To reconstitute the aequorin cofactor, the cells are then resuspended in 5 mL of PBS containing 2.5 uM coelenterazine f and 300 uM reduced glutathione, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30-45 minutes. The cells are centrifuged once more, then resuspended in 800 uL of PBS for assay.","100 \u03bcL of cells are placed in the well of a 96-well white assay plate, and an amount of an agonist known to saturate the receptor is added. Each aliquot of cells, pretreated with a different concentration of test compound, is challenged with the agonist and the integrated luminescence is measured over 30-60 seconds (\u201cagonist response\u201d). Next, 100 uL of 1% triton X-100 in PBS is injected into the well and the integrated luminescence is measured over 30-60 seconds (\u201ctriton response\u201d). The fractional activation of the receptor is then expressed as F=agonist response\/(agonist response+triton response). F is then plotted as a function of the test compound, and the resulting curve is fit to a rectangular square hyperbola to obtain an ICvalue for desensitization of the receptor by the test compound.","Expression of the Motilin Receptor and Aequorin","A synthetic gene encoding the motilin receptor was designed using common methods based upon the sequence of the naturally occurring human motilin gene. An error in the synthesis was corrected to give Kos127-42-61, a pUC derived vector containing a synthetic gene encoding the motilin receptor. The HindIII\/EcoRI fragment of pkos127-42-61, containing a fully sequenced synthetic gene encoding the human motilin receptor and an upstream Kozak sequence was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector. The resulting plasmid construct (pkos127-159) was verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing.","HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were grown to \u02dc95% confluence in T175 flasks at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere containing 5% CO. Each T175 flask was transfected with a total of 11.5 ug of DNA using the Lipofectamine Plus reagents and the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. For transient transfections, the ratio of pkos127-159 (\u201cmotilin receptor DNA\u201d) to pmtAEQ (\u201caequorin DNA\u201d) was 10:1, while transfections performed to generate stable cell lines used a receptor DNA:aequorin DNA ratio of 1:10. Transiently transfected cells were harvested 18-22 hours post transfection by removing the medium and treating the layer of cells with 5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0 C.

The medium was changed 7 days post transfection, and by 10 days following transfection, \u02dc80% of the transfected cells had died, and no viable cells were visible in the flask containing the non-transfected control. Two weeks after transfection, single, well separated colonies were visible and could be circled with a marker pen. Medium was aspirated, replaced with a thin layer of PBS, and clones were isolated by scraping the area of the circled colony with a pipette tip while simultaneously drawing PBS (and cells) into the pipette tip. Clones were dispensed into 24 or 6-well tissue culture clusters in MEMalpha containing 800 ug\/mL G418.
