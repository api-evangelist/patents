title: Systems and methods for capturing employee time for time and attendance management
abstract: Systems and techniques to capture employee time for time and attendance management are disclosed. In general, in one implementation, a technique includes using a multi-touch tablet style device as a Cloud Clock for capturing employee time. Employees will punch in and out at the device by standing in front of the Cloud Clock with a personal ID card. The Cloud Clock device will use its front-facing video camera to identify the employee and log the time in a web-based application that tracks employee work hours. Such a Cloud Clock can also be used as a self-service station where employees can access their schedules, request time-off, and trade shifts. Such Cloud Clocks can be loaded with management software that allows the clocks to be remotely monitored for anomalies. The Cloud Clocks can also be updated remotely without requiring user intervention at the clock.

No. 61\/553,884, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Capturing Employee Time for Time & Attendance Management\u201d, filed on Oct. 31, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This document relates to techniques and methods to capture employee work time as part of a time and attendance management solution.","Businesses can track the amount of time their employees spend at work using specially-designed time clocks. Time clocks allow employees to enter the time they begin working and again enter the time when the employee ends working. Time clocks generally range from mechanical clocks that require an employee has to insert and punch a paper card to electronic time clocks that allow employees to swipe magnetic identification cards to register times. Time clocks can be standalone hardware devices that are installed on a business's premises. Time clocks typically interact with an electronic system that stores time entries that are submitted to the time clock. Such time clocks can require regular maintenance from qualified personnel.","Systems and methods relating to capturing employee data for time and attendance management are described. In general, in one implementation, a technique for capturing employee time and attendance includes using a multi-touch tablet device as a time clock (hereinafter \u201cCloud Clock\u201d). Employees can interact with the multi-touch table device to punch in, e.g., record a time they begin working, and to punch out, e.g., record a time they stop working. In some implementations, employees can punch in and punch out using the multi-touch tablet device by standing in front of the Cloud Clock with a personal identification (\u201cID\u201d) card. The Cloud Clock device can use a front-facing video camera to identify employees and log their respective time records each time the employees punch in and punch out. In some implementations, the Cloud Clock logs the times in a web-based application that tracks employee work hours. In some implementations, the Cloud Clock can be used as a self-service station at which employees can access their schedules, request time-off, or revise their schedules (e.g., trade shifts with other employees). The Cloud Clocks can be loaded with management software that allows the Cloud Clocks to be remotely monitored for anomalies. The Cloud Clocks can also be updated remotely without requiring user intervention at the Cloud Clock.","The Cloud Clock can include a capacitive touch panel for multi-touch user interaction, a front-facing video camera to capture digital images of employees and identification cards, WiFi connectivity to an application cloud, a Global Positioning System (GPS) for geo-fencing, an accelerometer for detecting unauthorized motion, a configurable software platform on the device for easy customization, an over-the-air remote management functionality, and an on-board battery to handle power outages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102","104"],"i":["a","c","a","c "]},"Time entries can be synchronized between Cloud Clocks and application servers  in real time over a network. In some implementations, the data can be sent over authenticated and encrypted channels to the application servers. The Cloud Clocks -can be sold along with a wireless access point that is pre-configured to work with the Cloud Clocks -. This enables customers to quickly setup the Cloud Clocks -and establish connectivity with the application servers .","In some implementations, the Cloud Clock can be remotely monitored by a service in the cloud for faults including power outages and network outages. Any loss of power or network connectivity to the Cloud Clock can be automatically detected by the server. Upon detection, the appropriate personnel (e.g., local administrators) can be notified (e.g., notified through email or text messages).","In some implementations, the Cloud Clock can run a monitor client program in the background that continuously measures the wireless network strength, the remaining power in the battery and the charging status. The monitor client program can send periodically (in response to a trigger event or request) heartbeats to a monitoring service. Each heartbeat can include measurements of the network, power, and charging state. The monitoring service can check the incoming heart beats of each clock against thresholds to determine if a Cloud Clock is losing power or has poor network connectivity.","In some implementations, the Cloud Clock can be remotely monitored by a service for theft or unauthorized movement from an installed location. An accelerometer (or other motion sensor) and\/or on-board GPS can be used to detect unauthorized movement of the Cloud Clock and local administrators will be notified. The Cloud Clock can be loaded with management software that allows the clocks to be remotely monitored for anomalies. The Cloud Clock can also be updated remotely without requiring user intervention at the Cloud Clock.","For example, when a clock is accidentally or intentionally pulled or displaced from its mounting, the on board accelerometer will detect the motion and send an alert to a monitoring service in the cloud. Managers can track these alerts and suitable action can be taken to restore the Cloud Clock to its original setting. In some cases, the on board GPS receiver can be utilized to track the movement of the Cloud Clock from the point of its original setting. For example, the GPS receiver can be used to track a person who is carrying the Cloud Clock away from its mounting location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102","102","102","200","202","210","202","204","206","208","210"],"i":["a","b","c"]},"The Cloud Clock  can be mounted on a powered pedestal or setup on a desktop or mounted securely on a wall. The Cloud Clock  can be connected at all times wirelessly to application servers over a network (e.g., Internet) in a secure way (e.g., using Secure Sockets Layer). A customer who purchases the Cloud Clock  will be able to install and deploy the Cloud Clock  in a few simple steps.","In some implementations, the Cloud Clock is capable of restricting its operation within a geo-fence. A geo-fence can be a specified geographic boundary outside of which employees are not allowed to register time. The Cloud Clock can be configured to operate within a specified geo-fence. The Cloud Clock includes an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) that can be used to detect whether the Cloud Clock is or is not within the geo-fence for authorized operation.","In some implementations, the Cloud Clock can be used as a mobile check-in and check-out station that allows employees to punch in and punch out in cases where an employer requires its employees to punch in and out at an offsite location. For example, road crews who need to meet at a job site can punch in at the Cloud Clock that is configured to operate within a geo-fence encompassing the job site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["312","300","300","302","310","202","304","306","308","310"]},"In , an employee  is shown as \u201cpunching in,\u201d or registering their time by presenting themselves in front of the camera  and by flashing an identification (\u201cID\u201d) card  to the Cloud Clock .

Software running on the Cloud Clock  can be configured to log in the employee  by capturing a live video frame of the employee  and the ID card  using a front facing camera  of the Cloud Clock  and then processing the captured frame. The software and\/or hardware in the Cloud Clock  can use a combination of image processing techniques and face recognition techniques to process the captured frame.

In , the display region  depicts a captured live video frame of an ID card . In some implementations, the display region  can display an authenticated icon  indicating that the ID card  has been authenticated.","In some implementations, the image processing techniques include a bar code recognition process used to recognize one or two-dimensional bar codes (e.g., QR code) printed on the ID card  and captured in the video frame . As described in , the employee can flash an ID card  in front of the camera . The camera  can capture a video frame of the face of the employee flashing the ID card . The image processing can be applied to at least a portion of the captured video frame that contains identifying information (e.g., a code). One or more image processing operations can be performed to the captured video frame including, but not limited to, image binarization, image tilt correction, image orientation, image geometric correction, and image normalization. This image processing allows images to be collected under different illumination conditions, different acquisition angles, and allows employees to be quickly identified based on the ID codes printed on the ID cards.","The Cloud Clock  is capable of capturing and storing an image of the employee that is registering their time. The captured image can be used for biometric employee authentication using various face recognition techniques. In some implementations, face recognition processing can use one or more of the following face recognition\/verification processes: Principal Component Analysis using eigenfaces, Linear Discriminate Analysis, Elastic Bunch Graph Matching using the Fisherface algorithm, the Hidden Markov model and neuronal motivated dynamic link matching. In some implementations, face recognition\/verification techniques (e.g., supervised learning, Viola-Johns face detection) can be used in a manner that adheres to the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) benchmark.
