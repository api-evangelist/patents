{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to data management systems and methods, and in particular to a pipe fusion data management system and method for use in connection with a system and arrangement for fusing two or more sections of pipe or conduit for use in a variety of applications.","Description of the Related Art","Conduit systems are used in many applications throughout the world in order to transfer or convey material, such as water and other fluids, from location to location for distribution throughout the system. For example, extensive conduit systems are used to distribute water to both residences and businesses for use and further processes. Typically, such conduit or piping systems are located underground, as aboveground piping is both unsightly and intrusive. Furthermore, conduit systems and arrangements can be used in non-fluid applications, such as for providing protected conduit systems through which wire, cable, and the like can be positioned.","In general, water conduit systems transport material through piping manufactured from various materials, e.g., cast iron, ductile iron, reinforced concrete, cement-asbestos, etc. The pipes are buried underground, with the branches extending in various directions in order to reach the end user. Normally, after many years of use, or for some other reason, the in-ground piping fails and begins to leak, thereby reducing line pressure and unnecessarily allowing water to leak into the area surrounding the piping. Such leaks not only affect the system, but also increase the processing costs of the supplier, which, in turn, increases the end user costs. Therefore, these leaks must be quickly repaired and preventative measures taken to ensure that further leakage is prevented. In order to address such issues and provide an effective solution to these leaking pipe systems, a pipe liner and method of installation have been developed, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,662, which is incorporated herein by reference, and which is primarily directed to pressurized pipeline applications. The '662 patent relates to the expansion of a pipe within a host pipe that requires repair.","While the '662 patent represents an advance in the art of relining or repairing underground conduit systems, there is room in the art for additional improvements and advancements. For example, in order to transport and insert the liner conduit within the host conduit, the liner conduit must be manufactured in sections or portions, which are typically much shorter in length than the final and intended liner conduit length. Therefore, portions of the liner conduit must be connected onsite as the liner conduit is fed into the host conduit. In addition, there is a need for the ability to connect multiple lengths of the liner conduit via a joint having substantially the same strength or pressure capability as that of the original conduit, and which does not increase the diameter of the joint area beyond the original conduit diameter.","Still further, the use of multiple and connectable pipe or conduit pieces is useful in many different applications beyond the above-discussed expansion application. For example, the use of such fused pipe is particularly useful in the case of slip-lining, wherein a slightly smaller diameter fused conduit is inserted into a larger pipe that is in need of rehabilitation, but that does not require a full capacity for flow. In this case, the conduit is pulled in and left in place, but is not expanded. In most cases, the space between the conduit and the host pipe is filled with a low-strength grout to hold the new line in position","Fused conduit is also required in various other applications, such as in a rehabilitation application, or in a horizontal directional drilling process. This method drills a pilot hole in the ground in a precise manner to control elevation and alignment. After the pilot hole is complete, the drill hole is reamed to a larger diameter and filled with drill mud to hold the larger hole open. The drill casing is then pulled through the drill mud resulting in a conduit in place. Further, fused conduit is useful in a pipe bursting application. Pipe bursting uses a large hydraulic or pneumatic cutter head to break apart old pipe and force the pieces into the surrounding soil. This allows a new pipe of equal or larger diameter in the existing line to be pulled in. This process is used where the replacement line capacity must be maintained or increased. Also, of course, fused pipe is equally useful in a direct-bury application, or in conduit systems used to convey wire, cable, and the like.","Fusion processes for pipe or conduit have been developed that utilize mechanical joints, embedded wires at or near the fusion joint or resistive heating elements for joining conduit sections together. Accordingly, preexisting fusion equipment is available. However, this equipment must be modified in its use and operating parameters for fusion of polyvinyl chloride-based conduit. While pipe made from PVC is widely used in connection with potable water and wastewater systems, these piping systems are created by joining sections of PVC pipe by bell-and-spigot gasket arrangements or solvent-cement joints. There exist certain ASTM International (ASTM) Standard Specifications and American Water Works Association (AWWA) specifications that address such products\/systems.","Unlike PE pipe, which is generally joined by heat fusion techniques, PVC pipe has normally been limited to applications that can be serviced by bell-and-spigot joints. This limitation has restricted the use of PVC pipe in various rehabilitation and new-build applications. In order to address these and other issues, a fusion process for conduit has been developed, as shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,982,051 and Publication No. 2006\/0071365 (application Ser. No. 11\/244,123), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","At zero expansion, the Hydrostatic Design Basis (HDB) of the PVC conduit is known to be about 4,000 psi. At two times expansion, the HDB of the PVC conduit is about 7,100 psi. However, definitively determining the HDB of expanded PVC conduit at any value between these values may be useful, and indeed, in some instances, required. Further, as a result of field conditions, the variance in wall thickness of the PVC starting stock, when expanded, reduces the data confidence level to less than the required 85% when conventional technology is used. Accordingly, and in order to address the need for a methodology that yields results within the required confidence level and provide data between known points, methods and systems have been developed to effectively determine the Hydrostatic Design Basis (HDB) of expanded oriented pipe other than at specific predetermined uniform expansion. Such methods and systems are shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,269,520, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Based upon the above discussion, it is clear that fusion of pipe (whether made from PVC or PE) is a data-centric process. As most piping systems are large and complex, when using fusion to join sections of pipe, a large number of fused joints are created. Therefore, there is a need to obtain, store, process, and analyze some or all of the data associated with the fusion process in a centralized system. For example, the fusion process should be controlled and managed at all stages to help ensure effective and safe preparation, fusion, and installation. Still further, multiple fusion processes may be occurring in multiple projects and locations during the same time period. Such a large number of fusion and installation processes leads to a large data set, which, if properly collected and analyzed, allows for effective and accurate control.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for a pipe fusion data management system that collects, stores, processes, and\/or analyzes the multiple and remote fusion and installation processes occurring in various, discrete locations.","Generally, the present invention provides a pipe fusion data management system that enables users to overcome or address some or all of the deficiencies and drawbacks existing in the collection, transmission, and analysis of data from known fusion applications and processes. Preferably, the present invention provides a pipe fusion data management system that facilitates the collection, storage, processing, and\/or analysis of many different data points, streams, and information pertaining to the fusion and\/or installation of pipe, whether in a reparation, construction, or new installation application. Preferably, the present invention provides a pipe fusion data management system that leads to the effective management and control of multiple and remote fusion processes occurring in the various locations.","Therefore, in one preferred and non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, provided is a pipe fusion data management system. The system includes a data receiving interface configured to receive data directly or indirectly from at least one remote source, the data including at least one data field representing at least one of the following: fusion data, pipe data, parameter data, operation data, configuration data, condition data, measurement data, entity data, user data, or any combination thereof; an input device configured to facilitate user input of data; a storage device in direct or indirect communication with at least one of the data receiving interface and the input device and configured to store at least one of the following: at least a portion of the data received at the data receiving interface, at least a portion of the data input by a user, processed data, or any combination thereof; and a processor in direct or indirect communication with at least one of the data receiving interface, the input device, and the storage device, the processor configured to generate a visual user interface configured to display at least one of the following: at least a portion of the data received at the data receiving interface, at least a portion of the data input by the user; at least a portion of the data stored on the storage device, processed data, or any combination thereof.","In another preferred and non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, provided is a computer-implemented method for pipe fusion data management.

The at least one remote source comprises at least one pipe fusion arrangement including at least one fusion apparatus configured to fuse a plurality of pipe sections together, thereby creating at least one fusion joint.","In a further preferred and non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, provided is a pipe fusion data management system, including: means for receiving data directly or indirectly from at least one remote source, the data including at least one data field representing at least one of the following: fusion data, pipe data, parameter data, operation data, configuration data, condition data, measurement data, entity data, user data, or any combination thereof; and means for generating a visual user interface configured to display at least one of the following: at least a portion of the data received from the at least one remote source, at least a portion of data input by a user, at least a portion of data stored on a storage device, processed data, or any combination thereof, the user interface comprising at least one of the following: a central interface, an activity interface, a customer interface, a project interface, a report interface, a pipe management interface, an administration interface, or any combination thereof.

It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the invention.","The present invention may be implemented on a variety of computing devices and systems, wherein these computing devices include the appropriate processing mechanisms and computer-readable media for storing and executing computer-readable instructions, such as programming instructions, code, and the like. As illustrated in  and according to the prior art, a schematic and block diagram of exemplary computing devices, in the form of personal computers , , in a computing system environment  are provided. This computing system environment  may include, but is not limited to, at least one computer  having certain components for appropriate operation, execution of code, and creation and communication of data. For example, the computer  includes a processing unit  (typically referred to as a central processing unit or CPU) that serves to execute computer-based instructions received in the appropriate data form and format. Further, this processing unit  may be in the form of multiple processors executing code in series, in parallel, or in any other manner for appropriate implementation of the computer-based instructions.","In order to facilitate appropriate data communication and processing information between the various components of the computer , a system bus  is utilized. The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, or a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. In particular, the system bus  facilitates data and information communication between the various components (whether internal or external to the computer ) through a variety of interfaces, as discussed hereinafter.","The computer  may include a variety of discrete computer-readable media components.

Of course, combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The computer  further includes a system memory  with computer storage media in the form of volatile and non-volatile memory, such as ROM and RAM. A basic input\/output system (BIOS) with appropriate computer-based routines assists in transferring information between components within the computer  and is normally stored in ROM. The RAM portion of the system memory  typically contains data and program modules that are immediately accessible to or presently being operated on by processing unit , e.g., an operating system, application programming interfaces, application programs, program modules, program data, and other instruction-based computer-readable code.","The computer  may also include other removable or non-removable, volatile or non-volatile computer storage media products. For example, the computer  may include a non-removable memory interface  that communicates with and controls a hard disk drive , i.e., a non-removable, non-volatile magnetic medium; and a removable, non-volatile memory interface  that communicates with and controls a magnetic disk drive unit  (which reads from and writes to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk ), an optical disk drive unit  (which reads from and writes to a removable, non-volatile optical disk, such as a CD ROM ), a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port for use in connection with a removable memory card , etc. However, it is envisioned that other removable or non-removable, volatile or non-volatile computer storage media can be used in the exemplary computing system environment , including, but not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, DVDs, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, etc. These various removable or non-removable, volatile or non-volatile magnetic media are in communication with the processing unit  and other components of the computer  via the system bus . The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in  provide storage of operating systems, computer-readable instructions, application programs, data structures, program modules, program data, and other instruction-based computer-readable code for the computer  (whether duplicative or not of the information and data in the system memory ).","A user may enter commands, information, and data into the computer  through certain attachable or operable input devices, such as a keyboard , a mouse , etc., via a user input interface . Of course, a variety of such input devices may be utilized, e.g., a microphone, a trackball, a joystick, a touchpad, a touch-screen, a scanner, etc., including any arrangement that facilitates the input of data and information to the computer  from an outside source. As discussed, these and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through the user input interface  coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a USB. Still further, data and information can be presented or provided to a user in an intelligible form or format through certain output devices, such as a monitor  (to visually display this information and data in electronic form), a printer  (to physically display this information and data in print form), a speaker  (to audibly present this information and data in audible form), etc. All of these devices are in communication with the computer  through an output interface  coupled to the system bus , It is envisioned that any such peripheral output devices be used to provide information and data to the user.","The computer  may operate in a network environment  through the use of a communications device , which is integral to the computer or remote therefrom. This communications device  is operable by and in communication with the other components of the computer  through a communications interface . Using such an arrangement, the computer  may connect with or otherwise communicate with one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer , which may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network personal computer, a peer device, or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the components described above in connection with the computer . Using appropriate communications devices , e.g., a modem, a network interface, or adapter, etc., the computer  may operate within and communicate through a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN), but may also include other networks such as a virtual private network (VPN), an office network, an enterprise network, an intranet, the Internet, etc. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers ,  may be used.","As used herein, the computer  includes or is operable to execute appropriate custom-designed or conventional software to perform and implement the processing steps of the method and system of the present invention, thereby forming a specialized and particular computing system. Accordingly, the presently-invented method and system may include one or more computers  or similar computing devices having a computer-readable storage medium capable of storing computer-readable program code or instructions that cause the processing unit  to execute, configure, or otherwise implement the methods, processes, and transformational data manipulations discussed hereinafter in connection with the present invention. Still further, the computer  may be in the form of a personal computer, a personal digital assistant, a portable computer, a laptop, a palmtop, a mobile device, a mobile telephone, a server, or any other type of computing device having the necessary processing hardware to appropriately process data to effectively implement the presently-invented computer-implemented method and system.","The present invention is directed to a pipe fusion data management system  for use in connection with a pipe fusion arrangement PFA, which typically includes at least one fusion apparatus FA configured or operable to fuse or join two or more pipe sections together, thereby creating at least one fusion joint. This fusion apparatus FA may be utilized and operated by a trained technician T. Further, and normally, the fusion process, such as the fusion process shown and described in the above-referenced '051 patent and\/or '365 publication, occurs at the job site in various, discrete locations (or even various positions or areas at a single, large worksite). In particular, one or more job sites may employ one or multiple fusion apparatuses FA to join pipe sections for use in any of a variety of applications, such as the applications discussed above. In addition, these applications are normally customer-specific, and regardless of how many job sites, project-specific as well. Therefore, when there are multiple projects occurring at these various and remote locations, the pipe fusion arrangement PFA or fusion apparatus FA at each location (or position at the location) is generating a large amount of useful data. It is this data or data source that represents one of the primary focuses of the pipe fusion data management system  of the present invention.","It should be noted that the presently-invented pipe fusion data management system  is not limited to the fusion (or joining) of any particular type, size, or configuration of pipe. Although, in one preferred and non-limiting embodiment, the pipe fusion process is referring to the fusion of polyvinyl chloride pipe sections, the system  is also useful in connection with the fusion and\/or joining of other types and sizes of pipes, such as high density polyethylene pipe, polyethylene pipe, polyolefin pipe, thermoplastic pipe, synthetic pipe, metal pipe, or the like. Further, the system  of the present invention can be effectively used to manage other fusion or joining processes, such as welding, mechanical joints and arrangements, adhesion, and the like.","Further to the data that is generated and\/or collected at the job site or remote location, additional data can be associated therewith, whether on a customer-specific or project-specific basis. Accordingly, the system  allows for the appropriate generation, identification, collection, storage, and\/or analysis of multiple data streams for use in project management, exception identification and reporting, immediate process improvement, as well as long-term process improvement. Therefore, and in one preferred and non-limiting embodiment, the system  represents a central repository and analysis system that can be utilized to effectively track, control, manage, and improve both the individual and collective pipe fusion processes.","In addition, the system  can be implemented and operated on one or more computers ,  and\/or in a computing system environment . Accordingly, the data can be derived or generated (as well as communicated) from any component of the pipe fusion arrangement PFA or fusion apparatus FA in a direct or indirect manner. For example, the fusion apparatus FA may have the appropriate computer  or similar computing device capable of receiving and\/or transmitting data, or alternatively, the technician T may use an onsite computer  to transmit or send this data, normally in a wireless format. However, as discussed hereinafter, any of the components, functions, or features of the presently-invented system  can be implemented on one or more computers  or computing devices capable of effectively implementing such functions. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to any specific computer  or computing system environment , such that some or all of the steps, processes, and functions may also be implemented in the network environment  (i.e., the \u201ccloud\u201d or software-as-a-service (SaaS) environment).","One preferred and non-limiting embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in . In particular, the system  includes a data receiving interface  that is configured, adapted, or programmed to directly or indirectly receive data from at least one remote source, such as the pipe fusion arrangement PFA, fusion apparatus FA, and\/or technician T. Further, this received data includes fusion data, pipe data, parameter data, operation data, configuration data, condition data, measurement data, entity data, and\/or user data. The system  further includes one or more input devices  configured, adapted, or programmed to facilitate the user U input of data. This input device  may also be in the form of a computer  or computing system environment , and may permit the user U to input data in a direct or indirect (wireless) manner. In this embodiment, normally the user U will have certain privileges that are established for use of the various features and functions of the system  discussed hereinafter.","The system  includes one or more storage devices  that are in direct or indirect communication with the data receiving interface  and the input device , and such storage devices  are configured, adapted, or programmed to store at least a portion of the data received from the data receiving interface , at least a portion of the data input by the user U, and\/or processed data. Further, the system  includes a processor  that is in direct or indirect communication with the data receiving interface , the input device , and the storage device . The processor , normally in the form of some computing device, computer, server, or the like, is configured, adapted, or programmed to generate a visual user interface  for displaying at least a portion of the data received at the data receiving interface , at least a portion of the data input by the user U, at least a portion of the data stored in the storage device , and\/or processed data. As discussed above, the system  may provide for the generation and\/or receipt of data from one or more remote sources, such as the pipe fusion arrangement PFA, the fusion apparatus FA, the technician T, the input device , and\/or the user U.","Various screenshots of one preferred and non-limiting embodiment of the system  of the present invention are set forth in , with exemplary reports configured and created by the system  in . However, it should be noted that the layout, format, and other visual features of this exemplary embodiment could be modified or otherwise configured without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the layouts, selectable portions, drop-down menus, radio buttons, and other functional and navigational features could be reconfigured or otherwise modified for use in connection with a variety of computers and interfaces. Further, such features may be user-configurable, such that the visual user interface  can be adapted or modified to meet the individual requirements of the user U.","As provided in , the user interface  includes an initial or central interface , and the central interface  includes multiple selectable elements  (e.g., buttons, activatable portions, etc.) for navigating to specific portions of the system  (as discussed hereinafter). As stated above, this central interface  may be formatted or laid out in any desirable manner, and in one preferred and non-limiting embodiment, the central interface  includes multiple and discrete selectable elements  for navigating to an activity interface , a customer interface , a project interface , a report interface , a pipe management interface , and an administration interface .","As discussed hereinafter, each of these various interfaces , , , , ,  represent certain functional portions or sub-systems for facilitating or implementing the overall functionality of the system . Therefore, the central interface  is in the form of an interactive interface for presenting the user U with multiple options for viewing, arranging, providing, configuring, and\/or outputting at least a portion of the data received at the data receiving interface , at least a portion of the data input by the user U, at least a portion of the data stored on the storage , and\/or data processed by the system .","As shown in , and in one preferred and non-limiting embodiment, the activity interface  is an interactive interface for viewing, arranging, providing, configuring, and\/or outputting activity data . In this embodiment, the activity data  includes item data, description data, update data, and\/or fusion data. The item data is directed to the type of item or entry, such as \u201cfusion\u201d or the like. The description data includes specified fusion data, such as the fusion joint number, project information relating to the fusion joint, the size of the pipe being fused, and the identification of the person submitting the fusion joint for approval. The update data includes when the item, such as the specific fusion joint, was submitted for approval.","In this manner, the user U (or the person who would approve the fusion joint) is able to receive an itemized report on all the fusion joints submitted. Further, by activating a button  at the top of a column, the underlying activity data  can be reordered based upon the nature of the button , such as in alphabetical order, in time order, in type order, in category order, or the like. In addition, the activity interface  accepts a user selection of one or more of the items, typically a row of activity data , and generates a detailed fusion joint report , as illustrated in one preferred and non-limiting embodiment in .","With reference to , the fusion joint report  is also an interactive interface for viewing, arranging, providing, and\/or outputting data for review by the user U and approval of the specific fusion joint. Accordingly, this interactive interface may include and present fusion data , pipe data , equipment data , condition data , instruction data , and\/or status data . Further, the fusion joint report  allows the user U to review, analyze, and\/or modify the information and data presented thereon, such as through direct editing, selectable elements , drop-down menus, radio buttons, or the like. After performing this review, the user U may \u201capprove\u201d or \u201creject\u201d the fusion joint using the buttons  at the bottom of the fusion joint report . In addition, displayed next to these buttons  is status data  indicating the status of that particular fusion joint.","As shown in , the fusion data  includes the fusion date, the project number, the pull number, the project name, jobsite information, and the fusion technician. While the data in the fusion joint report  is initially populated and transmitted by the pipe fusion arrangement PFA, fusion apparatus FA, and\/or technician T, the user U (such as a user U with administrative rights) can review, modify, accept, or reject some or all of the information on the fusion joint report .","As further illustrated in , the pipe data  includes the joint number, and the type of pipe being fused or joined. The equipment data  includes the identification of the fusion machine, the type of heat plate used, the type and serial number of the data logger used, the type and serial number of the pyrometer used, and other equipment information. It should be noted that by tracking this type of detail and information with respect to each fusion joint, the system  facilitates further analysis and accurate determination of any failure points or other required maintenance issues. For example, if a specific heat plate or fusion machine is resulting in certain variations over multiple fusion joints, this machine or heat plate can be identified and targeted for maintenance and\/or other corrective actions. Accordingly, the system  of the present invention allows for the accurate analysis and determination across all aspects of the fusion or joining process.","The condition data  includes pressure information, including drag pressure, heat pressure, and fusion pressure, as well as the ambient conditions and time information, such as ambient outside temperature, ambient pipe temperature, starting time, ending time, pipe temperature at the end of the process, heating time, maximum facing pressure, and the type of weather during the fusing operation. Further, the fusion joint report  includes a visual representation of the heat plate, including the heating plate temperature and extrusion information recorded from the specific pipe being fused or joined. When using a dual-sided heat plate, this visual indication includes the left face temperature and the right face temperature, as well as the temperature at predetermined locations on the face of the heat plate. In addition, the joint number, lot information, intermediate fusion status, date, and time are also indicated and represented in appropriate alignment with the visual indication of the sides of the heat plate. Further, the condition data  includes any notes or comments on the site conditions.","As illustrated in , the instruction data  includes specific information related to the specific pipe being fused, including pipe diameter, pipe dimensional ratio, pipe color, piston area, safe pull force, bend radius, heat pressure, fusion pressure, maximum fusion temperature, minimum fusion temperature, and\/or maximum temperature variance. This information is provided in order to allow the user U to quickly identify any differences or departures for any of the listed parameters (e.g., heat pressure, fusion pressure, temperature, etc.), which may lead to possible issues in the fusion process or with the resulting fusion joint. The fusion joint report  also provides areas for comments, recommendations, and notes, which constitutes information that may be provided by the user U and\/or the technician T.","In operation, the user U (or administrator) receives the activity data  at the activity interface  on a substantially real-time basis; however, this data  can also be received on a periodic basis, a predetermined basis, a set basis, or the like. This allows the user U to serially review each incoming fusion joint by reviewing the fusion joint report  in a timely manner. In order to identify variations or other potential errors or items requiring further attention, it is envisioned that visual or audible alarms or other similar indications can be generated or displayed both at the activity interface , as well as in connection with a generated fusion joint report . For example, if the heat plate temperature or the fusion pressure is outside of the acceptable boundaries, the associated data can be brought to the user's U attention through an alarm, increased font size, font color, or the like. This allows for the preemptive analysis and identification of possible issues or exceptions in a fused joint. By allowing this to occur in a quick manner (such as prior to pipe installation), any such errors, exceptions, or issues can be quickly and effectively addressed, such as through a call, e-mail, or other communication to the technician T. In addition, the line item on the activity interface  can also be highlighted or otherwise set apart from the other, acceptable items or joints.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["28","28","40","28","56"]},"The customer interface  accepts a user selection of at least one item on the list, and generates an interactive interface  for viewing, arranging, providing, configuring, and\/or outputting specific customer data , as shown in .
