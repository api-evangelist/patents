title: Network management apparatus and method based on simple network management protocol
abstract: An apparatus and method is provided for managing a communication device using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). When a developer creates an SNMP interface header file through an application program at a compile time, an extractor generates a management information base (MIB) file and object identifier information (OIDInfo) on the basis of the interface header file. When a manager makes an SNMP request at a run time, an agent sends the OIDInfo included in the SNMP request message to an OIDInfo processor. The OIDInfo processor refers to an OIDInfo memory and delivers general message service (GMS) information to the agent. A GMS request/response process between the agent and the application program is then performed on the basis of the GMS information.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for managing a network device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a network management apparatus and method for managing a communication device using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).","2. Description of the Related Art","Integrated network management is difficult because of the rapid growth of networks in several past years and the advent of various heterogeneous systems. As networks scale up, network device management is becoming essential in many fields.","Therefore, network managers need a network framework for comprehensive management in various network environments. Due to this need, the main standards organization for the Internet, i.e., Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), has adopted Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) corresponding to a relatively simple protocol as a standard for managing a network device based on the Internet.","In a conventional SNMP system, a management system is referred to as a manager and a management target is referred to as an agent. A management information transmission network for connecting the manager to the agent is based on Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), and communication using SNMP uses a command for retrieving management information, a command for successively retrieving management information, a command for changing and writing management information, and a command for reporting an exceptional operation on the basis of a management information base (MIB) between the manager and the agent.","The SNMP agent is a software module placed in a management target device and has information about the MIB. This information is delivered to the SNMP manager using SNMP.","Specific information, resources, and so forth, that are to be managed using SNMP are referred to as objects. A collection of the objects is referred to as the MIB. The format of the MIB is defined as part of the SNMP, and the objects are defined using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN. 1).","The SNMP agent manages an MIB configured by parameters relating to a network device function. The SNMP manager obtains a specific value from MIBs provided by SNMP agents, and identifies a device state or changes the value.","As described above, an operation for conventionally managing a network using SNMP denotes an operation for obtaining a specific value from MIBs provided by management target devices, identifying a device state, and changing the value.","According to SNMP, a management method can be easily used, and various types of devices using TCP\/IP can be developed. Through various Requests For Comments (RFCs), a management range can be easily designated or extended and protocols can be configured simply. Among the many management protocols, SNMP is widely used because it can be easily implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102"]},"First, commands transmitted\/received between the SNMP manager  and the SNMP agent  as illustrated in  will be described.\n\n","The SNMP manager  and the SNMP agent  of  can communicate with each other using the above-described messages.","A conventional development method and a conventional method for interfacing with an application program will now be described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"102"},"In step  of , a network manager defines an MIB to develop the SNMP agent , and defines a structure used for an interface with an associated application program.","In step , an MIB file is generated on the basis of the MIB defined in step . In step , the network manager codes and compiles the generated MIB file, thereby generating the SNMP agent .","In step , the network manager determines if the MIB or interface has been corrected. If the MIB or interface has been corrected, the network manager proceeds to step  to define management items.","In step , the network manager generates an MIB file on the basis of the management items defined in step . In step , the network manager recodes and recompiles the SNMP agent  on the basis of the generated MIB file.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","304"]},"In order for the manager  to interface with the application programs , the agent  must know structure and destination information. When a conventional tool for developing the SNMP agent  is used, objects  corresponding to the management items must be implemented using a structure used in the application programs .","In the conventional method for developing the SNMP agent , an MIB is designed such that characteristics of a device can be reflected. Content of the designed MIB determines a development range of the SNMP agent , a role of the application programs  for performing a management function within the device, an interface method between the SNMP agent  and the application programs , and so on.","A conventional tool is used to effectively develop the SNMP protocol. The development of the SNMP agent  using the tool is facilitated when the SNMP agent  has necessary data. However, the development of the SNMP agent  is difficult and complex because MIB objects have different structures when an MIB object value is obtained through an interface with the application programs .","The SNMP manager  accesses management items managed in the different application programs  within a device through the SNMP agent . These management items are expressed by the MIB and differ according to device characteristics. This MIB cannot be perfectly defined at the time of initial development.","Because the SNMP agent  is conventionally developed on the basis of the above-described MIB, different SNMP agents  must be developed for devices. Items to be managed in an identical device can be frequently changed, added, or deleted. When a change is made, the SNMP agent  needs to be corrected.","Since the SNMP agent  must be corrected and recompiled whenever the MIB is changed, added, or deleted in the above-described environment, a great deal of time and effort is required for the development.","Accordingly, a need exists for an effective and efficient system and method for managing a communication device using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).","Embodiments of the present invention are provided to substantially solve the above and other problems, and provide a network management apparatus and method based on Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) that generate a management information base (MIB) file and an object identifier information file in real time in a network management system.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) management apparatus and method for controlling the operation of devices suitable for changes occurring in a network comprising a network management system.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) management apparatus and method for operating devices comprising a network management system according to a standard.","In accordance with an object of the present invention, an apparatus is provided for generating a management information base (MIB) file for managing a communication device using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) at a compile time and an object identifier information (OIDInfo) file for communication between an SNMP agent and an application program.

If the desired OIDTreeInfo is searched, the OIDInfo processor  returns the GMSInfo  indicated by the OIDTreeInfo. Then, the agent  creates a GMS header and a payload using the GMSInfo . When the GMS payload  is created, an OAM header is inserted before the payload, the EM header subsequent to the OAM header is inserted to support SNMP between the agent  and the application program , and a structure value subsequent to the EM header is inserted.

An MIB corresponding to a management item and an OIDInfo file can be automatically changed even when a structure used between the SNMP agent and the application program is added, changed, or deleted. Therefore, the SNMP agent can be easily developed and can be used for other devices or other management targets without modification.","While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
