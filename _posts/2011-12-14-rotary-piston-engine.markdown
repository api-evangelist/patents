{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was granted to the Department of the Navy by one employee of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for US Governmental purposes only without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The invention relates primarily to combustion engines, and more particularly, to a high power density engine that is light weight, fuel efficient, and versatile.","There are many applications where a high power-to-weight engine is either necessary or helpful. Uses for this type of engine range from hand-held power equipment to motorcycles to racing boats to flying cars to aircraft. When you add fuel efficiency, compactness, and versatility the uses multiply. Currently, there are few viable options available to fulfill these applications and those that are available are very inefficient when high power is no longer desired. When the application warrants it, the engine type of choice has been the turbine engine.","Turbine engines are only efficient while high power is desired (heavy lift\/movement and\/or high speed), becoming very wasteful outside of their design load. Turbine engines are often un-economical due to their high manufacturing costs and poor fuel efficiency. Internal combustion engines are much more fuel efficient at off peak performance, but currently lack the power-to-weight ratio of turbine engines. Internal combustion engines use readily available fuel to drive them and are practical for many applications. Internal combustion engines are relatively economical to manufacture, reach peak power from idle relatively quickly, and have relatively low heat and noise signatures.","Diesel engines, in particular, while highly fuel efficient, are large and heavy. Take the M1 Abrams tank, for example. Currently, the smallest diesel with the power and speed to drive this main battle tank is significantly larger and heavier than a similarly powered turbine engine. In order to fit one in the chassis, something will have to be sacrificed, such as ammunition and fuel capacity, or the tank may need to be redesigned, such as a new suspension, new transmission, different final drives, and the like.","Conventional internal combustion engines yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. There is a need for a high power density engine that is light weight, fuel efficient, compact and versatile, which is addressed by various exemplary embodiments.","According to various exemplary embodiments, a rotary piston engine comprises at least one tows-shaped cylinder defined by an outer wall formed about an exterior circumferential surface of the tows and a rotor formed about an interior circumferential surface of the torus; at least one piston connected to the rotor; at least one compression tunnel for storing compressed gas; an intake port disposed through the outer wall for each wall valve; an exhaust port disposed through the outer wall for each wall valve; at least one wall valve mechanism disposed in the outer wall, each wall valve mechanism located between an intake port and an exhaust port; and an inflow port and an outflow port for each piston, each inflow port and outflow port adapted to fluidly communicate a cylinder with a compression tunnel.","According to further aspects of various exemplary embodiments, a method of connecting the rotor to a drive shaft with at least one spoke; and disposing a fuel port and a spark port between an intake port and the corresponding wall valve mechanism.","According to a further aspect of various exemplary embodiments, a method of rotating a driveshaft comprises opening an outflow port to direct compressed gas, stored in a compression tunnel, into a cylinder shaped as part of a tows; combusting gases in the cylinder, the cylinder having at least one piston disposed therein, where combustion gases push each piston about the tows and the piston is connected with at least one spoke to a driveshaft; closing the outflow port and opening an inflow port to direct gases on an advancing side of each piston into a compression tunnel; closing the inflow port to complete the first two strokes of the \u201cmodified Otto\u201d cycle (tradename EPIC); and opening an exhaust port and an intake port, wherein the combustion gases are pushed out of the exhaust port and air (or air-fuel mixture) is taken in through the intake port during the second two strokes of the \u201cmodified Otto\u201d cycle. Note that strokes of a rotary piston engine are not necessarily linear and generally comprise an arc, and generally begin and end at points of interaction between a piston and wall valve.","The above and other features of these embodiments relating to the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, are more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. The particular assemblies are shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the claims. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the exemplary embodiments of the invention (used for the \u2018Detailed Description\u2019) is defined only by the appended claims.","In accordance with various embodiments, the components, process steps, and\/or data structures incorporated therein may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and\/or general purpose machines. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other related component.","Broadly, the current invention provides a rotary piston engine that combines most of the advantages of an internal combustion engine with those of a turbine engine. The rotary piston engine improves on the existing internal combustion and turbine technology by achieving the same or better high end performance, while improving the efficiency during off-peak operations. As discussed in greater detail below, the rotary piston engine of the current invention includes an engine housing, at least one continuous cylinder doughnut, pistons (also called piston pedals), movable wall valves, at least one rotor and at least one drive shaft.","Referring to , a rotary piston engine  may be a doughnut-shaped (i.e., toroidal) structure typically encased in a housing . A cylinder may be a C-shaped member defined by an outer wall  forming the exterior circumferential surface of the torus and a rotor  formed about an interior circumferential surface of the torus. One or more pistons  may rotate inside the outer wall . Each piston  is attached to a rotor , which in this embodiment is a solid rim with a flat (or concave) outer surface with a multiple spoke center, which may seal with outer wall  to form the inside diameter of the doughnut shape.","A seal  may be used to seal between the rotor  and outer wall . Spokes  may connect the rotor  with its pistons  to a drive shaft  disposed in the center opening of the doughnut-shaped rotary piston engine . A ring  may be disposed about each piston  to help seal the piston in the doughnut-shaped rotary piston engine . Similarly, another ring (not shown) may be disposed about each wall valve  for sealing in the doughnut-shaped rotary piston engine .","In an exemplary embodiment, a 5.7 liter, 8-cylinder (64-cylinder equivalent) rotary piston engine  may be designed as described below with reference to . The sizes, configuration, number of pistons , and the like are for purposes of the current example and not meant to limit the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.","The rotary piston engine  may be doughnut shaped with a \u00d816\u2033 (inches) outside diameter and a \u00d87\u2033 doughnut hole. The width of the doughnut may be 4.5\u2033 (the exemplary pistons  are \u00d84.0\u2033 diameter\u00d70.5\u2033 thick piston paddles, facing perpendicular to the planar surfaces of the doughnut). The inner rim of the doughnut hole is the circumference of the rotor  supporting the eight pistons  (constituting paddles) radially and equally spaced around off the top of it. The spokes  from the rotor  circumference join in the center of the doughnut hole, radially around the driveshaft  (which is perpendicular to the planar surfaces of the doughnut).","In this example, the engine core is \u00d816\u2033D\u00d74.5\u2033W with a hole in its center of \u00d87\u2033D\u00d74.5\u2033W (other than the rotor spokes  and driveshaft ). Added to this are eight wall valves , an ambient intake port , an ambient exhaust port , a fuel port , and a spark port . The wall valves  can be placed radially around the circumference, increasing the overall diameter to \u00d825\u2033 without increasing the width (as shown in , for example). Another possibility is placing the wall valves  radially out the side of the doughnut, increasing the width to 9\u2033 without increasing the diameter. So the overall dimensions for the latter are \u00d816\u2033 diameter\u00d79\u2033 width, with a weight less than 570 pounds. These dimensions may optionally include engine components that support operational functions.","A plurality of seals  may be disposed at the distal ends of the pistons , where they meet the outer wall  (this seal may be the previously described ring  or some other sealing member), and at the proximate corners of the wall valves  to seal them against the piston  as shown in  as well as to seal the wall valves  against the inside of the rotor  and outer wall .","Referring now to the drawings, the operation of the rotary piston engine  will be described. This operational description should be taken as only one example of the operation of the rotary piston engine , without limitation. Other operational parameters may be used, as can be recognized by those skilled in the art.","The drawings in  have been simplified, using only one piston  and one wall valve  (a one equivalent cylinder engine) to demonstrate the process. This process has been simplified for explanatory purposes. As the rotor  and piston  rotate around the driveshaft , they have to pass by the wall valve . The wall valve  retracts rapidly up into the engine housing  and out of the outer wall  to enable the piston  to pass under it. It then snaps back into the cylinder through the outer wall , sealing the wall valve  with the outer wall  and rotor  just as the piston  passes under it, such that the cylinder's cross section looks like a \u201cC\u201d shape (as opposed to a donut shape when the wall valve  is retracted up out of the cylinder) and gasses cannot pass around the wall valve .","The rotary piston engine  uses a \u201cmodified-Otto\u201d cycle (tradename EPIC) such that the power and compression strokes occur simultaneously, followed by the simultaneous combination of the intake and exhaust strokes. In this example, the rotary piston engine's doughnut hole is sealed such that it stores the compressed air (only air for direct injection or air-fuel mixture for carburetor & manifold injection. Let \u2018air\u2019 represent either for this example) of the \u201cmodified-Otto\u201d cycle and is referred to as a compression tunnel .","The compression tunnel  has an inflow port  just to the left of the piston  and an outflow port  just to the right of the piston, both porting through the rotor . There is also an intake port  just to the left of the wall valve  and an exhaust port  just to the right of the wall valve , both porting through the outer wall . A spark or glow plug (not shown) comes through the outer wall  just to the left of the wall valve  at the spark port . Note that the spark or glow plug may not be needed if pressure-induced combustion is operational.","For discussion purposes, let the initial state be such that the cylinder \u201cC\u201d shape is filled with uncompressed air and let the compression tunnel  be filled with compressed air. Let the rotor  spin counter clockwise around the \u201cY axis\u201d (i.e., straight back into the page as shown in ), let the wall valve  move straight up and down along the \u201cZ axis\u201d (i.e., parallel to the short side of the page) at the top of the rotary piston engine . One revolution is represented by the time the piston  leaves the wall valve  until the time it returns again. In this example, one revolution covers two stokes of the \u201cmodified-Otto\u201d cycle. The engine view of  represents a cross sectional view.","Starting with the power\/compression combination stroke (), as the piston  advances, the compressed air is released from the doughnut hole and ignited. The expanding hot gasses between the piston  and the wall valve  drive the piston  forward. An advancing side  of the piston begins to compress the air in the cylinder \u201cC\u201d shape. When the piston  is near the half-way point of the stroke, the compression tunnel outflow port  closes and the compression tunnel inflow port  opens. Now the air in front of the piston  compresses into the compression tunnel  as the piston  is pushed from behind by the expanding combustion gasses .","As the piston  nears the wall valve , the compression tunnel inflow port  closes, locking the compressed air inside the compression tunnel . The wall valve  immediately retracts out of the cylinder, enabling the piston  to pass under it (the advancing side  of the piston  is now touching exhaust  left by the stroke that has just occurred) and then the wall valve  immediately snaps shut behind the piston . The pressurized air is stored in the compression tunnel  for the full intake\/exhaust combination stroke that follows.","At this point, referring to , the intake port  opens behind the piston  and the exhaust port  opens at the other end of the \u201cC\u201d shape on the advancing side  of the piston . The piston  proceeds forward, sucking in air  and pushing out exhaust gasses  (left by the proceeding stroke). As the piston  approaches the wall valve  again, the intake port  and exhaust port  begin to close, leaving a cylinder full of air behind the piston  and empty of exhaust gasses in front of the piston .","The wall valve  immediately retracts out of the cylinder, enabling the piston  to pass under it (the advancing side  of the piston  is now touching the air  that was taken in by the stroke that has just occurred) and then immediately snaps shut behind it. At the completion of the intake\/exhaust strokes, the compressed air that was previously stored in the compression tunnel  is available to start the power\/compression combination stroke. Now the process repeats itself.","The above example is equivalent to a conventional single cylinder engine in which there is only one power stroke for every two revolutions. By adding another wall valve midway in the torus shaped cylinder, the engine is converted into a two equivalent cylinder engine. This allows one power stroke per rotor revolution (just as a conventional 2-stroke engine has one power stroke per crank shaft revolution). If another piston is added symmetrically to the rotor, the engine becomes a four equivalent cylinder engine, with two power strokes for every revolution.","Four wall valves and four pistons is equivalent to a 16-cylinder engine (or similarly eight pistons and two wall valves). The multiplication factor continues with eight wall valves and eight pistons equating to a 64-cylinder engine, even though there are physically only eight distinct cylinders, as sectioned off by the eight wall valves. This engine would produce 32 power strokes per rotor revolution (versus four power strokes per crank shaft revolution in a conventional eight-cylinder engine).","This phenomenon is possible because each piston shares the same space as the previous piston, sequentially and each piston accomplishes two strokes of the four \u2018Otto\u2019 strokes, simultaneously,","A revolution may contain zero to multiple strokes, completing zero to multiple cycles.","Power (combustion, etc.) is applied perpendicular to the moment arm (rotor spoke) throughout the entire stroke, supplying maximum leverage throughout a power stroke. A conventional piston engine's piston rod (lessened even more by the angle between the piston rod and the piston's parallel movement along the cylinder) is only perpendicular to its moment arm (crankshaft lobe) at one moment in time during its power stroke, and that likely never coincides with the point of maximum combustion power.","Power may be routed in any direction or orientation.","A rotor(s) (or outer cylinder wall) never has to change its motion for the purpose of completing the four strokes of the Otto cycle (or diesel or any other cycle or process). This allows for the conservation of momentum. A conventional piston engine's pistons must each stop, change direction, and accelerate twice to complete the four stokes of the Otto cycle.","Alluding to a cycle, such as the Otto cycle, does not exclude the invention's incorporation of other cycles and processes (particularly the diesel cycle). In fact the invention includes all applicable cycles and processes (including non-cyclic, mixed cycles, combinations, etc.), regardless of the number of strokes, combustion process(s) (e.g., Isentropic expansion, constant pressure, other), fuel\/energy type (electromagnetic, electrical, thermodynamic, fluid dynamic, other dynamics, quantum, relativistic, magnetic, heat, pressure, state change, mechanical, organic and\/or inorganic chemical composition, element, biological composition, molecular\/atomic construct, or combination; even types not requiring air \u2018oxygen\u2019 intake, compression, and\/or exhaust), fuel state (e.g., gaseous, liquid, solid, or combination), ignition\/energy release and trigger (e.g., electromagnetic, electrical, thermodynamic, fluid dynamic, other dynamics, quantum, relativistic, magnetic, spark, flame, heat, pressure, state change, mechanical, biological, chemical, physical, statistical, electronic, indicator, time, command, signal, sequence\/pattern, reaction, proximity, temperature, speed, change in speed, gravity, combination, or other), lack of combustion (e.g., Steam, compressed air, etc.), or other.","Individual equivalent cylinders can be turned off at will and turned back on almost instantly. Since the compressed air (or fuel\/air mixture) is stored, one simply does not open the outflow port after a piston passes a wall valve and waits to release it until that piston passes a different wall valve further down line. This delay could be for a portion of a revolution up to thousands of revolutions.","Any number of equivalent cylinders may be shut off (from 1 to 64 for the 64-equivalent cylinder example) for variable and independent time periods, to match the instantaneous power demand (or other reasons). There may be practical limits or combinations that must be observed. Thus, a cycle or process may change progressively, sequentially, randomly, etc. in different portion(s) or for an entire operation.","Any process(es), along with its timing\/sequencing with and use of other items may be varied and more complex than the simplified process(es) described herein. A process(es) may be based on time, sequence, cycle, pattern, portions, ingredients, method(s), programming, code, equation (s), condition(s), physical characteristic(s), scientific principles or phenomena (physics, chemistry, biology, physical sciences), natural laws, engineering logic, random, other process(es), combination(s), etc.","Various embodiments include the potential utilization of an odd (or even) number of pistons and\/or wall valves. The number of pistons does not need to match the number of wall valves.","Placement of any engine item(s) throughout or external to the engine(s) may or may not be symmetrical.","Movement in and out of a cylinder may or may not be limited to the wall valve(s). A piston(s) may also move to allow passage under a wall valve or to temporarily reduce the number of pistons in the engine. Similarly, the wall valve(s) could be stationary and only the piston(s) move in and out of a cylinder or both a wall valve(s) and piston(s) may move.","A wall valve(s) (and\/or piston(s)) may stay retracted for portions of or many revolutions to increase the physical stroke length (gas expansion path) of an equivalent cylinder, rest, vary the firing sequence of the engine, etc.","Other items may move in, within, out, and\/or around the cylinder with similar or different characteristics to that of pistons.","Piston(s) may switch positions with the wall valve(s), such that the piston extends from the outer cylinder wall and the wall valve extends from the rotor rim (or any other positions).","Torus cylinders may be stacked inside of each other (an example may be similar to the nestling of a Matryoshka doll. In one such embodiment, the outer cylinder wall of one torus cylinder may become the inner cylinder wall of next torus cylinder, and vice-versa Alternatively, torus cylinders may be stacked abreast (i.e., side-by-side). In one such embodiment, the outer cylinder wall of one torus cylinder may be shared by the next torus cylinder, and vice-versa. Also, combinations of the nestling and abreast configurations are possible, as well as tandem (i.e., one-behind-the-other) arrangements.","Movement in, within, and out of a cylinder by piston(s) and\/or wall valve(s) may be perpendicular, angled, linear, non-linear, complex, rotary, hinged, gated, flapped, slid, etc. such that they translate, rotate, swing, slide, roll, float, slip, fluid dynamically, spiral, other, or combination. Movement of piston(s) and\/or wall valve(s) may be in part(s) or in whole such that individual pieces (or groups of pieces) may move in simple or complex relative motion to each other and\/or other engine item(s).","Piston(s) may or may not be connected physically or in any other way to the engine or other.","A cross section of each piston(s) or wall valve(s) in part(s) or in whole, perpendicular to the length of its cylinder, will generally match the shape of the cylinder cross section. The piston(s) shape does not need to match that of the wall valve(s).","Each piston(s) face, in part(s) or in whole, perpendicular to the length of its cylinder, will combine proportions of the shape of each wall valve (the inverse of the shape of the portion of each wall valve's shape that comes in contact with each piston), the parallel and perpendicular cross sections of itself (i.e., piston), and any other alteration in shape. Each piston face may be partially or fully open to the passage of substance through it for a time, multiple times, or continually.","Each piston(s) and\/or wall valve(s) may move in, within, or out of any other engine item(s) or engine(s).","Each wall valve face may be partially or fully open to the passage of substance through it for a time, multiple times, or continually. Each wall valve face will combine proportions of the shape of perpendicular and parallel cross sections of itself (i.e., wall valve), and any other alteration in shape.","Each rotor may rotate around or on a shaft (or other interior feature), rotate inside the outer wall of the cylinder, or it may remain stationary. Similarly, the engine housing (or outer wall) may be stationary; it may rotate around the rotor, or rotate inside an exterior feature. Either may move in simple or complex relative motion to each other and\/or other engine parts (e.g., translate, rotate, swing, slide, roll, float, slip, fluid dynamically, spiral, other, or in combination.","Each rotor spoke(s) can be tensile only, compressive only, a combination, segmented, continuous, in parts, of any number, planner, non-planner and spatial. Rotor spokes may be absent completely, a void in the entire (or partial) center of the rotor (or rotors).","Any engine item(s) used internal or external to a engine(s) may be housed in, routed around, through, between, shared, or in combination with any engine item(s), internal or external to the engine(s).

A reduced volumetric space between and while a piston and wall valve are in contact allows a smaller quantity of combustible material to be released through the outer portion of either; while maintaining adequate to enhanced conditions for combustion. Combustion source location(s), along with control of mix, quantity, and timing may aid the combustion process for power, efficiency, smoothness (avoid detonation or one large explosion), and flame speed.

Because the pistons  are thicker in these embodiments, an alternate compression tunnel  may be formed inside each piston, decreasing losses. This may be achieved by forming inflow ports  and outflow ports  onto the piston  as shown in . Also, the spark plug can be installed into the wall valve  for gasoline engines (not required for diesel versions).","The rotary piston engine  of the current invention can be used for any commercial application where a high power-to-weight ratio engine is desired. This is especially true where fuel economy and\/or compact size are also appreciated (decreasing operating costs or improving business with increased operational range or payload). Some industries that may benefit from exemplary embodiments include shipping, trucking, trains, air carriers (turboprop), rotorcraft, automotive, boating, flying, construction and farming.","As discussed above, the rotary piston engine  of the current invention offers a high power-to-weight ratio compared to conventional designs. A performance comparison is shown in  as a tabular listing. In particular, the exemplary rotary piston is compared to turbo shaft, industrial piston, and standard piston engines (the last comparing both Diesel and gasoline fuel types).","In various embodiments, cylinders can be turned on and off in less than two engine revolutions, with no losses, to adjust to power needs while maximizing fuel economy. The rotary piston engine of the current invention can be scaled down for hand-held power equipment or scaled up to power a ship, it can be short and fat, or long and skinny. The engine's center doughnut hole diameter can be much larger or smaller than the piston diameter (to adjust stroke length, moment arm, or to make room for other systems in the center), and it can have one to unlimited equivalent cylinders.","The rotors can be stacked to increase power density, to run counter-rotating shafts, or as a built-in back-up engine (each rotor can have entirely independent systems). The engine's rotor could be fixed such that the engines housing moves around it (e.g., a self propelled tire). The engine's center is essentially hollow, a doughnut hole or a torus, that could house systems including electrical coils (a built in hybrid motor or generator), a water impellor propulsion or liquid pump, a solids (or semi-solids) mover, ducted fan propulsion, a completely hollow tube for pass through, a completely solid or semi-solid center, and the like.","The invention's outer section (eg. Doughnut) may be wrapped or coated, partially or in whole, with wire, tubing, insulation, sheeting, coating, or other to produce a mechanical, electromagnetic, or other effect(s).","Internal cylinders may be used to move other fluids (liquid, gases, semi-solid) if driven externally or may be powered by other than a fuel-air mixture.","Spinning section(s) of the engine (e.g., Rotor) can energize itself via rotational and centrifugal forces, inertia, heat, etc. These energy sources would allow hydraulics, mechanical movement, natural flow, and the generation of electricity or magnetism for example. The generated energy could also be shared with the stationary engine section(s).","Embodiments of the engine (or portions thereof) may be unwound from around and\/or stretched out longitudinally along the y axis (running into the page for ) spirally, curved, straightened, other geometry, or some combination thereof. This may be such that movement of a portion(s) of the engine is translated longitudinally (may be in combination with rotational, vertical, and\/or lateral movement) in a spiral curvature. The stretched out portion(s) may be parts of the engine housing (e.g., outer wall), cylinder, engine core (e.g., Rotor), combination, and\/or other. The stretched out portions may also be stacked (similar to that of stacking the torus cylinders), consistent with any attributes described herein.","Engine (or portion thereof) may rotate around, move along any axis (or combination of), or move relative to any other portion(s) of the engine(s), including the y axis as demonstrated previously.","Engine start may not require a flywheel. Also, an electric starter may not be required if pre-stored compressed gas (internal or external to the engine) is used for initiation.","Wall valve (or piston) movement may utilize electromagnetic, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, mechanical, or other forces. Similarly, the spinning item(s) of the engine may utilize the same forces for breaking, transferring energy, or locking to another engine item(s) for a time.","\u2018The wall valve\u2019  denotes a component that extends radially inward between the outer wall  and the rotor  to engage the pistons , or withdraws into the outer wall . Any reference to \u2018torus\u2019 also refers to \u2018doughnut\u2019 equally (as appropriate).","In some embodiments of the invention, a cooling cycle may be periodically performed in and around engine items impacted by heat.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed; and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims (or as described above)."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
