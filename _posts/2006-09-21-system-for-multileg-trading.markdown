OVERVIEW OF EXAMPLE MULTI-LEG TRADING AND RELATED SUCCESS METRICS","3. OVERVIEW OF AN EXAMPLE ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEM","4. TRADER API","5. OVERVIEW OF AN EXAMPLE MULTI-LEG TRADE","6. EXAMPLES","Example 1","Example 2"],"p":["Aspects of the present invention relate to computerized devices, systems and\/or methods for monitoring, performing and\/or determining risk for multi-leg transactions.","Most financial instruments are traded on an exchange by brokers\/traders via electronic trading terminals of an electronic trading system. The terminals typically receive large amounts of data for one or more markets and financial instruments of particular interest to a trader on a substantially real-time basis. When trading a single instrument (a single-leg trade) the trader typically monitors the frequency with which this instrument is trading, the direction of price movement and potentially the depth-of-market if available. As a result the trader will have a good level of confidence in achieving a desired trade at a particular price and volume.","In a multi-leg trading scenario, the trader may create a synthetic instrument to improve trading efficiency. In this scenario the synthetic instrument provides the trader with a calculated best bid and offer price for a given volume and the ability to execute all legs of the synthetic with a single instruction. However, the ability to monitor the frequency of trading, direction of price movement and depth of market for each of the underlying legs becomes more challenging. The trader has no guarantee that the system will achieve execution on all underlying legs or at the expected price. Multi-leg trades therefore have greater risk than single-leg trades, and this risk increases if one or more legs are in less liquid markets.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter.","Aspects of the present invention address one or more issues described above, thereby monitoring, determining and\/or presenting risk to a trader for multi-leg transactions.","In some aspects of the invention, a trading terminal can calculate the current price for a synthetic instrument representing a multi-leg trade based on trading data for each financial instrument of the multi-leg trade. Other aspects of the present invention relate to a trading system that can provide indicia of the likelihood of success of completing each single-leg trade of a multi-leg trade.","These and other aspects of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments.","The various aspects summarized previously may be embodied in various forms. The following description shows by way of illustration of various combinations and configurations in which the aspects may be practiced. It is understood that the described aspects and\/or embodiments are merely examples, and that other aspects and\/or embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","The following description is divided into subsections to assist the reader. These subsections are included for illustrative purposes only as aspects of the invention may include one or more of the components, processes, and APIs described below:\n\n","In general, financial markets have three primary steps in their trading processes: Market Price Discovery, Transaction Execution, and Transaction Settlement.","Market Price Discovery is the process by which an executable Bid (the price at which someone is willing to buy) and an executable Offer (the price at which someone is willing to sell) are created and disseminated to market participants. In general terms, this process involves the collection of a \u201ccentral limit order book\u201d of bids and offers from all participants active in the market place. The term \u201call participants\u201d generally refers to those who are interested in buying or selling a particular instrument. The central limit order book (also referred to as \u201cthe book\u201d or \u201cthe CLOB\u201d) is arranged according to the rules of the market in a \u201cprice-time priority\u201d sequence. This gives priority to the highest Bids and lowest Offers. This priority ordering also resolves ties in price by sequencing according to time. In short, the first highest Bid has priority over all other bids in the marketplace. In almost all cases, the book of bids and offers is anonymous, meaning that the identity of bidders and offerors is not revealed to market participants prior to a trade. Other variations on CLOB sequencing are possible, for example Prize\/Size\/Time priority, in which larger orders have priority over smaller orders of the same price, even if they arrived later in time. The operator of the market typically determines the priority sequencing rules of the CLOB based on the requirements of the marketplace, in order to maximize liquidity and encourage involvement of the largest number of participants. In some markets a central regulatory authority may dictate the priority rules of the CLOB.","Markets may include a number of participants. The participants are not always equal, however, in the eyes of other market participants. Depending on the characteristics of a particular market, not all bids and offers are always available for trading to any particular participant. For example, a seller of securities may only want to sell to an institution, and not to a private individual. Or a buyer of foreign currency may not be able to settle with a foreign institution, so his bid is limited for access by domestic counterparties.","To account for these limitations on the trading abilities for a given market participant, the market price discovery process may filter the book of bids and offers so that participants can only see those orders (bids and offers) that are actually available to them for transacting. The filtering process must take account of any limitations imposed by the bidder or offeror, and any limitations imposed by the recipient. This is known as bi-lateral filtering.","Transaction Execution is the process by which a bidder and an offeror (a buyer and a seller) are matched by a broker in order that they may complete a transaction. The matching process is typically performed by a computer in active markets, but it may be performed by a human being (a so-called \u201cvoice broker\u201d) in some markets. When an order is fully matched, it is removed from the book so that other participants do not mistakenly believe the order is still available for transacting. In some cases, the process of Transaction Execution involves additional steps of negotiation in case the fall detail of the intended transaction is not captured simply by the price that was revealed in price discovery. For example, it may be necessary for the transacting parties to agree on settlement dates, on quantity, on reference prices, and so forth. These parameters to a trade may not have been conditions on the original bids and offers and, hence, could not be matched prior to bringing the two parties together.","Once two parties have agreed to execute a trade, they are obligated to one another to complete the settlement of the transaction. The settlement process is the procedure used to effect the actual exchange of value between the parties. For example, in a securities transaction, a buyer and a seller agree to trade, e.g., 1000 shares of stock X at a price of $10 per share. This transaction is scheduled for settlement three days after the trade date. On or before the settlement date, the seller must make arrangements for delivery of 1000 shares of stock to the buyer and the buyer must make arrangements for delivery of $10,000 to the seller. Once both of these exchanges are complete, the transaction is said to have been fully settled.","In some complex financial transactions, the settlement may actually take place on multiple dates. For example, in an Interest Rate Swap the parties agree to exchange payments every six months over a period of possibly several years. In a Foreign Exchange swap, a first settlement occurs two days following the transaction and a second settlement occurs anywhere from three days to a year or more later.","Success metrics for multi-leg trading (SMMT) is generally a process that can be implemented by a trading terminal and\/or electronic trading system to provide a trader with a numeric and\/or graphical view on the probability of a desired multi-leg trade completing at an expected price for a given volume, as well as perhaps the probability of each leg of the trade completing. Dependent upon the calculated probability, the trader can determine whether or not to execute the multi-leg trade.","As transaction products deliver more sophisticated multiple asset class trading across multiple execution venues and instrument types (both derivative and OTC cash), the use and complexity of synthetic instruments will likely increase. As a result, the value of SMMT will increase in both end user and program trading environments.","SMMT can be applied to a wide variety of multi-leg trade scenarios, such as the following example multi-leg trade scenarios:\n\n","SMMT can include a numeric and\/or graphical representation of the probability that all legs in the multi-leg trade will be executed and at an expected price for a given volume. Within a trading screen or an order entry form the Success Metric may be represented as shown in  and\/or B.","The Success Metric for the multi-leg trade can be calculated from equivalent Success Metric values for each of the underlying leg instruments. These values can in turn be calculated from factors such as the current price, volume, depth of market, frequency of trade, or and\/or other factors for each underlying leg. The frequency of trade can be calculated over a defined period of time.","The Success Metric values for the underlying legs could be calculated by individual trading terminals. It could also be calculated centrally by the trading system(s) to enable more efficient calculation of the Success Metric value for the synthetic instrument by the trading terminals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","110","116","118","120","122","116","118","120","122"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["116","118","120","114","112","110","122","116","118","120","112"]},"Traders may trade with each other using trading terminals. The trading terminals may include a trader application  that handles the local display of trading information and accepting and forwarding actions from a trader. The trading terminals may include dedicated trading computers, general purpose computers running a local trading application, a computer, or other computing system that provides an Internet-based trading application and combinations there between. Further, the trader applications may optionally be a \u201cblack-box\u201d that performs algorithmic trading without local display or actions from a trader.","For purposes herein, the functionality that receives information from a trader and provides information to a trader is referred to as a \u201ctrader application\u201d, represented in  by trader  application . The trader application  may execute on a computer located at each market participant (trader) location. The trader application  may be a program that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with trading functionality, an automated program trading application, or a hybrid of these two programs. The trader may enter trade order messages in the trader applications  in response to a viewed order book.","Each trader application  communicates (directly or indirectly) with trading systems ,   and  via a network . For instance, network  may be a wide area network or any other type of network. The network  may be the public Internet, a privately managed TCP\/IP network, or any other form of communications network that allows trading applications to communicate at high speed, and with low latency, with the trading terminals . The trader application  of each trading terminal can communicate with the one or more trading systems using one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) .","The above description relates to the physical connections between the components shown in . Example processes performed by the components of  are described below.","Trader applications  are available to market participants. Using the Trader applications , traders can enter bids and offers, cancel unmatched open orders, create synthetic instruments for multi-leg trades, and execute single and multi-leg trades as are permitted on the marketplace.","The trader applications  may display a central order book for various financial instruments include the financial instruments for one or more legs of a multi-leg transaction. The central order book may be dynamically updated with the bids and offers available in the marketplace. The display may be updated in real time as new orders are received by the marketplace. The trader applications  may also display and store a record of all executed transactions that are reported by the trading system(s) for a single trading workstation and\/or a single trader. As further described below, the trader applications may also calculate and\/or display the probability of success for executing single-leg transactions and\/or multi-leg transactions.","The trading systems can receive the orders and cancellations from all trader applications  of the particular system, and can organize these orders into a central order book according to the priority rules of the marketplace.","Network  provides a medium through which the central order book for each trading system is provided to all market participants. Network  may provide a high speed, low latency connection between trader applications  and trading systems , ,  and .","The trading systems , ,  and  can perform a number of functions. For instance, the trading systems can match bids and offers, or buy and sell orders, according to the rules of the marketplace, removes such matched bids and offers from their central order book, and notifies the trader applications  which originated the matched bids and\/or offers of the resulting trade executions as described above. Each side of a single-leg trade may be associated with an individual trader entity (for instance, the trader that submitted the bid or offer).","In at least one illustrative implementation of the system of , the systems may include computers, stored programs, and communications networks and be operated so as to not require manual intervention under normal trading operations. Accordingly, this illustrative representation of the system of  may allow fast and efficient trading of multi-leg trades over multiple trading systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["624","628"]},"Also, the trading terminal  may be an automated terminal that does not have a user interface but only handle transactions in an automated fashion for a trader. The trading terminal  may not be a \u201cterminal\u201d in the traditional sense, but rather may be a software application which performs automated trading based on rules embodied in its software (so-called \u201cblack-box\u201d proprietary trading).","The trading terminal  may exchange messages with other components of the system through network  using application programming interfaces . The application programming interfaces may include, but are not limited to, the following.","First, market information  may be provided to the trading terminal  for display on display . The market information may be transmitted in various ways including only as a singular book, a book followed by incremental updates to the book, and the like. The display of market information may include the order book, trades in the market, price history, high and low prices for instruments, and associated volumes.","Next, API  supports order entry capabilities  that allow a trader to create order messages to be transmitted to the network . The order entry functions may include entering limit orders, entering market orders, entering spread orders, entering contingent orders, and canceling of previously submitted Orders.","Further, API  may include the handling of trade reports . The handling of trade reports  may include information that flows upstream from the trading terminal  to the network  specifying which report or types of reports are desired and\/or the delivery of the reports. The reports may be static or dynamic (receiving real-time information from a remote source and incorporating it into the information displayed to a trader) as is known in the art. For instance, the reports may include information regarding executed orders and fulfillment of settlement obligation summaries.","Finally, API  may include support for additional applications  that may aid the trader in understanding new market information and additionally executing trades in the system. The additional applications may include applications that provide analytical information or charts to automated trading programs and\/or algorithmic trading programs. Further, the additional applications may provide analytical tools for the traders. For example, the additional applications may calculate and\/or provide indications of the probability of success for the trader to complete a single-leg transaction (either on its own or part of a multi-leg transaction) and\/or a success metric for completing a desired multi-leg trade.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["110","112","312"]},"If a trader were to buy a quantity of ten Synthetic1, this would equate to a purchase of ten of Instrument1 and twenty of Instrument2. If a trader were to sell a quantity of one hundred Synthetic1, this would equate to a sale of one hundred Instrument1 and two hundred Instrument2.","The synthetic instrument could comprise of any number of underlying instruments in varying volumes and combinations of buy and sell, e.g. Synthetic2=(3\u00d7Instrument1)+(2\u00d7Instrument2)\u2212(5\u00d7Instrument3).","The trader typically would want to know the price for purchasing a quantity of 50 Synthetic1. To do so, the trader could open a purchase order entry form (not shown) via his trading terminal  to request information for purchasing a quantity of 50 of Synthetic1. As such, the trading terminal  and\/or trading system  would perform step  of receiving request data requesting Success Metric Values for trading the synthetic instrument, in which the request data would include parameters of the requested trade, such as the quantity of Synthetic1. The trading terminal and\/or trading system could then perform the step  of monitoring trading data for each financial instrument of the synthetic instrument, which would be Instrument1, Instrument2 and Instrument3 in the present example.","Based on the trading data received by the trading system and\/or trading terminal, the trading system or trading terminal could do the following: Step , calculate the current price for the synthetic instrument based on the trading data; Step , calculate the probability of executing the requested trade at the current price or at a requested price for each instrument; and Step , calculate the probability of executing the requested trade for the synthetic instrument at the current price based on the probability of trading each financial instrument at their current prices (i.e., the Success Metric Values for performing the multi-leg trades of the synthetic instrument). Trading terminal  could display the current price for purchasing a quantity of one Synthetic1 and the Success Metric probability value indicating the likelihood of success for purchasing this quantity at the current price or at a desired price entered by the trader, such as via the purchase order entry form.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":"112"},"The trader considers both the purchase price and the Success Metric probability value displayed on the trading terminal and, if acceptable, hits the trade button. As such, the trading terminal  performs the step of  of receiving instructions to execute the requested trade of the synthetic instrument, such as Synthetic1. The trading terminal then performs the step  of simultaneously sending execution instructions to trade each financial instrument of the synthetic instrument according to the requested trade parameters. The trader then receives a confirmation detailing the successful purchase of 50 Synthetic1 and the actual price that he has paid. This can be done via trading terminal  performing the step  of displaying the actual trade data for the executed synthetic instrument.","The Success Metric probability value for Synthetic1 is produced from a calculation involving the Success Metric probability value for Instrument1 and the Success Metric probability value for Instrument2. In the above example a simple multiplication was used.","SM(Synthetic1)=SM(Instrument1)\u00d7SM(Instrument2). For example, if SM(Instrument1) equals 95% and SM(Instrument2) equals 87% then SM(Synthetic1) would equal 82.65%.","The Success Metric probability values for Instrument1 and Instrument2 will vary based upon how liquid trading in these instruments is at a particular point in time. If the frequency of trade is high and the depth of market is high then the Success Metric probability will be high. If the frequency of trade is low and the depth of market is low then the Success Metric probability will be low. If the trader wants to trade a very large volume then the Success Metric probability will be lower than if he wanted to trade a very small volume.","The Success Metric probability values for Instrument1 and Instrument2 would therefore be calculated based on a formula involving a number of variables that may include current price, volume to be traded, depth of market and frequency of trade. As shown in , trading terminal  and\/or trading system  can perform the step  of monitoring trading data for the financial instrument of a single-leg trade. The trading terminal and\/or trading system can also perform the step  of continually calculating probability factors for the single-leg transaction based on the trading data, such as average change in price, average deal rate, market depth, bid-offer spread, etc. Based on the calculated probability factors, the trading terminal and\/or trading system can perform the step  of calculate\/re-calculating the probability of executing the single-leg trade, for example at the current price for the financial instrument.","When the trader first opens the purchase order entry form with a quantity of one, the Success Metric probability is calculated based upon this volume. As the trader increases the volume to fifty the Success Metric probability is recalculated. As the volume is increased we would expect the Success Metric probability for the Synthetic to decrease. This could be represented graphically to the trader according to the graph shown in . As illustrated, the likelihood of successfully completing the multi-leg transaction may decrease as the volume increases. Based upon the trader's appetite for risk, he could use this chart to determine the volume he is willing to trade. Similarly the more the trader is willing to pay for a given volume, and assuming the market depth is available, the more likely he is to achieve his trade.","The following are illustrative examples of multi-leg trades and success metric calculations related to the same.","The following example is of a synthetic trade (x) consisting of 2 legs (y and z) where the relative volumes of each leg are fixed in a ratio x=y+2z. The factors that influence the probability of each leg being executed include (but are not limited to) the following: The volume available in the order book(s) of accessible markets; the price levels for each of the above volumes; the volatility of the price; the volatility of volume at the price; and the price trend (within the desired trading window).","If we start by disregarding volatilities, trends and the possibility of someone else hitting the offers for y and z, then at any one point in time if available volumes of y and z exceeds required volumes there is a theoretical price of x that can be 100% achieved for buying a required volume of x (e.g. 100 units), determined by the available offers of the underlying legs (y and z), as illustrated below in Tables 1 and 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Synthetic X",{},{},"BUY"]},{"entry":[{},"Volume","Price","SMMT","Time"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"100","7.2","100%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Leg y",{},"BUY","Leg z",{},"BUY"]},{"entry":[{},"Volume","Price","%","Volume","Price","%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"100","3.2","100%","200","9.2","100%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0078"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Y",{},"Z",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Depth of Book",{},"Depth of book"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Volume","Price offered","Volume","Price offered"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"80","3","160","9"]},{"entry":[{},"50","4","80","10"]},{"entry":[{},"70","5","70","11"]},{"entry":[{},"150","6","30","12"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"To purchase 100 contracts of x would need to take all 80 contracts shown at 3 and 20 at 4.

He could also enter a desired SMMT value for a given volume and trading window to determine a price.","SMMT Model","Conducting multi-leg trades to implement a hedging strategy, spread, or arbitrage opportunity where the trader wants to achieve a specific price and\/or volume can be complex. The trader must monitor price, volume and trends for each of the underlying legs to take a view on whether the trade will be achieved. This complexity is increased significantly where the legs of the multi-leg trade vary by currency, or in the case of commodities, by units.","The trader may create a synthetic instrument that calculates a single price and volume for the desired multi-leg trade. In more sophisticated situations the trader may also be able to calculate a synthetic depth of market. This simplifies his view on the market but at the same time masks the activity in the underlying legs of the trade. For example it may not be clear that liquidity or volume is insufficient in one or more of the underlying legs. The trader also has no \u2018what if\u2019 capability to determine the likelihood of achieving a better trade in the near future based upon trends in the underlying legs.","The Success Metric for Multi-leg Trading (SMMT) resolves both of these issues. The SMMT calculation for a multi-leg trade provides the probability of successfully executing that trade at the desired price and volume. In addition, if the trader considers the SMMT value to be too high\/low, he can adjust the value and see the resultant impact on the price and\/or volume that can be achieved.","In this theoretical example, conducted in an exchange traded market, where market depth is available, the trader wants to conduct a 200 lot multi-leg trade comprising three instruments B, C and D in the following ratios: B+2C\u22123D. The trader can monitor the depth of market in the three underlying instruments as shown in the Tables 4, 5 and 6
