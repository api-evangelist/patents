title: Distributed road assessment system
abstract: A system that detects damage on or below the surface of a paved structure or pavement is provided. A distributed road assessment system includes road assessment pods and a road assessment server. Each road assessment pod includes a ground-penetrating radar antenna array and a detection system that detects road damage from the return signals as the vehicle on which the pod is mounted travels down a road. Each road assessment pod transmits to the road assessment server occurrence information describing each occurrence of road damage that is newly detected on a current scan of a road. The road assessment server maintains a road damage database of occurrence information describing the previously detected occurrences of road damage. After the road assessment server receives occurrence information for newly detected occurrences of road damage for a portion of a road, the road assessment server determines which newly detected occurrences correspond to which previously detected occurrences of road damage.

The deterioration of these paved structures may be caused by usage, environmental, and aging factors, resulting in damage to the surface of the road, to rebar within pavement, to pilings supporting the road, and so on. One usage factor is vehicle weight. As the weight of a vehicle increases, the road damage (e.g., buckling and cracking) increases due to the increased stress on the road. Other usage factors include use of chains or studded tires. One environmental factor is temperature. During winter, water that seeps under a road may freeze and expand, causing road damage (e.g., potholes). Other environmental factors include earthquakes, snow, rain, and so on.","Regardless of how a paved structure is damaged, a damaged paved structure may present a danger to vehicles and their passengers that travel over the damaged portions of the paved structure. In addition, the damage may also present a danger to pedestrians, other vehicles, houses, and so on that happen to be nearby when a vehicle travels over a damaged portion. To minimize this danger, the paved structures may be periodically inspected. For example, a civil engineering firm may check paved structures on a regular basis (e.g., yearly) for the presence of new damage (e.g., cracks). Current inspection techniques include visual inspection augmented by chain dragging or hammering to detect changes in sound reverberations. These inspection techniques result in subjective, highly variable, and highly unreliable assessments, while also requiring that traffic be rerouted during the evaluation process.","It has been suggested that damage to paved structures be detected using ground-penetrating radar (\u201cGPR\u201d). However, each time the paved structure, roadway, or area is scanned, large amounts of data may be collected and processed. For example, the scan of a road may collect GPR return signals every few centimeters. A GPR system may generate image frames from the return signals and attempt to detect surface and subsurface damage from those image frames. Because GPR systems and their analysis techniques are typically expensive and computationally intensive, any possible road damage assessment by such techniques would likely be limited to only certain roads (e.g., bridge decks) and\/or performed only on an infrequent basis. Such limited and infrequent road damage assessment fails to detect many types of road damage that may cause a serious safety hazard.","A system for inspecting roads is provided. The system comprises a road assessment pod and a road assessment server. The road assessment pod is capable of being coupled to a vehicle and includes a collection of antennas for emitting ground-penetrating radar and receiving return signals as the vehicle travels down a road; a damage assessment component that analyzes the return signals to detect occurrences of damage and that determines the type of each occurrence of damage; and a transmission component that, for each occurrence of damage, transmits occurrence information that includes location and type of the occurrences. The road assessment server includes a component that receives the occurrence information transmitted by the road assessment pod; a correspondence component that identifies correspondences between newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences; a component that, when no correspondence is identified between a newly detected occurrence and any previously detected occurrence, indicates that the newly detected occurrence represents damage not previously detected; and a component that, when a correspondence is identified between a newly detected occurrence and a previously detected occurrence, updates information for that previously detected occurrence based on that newly detected occurrence. The system may also be wherein the correspondence component identifies a root correspondence between a newly detected occurrence and a previously detected occurrence and then identifies correspondences between other newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences based on that root correspondence. The system may also be wherein the correspondence component identifies correspondences between other newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences further based on locations of the occurrences relative to the root correspondence. The system may also be wherein the correspondence component identifies correspondences between other newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences further based on types of the occurrences. The system may also be wherein the road assessment server includes a component that provides a user interface for receiving from a user a query relating to road damage and for displaying a map indicating locations of road damage. The system may also be wherein the damage assessment component includes a detection component that detects objects from the return signals and a classification component that classifies the detected objects as representing road damage or not representing road damage. The system may also be wherein the road assessment server receives transmitted occurrence information from a plurality of road assessment pods. The system may also be wherein the road assessment server includes a component that provides instructions to the road assessment pod indicating a road that the road assessment pod is to inspect for damage.","A road assessment pod for collecting road damage information as a vehicle travels down a road is provided. The road assessment pod comprises a collection of antennas for emitting ground-penetrating radar and receiving return signals as the vehicle travels down a road; a detection component that analyzes the return signals to detect objects on or below the surface of the road; a classification component that determines whether a detected object represents an occurrence of road damage; a type component that determines a type of each occurrence of damage; and a transmission component that, for each occurrence of damage, transmits occurrence information that includes location and type of the occurrence. The road assessment pod may also be wherein the collection of antennas includes transceivers that operate in multistatic mode. The road assessment pod may also be claim  including a navigation component that determines current location of the road assessment pod. The road assessment pod may also be wherein power for the road assessment pod is provided by the vehicle on which it is mounted. The road assessment pod may also include a component that transmits images generated by the detection component to a road assessment server. The road assessment pod may also be wherein the road damage information is collected as the vehicle travels at highway speeds.","A road assessment system for collecting road damage information from road assessment pods as vehicles on which the road assessment pods are mounted travel down a road is provided. The road assessment system comprises a component that receives occurrence information transmitted by road assessment pods, the occurrence information indicating newly detected occurrences of damage to the road; a correspondence component that identifies correspondences between newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences; a component that, when no correspondence is identified between a newly detected occurrence and any previously detected occurrence, indicates that the newly detected occurrence represents damage not previously detected; and a component that, when a correspondence is identified between a newly detected occurrence and a previously detected occurrence, updates information for that previously detected occurrence based on that newly detected occurrence. The road assessment system may also be wherein the correspondence component identifies a root correspondence between a newly detected occurrence and a previously detected occurrence and then identifies correspondences between other newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences based on that root correspondence. The road assessment system may also be wherein the correspondence component identifies correspondences between other newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences further based on locations of the occurrences relative to the root correspondence. The road assessment system may also be wherein the correspondence component identifies correspondences between other newly detected occurrences and previously detected occurrences further based on types of the occurrences. The road assessment system may also include a component that provides a user interface for receiving from a user a query relating to road damage and for displaying a map indicating locations of road damage.","A method for inspecting roads is provided. The method comprises collecting by a road assessment pod road damage information as a vehicle on which the road assessment pod is mounted travels down a road, the road assessment pod using ground-penetrating radar to identify occurrences of damage to the road; transmitting by the road assessment pod occurrence information in real time to a road assessment server, the occurrence information including location and type of each occurrence of damage identified by the road assessment pod; and processing by the road assessment server the occurrence information to identify new occurrences of damage and changes to existing occurrences of damage based on the locations of newly detected occurrences of damage compared to locations of previously detected occurrences of damage.","A method and system is provided that detects damage on or below the surface of a paved structure or pavement. These can include but are not limited to road surfaces, bridge decks, parking structures, airport runways, taxiways, utility conduits, and so on, which are generally referred to as \u201croads.\u201d In some embodiments, a distributed road assessment system includes road assessment pods and a road assessment server. Each road assessment pod includes a ground-penetrating radar antenna array and a detection system that detects road damage from the return signals as the vehicle on which the pod is mounted travels down a road. Each road assessment pod transmits to the road assessment server occurrence information describing each occurrence of road damage that is newly detected on a current scan of a road (i.e., as the vehicle travels down the road). For example, a road assessment pod may transmit the type (e.g., pothole), location, severity, orientation, size, and so on of each newly detected occurrence of road damage. The road assessment server maintains a road damage database of occurrence information describing the previously detected occurrences of road damage (e.g., detected by a road assessment pod on a previous scan of a road). After the road assessment server receives occurrence information for newly detected occurrences of road damage for a portion of a road, the road assessment server determines which newly detected occurrences correspond to which previously detected occurrences of road damage. When the road assessment server determines that a newly detected occurrence corresponds to a previously detected occurrence, it updates its database to reflect the new occurrence information received from a road assessment pod. For example, the new occurrence information may indicate that the severity of the road damage has increased or decreased since the last scan. If the severity has decreased, then the damage may have been repaired or either the new scan or the previous scan may have been somewhat inaccurate. When the road assessment server determines that a newly detected occurrence does not correspond to a previously detected occurrence, it adds the occurrence information for the newly detected occurrence to its road damage database. The road assessment server may also provide a user interface through which a person can view and analyze the occurrence information of the road damage database. The road assessment server may also interface with a geographic information system (\u201cGIS\u201d) to provide maps that graphically illustrate the locations of roads along with the occurrences of damage along the roads.","In some embodiments, the road assessment pods may be mounted on fleets of vehicles such as government-owned vehicles, postal service vehicles, express delivery vehicles, trucking company vehicles (e.g., \u201cbig rigs\u201d), and so on. The road assessment pods inspect the roads that the vehicles travel over at highway speeds so that the roads can be inspected as the vehicles travel over the roads during their normal course of business. For example, a road assessment pod mounted on a big rig may inspect a highway as the rig travels to its next location for pickup or delivery of a bad. In some cases, the owners of the vehicles may be compensated for allowing road assessment pods to be mounted on their vehicles. The road assessment pods may have a few standard configurations for use by vehicles of different types. The standard configurations may include a standard array of antennas, a standard detection system, an object classification component, a standard navigation system (including a global positioning system (\u201cGPS\u201d) receiver, and a data transmission system. A road assessment pod may include its own power supply or may tap into the power of the vehicle to which it is mounted. The standard configurations may include a few different mounting options to accommodate different types of vehicles (e.g., a car or a truck). When standard configurations are used, the cost of production of the road assessment pods will likely be lowered. With a lower cost, the road assessment pods can be mounted on vehicles at a relatively low per-vehicle cost, and road damage information can be collected at an increased frequency and over a wide area. When the road damage information is collected more frequently, safety problems caused by newly detected damage or previously detected damage that is rapidly deteriorating damage can be minimized by taking early preventive measures. The detection system of a road assessment pod may detect objects within a scan using conventional detection techniques. In some embodiments, the objects are detected using the imaging and detection system described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/219,410, entitled \u201cREAL-TIME SYSTEM FOR IMAGING AND OBJECT DETECTION WITH A MULTISTATIC GPR ARRAY,\u201d which is being filed concurrently and is hereby incorporated by reference. After the detection system detects an object, the object classification component analyzes the object to determine whether the object represents road damage or some other type of surface or subsurface object. For example, the object classification component may differentiate pavement seams from cracks and speed bumps from buckling. In some embodiments, the objects are classified using the classification system described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/219,435, entitled \u201cCLASSIFICATION OF SUBSURFACE OBJECTS USING SINGULAR VALUES DERIVED FROM SIGNAL FRAMES,\u201d which is being filed concurrently and is hereby incorporated by reference. The transmission system of the road assessment pod may transmit to the road assessment server the occurrence information for newly detected occurrences at a set frequency (e.g., once every 5 minutes), after a certain number of occurrences have been detected, and so on. The transmission system may transmit the occurrence information using various types of communication networks such as a cellular network, a satellite network, a wireless wide area network, and so on. When a road assessment pod includes a detection system that detects objects from the return signals, the pod can avoid having to transmit the streaming imaging data to the road assessment server and instead only transmit the road damage properties or attributes. The amount of occurrence information that may be sent from a road assessment pod to the road assessment server is thus very small compared to the amount of imaging data from which the occurrence information is derived.","In some embodiments, the road assessment server captures properties or characteristics of previously detected occurrences, such as location, severity of damage, time of detection, size, elongation, orientation, etc. The topology of the network of previously detected occurrences (the geometrical structure of the network in xyz space) is maintained in the road damage database, which stores attributes of previously detected occurrences and implicitly captures the geometrical structure of the network. The road assessment server detects changes in road damage (i.e., new damage or existing damage that has changed) by comparing the attributes and topology of new occurrences detected on the latest scan to the road damage database of previously detected occurrences. The road damage database includes values of attributes for specific occurrences of damage that are aggregated from previous scans. When the road assessment server receives information on newly detected occurrences for the latest scan, it evaluates how well the newly detected occurrences correspond to previously detected objects topologically and possibly in terms of attributes. The road assessment server initially selects a previously detected occurrence that appears to correspond to a newly detected occurrence (in the sense that they topologically appear to be the same occurrence of damage) using a spatial network correspondence algorithm. Such a topological correspondence is referred to as the \u201croot correspondence.\u201d The road assessment server evaluates the degree of correspondence between other newly detected occurrences and other previously detected occurrences in the vicinity based on this root correspondence. The root correspondence algorithm may, for example, select a previously detected occurrence and a newly detected occurrence that are topologically consistent and have similar attributes. Once the road assessment server selects a pair of newly and previously detected occurrences as the root correspondence, it calculates a \u201ccost\u201d associated with pairs of other newly and previously detected occurrences. This cost reflects the belief that the newly detected object of the non-root pair corresponds to the previously detected occurrences of that pair. For example, a low cost may indicate that the occurrences more likely correspond. The road assessment server may then generate a change index for each newly detected occurrence to quantify the belief that it might not have been previously detected (and thus constitute a change). For example, a high change index may indicate that the newly detected occurrence of damage is more likely to have never been detected on any previous scan. The change detection system may set the change index for a newly detected occurrence to be the cost of assigning that occurrence to the previously detected occurrence that it best corresponds with based on both attributes and topological consistency. The change detection system may determine a likely correspondence between previously and newly detected occurrences using a standard minimal cost assignment algorithm applied to spatially localized sets of previous and newly detected occurrences. After determining the optimal correspondence, the road assessment server updates information in the road damage database of previously detected occurrences with the values of the attributes of the corresponding newly detected occurrences, as these attributes may vary over time due to variations in scan path (e.g., direction of travel or closeness to the center of the roadway), changes in the surface (e.g., ruts in the roadway after a rainstorm), and so on. If a newly detected occurrence corresponds to no previously detected occurrence, then it may constitute a change. If so, the road assessment server adds that occurrence as an additional occurrence to the road damage database, and it will be treated as a previously detected occurrence by subsequent scans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["110","111","113","112"]},"In some embodiments, a road assessment pod employs a linear array of transmitter and receiver antennas for transmitting and receiving radar signals.

Mapping efficiency reflects the degree of topological match between previously detected occurrences and newly detected occurrences within a localized area given a presumption of root correspondence between a specific previously detected occurrence and a specific newly detected occurrence within that same area. The road assessment server establishes the root correspondence as that pair of previously and newly detected occurrences for which the associated mapping efficiency is maximized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1E","FIG. 1E"],"b":["101","102","103","104","105","106","107"]},"In some embodiments, the road assessment server generates a cost matrix with one row for each newly detected occurrence in the vicinity of the newly detected occurrence in the root pair and one column for each previously detected occurrence in that same vicinity (excluding the previously detected occurrence in the root pair). For each entry in the cost matrix, the road assessment server generates a cost (or score) reflecting the belief that the newly detected occurrence associated with that entry does not correspond to the previously detected occurrence associated with that entry, given the root correspondence established as described above. The road assessment server calculates the cost for each such pair based on (i) detection fitness for occurrences in that pair and (ii) topological consistency between those occurrences. The fitness of a detection is a measure of the goodness or strength of an occurrence detection, and it varies from 0 to 1. Topological consistency also varies from 0 to 1, and it reflects the degree of consistency between attributes of the previously and newly detected occurrences in the pair. These attributes are referred to as edge attributes, and they may include the orientation of an occurrence relative to its root, the pointing vector from the root to the occurrence, the orientation angles of the occurrence and its root relative to the pointing vector from the centroid of the root to the centroid of the occurrence, and so on. The edge attributes are derived from the attributes of the occurrences (vertices) that they connect, where the vertex attributes include occurrence location, time of detection, orientation, length, width, elongation, etc. In some embodiments, the road assessment server may only use location when determining topological consistency. In some embodiments, the topological consistency between a pair of previously and newly detected occurrences is computed by evaluating the likelihood of the attributes of the edge that connects the previously detected occurrence to its root relative to the attributes of the edge that connects the newly detected occurrence to its root. The joint likelihood of edge attributes is modeled as the product of marginal likelihood functions of one variable for each of the edge attributes. The road assessment server provides a marginal likelihood function for each edge attribute that takes the value of the corresponding attribute for the edge that connects the newly detected occurrence to its root as the mode or peak location. The variance of each marginal likelihood function may be specific to each edge attribute, and it reflects the degree of uncertainty in attribute values captured by a distributional attributed relational tree as described below in detail. The road assessment server then determines the minimal cost assignment (one-to-one mapping) of newly detected occurrences to previously detected occurrences from the cost matrix.","In some embodiments, after generating a cost matrix, the road assessment server updates the road damage database to reflect the newly detected occurrences. The road assessment server may apply a minimal cost algorithm to identify the correspondence between previously and newly detected occurrences that represents the most likely correspondence. One suitable minimal cost assignment algorithm is described in Orlin, J. B. and Ahuja, R. K., \u201cNew Scaling Algorithms for the Assignment and Minimum Cycle Mean Problems,\u201d Mathematical Programming, Vol. 54, 1992, pp. 41-56, which is hereby incorporated by reference. After identifying the most likely correspondence between the previously and newly detected occurrences, the road assessment server updates the road damage database for the previously detected occurrences to reflect the attributes of the corresponding newly detected occurrences.

The road assessment server generates a binary spatial index grid for \u03a9in xyz space (e.g., representing the area along the entire scan or along a portion of the scan). The cubic grid cells may have a width defined by their error tolerance \u03b5 in relative locations of occurrences, and the grid origin may be at the minimum x, y, and z over all previously detected occurrences within \u03a9. The road assessment server sets the value of the grid cell to 1 if it contains the centroid of an occurrence from \u03a9. Once the road assessment server has identified a root correspondence, the root vertices may be designated as the vertices of index 0 in \u03a9and \u03a9.","The road assessment server constructs a DART D by imposing uncertainty on the ART formed from \u03a9with V(\u03a9) as the root. The road assessment server replaces each edge attribute ain the ART with a likelihood function p(a|D) in DART D, where the peak and width of the likelihood function vary in accordance with the values of the attributes of the newly detected occurrences. For example, the peak of the likelihood function occurs at the value of afrom the ART, and the width of the likelihood function is specified to reflect the degree of uncertainty in the value of a.","The road assessment server transforms change detection into a minimal cost assignment problem in which newly detected occurrences captured in DART D are assigned to previously detected occurrences captured in the subset \u03a9of the road damage database. Once formulated, this minimal cost assignment problem can be solved using standard cost scaling methods. In some embodiments, the road assessment server employs a cost function c that depends on a variable u that combines fitnesses of detections associated with a corresponding pair of previously and newly detected occurrences, and a variable v that quantifies topological consistency for that pair. The variables u and v both vary from zero to one, and c(u,v) is a continuous function defined on the unit square 0\u2266u, v\u22661, The road assessment server assumes that complete topological inconsistency (v=0) will lead to the highest possible cost (c=1) and that complete absence of fitness (u=0) will also lead to the highest possible cost (c=1) The lowest possible cost (c=0) applies only when topological consistency and detection fitness are both perfect (u=v=1). The road assessment server may further take the cost trend for perfect topological consistency (v=1) as linear and decreasing from one to zero with fitness u. These conditions lead to the following boundary conditions for cost function c:\n\n(0)=1\u2003\u2003(2a)\n\n(1)=1\u2003\u2003(2b)\n\nThe simplest continuous function from zero to one over the unit square that satisfies these boundary conditions is the bilinear DART cost function represented as follows:\n\n()=1\u2003\u2003(3)\n","The road assessment server characterizes topological matching of DART D to \u03a9as a minimal cost assignment problem. To accomplish this, it generates a cost matrix {c} from the cost function c(u,v). The rows j of {c} represent previously detected occurrences, and the columns k represent newly detected occurrences. The elements c\u03b5[0,1] reflect the cost of making the determination that previously detected occurrence j and newly detected occurrence k are really the same occurrence.

The element cthus represents the cost of mapping previous occurrence j+1 from \u03a9(expressed symbolically as V(\u03a9)) to recent occurrence k+1 from \u03a9(i.e., leaf k+1 of DART D, expressed symbolically as V(\u03a9)).
