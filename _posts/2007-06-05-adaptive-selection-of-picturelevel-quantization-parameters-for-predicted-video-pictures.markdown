title: Adaptive selection of picture-level quantization parameters for predicted video pictures
abstract: Techniques and tools for adaptive selection of picture quantization parameters (“QPs”) for predicted pictures are described. For example, a video encoder adaptively selects a delta QP for a B-picture based on spatial complexity, temporal complexity, whether differential quantization is active, whether the B-picture is available as a reference picture, or some combination or subset of these or other factors. The delta QP can then be used to adjust the picture QP for the B-picture (e.g., to reduce bit rate for the B-picture without appreciably reducing the perceived quality of a video sequence.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["With the increasing popularity of DVDs, music and video delivery over the Internet, and digital cameras, digital media have become commonplace. Engineers use a variety of techniques to process digital audio, video, and images efficiently while still maintaining quality. To understand these techniques, it helps to understand how the audio, video, and image information is represented and processed in a computer.","I. Representation of Media Information in a Computer","A computer processes media information as a series of numbers representing that information. For example, a single number may represent the intensity of brightness or the intensity of a color component such as red, green or blue for each elementary small region of a picture, so that the digital representation of the picture consists of one or more arrays of such numbers. Each such number may be referred to as a sample. For a color image, it is conventional to use more than one sample to represent the color of each elemental region, and typically three samples are used. The set of these samples for an elemental region may be referred to as a pixel, where the word \u201cpixel\u201d is a contraction referring to the concept of a \u201cpicture element.\u201d For example, one pixel may consist of three samples that represent the intensity of red, green and blue light necessary to represent the elemental region. Such a pixel type is referred to as an RGB pixel. Several factors affect quality of media information, including sample depth, resolution, and frame rate (for video).","Sample depth is a property normally measured in bits that indicates the range of numbers that can be used to represent a sample. When more values are possible for the sample, quality can be higher because the number can capture more subtle variations in intensity and\/or a greater range of values. Resolution generally refers to the number of samples over some duration of time (for audio) or space (for images or individual video pictures). Images with higher resolution tend to look crisper than other images and contain more discernable useful details. Frame rate is a common term for temporal resolution for video. Video with higher frame rate tends to mimic the smooth motion of natural objects better than other video, and can similarly be considered to contain more detail in the temporal dimension. For all of these factors, the tradeoff for high quality is the cost of storing and transmitting the information in terms of the bit rate necessary to represent the sample depth, resolution and frame rate, as Table 1 shows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Bit rates for different quality levels of raw video"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Resolution",{},"Bit rate"]},{"entry":["Bits per pixel","(pixels,","Frame rate","(millions"]},{"entry":["(sample depth times samples","width \u00d7","(frames per","of bits"]},{"entry":["per pixel)","height)","second)","per second)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u20028 (value 0-255,","160 \u00d7 120","7.5","1.2"]},{"entry":"monochrome)"},{"entry":["24 (value 0-255 each, RGB)","320 \u00d7 240","15","27.6"]},{"entry":["24 (value 0-255 each, RGB)","640 \u00d7 480","30","221.2"]},{"entry":["24 (value 0-255 each, RGB)","1280 \u00d7 720\u2002","60","1327.1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Despite the high bit rate necessary for storing and sending high quality video (such as HDTV), companies and consumers increasingly depend on computers to create, distribute, and play back high quality content. For this reason, engineers use compression (also called source coding or source encoding) to reduce the bit rate of digital media. Compression decreases the cost of storing and transmitting the information by converting the information into a lower bit rate form. Compression can be lossless, in which quality of the video does not suffer but decreases in bit rate are limited by the complexity of the video. Or, compression can be lossy, in which quality of the video suffers but decreases in bit rate are more dramatic. Decompression (also called decoding) reconstructs a version of the original information from the compressed form. An encoder\/decoder system is sometimes referred to as a \u201ccodec.\u201d","In general, video compression techniques include \u201cintra\u201d compression and \u201cinter\u201d or predictive compression. For video frames, intra compression techniques compress individual frames, typically called I-frames or key frames. Inter compression techniques compress frames with reference to preceding and\/or following frames, and inter-compressed frames are typically called predicted frames, P-frames, or B-frames.","II. Inter and Intra Compression in Windows Media Video, Versions 8 and 9","Microsoft Corporation's Windows Media Video, Version 8 (\u201cWMV8\u201d) includes a video encoder and a video decoder. The WMV8 encoder uses intra and inter compression, and the WMV8 decoder uses intra and inter decompression. Windows Media Video, Version 9 (\u201cWMV9\u201d) uses a similar architecture for many operations.","A. Intra Compression",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","105","115","115","115"]},"The encoder then quantizes () the DCT coefficients, resulting in an 8\u00d78 block of quantized DCT coefficients (). Quantization is lossy. Since low frequency DCT coefficients tend to have higher values, quantization typically results in loss of precision but not complete loss of the information for the coefficients. On the other hand, since high frequency DCT coefficients tend to have values of zero or close to zero, quantization of the high frequency coefficients typically results in contiguous regions of zero values. In addition, in some cases high frequency DCT coefficients are quantized more coarsely than low frequency DCT coefficients, resulting in greater loss of precision\/information for the high frequency DCT coefficients.","The encoder then prepares the 8\u00d78 block of quantized DCT coefficients () for entropy encoding, which is a form of lossless compression. The exact type of entropy encoding can vary depending on whether a coefficient is a DC coefficient (lowest frequency), an AC coefficient (other frequencies) in the top row or left column, or another AC coefficient.","The encoder encodes the DC coefficient () as a differential from the DC coefficient () of a neighboring 8\u00d78 block, which is a previously encoded neighbor (e.g., top or left) of the block being encoded. ( shows a neighbor block () that is situated to the left of the block being encoded in the frame.) The encoder entropy encodes () the differential.","The entropy encoder can encode the left column or top row of AC coefficients as a differential from a corresponding left column or top row of the neighboring 8\u00d78 block. This is an example of AC coefficient prediction.  shows the left column () of AC coefficients encoded as a differential () from the left column () of the neighboring (in reality, to the left) block (). The differential coding increases the chance that the differential coefficients have zero values. The remaining AC coefficients are from the block () of quantized DCT coefficients.","The encoder scans () the 8\u00d78 block  of quantized AC DCT coefficients into a one-dimensional array () and then entropy encodes the scanned AC coefficients using a variation of run length coding (). The encoder selects an entropy code from one or more run\/level\/last tables () and outputs the entropy code.","B. Inter Compression","Inter compression in the WMV8 encoder uses block-based motion compensated prediction coding followed by transform coding of the residual error.  illustrate the block-based inter compression for a predicted frame in the WMV8 encoder. In particular,  illustrates motion estimation for a predicted frame () and  illustrates compression of a prediction residual for a motion-compensated block of a predicted frame.","For example, in , the WMV8 encoder computes a motion vector for a macroblock () in the predicted frame (). To compute the motion vector, the encoder searches in a search area () of a reference frame (). Within the search area (), the encoder compares the macroblock () from the predicted frame () to various candidate macroblocks in order to find a candidate macroblock that is a good match. The encoder outputs information specifying the motion vector (entropy coded) for the matching macroblock. The motion vector is differentially coded with respect to a motion vector predictor. The prediction is rarely perfect, so the encoder usually encodes blocks of differences (also called the error or residual blocks) between the prediction macroblock and the macroblock () itself.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["335","335","315","325","340","335","345","350","355","360","355","365","370","375"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","410","420","410","415","420","430","425","435","445","465","455","470","465","445","475"]},"III. Lossy Compression and Quantization","The preceding section mentioned quantization, a mechanism for lossy compression, and lossless compression. Lossless compression reduces the bit rate of information by removing redundancy from the information without any reduction in fidelity. Lossless compression techniques reduce bit rate at no cost to quality, but can only reduce bit rate up to a certain point. Decreases in bit rate are limited by the inherent amount of variability in the statistical characterization of the input data, which is referred to as the source entropy.","In contrast, with lossy compression, the quality suffers somewhat but the achievable decrease in bit rate is more dramatic. Lossy compression techniques can be used to reduce bit rate more than lossless compression techniques, but some of the reduction in bit rate is achieved by reducing quality, and the lost quality cannot be completely recovered. Lossy compression is often used in conjunction with lossless compression\u2014e.g., in a system design in which lossy compression establishes an approximation of the information and lossless compression techniques are applied to represent the approximation.","According to one possible definition, quantization is a term used for an approximating non-reversible mapping function commonly used for lossy compression, in which there is a specified set of possible output values, and each member of the set of possible output values has an associated set of input values that result in the selection of that particular output value. In general, an encoder varies quantization to trade off quality and bit rate. Coarser quantization results in greater quality reduction but allows for greater bit rate reduction.","In many systems, the extent of quantization is measured in terms of quantization step size. Coarser quantization uses larger quantization step sizes, corresponding to wider ranges of input values. Finer quantization uses smaller quantization step sizes. Often, for purposes of signaling and reconstruction, quantization step sizes are parameterized as multiples of a smallest quantization step size. Quantization step sizes may be represented by quantization indexes.","Different reconstruction rules may be used to determine the reconstruction value for each quantization index. Standards and product specifications that focus only on achieving interoperability will often specify reconstruction values without necessarily specifying the classification rule. In other words, some specifications may define the functional mapping k\u2192\u03b2[k] without defining the functional mapping x\u2192A[x]. This allows a decoder built to comply with the standard\/specification to reconstruct information correctly. In contrast, encoders are often given the freedom to change the classifier in any way that they wish, while still complying with the standard\/specification.","A variety of quantization techniques have been developed, including scalar or vector, uniform or non-uniform, and adaptive or non-adaptive quantization.","A. Scalar Quantizers","According to one possible definition, a scalar quantizer is an approximating functional mapping x\u2192Q[x] of an input value x to a quantized value Q[x], sometimes called a reconstructed value.  shows a \u201cstaircase\u201d I\/O function () for a scalar quantizer. The horizontal axis is a number line for a real number input variable x, and the vertical axis indicates the corresponding quantized values Q[x]. The number line is partitioned by thresholds such as the threshold (). Each value of x within a given range between a pair of adjacent thresholds is assigned the same quantized value Q[x]. For example, each value of x within the range () is assigned the same quantized value (). (At a threshold, one of the two possible quantized values is assigned to an input x, depending on the system.) Overall, the quantized values Q[x] exhibit a discontinuous, staircase pattern. The distance the mapping continues along the number line depends on the system, typically ending after a finite number of thresholds. The placement of the thresholds on the number line may be uniformly spaced (as shown in ) or non-uniformly spaced.","A scalar quantizer can be decomposed into two distinct stages. The first stage is the classifier stage, in which a classifier function mapping x\u2192A[x] maps an input x to a quantization index A[x], which is often integer-valued. In essence, the classifier segments an input number line or data set.  shows a generalized classifier () and thresholds for a scalar quantizer. As in , a number line for a real number variable x is segmented by thresholds such as the threshold (). Each value of x within a given range such as the range () is assigned the same quantized value Q[x].  shows a numerical example of a classifier () and thresholds for a scalar quantizer.","In the second stage, a reconstructor functional mapping k\u2192\u03b2[k] maps each quantization index k to a reconstruction value \u03b2[k]. In essence, the reconstructor places steps having a particular height relative to the input number line segments (or selects a subset of data set values) for reconstruction of each region determined by the classifier. The reconstructor functional mapping may be implemented, for example, using a lookup table. Overall, the classifier relates to the reconstructor as follows:\n\nQ[x]=\u03b2[A[x]]\u2003\u2003(1).\n","In common usage, the term \u201cquantization\u201d is often used to describe the classifier stage, which is performed during encoding. The term \u201cinverse quantization\u201d is similarly used to describe the reconstructor stage, whether performed during encoding or decoding.","The distortion introduced by using such a quantizer may be computed with a difference-based distortion measure d(x\u2212Q[x]). Typically, such a distortion measure has the property that d(x\u2212Q[x]) increases as x\u2212Q[x] deviates from zero; and typically each reconstruction value lies within the range of the corresponding classification region, so that the straight line that would be formed by the functional equation Q[x]=x will pass through every step of the staircase diagram (as shown in ) and therefore Q[Q[x]] will typically be equal to Q[x]. In general, a quantizer is considered better in rate-distortion terms if the quantizer results in a lower average value of distortion than other quantizers for a given bit rate of output.","B. Dead Zone+Uniform Threshold Quantizers","A non-uniform quantizer has threshold values that are not uniformly spaced for all classifier regions. According to one possible definition, a dead zone plus uniform threshold quantizer (\u201cDZ+UTQ\u201d) is a quantizer with uniformly spaced threshold values for all classifier regions except the one containing the zero input value (which is called the dead zone). In a general sense, a DZ+UTQ is a non-uniform quantizer, since the dead zone size is different than the other classifier regions.","A DZ+UTQ has a classifier index mapping rule x\u2192A[x] that can be expressed based on two parameters.  shows a staircase I\/O function () for a DZ+UTQ, and  shows a generalized classifier () and thresholds for a DZ+UTQ. The parameter s, which is greater than 0, indicates the step size for all steps other than the dead zone. Mathematically, all sare equal to s for i\u22600. The parameter z, which is greater than or equal to 0, indicates the ratio of the dead zone size to the size of the other steps. Mathematically, s=z\u00b7s. In , z is 2, so the dead zone is twice as wide as the other classification zones. The index mapping rule x\u2192A[x] for a DZ+UTQ can be expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"A","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"x"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"sign","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mi":"max","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":",","mrow":{"mo":["\u230a","\u230b"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"x"},"mi":"s"},{"mi":"z","mn":"2"}],"mo":["-","+"],"mn":"1"}}}}}],"mo":"*"}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":"\u2514\u2022\u2518"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sign","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"+","mn":"1"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["for","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"\u2265","mn":"0"},"mo":","}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["for","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"<","mn":"0."}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIGS. 5"],"b":["850","6","6"]},"C. Perceptual Effects of Quantization","As mentioned above, lossy compression tends to cause a decrease in quality. For example, a series of ten samples of slightly different values can be approximated using quantization as ten samples with exactly the same particular approximate value.","This kind of quantization can reduce the bit rate of encoding the series of ten samples, but at the cost of lost detail in the original ten samples.","In some cases, quantization produces visible artifacts that tend to be more artificial-looking and visually distracting than simple loss of fine detail. For example, smooth, un-textured content is susceptible to contouring artifacts\u2014artifacts that appear between regions of two different quantization output values\u2014because the human visual system is sensitive to subtle variations (particularly luma differences) in smooth content.","Another perceptual effect of quantization occurs when average quantization step sizes are varied between frames in a sequence. Although the flexibility to change quantization step sizes can help control bit rate, an unpleasant \u201cflicker\u201d effect can occur when average quantization step sizes vary too much from frame to frame and the difference in quality between frames becomes noticeable. Furthermore, devoting too much bit rate to frames or regions that are not perceptually important can cause shortages in available bit rate for more important frames or regions.","V. Inverse Quantization in VC-1","VC-1 is a video codec standard that specifies certain rules for inverse uantization. The encoder sends a picture-level bitstream element, PQINDEX, to indicate a base quantization step size (also referred to herein as a quantization parameter or QP) for the picture (\u201cpicture QP\u201d). PQINDEX is present for all picture types, including I-pictures, P-pictures and B-pictures. Although VC-1 does not specify how the value of PQINDEX should be determined for different pictures, the value of PQINDEX (and, therefore, the QP for the picture) can vary for different picture types. Typically, lower QPs are used for I-pictures, and higher QPs are used for predicted pictures.","In differential quantization, the encoder varies QPs for different parts of a picture. Typically, this involves varying QPs on a macroblock level or other sub-picture level. The encoder makes decisions on how to vary the QPs, and signals those decisions, as appropriate, to a decoder. In VC-1, the encoder sends a bitstream element (DQUANT) at a syntax level above picture level to indicate differential quantization status. If DQUANT=0, the QP indicated by PQINDEX is used for all macroblocks in the picture. If DQUANT=1 or 2, different macroblocks in the same picture can use different QPs.","A VC-1 encoder can use more than one approach to differential quantization. In one approach, only two different QPs are used for a picture. This is referred to as bi-level differential quantization. For example, one QP is used for macroblocks at picture edges and another QP is used for macroblocks in the rest of the picture. This can be useful for saving bits at picture edges, where fine detail is less important for maintaining overall visual quality. Or, a 1-bit value signaled per macroblock indicates which of two available QP values to use for the macroblock. In another approach, referred to as multi-level differential quantization, a larger number of different QPs can be used for individual macroblocks in a picture.","V. Other Standards and Products","Various video standards allow the use of different quantization step sizes for different picture types, and allow variation of quantization step sizes for rate and quality control. Standards typically do not fully specify the quantizer design.","Numerous systems for adjusting quantization thresholds have been developed. Many standards and products specify reconstruction values that correspond to a typical mid-point reconstruction rule (e.g., for a typical simple classification rule) for the sake of simplicity. For classification, however, the thresholds can in fact be adjusted so that certain input values will be mapped to more common (and hence, lower bit rate) indices, which makes the reconstruction values closer to optimal.","Numerous international standards specify aspects of video decoders and formats for compressed video information. Directly or by implication, these standards also specify certain encoder details, but other encoder details are not specified. Some standards address still image compression\/decompression, and other standards address audio compression\/decompression. Numerous companies have produced encoders and decoders for audio, still images, and video. Various other kinds of signals (for example, hyperspectral imagery, graphics, text, financial information, etc.) are also commonly represented and stored or transmitted using compression techniques.","Given the critical importance of compression to digital video, it is not surprising that video compression is a richly developed field. Whatever the benefits of previous video compression techniques, however, they do not have the advantages of the following techniques and tools.","The present application describes techniques and tools for adaptive selection of picture quantization parameters (\u201cQPs\u201d) for predicted pictures. For example, a video encoder adaptively selects a delta QP for a B-picture based on spatial complexity, temporal complexity, whether differential quantization is active, whether the B-picture is available as a reference picture, or some combination or subset of these or other factors. The delta QP can then be used to adjust the picture QP for the B-picture (e.g., to reduce bit rate for the B-picture without appreciably reducing the perceived quality of a video sequence).","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.","The present application relates to techniques and tools for efficient compression of video.

For the sake of presentation,  shows a path for key pictures through the encoder system () and a path for predicted pictures. Many of the components of the encoder system () are used for compressing both key pictures and predicted pictures. The exact operations performed by those components can vary depending on the type of information being compressed.","A predicted picture (e.g., progressive P-frame or B-frame, interlaced P-field or B-field, or interlaced P-frame or B-frame) is represented in terms of prediction (or difference) from one or more other pictures (which are typically referred to as reference pictures or anchors). A prediction residual is the difference between what was predicted and the original picture. In contrast, a key picture (e.g., progressive I-frame, interlaced I-field, or interlaced I-frame) is compressed without reference to other pictures.","If the current picture () is a predicted picture, a motion estimator () estimates motion of macroblocks or other sets of samples of the current picture () with respect to one or more reference pictures, for example, the reconstructed previous picture () buffered in the picture store (). If the current picture () is a bi-predictive picture, a motion estimator () estimates motion in the current picture () with respect to up to four reconstructed reference pictures (for an interlaced B-field, for example). Typically, a motion estimator estimates motion in a B-picture with respect to one or more temporally previous reference pictures and one or more temporally future reference pictures, but B-pictures need not be predicted from different temporal directions. The encoder system () can use the separate stores (, ) for multiple reference pictures.","The motion estimator () can estimate motion by full-sample, \u00bd-sample, \u00bc-sample, or other increments, and can switch the precision of the motion estimation on a picture-by-picture basis or other basis. The motion estimator () (and compensator ()) also can switch between types of reference picture sample interpolation (e.g., between bicubic and bilinear) on a per-frame or other basis. The precision of the motion estimation can be the same or different horizontally and vertically. The motion estimator () outputs as side information motion information () such as differential motion vector information. The encoder () encodes the motion information () by, for example, computing one or more predictors for motion vectors, computing differentials between the motion vectors and predictors, and entropy coding the differentials. To reconstruct a motion vector, a motion compensator () combines a predictor with differential motion vector information.","The motion compensator () applies the reconstructed motion vector to the reconstructed picture(s) () to form a motion-compensated current picture (). The prediction is rarely perfect, however, and the difference between the motion-compensated current picture () and the original current picture () is the prediction residual (). During later reconstruction of the picture, the prediction residual () is added to the motion compensated current picture () to obtain a reconstructed picture that is closer to the original current picture (). In lossy compression, however, some information is still lost from the original current picture (). Alternatively, a motion estimator and motion compensator apply another type of motion estimation\/compensation.","A frequency transformer () converts the spatial domain video information into frequency domain (i.e., spectral) data. For block-based video pictures, the frequency transformer () applies a DCT, variant of DCT, or other block transform to blocks of the sample data or prediction residual data, producing blocks of frequency transform coefficients. Alternatively, the frequency transformer () applies another conventional frequency transform such as a Fourier transform or uses wavelet or sub-band analysis. The frequency transformer () may apply an 8\u00d78, 8\u00d74, 4\u00d78, 4\u00d74 or other size frequency transform.","A quantizer () then quantizes the blocks of spectral data coefficients. The quantizer applies uniform, scalar quantization to the spectral data with a step-size that varies on a picture-by-picture basis or other basis (e.g., a macroblock-by-macroblock basis). Alternatively, the quantizer applies another type of quantization to the spectral data coefficients, for example, a non-uniform, vector, or non-adaptive quantization, or directly quantizes spatial domain data in an encoder system that does not use frequency transformations. Techniques and tools relating to quantization in some implementations are described in detail below.","In addition to adaptive quantization, the encoder () can use frame dropping, adaptive filtering, or other techniques for rate control.","When a reconstructed current picture is needed for subsequent motion estimation\/compensation, an inverse quantizer () performs inverse quantization on the quantized spectral data coefficients. An inverse frequency transformer () then performs the inverse of the operations of the frequency transformer (), producing a reconstructed prediction residual (for a predicted picture) or a reconstructed key picture. If the current picture () was a key picture, the reconstructed key picture is taken as the reconstructed current picture (not shown). If the current picture () was a predicted picture, the reconstructed prediction residual is added to the motion-compensated current picture () to form the reconstructed current picture. One or both of the picture stores (, ) buffers the reconstructed current picture for use in motion compensated prediction. In some embodiments, the encoder applies a de-blocking filter to the reconstructed frame to adaptively smooth discontinuities and other artifacts in the picture.","The entropy coder () compresses the output of the quantizer () as well as certain side information (e.g., motion information (), quantization step size (QP)). Typical entropy coding techniques include arithmetic coding, differential coding, Huffman coding, run length coding, LZ coding, dictionary coding, and combinations of the above. The entropy coder () typically uses different coding techniques for different kinds of information (e.g., DC coefficients, AC coefficients, different kinds of side information), and can choose from among multiple code tables within a particular coding technique. The encoder () may use special signaling for a skipped macroblock, which is a macroblock that has no information of certain types (e.g., no differential motion vectors for the macroblock and no residual information).","The entropy coder () provides compressed video information () to the buffer (). A buffer level indicator may be fed back to a controller. Before or after the buffer (), the compressed video information () can be channel coded for transmission over the network. The channel coding can apply error detection and correction data to the compressed video information ().","A controller (not shown) receives inputs from various modules such as the motion estimator (), frequency transformer (), quantizer (), inverse quantizer (), entropy coder (), and buffer (). The controller evaluates intermediate results during encoding, for example, estimating distortion and performing other rate-distortion analysis. The controller works with modules such as the motion estimator (), frequency transformer (), quantizer (), and entropy coder () to set and change coding parameters during encoding. When an encoder evaluates different coding parameter choices during encoding, the encoder may iteratively perform certain stages (e.g., quantization and inverse quantization) to evaluate different parameter settings. The encoder may set parameters at one stage before proceeding to the next stage. Or, the encoder may jointly evaluate different coding parameters. The tree of coding parameter decisions to be evaluated, and the timing of corresponding encoding, depends on implementation.","The encoder () may include one or more modules for using regions of interest to adjust encoder settings. For example, the encoder can allow a user to preview video after quantization or other encoding stages and draw regions of interest to indicate areas for quality adjustment. Alternatively, region-of-interest adjustments can be made after the encoder () outputs encoded video.","The relationships shown between modules within the encoder () indicate general flows of information in the encoder; other relationships are not shown for the sake of simplicity. In particular,  usually does not show side information indicating the encoder settings, modes, tables, etc. used for a video sequence, picture, macroblock, block, etc. Such side information, once finalized, is sent in the output bitstream, typically after entropy encoding of the side information.","Particular embodiments of video encoders typically use a variation or supplemented version of the generalized encoder (). Depending on implementation and the type of compression desired, modules of the encoder can be added, omitted, split into multiple modules, combined with other modules, and\/or replaced with like modules. For example, the controller can be split into multiple controller modules associated with different modules of the encoder. In alternative embodiments, encoders with different modules and\/or other configurations of modules perform one or more of the described techniques.","III. Multiple Pass Encoding and Complexity Analysis","Multiple-pass video encoders generally perform a first encoding on video data in order to determine statistics about the video data. By using information gained during a first-pass analysis, multiple-pass encoding systems are able to perform processing and encoding that is more accurately directed toward the particular nature of the video being encoded. This tuning of the process can result in an encoded video stream that either has a lower bit rate, fewer visible artifacts, or both, at a cost of increased processing time (compared to single-pass encoding) on the encoder side.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 10"],"b":["1200","1210","1220","1225","1220","1000","1200","1225","1220","1230","1240","1230","1210","1240","1250","1220","1230","1250"]},"Video complexity can be measured, for example, in terms of spatial complexity and temporal complexity. Spatial complexity generally refers to the amount of busyness or detailed texture in a picture or group of pictures.

The quantization value and frame size for the I-picture are multiplied () and this product is set () as the spatial complexity parameter for the group of pictures. Thus, in this example, for a quantization value and frame size for the I-picture (QVand Size, respectively), a spatial complexity parameter (C) used for every frame in the group of pictures is calculated as follows:\n\n\u00d7Size\u2003\u2003(4).\n\nAlternatively, one or both of the quantization value and frame size may be scaled up or down or otherwise adjusted before calculating a spatial complexity parameter.

For example, an encoding system can use complexity parameters to adjust quantization, such as by adjusting quantization dead zones or selecting delta QPs for P-pictures or B-pictures based at least in part on the complexity parameters, as described below.","IV. Techniques and Tools for Adaptive Quantization for Predicted Pictures","Under one possible measure of video quality, video encoders aim to achieve a desired quality level over entire video sequences, rather than focusing solely on the quality of individual pictures. To help maintain quality over sequences of pictures, it is important for encoders to make good decisions as to how many bits to use on particular pictures of different types. A poor bit allocation scheme may cause an encoder to use too many bits encoding some pictures and not enough bits encoding others.","In general, the quality of reference pictures in a sequence directly affects the quality of the entire sequence. Therefore, it is important for encoders to allocate enough bits for I-pictures and P-pictures to maintain high quality because I-pictures and P-pictures are often used as motion compensation references for other pictures. Encoding artifacts that appear in individual I-pictures and P-pictures are likely to be propagated to other pictures, but this is not the case for B-pictures that are not used as reference pictures.","When encoding video, overall coding quality can be improved if fewer bits are allocated to B-pictures than to I-pictures and P-pictures. Unlike I-pictures and P-pictures, B-pictures are generally not used as reference pictures for other pictures in motion compensation. For this reason, slightly reducing the quality of B-pictures (e.g., by increasing a quantization step size) will not affect the quality of other frames. In addition, quality gains from spending more bits encoding B-pictures (e.g., by using smaller quantization step sizes) are generally not as significant as quality gains from spending those bits encoding I-pictures and P-pictures. Therefore, quality often can be improved by saving bits in B-pictures and using the saved bits to improve the quality of I-pictures and P-pictures.","Restrictions on frequency of B-pictures can make quality loss in B-pictures even less noticeable. For example, when consecutive progressive B-frames (in display order) are not allowed in a sequence, individual progressive B-frames will be displayed between two reference frames. If the reference frames are coded with good quality and the motion between the frames can be accurately predicted, the progressive B-frame will likely be perceived as a good quality frame even if it is coded with a higher QP than the reference frames. Even if the higher QP reduces the quality of the B-frame, it is likely that the reduction in quality will not be noticeable because of the quality of motion-compensated prediction and\/or because human eyes tend to average the picture quality temporally. An isolated lower-quality frame generally will not affect users' overall viewing experience when the video is played in real-time.","A. Adjusting Picture QPs for Predicted Pictures (Adaptive Delta QP)","An encoder can make various kinds of adjustments to B-pictures to maintain quality in video sequences while keeping bit rate relatively low. For example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/400,744, filed Apr. 7, 2006, describes a rate control scheme for B-pictures that combines quantization step size control with adaptive dead zone control. Another way to adjust B-pictures to maintain quality in video sequences while keeping bit rate relatively low is to adjust a difference (sometimes referred to as a \u201cdelta QP\u201d) between a picture QP for a B-picture and a picture QP for an I-picture.","As mentioned above, an isolated lower-quality frame generally will not affect users' overall viewing experience over a sequence of frames. Based on this idea, techniques and tools for adaptively adjusting picture QPs for predicted pictures (e.g., B-pictures) to help achieve better bit allocation are described. For example, an encoder can implement one or more of the following features:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0130"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 10","FIG. 12"],"b":["1700","1000","1000","1200","1700"]},"Referring again to , the encoder selects () a picture type for a current predicted picture. The encoder can use various criteria for selecting picture types, although the encoder may have to follow certain rules for selecting picture types in order to be compliant with a decoder. In this example, the encoder encodes predicted pictures as P-pictures or B-pictures.","The encoder selects () an initial QP for the current picture based at least in part upon the selected picture type. Typically, initial picture QPs for predicted pictures such as B-pictures will be higher than initial QPs for I-pictures. Then, the encoder adaptively selects () a delta QP for the current predicted picture. For example, the encoder adaptively selects a delta QP for a B-picture based on spatial complexity, temporal complexity, differential quantization status, and\/or other factors. The encoder also can adjust quantization for the current picture in other ways, such as by selecting a larger or smaller dead zone, or switching between a uniform quantizer and non-uniform quantizer.","The encoder quantizes () data for the current picture based on the selected delta QP. For example, the encoder uses an adjusted QP determined by adjusting the initial QP for the picture by the delta QP for the picture. The encoder can then process () other pictures.","1. Example Delta Qp Factors","For example, assume QPis the QP selected by an encoder's rate controller module for a B-picture. An adjusted picture QP for a B-picture (QP) can be calculated by adding a delta QP (\u0394QP) to QP:\n\n\u2003\u2003(7).\n\n\u0394QP can be determined adaptively based on several factors. Generally, one possible factor to be considered when determining \u0394QP is scene complexity. When scene complexity is low, a bigger QP generally can be used for B-pictures in the scene without causing noticeable artifacts.\n","As mentioned above, a delta QP can be selected based on many different factors, including spatial complexity, temporal complexity, differential quantization (i.e., whether quantization step sizes vary between macroblocks in the picture), and whether the picture will be used as reference. In some cases, it may be desirable to take all of these factors into consideration. In other cases, some subset of these factors and\/or other factors can be considered.","Spatial Complexity","Spatial complexity can be measured by performing pre-encoding analysis of a picture or group of pictures. For example, spatial complexity can be measured based on a texture analysis of a picture or group of pictures. Texture analysis can include determining whether high-textured, smooth, or sharp-edge features are present. In the case of two-pass encoding, spatial complexity may be calculated from first-pass encoding results using various techniques such as the technique () shown in . Spatial complexity is typically considered to be high in high-texture pictures, for which the delta QP will usually be lower than for low-texture pictures. Spatial complexity is typically considered to be low in low-texture pictures, for which the delta QP will usually be higher than for high-texture pictures.","Temporal Complexity","Temporal complexity also can be measured by performing pre-encoding analysis of a picture or group of pictures. For example, temporal complexity can be measured based on a fast motion search on down-sampled frames. In the case of two-pass encoding, temporal complexity may be calculated from first-pass encoding results using various techniques such as the technique () shown in . Temporal complexity is typically considered to be high in high-motion pictures (or other pictures where change over time is significant), for which the delta QP will usually be lower than for low temporal complexity pictures.","Differential Quantization","Differential quantization is a within-frame macroblock quantization scheme in which the encoder chooses different QPs for different macroblocks in the same picture, which can help to reduce visible artifacts. For example, a lower QP may be chosen for macroblocks in smooth regions where quantization artifacts are more likely to be perceived. In this case, an encoder can increase a delta QP for the picture since differential quantization will still tend to result in a lower QP in regions that are likely to cause visible artifacts.","Reference Picture Status","Reference picture status for a current picture (i.e., whether or not the current picture can be used as a reference picture) is usually determined based on picture type. In one implementation, progressive B-frames and interlaced B-frames are not used as reference pictures, while B-fields can be used as reference pictures: specifically, the first B-field to be decoded in a frame having two B-fields is available for use as a reference for the second field to be decoded in the frame. Typically, a delta QP for a picture of a type that will not be used as a reference picture will be higher than a delta QP for a picture of a type that will potentially be used as a reference picture.","2. Example B-field Delta Qp Decision","In the following example, an encoder makes a delta QP decision for a B-field by looking at temporal complexity, differential quantization status, and whether the current B-field will be used as a reference picture for the other field in the frame. In this example, spatial complexity is not separately considered, although spatial characteristics may affect temporal complexity for some temporal complexity measures. Specifically, in this example, AQP is calculated as follows:\n\n\u0394\u2003\u2003(8).\n","The value represented by dis derived from a measure of temporal complexity, as shown in Equation 9, below.
