title: Adaptive recommendation explanations
abstract: A method and system for generating adaptive explanations for associated recommendations is disclosed. The adaptive explanations comprise a syntactical structure and associated phrases that are selected in accordance with usage behaviors and/or inferences associated with usage behaviors. The phrases included in an adaptive explanation may be selected through application of a non-deterministic process. The adaptive explanations may be beneficially applied to recommendations that are associated with content, products, and people, including recommendations that comprise advertisements.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0002","num":"0001"},"delete-start":{},"delete-end":{},"insert-start":{},"insert-end":{}},"This invention relates to methods and systems for computer-based generation and adaptation of communications to users over time based on usage behaviors.","Computer-based applications in which the user interface includes communications to the user in a natural language (e.g., English) format have traditionally been non-adaptive\u2014that is, the perceived \u201cpersonality\u201d of the computer-based application as represented by its communications to the user does not automatically adapt itself to the user over time, based on the user's interactions with the computer-based application. The inability of a computer-based personality to adapt over time also forecloses the possibility of the computer-based personality exhibiting the capability of communicating to a user a sense of introspection and self-awareness with regard to changes in its personality over time, and also limits the effectiveness in conveying a sense of awareness to a user of changes in the behaviors of a user over time. Such static personality approaches of the prior art therefore significantly limit how engaging a computer-based application's user interface can be. Thus there is a need for computer-based personalities that can adapt to one or more users over time and thereby provide users with the experience of receiving more intelligent and even human-like communications from the system.","In accordance with the embodiments described herein, a method and system for adaptive computer-based personalities, including adaptive explanations associated with computer-generated recommendations, is disclosed that addresses the shortcomings of prior art approaches. The present invention may apply features of adaptive recombinant systems as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/419,554 entitled \u201cAdaptive Self-Modifying and Recombinant Systems\u201d on May 22, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Other features and embodiments will become apparent from the following description, from the drawings, and from the claims.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.","A method and system for adapting computer-based personalities, including adaptive explanations associated with recommendations, as manifested through textual or audio communications, is disclosed. In some embodiments, a computer-based adaptive communication comprises one or more phrases that are automatically selected by a computer-based system, at least in part, through non-deterministic means. The frequency distribution of the plurality of potential phrases for selection in a potential adaptive communication is updated based on behaviors of the one or more recipients of a previous communication. Thus, the probabilistic selection of phrases included in the adaptive communications, and hence the \u201cpersonality\u201d of the computer-based system, is influenced by prior usage behaviors. In some embodiments, the computer-based personality may also exhibit \u201cself-awareness\u201d by monitoring changes in phrase frequency distributions over time, and including in its adaptive communications appropriate self-aware phraseology based on an evaluation of the changes in phrase frequency distributions. Awareness phrases associated with changes in user behavior over time may also be expressed in the adaptive communications in some embodiments.","Adaptive System","In some embodiments, the present invention may apply the methods and systems of an adaptive system as depicted by .  is a generalized depiction of an adaptive system , according to some embodiments. The adaptive system  includes three aspects: 1) a structural aspect , a usage aspect , and a content aspect . One or more users  interact with the adaptive system . An adaptive recommendations function  may produce adaptive recommendations , based upon the user interactions that are either delivered to the user  or applied to the adaptive system .","As used herein, one or more users  may be a single user or multiple users. As shown in , the one or more users  may receive the adaptive recommendations . Non-users  of the adaptive system  may also receive adaptive recommendations  from the adaptive system .","A user  may be a human entity, a computer system, or a second adaptive system (distinct from the adaptive system ) that interacts with, or otherwise uses the adaptive system. The one or more users  may include non-human users of the adaptive system . In particular, one or more other adaptive systems may serve as virtual system \u201cusers.\u201d These other adaptive systems may operate in accordance with the architecture of the adaptive system . Thus, multiple adaptive systems may be mutual users for one another.","It should be understood that the structural aspect , the content aspect , the usage aspect , and the recommendations function  of the adaptive system , and elements of each, may be contained within one computer, or distributed among multiple computers. Furthermore, one or more non-adaptive systems may be modified to become one or more adaptive systems  by integrating the usage aspect  and the recommendations function  with the one or more non-adaptive systems.","The term \u201ccomputer system\u201d or the term \u201csystem,\u201d without further qualification, as used herein, will be understood to mean either a non-adaptive or an adaptive system. Likewise, the terms \u201csystem structure\u201d or \u201csystem content,\u201d as used herein, will be understood to refer to the structural aspect  and the content aspect , respectively, whether associated with a non-adaptive system or the adaptive system . The term \u201csystem structural subset\u201d or \u201cstructural subset,\u201d as used herein, will be understood to mean a portion or subset of the structural aspect  of a system.","Structural Aspect","The structural aspect  of the adaptive system  is depicted in the block diagram of . The structural aspect  comprises a collection of system objects  that are part of the adaptive system , as well as the relationships among the objects . The relationships among objects  may be persistent across user sessions, or may be transient in nature. The objects  may include or reference items of content, such as text, graphics, audio, video, interactive content, or embody any other type or item of information. The objects  may also include references to content, such as pointers. Computer applications, executable code, or references to computer applications may also be stored as objects  in the adaptive system . The content of the objects  is known herein as information . The information , though part of the object , is also considered part of the content aspect , as depicted in , and described below.","The objects  may be managed in a relational database, or may be maintained in structures such as flat files, linked lists, inverted lists, hypertext networks, or object-oriented databases. The objects  may include meta-information  associated with the information  contained within, or referenced by the objects .","As an example, in some embodiments, the World-wide Web could be considered a structural aspect, where web pages constitute the objects of the structural aspect and links between web pages constitute the relationships among the objects. Alternatively, or in addition, in some embodiments, the structural aspect could be comprised of objects associated with an object-oriented programming language, and the relationships between the objects associated with the protocols and methods associated with interaction and communication among the objects in accordance with the object-oriented programming language.","The one or more users  of the adaptive system  may be explicitly represented as objects  within the system , therefore becoming directly incorporated within the structural aspect . The relationships among objects  may be arranged in a hierarchical structure, a relational structure (e.g. according to a relational database structure), or according to a network structure.","Content Aspect","The content aspect  of the adaptive system  is depicted in the block diagram of . The content aspect  comprises the information  contained in, or referenced by the objects  that are part of the structural aspect . The content aspect  of the objects  may include text, graphics, audio, video, and interactive forms of content, such as applets, tutorials, courses, demonstrations, modules, or sections of executable code or computer programs. The one or more users  interact with the content aspect .","The content aspect  may be updated based on the usage aspect , as well as associated metrics. To achieve this, the adaptive system  may employ the usage aspect of other systems. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, other computer systems, other networks, such as the World Wide Web, multiple computers within an organization, other adaptive systems, or other adaptive recombinant systems. In this manner, the content aspect  benefits from usage occurring in other environments.","Usage Aspect","The usage aspect  of the adaptive system  is depicted in the block diagram of , although it should be understood that the usage aspect  may also exist independently of adaptive system  in some embodiments. The usage aspect  denotes captured usage information , further identified as usage behaviors , and usage behavior pre-processing . The usage aspect  thus reflects the tracking, storing, categorization, and clustering of the use and associated usage behaviors of the one or more users  interacting with the adaptive system .","The captured usage information , known also as system usage or system use , includes any user behavior  exhibited by the one or more users  while using the system. The adaptive system  tracks and stores user key strokes and mouse clicks, for example, as well as the time period in which these interactions occurred (e.g., timestamps), as captured usage information . From this captured usage information , the adaptive system  identifies usage behaviors  of the one or more users  (e.g., web page access or email transmission). Finally, the usage aspect  includes usage-behavior pre-processing, in which usage behavior categories , usage behavior clusters , and usage behavioral patterns  are formulated for subsequent processing of the usage behaviors  by the adaptive system . Some usage behaviors  identified by the adaptive system , as well as usage behavior categories  designated by the adaptive system , are listed in Table 1, and described in more detail, below.","The usage behavior categories , usage behaviors clusters , and usage behavior patterns  may be interpreted with respect to a single user , or to multiple users , in which the multiple users may be described herein as a community, an affinity group, or a user segment. These terms are used interchangeably herein. A community is a collection of one or more users, and may include what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccommunity of interest.\u201d A sub-community is also a collection of one or more users, in which members of the sub-community include a portion of the users in a previously defined community. Communities, affinity groups, and user segments are described in more detail, below.","Usage behavior categories  include types of usage behaviors , such as accesses, referrals to other users, collaboration with other users, and so on. These categories and more are included in Table 1, below. Usage behavior clusters  are groupings of one or more usage behaviors , either within a particular usage behavior category  or across two or more usage categories. The usage behavior pre-processing  may also determine new \u201cclusterings\u201d of user behaviors  in previously undefined usage behavior categories , across categories, or among new communities. Usage behavior patterns , also known as \u201cusage behavioral patterns\u201d or \u201cbehavioral patterns,\u201d are also groupings of usage behaviors  across usage behavior categories . Usage behavior patterns  are generated from one or more filtered clusters of captured usage information .","The usage behavior patterns  may also capture and organize captured usage information  to retain temporal information associated with usage behaviors . Such temporal information may include the duration or timing of the usage behaviors , such as those associated with reading or writing of written or graphical material, oral communications, including listening and talking, or physical location of the user . The usage behavioral patterns  may include segmentations and categorizations of usage behaviors  corresponding to a single user of the one or more users  or according to multiple users  (e.g., communities or affinity groups). The communities or affinity groups may be previously established, or may be generated during usage behavior pre-processing  based on inferred usage behavior affinities or clustering. Usage behaviors  may also be derived from the use or explicit preferences  associated with other adaptive or non-adaptive systems.","Adaptive Recommendations","As shown in , the adaptive system  generates adaptive recommendations  using the adaptive recommendations function . The adaptive recommendations , or suggestions, enable users to more effectively use and navigate through the adaptive system .","The adaptive recommendations  are presented as structural subsets of the structural aspect . The adaptive recommendations  may be in the context of a currently conducted activity of the system , a currently accessed object , or a communication with another user . The adaptive recommendations  may also be in the context of a historical path of executed system activities, accessed objects , or communications during a specific user session or across user sessions. The adaptive recommendations  may be without context of a current activity, currently accessed object , current session path, or historical session paths. Adaptive recommendations  may also be generated in response to direct user requests or queries, including search requests. Such user requests may be in the context of a current system navigation, access or activity, or may be outside of any such context. The adaptive recommendations  may comprise advertising content.","Fuzzy Content Network","In some embodiments, the structural aspect  of the adaptive system , comprises a fuzzy content network. A fuzzy content network  is depicted in .","The fuzzy content network , including content sub-networks a, b, and c. The content network  includes \u201ccontent,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d or \u201cinformation,\u201d packaged in modules known as objects .","The content network  discretizes information as \u201cobjects.\u201d In contrast to typical procedural computer programming structures, objects are defined at a higher level of abstraction. This level of abstraction allows for powerful, yet simple, software architectures.","One benefit to organizing information as objects is known as encapsulation. An object is encapsulated when only essential elements of interaction with other objects are revealed. Details about how the object works internally may be hidden. In , for example, the object  includes meta-information  and information . The object  thus encapsulates information .","Another benefit to organizing information as objects is known as inheritance. The encapsulation of , for example, may form discrete object classes, with particular characteristics ascribed to each object class. A newly defined object class may inherit some of the characteristics of a parent class. Both encapsulation and inheritance enable a rich set of relationships between objects that may be effectively managed as the number of individual objects and associated object classes grows.","In the content network , the objects  may be either topic objects t or content objects c, as depicted in , respectively. Topic objects t are encapsulations that contain meta-information t and relationships to other objects (not shown), but do not contain an embedded pointer to reference associated information. The topic object t thus essentially operates as a \u201clabel\u201d to a class of information. The topic object  therefore just refers to \u201citself\u201d and the network of relationships it has with other objects .","Content objects c, as shown in , are encapsulations that contain meta-information c and relationships to other objects  (not shown). Additionally, content objects c may include either an embedded pointer to information or the information  itself (hereinafter, \u201cinformation \u201d).","The referenced information  may include files, text, documents, articles, images, audio, video, multi-media, software applications and electronic or magnetic media or signals. Where the content object c supplies a pointer to information, the pointer may be a memory address. Where the content network  encapsulates information on the Internet, the pointer may be a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).","The meta-information  supplies a summary or abstract of the object . So, for example, the meta-information t for the topic object t may include a high-level description of the topic being managed. Examples of meta-information t include a title, a sub-title, one or more descriptions of the topic provided at different levels of detail, the publisher of the topic meta-information, the date the topic object t was created, and subjective attributes such as the quality, and attributes based on user feedback associated with the referenced information. Meta-information may also include a pointer to referenced information, such as a uniform resource locator (URL), in one embodiment.","The meta-information c for the content object c may include relevant keywords associated with the information , a summary of the information , and so on. The meta-information c may supply a \u201cfirst look\u201d at the objects c. The meta-information c may include a title, a sub-title, a description of the information , the author of the information , the publisher of the information , the publisher of the meta-information c, and the date the content object c was created, as examples. As with the topic object t, meta-information for the content object c may also include a pointer.","In , the content sub-network a is expanded, such that both content objects c and topic objects t are visible. The various objects  of the content network  are interrelated by degrees, using relationships  (unidirectional and bidirectional arrows) and relationship indicators  (values). Each object  may be related to any other object , and may be related by a relationship indicator , as shown. Thus, while information  is encapsulated in the objects , the information  is also interrelated to other information  by a degree manifested by the relationship indicators .","The relationship indicator  is a numerical indicator of the relationship between objects . Thus, for example, the relationship indicator  may be normalized to between 0 and 1, inclusive, where 0 indicates no relationship, and 1 indicates a subset relationship. Or, the relationship indicators  may be expressed using subjective descriptors that depict the \u201cquality\u201d of the relationship. For example, subjective descriptors \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d and \u201clow\u201d may indicate a relationship between two objects .","The relationship  between objects  may be bidirectional, as indicated by the double-pointing arrows. Each double-pointing arrow includes two relationship indicators , one for each \u201cdirection\u201d of the relationships between the objects .","As  indicates, the relationships  between any two objects  need not be symmetrical. That is, topic object t has a relationship of \u201c0.3\u201d with content object c, while content object c has a relationship of \u201c0.5\u201d with topic object t. Furthermore, the relationships  need not be bi-directional\u2014they may be in one direction only. This could be designated by a directed arrow, or by simply setting one relationship indicator  of a bi-directional arrow to \u201c0,\u201d the null relationship value.","The content networks A, B, C may be related to one another using relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators . For example, in , content sub-network a is related to content sub-network b and content sub-network c, using relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators . Likewise, content sub-network b is related to content sub-network a and content sub-network c using relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators .","Individual content and topic objects  within a selected content sub-network a may be related to individual content and topic objects  in another content sub-network b. Further, multiple sets of relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators  may be defined between two objects .","For example, a first set of relationships  and associated relationship indicators  may be used for a first purpose or be available to a first set of users while a second set of relationships  and associated relationship indicators  may be used for a second purpose or available to a second set of users. For example, in , topic object t is bi-directionally related to topic object t, not once, but twice, as indicated by the two double arrows. An indefinite number of relationships  and associated relationship indicators  may therefore exist between any two objects  in the fuzzy content network . The multiple relationships  may correspond to distinct relationship types. For example, a relationship type might be the degree an object  supports the thesis of a second object , while another relationship type might be the degree an object  disconfirms the thesis of a second object . The content network  may thus be customized for various purposes and accessible to different user groups in distinct ways simultaneously.","The relationships among objects  in the content network , as well as the relationships between content networks a and b, may be modeled after fuzzy set theory. Each object , for example, may be considered a fuzzy set with respect to all other objects , which are also considered fuzzy sets. The relationships among objects  are the degrees to which each object  belongs to the fuzzy set represented by any other object . Although not essential, every object  in the content network  may conceivably have a relationship with every other object .","The topic objects t encompass, and are labels for, very broad fuzzy sets of the content network . The topic objects t thus may be labels for the fuzzy set, and the fuzzy set may include relationships to other topic objects t as well as related content objects c. Content objects c, in contrast, typically refer to a narrower domain of information in the content network .","The adaptive system  of  may operate in a fuzzy content network environment, such as the one depicted in . In , an adaptive system D includes a structural aspect D that is a fuzzy content network. Thus, adaptive recommendations  generated by the adaptive system D are also structural subsets that are themselves fuzzy content networks.","User Behavior and Usage Framework",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1000","920","925","925","100","1000","925","1002","925","925","1006","1008","1010"]},"Memberships in the communities are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as depicted by the overlaps of the sub-community A usage patterns , sub-community B usage patterns , and sub-community C usage patterns  (as well as and the individual usage patterns ) in the usage framework . Recall that a community may include a single user or multiple users. Sub-communities may likewise include one or more users. Thus, the individual usage patterns  in  may also be described as representing the usage patterns of a community or a sub-community. For the one or more computer-based systems , usage behavior patterns may be segmented among communities and individuals so as to effectively enable adaptive communications c delivery for each sub-community or individual.","The communities identified by the one or more computer-based systems  may be determined through self-selection, through explicit designation by other users or external administrators (e.g., designation of certain users as \u201cexperts\u201d), or through automatic determination by the one or more computer-based systems . The communities themselves may have relationships between each other, of multiple types and values. In addition, a community may be composed not of human users, or solely of human users, but instead may include one or more other computer-based systems, which may have reason to interact with the one or more computer-based systems . Or, such computer-based systems may provide an input into the one or more computer-based systems , such as by being the output from a search engine. The interacting computer-based system may be another instance of the one or more computer-based systems .","The usage behaviors  included in Table 1 may be categorized by the one or more computer-based systems  according to the usage framework  of . For example, categories of usage behavior may be captured and categorized according to the entire community usage patterns , sub-community usage patterns , and individual usage patterns . The corresponding usage behavior information may be used to infer preferences and\/or intentions and interests at each of the user levels.","Multiple usage behavior categories shown in Table 1 may be used by the one or more computer-based systems  to make reliable inferences of the preferences and\/or intentions and\/or intentions of a user with regard to elements, objects, or items of content associated with the one or more computer-based systems . There are likely to be different preference inferencing results for different users.","As shown in , the one or more computer-based systems  delivers adaptive communications to the user . These adaptive communications c may include adaptive recommendations  or associated explanations for the recommendations, or may be other types of communications to the user , including advertising. In some embodiments the adaptive communications c comprise one or more phrases, where phrases comprise one or more words. The adaptive communications c may be delivered to the user  in a written form, an audio form, or a combination of these forms.","By introducing different or additional behavioral characteristics, such as the duration of access of an item of content a more adaptive communication c is enabled. For example, duration of access will generally be much less correlated with navigational proximity than access sequences will be, and therefore provide a better indicator of true user preferences and\/or intentions and\/or intentions. Therefore, combining access sequences and access duration will generally provide better inferences and associated system structural updates than using either usage behavior alone. Effectively utilizing additional usage behaviors as described above will generally enable increasingly effective system structural updating. In addition, the one or more computer-based systems  may employ user affinity groups to enable even more effective system structural updating than are available merely by applying either individual (personal) usage behaviors or entire community usage behaviors.","Furthermore, relying on only one or a limited set of usage behavioral cues and signals may more easily enable potential \u201cspoofing\u201d or \u201cgaming\u201d of the one or more computer-based systems . \u201cSpoofing\u201d or \u201cgaming\u201d the one or more computer-based systems  refers to conducting consciously insincere or otherwise intentional usage behaviors , so as to influence the costs of advertisements  of the one or more computer-based systems . Utilizing broader sets of system usage behavioral cues and signals may lessen the effects of spoofing or gaming. One or more algorithms may be employed by the one or more computer-based systems  to detect such contrived usage behaviors, and when detected, such behaviors may be compensated for by the preference and interest inferencing algorithms of the one or more computer-based systems .","In some embodiments, the one or more computer-based systems  may provide users  with a means to limit the tracking, storing, or application of their usage behaviors . A variety of limitation variables may be selected by the user . For example, a user  may be able to limit usage behavior tracking, storing, or application by usage behavior category described in Table 1. Alternatively, or in addition, the selected limitation may be specified to apply only to particular user communities or individual users . For example, a user  may restrict the application of the full set of her usage behaviors  to preference or interest inferences by one or more computer-based systems  for application to only herself, and make a subset of process behaviors  available for application to users only within her workgroup, but allow none of her process usage behaviors to be applied by the one or more computer-based systems  in making inferences of preferences and\/or intentions and\/or intentions or interests for other users.","User Communities","As described above, a user associated with one or more systems  may be a member of one or more communities of interest, or affinity groups, with a potentially varying degree of affinity associated with the respective communities. These affinities may change over time as interests of the user  and communities evolve over time. The affinities or relationships among users and communities may be categorized into specific types. An identified user  may be considered a member of a special sub-community containing only one member, the member being the identified user. A user can therefore be thought of as just a specific case of the more general notion of user or user segments, communities, or affinity groups.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["925","920","1050","1050","1064","1062","1069","1065","1070","1063","1050"]},"Sub-community B  is a community that has many relationships or affinities to other communities. These relationships may be of different types and differing degrees of relevance or affinity. For example, a first relationship  between sub-community B  and sub-community D  may be of one type, and a second relationship  may be of a second type. (In , the first relationship  is depicted using a double-pointing arrow, while the second relationship  is depicted using a unidirectional arrow.)","The relationships  and  may be directionally distinct, and may have an indicator of relationship or affinity associated with each distinct direction of affinity or relationship. For example, the first relationship  has a numerical value , or relationship value, of \u201c0.8.\u201d The relationship value  thus describes the first relationship  between sub-community B  and sub-community D  as having a value of 0.8.","The relationship value may be scaled as in  (e.g., between 0 and 1), or may be scaled according to another interval. The relationship values may also be bounded or unbounded, or they may be symbolically represented (e.g., high, medium, low).","The user , which could be considered a user community including a single member, may also have a number of relationships to other communities, where these relationships are of different types, directions and relevance. From the perspective of the user , these relationship types may take many different forms. Some relationships may be automatically formed by the one or more computer-based systems , for example, based on interests or geographic location or similar traffic\/usage patterns. Thus, for example the entire community  may include users in a particular city. Some relationships may be context-relative. For example, a community to which the user  has a relationship could be associated with a certain process, and another community could be related to another process. Thus, sub-community E  may be the users associated with a product development business to which the user  has a relationship ; sub-community B  may be the members of a cross-business innovation process to which the user  has a relationship ; sub-community D  may be experts in a specific domain of product development to which the user  has a relationship . The generation of new communities which include the user  may be based on the inferred interests of the user  or other users within the entire community .","Membership of communities may overlap, as indicated by sub-communities A  and C . The overlap may result when one community is wholly a subset of another community, such as between the entire community  and sub-community B . More generally, a community overlap will occur whenever two or more communities contain at least one user or user in common. Such community subsets may be formed automatically by the one or more systems , based on preference inferencing from user behaviors . For example, a subset of a community may be formed based on an inference of increased interest or demand of particular content or expertise of an associated community. The one or more computer-based systems  is also capable of inferring that a new community is appropriate. The one or more computer-based systems  will thus create the new community automatically.","For each user, whether residing within, say, sub-community A , or residing outside the community , such as the user , the relationships (such as arrows  or ), affinities, or \u201crelationship values\u201d (such as numerical indicator ), and directions (of arrows) are unique. Accordingly, some relationships (and specific types of relationships) between communities may be unique to each user. Other relationships, affinities, values, and directions may have more general aspects or references that are shared among many users, or among all users of the one or more computer-based systems . A distinct and unique mapping of relationships between users, such as is illustrated in , could thus be produced for each user by the one or more computer-based systems .","The one or more computer-based systems  may automatically generate communities, or affinity groups, based on user behaviors  and associated preference inferences. In addition, communities may be identified by users, such as administrators of the process or sub-process instance . Thus, the one or more computer-based systems  utilizes automatically generated and manually generated communities.","The communities, affinity groups, or user segments aid the one or more computer-based systems  in matching interests optimally, developing learning groups, prototyping process designs before adaptation, and many other uses. For example, some users that use or interact with the one or more computer-based systems  may receive a preview of a new adaptation of a process for testing and fine-tuning, prior to other users receiving this change.","The users or communities may be explicitly represented as elements or objects within the one or more computer-based systems .","Preference and\/or Intention Inferences","The usage behavior information and inferences function  of the one or more computer-based systems  is depicted in the block diagram of . In embodiments where computer-based systems  is an adaptive system , then usage behavior information and inferences function  is equivalent to the usage aspect  of . The usage behavior information and inferences function  denotes captured usage information , further identified as usage behaviors , and usage behavior pre-processing . The usage behavior information and inferences function  thus reflects the tracking, storing, classification, categorization, and clustering of the use and associated usage behaviors  of the one or more users or users  interacting with the one or more computer-based systems .","The captured usage information , known also as system usage or system use , includes any interaction by the one or more users or users  with the system, or monitored behavior by the one or more users . The one or more computer-based systems  may track and store user key strokes and mouse clicks, for example, as well as the time period in which these interactions occurred (e.g., timestamps), as captured usage information . From this captured usage information , the one or more computer-based systems  identifies usage behaviors  of the one or more users  (e.g., web page access or physical location changes of the user). Finally, the usage behavior information and inferences function  includes usage-behavior pre-processing, in which usage behavior categories , usage behavior clusters , and usage behavioral patterns  are formulated for subsequent processing of the usage behaviors  by the one or more computer-based systems . Some usage behaviors  identified by the one or more computer-based systems , as well as usage behavior categories  designated by the one or more computer-based systems , are listed in Table 1, and are described in more detail below.","The usage behavior categories , usage behaviors clusters , and usage behavior patterns  may be interpreted with respect to a single user , or to multiple users , in which the multiple users may be described herein as a community, an affinity group, or a user segment. These terms are used interchangeably herein. A community is a collection of one or more users, and may include what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccommunity of interest.\u201d A sub-community is also a collection of one or more users, in which members of the sub-community include a portion of the users in a previously defined community. Communities, affinity groups, and user segments are described in more detail, below.","Usage behavior categories  include types of usage behaviors , such as accesses, referrals to other users, collaboration with other users, and so on. These categories and more are included in Table 1. Usage behavior clusters  are groupings of one or more usage behaviors , either within a particular usage behavior category  or across two or more usage categories. The usage behavior pre-processing  may also determine new \u201cclusterings\u201d of user behaviors  in previously undefined usage behavior categories , across categories, or among new communities. Usage behavior patterns , also known as \u201cusage behavioral patterns\u201d or \u201cbehavioral patterns,\u201d are also groupings of usage behaviors  across usage behavior categories . Usage behavior patterns  are generated from one or more filtered clusters of captured usage information .","The usage behavior patterns  may also capture and organize captured usage information  to retain temporal information associated with usage behaviors . Such temporal information may include the duration or timing of the usage behaviors , such as those associated with reading or writing of written or graphical material, oral communications, including listening and talking, or physical location of the user , potentially including environmental aspects of the physical location(s). The usage behavioral patterns  may include segmentations and categorizations of usage behaviors  corresponding to a single user of the one or more users  or according to multiple users  (e.g., communities or affinity groups). The communities or affinity groups may be previously established, or may be generated during usage behavior pre-processing  based on inferred usage behavior affinities or clustering.","User Behavior Categories","In Table 1, a variety of different user behaviors  are identified that may be assessed by the one or more computer-based systems  and categorized. The usage behaviors  may be associated with the entire community of users, one or more sub-communities, or with individual users or users of the one of more computer-based applications .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Usage behavior categories and usage behaviors"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["usage behavior category","usage behavior examples"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["navigation and access","activity, content and computer application"]},{"entry":[{},"accesses, including buying\/selling"]},{"entry":[{},"paths of accesses or click streams"]},{"entry":[{},"execution of searches and\/or search history"]},{"entry":["subscription and","personal or community subscriptions to"]},{"entry":["self-profiling","process topical areas"]},{"entry":[{},"interest and preference self-profiling"]},{"entry":[{},"affiliation self-profiling (e.g., job function)"]},{"entry":["collaborative","referral to others"]},{"entry":[{},"discussion forum activity"]},{"entry":[{},"direct communications (voice call, messaging)"]},{"entry":[{},"content contributions or structural alterations"]},{"entry":["reference","personal or community storage and tagging"]},{"entry":[{},"personal or community organizing of stored or"]},{"entry":[{},"tagged information"]},{"entry":["direct feedback","user ratings of activities, content, computer"]},{"entry":[{},"applications and automatic recommendations"]},{"entry":[{},"user comments"]},{"entry":["physiological responses","direction of gaze"]},{"entry":[{},"brain patterns"]},{"entry":[{},"blood pressure"]},{"entry":[{},"heart rate"]},{"entry":["environmental","current location"]},{"entry":["conditions and","location over time"]},{"entry":["location","relative location to users\/object references"]},{"entry":[{},"current time"]},{"entry":[{},"current weather condition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A first category of process usage behaviors  is known as system navigation and access behaviors. System navigation and access behaviors include usage behaviors  such as accesses to, and interactions with computer-based applications and content such as documents, Web pages, images, videos, TV channels, audio, radio channels, multi-media, interactive content, interactive computer applications, e-commerce applications, or any other type of information item or system \u201cobject.\u201d These process usage behaviors may be conducted through use of a keyboard, a mouse, oral commands, or using any other input device. Usage behaviors  in the system navigation and access behaviors category may include, but are not limited to, the viewing or reading of displayed information, typing written information, interacting with online objects orally, or combinations of these forms of interactions with computer-based applications. This category includes the explicit searching for information, using, for example, a search engine. The search term may be in the form of a word or phrase to be matched against documents, pictures, web-pages, or any other form of on-line content. Alternatively, the search term may be posed as a question by the user.","System navigation and access behaviors may also include executing transactions, including commercial transactions, such as the buying or selling of merchandise, services, or financial instruments. System navigation and access behaviors may include not only individual accesses and interactions, but the capture and categorization of sequences of information or system object accesses and interactions over time.","A second category of usage behaviors  is known as subscription and self-profiling behaviors. Subscriptions may be associated with specific topical areas or other elements of the one or more computer-based systems , or may be associated with any other subset of the one or more computer-based systems . Subscriptions may thus indicate the intensity of interest with regard to elements of the one or more computer-based systems . The delivery of information to fulfill subscriptions may occur online, such as through electronic mail (email), on-line newsletters, XML feeds, etc., or through physical delivery of media.","Self-profiling refers to other direct, persistent (unless explicitly changed by the user) indications explicitly designated by the one or more users regarding their preferences and\/or intentions and interests, or other meaningful attributes. A user  may explicitly identify interests or affiliations, such as job function, profession, or organization, and preferences and\/or intentions, such as representative skill level (e.g., novice, business user, advanced). Self-profiling enables the one or more computer-based systems  to infer explicit preferences and\/or intentions of the user. For example, a self-profile may contain information on skill levels or relative proficiency in a subject area, organizational affiliation, or a position held in an organization. A user  that is in the role, or potential role, of a supplier or customer may provide relevant context for effective adaptive e-commerce applications through self-profiling. For example, a potential supplier may include information on products or services offered in his or her profile. Self-profiling information may be used to infer preferences and\/or intentions and interests with regard to system use and associated topical areas, and with regard to degree of affinity with other user community subsets. A user may identify preferred methods of information receipt or learning style, such as visual or audio, as well as relative interest levels in other communities.","A third category of usage behaviors  is known as collaborative behaviors. Collaborative behaviors are interactions among the one or more users. Collaborative behaviors may thus provide information on areas of interest and intensity of interest. Interactions including online referrals of elements or subsets of the one or more computer-based systems , such as through email, whether to other users or to non-users, are types of collaborative behaviors obtained by the one or more computer-based systems .","Other examples of collaborative behaviors include, but are not limited to, online discussion forum activity, contributions of content or other types of objects to the one or more computer-based systems , or any other alterations of the elements, objects or relationships among the elements and objects of one or more computer-based systems . Collaborative behaviors may also include general user-to-user communications, whether synchronous or asynchronous, such as email, instant messaging, interactive audio communications, and discussion forums, as well as other user-to-user communications that can be tracked by the one or more computer-based systems .","A fourth category of process usage behaviors  is known as reference behaviors. Reference behaviors refer to the marking, designating, saving or tagging of specific elements or objects of the one or more computer-based systems  for reference, recollection or retrieval at a subsequent time. Tagging may include creating one or more symbolic expressions, such as a word or words, associated with the corresponding elements or objects of the one or more computer-based systems  for the purpose of classifying the elements or objects. The saved or tagged elements or objects may be organized in a manner customizable by users. The referenced elements or objects, as well as the manner in which they are organized by the one or more users, may provide information on inferred interests of the one or more users and the associated intensity of the interests.","A fifth category of process usage behaviors  is known as direct feedback behaviors. Direct feedback behaviors include ratings or other indications of perceived quality by individuals of specific elements or objects of the one or more computer-based systems , or the attributes associated with the corresponding elements or objects. The direct feedback behaviors may therefore reveal the explicit preferences and\/or intentions of the user. In the one or more computer-based systems , the advertisements  may be rated by users . This enables a direct, adaptive feedback loop, based on explicit preferences and\/or intentions specified by the user. Direct feedback also includes user-written comments and narratives associated with elements or objects of the computer-based system .","A sixth category of process usage behaviors is known as physiological responses. These responses or behaviors are associated with the focus of attention of users and\/or the intensity of the intention, or any other aspects of the physiological responses of one or more users . For example, the direction of the visual gaze of one or more users may be determined. This behavior can inform inferences associated with preferences and\/or intentions or interests even when no physical interaction with the one or more computer-based systems  is occurring. Even more direct assessment of the level of attention may be conducted through access to the brain patterns or signals associated with the one or more users. Such patterns of brain functions during participation in a process can inform inferences on the preferences and\/or intentions or interests of users, and the intensity of the preferences and\/or intentions or interests. The brain patterns assessed may include MRI images, brain wave patterns, relative oxygen use, or relative blood flow by one or more regions of the brain.","Physiological responses may include any other type of physiological response of a user  that may be relevant for making preference or interest inferences, independently, or collectively with the other usage behavior categories. Other physiological responses may include, but are not limited to, utterances, gestures, movements, or body position. Attention behaviors may also include other physiological responses such as breathing rate, heart rate, blood pressure, or galvanic response.","A seventh category of process usage behaviors is known as environmental conditions and physical location behaviors. Physical location behaviors identify physical location and mobility behaviors of users. The location of a user may be inferred from, for example, information associated with a Global Positioning System or any other positionally or locationally aware system or device, or may be inferred directly from location information input by a user (e.g., a zip code or street address), or otherwise acquired by the computer-based systems . The physical location of physical objects referenced by elements or objects of one or more computer-based systems  may be stored for future reference. Proximity of a user to a second user, or to physical objects referenced by elements or objects of the computer-based application, may be inferred. The length of time, or duration, at which one or more users reside in a particular location may be used to infer intensity of interests associated with the particular location, or associated with objects that have a relationship to the physical location. Derivative mobility inferences may be made from location and time data, such as the direction of the user, the speed between locations or the current speed, the likely mode of transportation used, and the like. These derivative mobility inferences may be made in conjunction with geographic contextual information or systems, such as through interaction with digital maps or map-based computer systems. Environmental conditions may include the time of day, the weather, lighting levels, sound levels, and any other condition of the environment around the one or more users .","In addition to the usage behavior categories depicted in Table 1, usage behaviors may be categorized over time and across user behavioral categories. Temporal patterns may be associated with each of the usage behavioral categories. Temporal patterns associated with each of the categories may be tracked and stored by the one or more computer-based systems . The temporal patterns may include historical patterns, including how recently an element, object or item of content associated with one or more computer-based systems . For example, more recent behaviors may be inferred to indicate more intense current interest than less recent behaviors.","Another temporal pattern that may be tracked and contribute to preference inferences that are derived, is the duration associated with the access or interaction with the elements, objects or items of content of the one or more computer-based systems , or the user's physical proximity to physical objects referenced by system objects of the one or more computer-based systems , or the user's physical proximity to other users. For example, longer durations may generally be inferred to indicate greater interest than short durations. In addition, trends over time of the behavior patterns may be captured to enable more effective inference of interests and relevancy. Since delivered recommendations may include one or more elements, objects or items of content of the one or more computer-based systems , the usage pattern types and preference inferencing may also apply to interactions of the one or more users with the delivered recommendations  themselves, including accesses of, or interactions with, explanatory information regarding the logic or rationale that the one more computer-based systems  used in deciding to deliver the recommendation to the user.","Adaptive Communications Generation","In some embodiments, adaptive communications c or recommendations  may be generated for the one or more users  through the application of affinity vectors.","For example, in some embodiments, Member-Topic Affinity Vectors (MTAV) may be generated to support effective recommendations, wherein for a registered user or member  of the one or more computer-based systems  a vector is established that indicates the relative affinity (normalized to the [0,1] continuum) the member has for every object sub-network the member has access to. For computer-based systems  comprising a fuzzy content network-based structural aspect, the member affinity values of the MTAV may be in respect to topic networks.","So in general, for each registered member, e.g., member M, a hypothetical MTAV could be of a form as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"MTAV for Member M"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Topic 1","Topic 2","Topic 3","Topic 4",". . .

This type of vector can be applied in two major ways:\n\n","To generate the MTAV, any of the behaviors of Table 1 may be utilized. For example, in some embodiments the following example behavioral information may be used:\n\n","This behavioral information is listed above in a generally reverse order of importance from the standpoint of inferring member interests; that is, access information gathered over a significant number of accesses or over a significant period of time will generally provide better information than subscription information, and save information is typically more informative of interests than just accesses.","The following fuzzy network structural information may also be used to generate MTAV values:\n\n","Personal topics that are not shared with other users  may be included in MTAV calculations. Personal topics that have not been made publicly cannot be subscribed to by other members, and so could in this regard be unfairly penalized versus public topics. Therefore for the member who created the personal topic and co-owners of that personal topic, in some embodiments the subscription vector to may be set to \u201cTrue,\u201d i.e. 1. There may exist personal topics that are created by a member  and that have never been seen or contributed to by any other member. This may not otherwise affect the recommendations  since the objects within that personal topic may be accessible by other members, and any other relationships these objects have to other topics will be counted toward accesses of these other topics.","In some embodiments the first step of the calculation is to use information 1-4 above to generate the following table or set of vectors for the member, as depicted in the following hypothetical example:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0121"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Member 1",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Behaviors","Topic 1","Topic 2","Topic 3","Topic 4",". . .","Topic N"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Subscriptions","\u20031","\u20021","\u20020","0",{},"\u20021"]},{"entry":["Topic Accesses","\u200214","\u20023","57","0",{},"\u20028"]},{"entry":["Weighted Accesses","112","55","23","6",{},"43"]},{"entry":["Weighted Saves","\u20036","\u20028","\u20024","0",". . .","\u20022"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The Subscriptions vector of Table 2 contains either a 1 if the member has subscribed to a topic or is the owner\/co-owner of a personal topic or a 0 if the member has not subscribed to the topic. The Topic Accesses vector contains the number of accesses to that topic's explore page by the member to a topic over a period of time, for example, the preceding 12 months.","The Weighted Accesses vector of Table 1 contains the number of the member's (Member 1) accesses over the last 12 months of each object multiplied by the relevancies to each topic summed across all accessed objects. (So for example, if Object 1 has been accessed 10 times in the last 12 months by Member 1 and it is related to Topic 1 by 0.8, and Object 2 has been accessed 4 times in the last 12 months by Member 1 and is related to Topic 1 at relevancy level 0.3, and these are the only objects accessed by Member 1 that are related to Topic 1, then Topic 1 would contain the value 10*0.8+4*0.3=9.2).","The Weighted Saves vector of Table 1 works the same way as the Weighted Accesses vector, except it is based on Member 1's object save data instead of access data.","In some embodiments, topic object saves are counted in addition to content object saves. Since a member saving a topic typically is a better indicator of the member's interest in the topic than just saving an object related to the said topic, it may be appropriate to give more \u201ccredit\u201d for topic saves than just content object saves. For example, when a user saves a topic object, the following process may be applied:","If the Subscriptions vector indicator is not already set to \u201c1\u201d for this topic in Table 1, it is set to \u201c1\u201d. (The advantage of this is even if the topic has been saved before 12 months ago, the user will still at least get subscription \u201ccredit\u201d for the topic save even if they don't get credit for the next two calculations).","In exactly the same way as a saved content object, a credit is applied in the Weighted Accesses vector of Table 2 based on the relevancies of other topics to the saved topic.","A special \u201cbonus\u201d weighting in the Weighted Accesses vector of Table 2 for the topic itself using the weighting of \u201c10\u201d\u2014which means a topic save is worth at least as much as 10 saves of content that are highly related to that topic.","The next step is to make some adjustments to Table 1. For example, it may be desirable scale the Weighted Accesses and Weighted Saves vectors by the number of objects that is related to each topic. The result is the number of accesses or saves per object per topic. This may be a better indicator of intensity of interest because it is not biased against topics with few related objects. However, per object accesses\/saves alone could give misleading results when there are very few accesses or saves. So as a compromise, the formula that is applied to each topic, e.g., Topic N, may be a variation of the following:\n\n((Weighted Accesses for Topic N)\/(Objects related to Topic N))*Square Root(Weighted Accesses for Topic N)\n\nThis formula emphasizes per object accesses, but tempers this with a square root factor associated with the absolute level of accesses by the member.

Change in Popularity (What's Hot\u201d factor)","2. Recency Factor","3. Object Affinity to MTAV","These weighting factors could take any value (but might be typically in the 0-5 range) and could be applied to associated ranking categories to give the category disproportionate weightings versus other categories. They can provide control over how important change in popularity, freshness of content, and an object's affinity with the member's MTAV are in ranking the candidate objects.","The values of the weighting factors are combined with the raw input information associated with an object to generate a rating score for each candidate object. The objects can then be ranked by their scores, and the highest scoring set of X objects, where X is a defined maximum number of recommended objects, can be selected for deliver to a recommendation recipient . In some embodiments, scoring thresholds may be set and used in addition to just relative ranking of the candidate objects. The scores of the one or more recommended objects may also be used by the computer-based system  to provide to the recommendation recipient a sense of confidence in the recommendation. Higher scores would warrant more confidence in the recommendation of an object than would lower scores.","Recommendation Explanation Generation","In addition to delivering a recommendation  for an object, the computer-based application  may deliver a corresponding explanation c of why the object was recommended. This can be very valuable to the recommendation recipient  because it may give the recipient a better sense of whether to bother to read or listen to the recommended content, without committing significant amount of time. For recommendations that comprise advertising content, the explanation may enhance the persuasiveness of the ad.","In some embodiments, variations of the ranking factors may be applied in triggering explanatory phrases. For example, the following table illustrates how the ranking information can be applied to determine both positive and negative factors that can be incorporated within the recommendation explanations.

The score level may contribute to the confidence level, but some other general factors may be applied, including the amount of usage history available for the recommendation recipient on which to base preference inferences and\/or the inferred similarity of the user with one or more other users for which there is a basis for more confident inferences of interests or preferences.","Recommendation explanations are one type of behavioral-based communications c that the one or more computer-based applications  may deliver to users . Other types of adaptive communications c may be delivered to a user  without necessarily being in conjunction with the recommendation of an object or item of content. For example, a general update of the activities of other users  and\/or other trends or activities related to people or content may be communicated.","Adaptive communications c may also comprise one or more phrases that communicate an awareness of behavioral changes in the user  over time, and inferences thereof. These behavioral changes may be derived, at least in part, from an evaluation of changes in the user's MTAV affinity values over time. In some cases, these behavioral patterns may be quite subtle and may otherwise go unnoticed by the user  if not pointed out by the computer-based system . Furthermore, the one or more computer-based systems may infer changes in interests or preferences of the user  based on changes in the user's behaviors over time. The communications c of these inferences may therefore provide the user  with useful insights into changes in his interest, preferences, and tastes over time. This same approach can also be applied by the one or more computer-based systems to deliver insights into the changes in interests, preferences and tastes associated with any user  to another user . These insights, packaged in an engaging communications c, can simulate what is sometimes referred to as \u201ca theory of mind\u201d in psychology.","The adaptive communications c in general may apply a syntactical structure and associated probabilistic phrase arrays to generate the adaptive communications in a manner similar to the approach described above to generate explanations for recommendations. The phrase tendencies of the adaptive communications c over a number of generated communications can be said to constitute a \u201cpersonality\u201d associated with the one or more computer-based applications .

Based, at least in part, on these evaluations , the frequency distributions  of one or more phrases that may be selected  for future user communications are then updated . For example, if the user communication c is an the explanation associated with an adaptive recommendation , and it is determined that the recommendation recipient reads the corresponding recommended item of content, then the relative frequency of selection of the one or more phrases comprising the explanation of the adaptive recommendation  might be preferentially increased versus other phrases that we not included in the user communication. Alternatively, if the communication c elicited one or more behaviors  from the communication recipient  that were indicative of indifference or a less than positive reaction, then the relative frequency of selection of the one or more phrases comprising the communication might be preferentially decreased versus other phrases that we not included in the user communication.","In , an illustrative data structure  supporting the adaptive personality process  according to some embodiments is shown. The data structure may include a designator for a specific phrase array . A phrase array may correspond to a specific unit of the syntax of an overall user communication.

In the illustrative data structure  this selection frequency distribution of phrases  in a phrase array  is based on the relative magnitude of the value of the frequency distribution indicator.
