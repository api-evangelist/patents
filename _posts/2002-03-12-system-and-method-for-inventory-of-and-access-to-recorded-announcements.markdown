title: System and method for inventory of and access to recorded announcements
abstract: A system and method for providing an inventory of and access to recorded announcement data, the method involving collecting switch data from one or more central office switches of a telecommunications network, extracting recorded announcement data from the switch data, storing the recorded announcement data in a database, and providing one or more users with access to the database through a computer network. The one or more central office switches could be non-incorporated switches or incorporated switches, depending on their ability to store switch data. For non-incorporated switches, which do not store a significant amount of information, the switch data is collected by hand from paper or electronic records and is entered into the database. For incorporated switches, which do store a significant amount of information, the switch data is downloaded from the switch as, for example, translation tables.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to recorded announcements communicated over a network used by a telephone service provider or a business, such as an airline, financial services institution, travel agency, or polling service. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for inventorying and accessing recorded announcement information via a network.","Numerous businesses use recorded announcements to convey information to their customers via a communications network. The use of recorded announcements is widespread and rapidly growing in today's global economy. For example, most, if not all, telecommunication companies use hundreds of recorded announcements to notify callers of call status, service status, available services, employment opportunities, account balances and the like. Similarly, banking services use thousands of recorded announcements to inform customers of, for example, account status, lending opportunities, payment options, credit rates, billings and various other services. Most establishments use recorded announcements to route calls, receive automated purchase information, generate sales, perform sales promotions and provide other automated customer services. Polling services use recorded announcements to respond to calls, issue questions to callers and generate responses to data input by callers. Hospitals, governmental agencies, and other large entities often employ recorded announcements both internally and externally for applications with callers. As yet another example, many airline services use hundreds of recorded announcements to inform passengers of flight status, ticket information, and the like. The travel services industry is another business sector that utilizes systems with recorded announcements. Most travel agencies, car rental services, hotels and the like handle transactions with recorded announcements. Many companies use \u201cin-house\u201d communication systems with \u201cpick up\u201d phones that play announcements when a user picks up the telephone (e.g., a car rental agency, hotel or the like, with a \u201cpick up\u201d telephone at a front desk or reception counter).","Most telecommunication systems employ one or more central offices (CO) on a network. Typically, each central office has recorded announcement equipment coupled to a switch network via a series of trunks. A trigger in the network is used to identify which recorded announcement(s) is (are) required for a communication on the network. The switch network routes incoming calls to a trunk. Each trunk is associated with one or more recorded announcements on the recorded announcement equipment. With existing systems and methods, recorded announcements are loaded on the recorded announcement equipment according to the needs of each central office. In most cases, at least a portion of the announcements that are available at one central office is common to two or more central offices on a network. For example, the announcements for a particular central office may be common to all of the telephone subscribers serviced on a local access transport area (LATA).","Currently, when new recorded announcements become available, or existing recorded announcements require maintenance and the like, work assignments must be made to update announcements in one or more of the central offices that use those announcements. When this occurs, using known systems, an announcement tape must be loaded in each central office. This arrangement is often time consuming and costly. For example, maintaining recorded announcements at numerous locations imposes significant labor efforts to assign and maintain announcements in each central office.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","110","100","150","102","110","100","103","100","120"]},"Thus, users (e.g., , ,  . . . n) are connected to a central office  through a router , a distributing frame  and into a switch network . In this example, user  has dialed a number that requires a recorded announcement from the central office . A processor (not shown) recognizes that a user  requires a recorded announcement and connects the line through the switch network  to a trunk circuit  that is in communication with recorded announcement equipment . In most arrangements, the recorded announcement equipment is coupled directly to the switch. Typically, this architecture is repeated in one or more central offices throughout a network. Of course, the number and sizes of the central offices will vary, depending upon the size of the overall system, and other considerations.","Under most current situations, recorded announcements are loaded on recorded announcement equipment  by the use of a standard conventional audiocassette tapes . In some instances, recorded announcements are loaded onto, for example, a lap top personal computer (or a local workstation)  and then loaded onto recorded announcement equipment  via a cable or other link .","Typically, for each recorded announcement there is an assigned trunk, or a path, to switch network . This configuration varies somewhat from one switch type to another. However, in the simplest terms, each announcement requires a trunk or path from the recorded announcement equipment  to the switch network . In switching systems such as the Lucent 1AESS\u2122 and 5ESS\u2122 switches, for example, most of the recorded announcement equipment interfaces with the switch network via an analog trunk circuit. The recorded announcement equipment in these switching systems has a channel for each announcement. This means that each channel is wired to a trunk circuit that also connects to the switch network. Accordingly, when an announcement must be added or changed at a central office, it is first loaded on the recorded announcement equipment  and then a trunk is wired into the switch network. The latest vintage of recorded announcement equipment that is used in 5ESS\u2122 switching systems uses a 24-channel T-carrier interface. In this arrangement, all 24 channels of each recorded announcement unit are wired to a T-carrier system that then connects to the switch network. No additional wiring of channels is needed at the time when announcements are added or changed. However, these systems require loading of the announcements and occasional maintenance.","Typically, in each central office, or perhaps in one location for a group of central offices, sets of tapes are maintained so that if for some reason one or more of the announcements becomes corrupted, announcements can be re-recorded from the tape(s) onto the recording announcement equipment . Similarly, when new services are added that involve recorded announcements, new tapes are made and delivered to the respective central offices so that they can be loaded onto the appropriate equipment at those central offices.","The recorded announcement equipment in Nortel Networks DMS\u2122 and Siemens EWSD\u2122 switching systems is similar to the latest vintage in 5ESS\u2122 systems in that the equipment connects to the switching network via a multi-channel link. No additional wiring is needed in the DMS\u2122 and EWSD\u2122 switching systems after the equipment is installed. However, these systems also require loading of the announcements and occasional maintenance.","Accordingly, using known systems, inventories of recorded announcements must be maintained for one or more central offices. Furthermore, care must be maintained to ensure consistency of the recorded announcements at all central offices. Another problem is that it is difficult to match recording levels across multiple devices at multiple central offices.","Accordingly, a need exists for a system and a method for requesting, provisioning, and maintaining recorded announcements and related equipment for one or more central offices.","In addition, most telecommunication systems employ multiple central offices, which have recorded-announcement equipment located at one or more central office switches. Recorded announcements are loaded on the equipment according to the needs of each central office. The number of announcements is often very large and capacity is often an issue. Accordingly, a need also exists to assemble data concerning the recorded announcement equipment at the various central offices and to provide access to the data. A further need exists to allow for the monitoring of available capacity at the central offices.","The present invention includes a system and method for managing recorded announcements and making them remotely available through a network, e.g., via an Intranet or Internet web site. Preferably, a web site allows users to access, manipulate, download, and sample recorded announcement inventories by central office(s), state, switch type, local access transport area (LATA), and\/or region. Certain embodiments of the invention include an interface to provide means for interacting with an announcement database, for alerting appropriate entities to the need for more recorded announcement equipment, and for allowing the identification of available recorded announcement capacity.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method for managing recorded announcement data involves collecting switch data from one or more central office switches of a telecommunications network, extracting recorded announcement data from the switch data, storing the recorded announcement data in a database, and providing one or more users with access to the database through a computer network. The one or more central office switches could be switches with non-incorporated recorded announcement equipment or switches with incorporated recorded announcement equipment, which impacts how much information regarding recorded announcement information is stored in the switch data. For non-incorporated switches, which do not store a significant amount of information about recorded announcement equipment, the switch data is collected by hand from paper or electronic records and is entered into the database. For incorporated switches, which do store a significant amount of information, the switch data is downloaded from the switch as, for example, translation tables.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is depicted in . In this detailed description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form. Furthermore, one skilled in the art can readily appreciate that the specific sequences in which methods are presented and performed are illustrative and it is contemplated that the sequences can be varied and still remain within the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"]},"The present invention operates on an announcement network that provides a centralized recorded announcement data schema. The network could, for example, use one or more announcement service nodes to provide recorded announcements to one or more central offices on a network. An example of such a network is described in the co-pending application Ser. No. 10\/073,238, titled \u201cSystem and Method for Providing Recorded Messages on a Communications Network,\u201d filed Feb. 13, 2002, which is assigned to the assignees of the present invention and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The system architecture of  uses one or more announcement service nodes to provide recorded announcements to one or more central offices on a network. In a preferred embodiment, a processor at a central office or the like sends a query to one or more service nodes to retrieve an appropriate announcement in response to a received call. According to one embodiment of the present invention, at least one service node is provided for each local access transport area (LATA).","In this architecture, most or all recorded announcements are stored at centralized locations, thus reducing the effort required in assigning, managing, and maintaining announcements. For example, according to embodiments of the invention, if a central office needs a new recorded announcement, nothing needs to be done except perhaps a translation change.","According to one exemplary embodiment, a new announcement is loaded at a centralized location. Logic in software at the centralized location determines, according to events in call processing, when the new announcement needs to be delivered to one or more central offices. In some situations in which the new announcement is needed only at one or a few central offices, translation changes may be needed. A translation change is a software entry in the program in the main processor that controls the operation of the switching system. A translation change would include information regarding the new announcement, such as the situation that requires the announcement, and the message to send requesting the announcement from the centralized location. Implementing a translation is a relatively simple operation and can be administered from a location remote to the central office.","Embodiments of the invention employ a centralized database designed to provide a source of recorded announcements accessible by users and, preferably, updateable by one or more administrative entities.","Referring to , customers (e.g., , ,  . . . n) (e.g., subscribers to a telephone service provider, Intranet clients, or employees of a company) are connected to a central office  via distributing frame  into a switch network . Central office  is connected to one or more trunks  and a frame  that includes an announcement digital signal processor . In turn, central office  is coupled to an announcement service node . Central office  serves as one central office on a LATA. Central offices ,  are also part of the LATA and are coupled to service node .","Announcement service node  comprises a router  and one or more databases . Database  may be in the format of a relational database (e.g., Oracle\u2122 databases), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or other known data storage architectures. In this example, when a device  initiates a call on the network, a processor (not shown), for example, initiates a query  to announcement service node  with a request that indicates a particular call scenario. For example, the processor may be located on or next to switch , communicating with service node  via trunk . The routing is determined by whatever the trigger (not shown) requests. In the preferred mode, service node  interprets the query and decides what announcement(s) is (are) needed. Service node  then sends the needed announcements back in packet-size form , for example, to the central office . An announcement digital signal processor  takes the packet-size file (or signal) and converts it into a voice file and connects it to the switch network  via a trunk circuit . The switch network  routes the recorded announcement to customer . Of course, the announcement may be delivered to a voice file, subscriber, customer, or other network application. Callers  and  are routed to announcements in a similar manner.","As shown in , multiple central offices ,  can be connected to service node . Preferably, each central office initiates requests  for announcements  from announcement service node . At the physical layer, a number of protocols for the requests (queries) are applicable, including X.25, DS0, and DS1. The transport of announcements from database  to a central office can involve the use of compression techniques such as Pulse Coded Modulation (PCM) or Adaptive Differential PCM (ADPCM) to conserve capacity.","According to one embodiment, a central office  provides a service node  with a customer identification code, e.g., a phone number, Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS), Automatic Number Identification (ANI), or other identification means, and service node  provides central office  with a customer identification file. The file may contain a name or other information related to the customer, including one or more personalized recorded announcements. In this manner, each service node can store personalized recorded announcements for a caller . For example, a telephone service provider could offer a service in which a subscriber can record personal greetings for specific callers to that subscriber's home or business telephone (e.g., the message \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to the caller with a particular telephone number).","As shown in , announcement service node  can access one or more databases . Of course, database  can be one or more databases in one or more locations. Service node  may access files using a number of established means, including Btrieve\u2122, ODBC (Open DataBase Compliant) implementations such as Remote Data Objects and ActiveX\u2122 Data Objects, or other structured query language (SQL) methods.","Local workstation  accesses announcement service node  via a network application  to remotely access, inventory, and maintain recorded announcements that are stored in database . Network application  is, for example, an Intranet or Internet application. Network application  and local workstation  enable a user to access recorded announcement information for a particular central office. Local workstation  can collect the recorded announcement information of multiple central offices, and store the information on workstation  or on a separated database server  (with which workstation  is in communication through network ).","Based on the exemplary system architecture of , the method of the present invention operates as follows. As shown in , the method begins in step  by collecting switch data from each central office of the network. Thus, for example, in the network of , inventory information would be collected from the switches of central offices , , and , such as switch  of central office . The collected switch data is preferably stored in workstation , but could be stored in database  or in another computer or server in communication with network , such as server .","After compiling this inventory information, the process continues in step  by extracting recorded announcement data from the switch data and formatting the recorded announcement data for access by users who assign and maintain recorded announcements. The extracted recorded announcement data preferably includes only necessary information, leaving out any extraneous data related to the central office (e.g., extraneous information that may be stored on the switch of the central office). At the conclusion of step , the recorded announcement inventory information is stored in a formatted database. The formatted database is stored, for example, in database server  or in another computer or server in communication with network .","After the recorded announcement data is stored in the formatted database, the process continues in step  by providing users with access to the formatted recorded announcement inventory data. This step could simply involve providing users with the ability to view the formatted database. Preferably, however, to provide this access, the present invention provides a graphical user interface through which users can view, search, and edit the inventory data stored in the formatted database. The users preferably access the information remotely through network .","The details of each of the steps , , and  are explained below.","Referring to step  of , the manner by which the switch data is collected depends on the type of switch that a particular central office has. Some switches are configured such that only a limited amount of information about recorded announcement equipment is stored in the switch translation tables. These switches are referred to herein as non-incorporated. Examples of non-incorporated switches include the Lucent 5ESS\u2122 digital switching office system and the Lucent 1AESS\u2122 analog central office switch. With non-incorporated switches, the switch data is collected by hand, from historical paper or electronic records kept in the course of maintaining the switch. Those persons responsible for maintaining the central office, such as central office technicians or managers, would typically possess these records. After collecting these records, the desired inventory data would be typed (in the case of paper records) or loaded (in the case of electronic records) into a database (e.g., database , workstation , or another database in communication with network ).","In contrast to non-incorporated switches, other switches are configured such that most or all of the information related to recorded announcement equipment is stored in the switch translation tables. These switches can therefore provide inventory data directly, eliminating the need to collect separate paper or electronic maintenance records. Thus, instead of collecting inventory information by hand, the information can be taken from the switch itself. These types of switches are referred to herein as incorporated switches. An example of an incorporated switch is the Northern Telecom (Nortel) DMS100F\u2122 switch, which contains a database that stores several translation tables. Thus, with incorporated switches, data can be downloaded from the database (e.g., translation tables) of the switch, ready to be pared down and assembled into a second formatted database (step  of ).","As would be appreciated by those skilled in the art, an incorporated switch, such as a DMS\u2122 switch, contains a processor that controls the switch network and the peripheral devices, and runs dynamic software. The dynamic software populates the translation tables with information about the switch, including information about recorded announcements. Thus, at any given time, the translation tables of the incorporated switch contain up-to-date information about its recorded announcements.","The tables listed below provide an example of the data typically stored on a DMS\u2122 switch. The tables summarize a data file downloaded from a DMS\u2122 switch in Alabaster, Alabama, which is owned and operated by BellSouth\u2122 of Atlanta, Ga. The data file includes a \u201cDisplay of DRAM\u201d for each DRAM (Digital Recorder Announcement Module), followed by a series of thirteen translation tables with the following headings: ANNS, ANNMES, CLLI, DRAMS, DRAMTRK, DRMUSERS, TMINV, DNROUTE, OFRT, OFR 2, OFR 3, OFR 4, and TRKNAME. The \u201cDisplay of DRAM,\u201d which is also referred to as DRAMREC, is not a translation table, but contains fields of data that are used in the present invention.","For illustration purposes only, the translation table headings correspond to following definitions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ANNS","Announcements;"]},{"entry":["ANNMEMS","Announcement Member Information (e.g., hardware on"]},{"entry":[{},"which the phrases are loaded);"]},{"entry":["CLLI","Common Language Location Identifier, which is an"]},{"entry":[{},"alphanumeric code used to identify physical locations and"]},{"entry":[{},"equipment such as buildings, central offices, poles, and"]},{"entry":[{},"antennae, and which in the context of the present invention"]},{"entry":[{},"is used to identify a recorded announcement that may be"]},{"entry":[{},"composed of one or more phrases;"]},{"entry":["DRAMS","Digital Recorder Announcement Modules;"]},{"entry":["DRAMTRK","(Announcement) Track of Digital Recorder Announcement"]},{"entry":[{},"Modules;"]},{"entry":["DRMUSERS","Users of Digital Recorder Announcement Modules;"]},{"entry":["TMINV","Trunk Module Inventory;"]},{"entry":["DNROUTE","Directory number to route;"]},{"entry":["OFRT","Office route index, table 1;"]},{"entry":["OFR 2","Office route index, table 2;"]},{"entry":["OFR 3","Office route index, table 3;"]},{"entry":["OFR 4","Office route index, table 4; and"]},{"entry":["TRKNAME","Trunk Group Number or Name (CLLI)."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"For brevity, the representative tables below include only the headings and the first few lines of each translation table (except for tables OFR 3 and OFR 4, which are shown complete, but have no data populating them).

Paring down the switch data involves identifying and extracting only the data necessary for the assignment and maintenance of recorded announcements. This data can include, for example, the number and capacity of the recorded announcement units in each central office and the number and type of announcements stored on each unit. For example, if a central office has five recorded announcement units, each having eight channels capable of storing one recorded announcement each, then the central office as a whole has the capacity to store up to forty different recorded announcements.","This format allows for, among other things, monitoring capacity available at the switches, such that when a new announcement is needed, it can be properly assigned to a central office having appropriate capacity. In other words, by implementing embodiments of the invention, a person responsible for assigning recorded announcements can readily determine which recorded announcement channels are available. Central office managers can also conveniently determine when the recorded announcement equipment of a central office has reached capacity, so that additional equipment can be allotted.","In completing step  for non-incorporated switches, the recorded announcement data is retrieved from the switch data by hand, as was the switch data in step . In an alternative embodiment for non-incorporated switches, steps  and  may be combined such that, in collecting switch data from paper or electronic records, only the switch data related to recorded announcements is captured.","In completing step  for incorporated switches, the recorded announcement data must be extracted from the translation tables, which contain large amounts of data irrelevant to the assignment and maintenance of recorded announcements. Therefore, for incorporated switches, step  involves selectively retrieving data from the translation tables to compile a pared-down body of data relating only to desired recorded announcement information.","For example, of all of the data fields available in the data file of a DMS\u2122 switch (e.g., as shown in ), only a subset is necessary for assigning and managing recorded announcements. Thus, for a DMS\u2122 switch, step  requires a selection of data fields from the retrieved tables.  illustrates the selection of an exemplary subset, as indicated by the shaded fields.","As illustrated in , a query  is sent to the incorporated switch requesting data from certain translation tables and DRAMREC display .

The data from the translation tables and DRAMREC display  is stored in a workstation  (). The data from the shaded fields shown in  is selected from each set of tables for each central office and placed in a database .

For non-incorporated switches, this data maintenance relies first on the thorough inventory of the recorded announcement data (from paper\/electronic records) at an initial point in time, and second, on diligent updating of the inventory based on the reporting of changes in the recorded announcement data (e.g., when an announcement is added). A routine survey of the non-incorporated switches could also be performed to catch changes in the recorded announcement data that may have mistakenly not been reported.

To begin building this initial inventory, a table is populated from the data in DRAMREC. This table lists the DRAM\/EDRAM cards and the announcement phrases that are stored on each.","Typically, in a DMS\u2122, recorded announcements are stored on DRAMs or EDRAMs, which each have a recording capacity of up to 248 seconds of announcements. There are, however, factors that may limit the quantity of announcements that may be placed on a DRAM or EDRAM.","DRAMs and EDRAMs are mounted in Trunk Modules (TMs). The TMs provide Circuits (speech paths) that connect the DRAMs or EDRAMs to the switch network.","In a DRAM or EDRAM there are up to eight cards that contain a specified amount of recording capacity. DRAMs consist of up to eight physically distinct cards. EDRAMs have one physical card that is viewed as a set of up to eight virtual cards in switch translations.","In all DRAM and most EDRAM configurations, there are up to eight cards with 31 seconds each. Some EDRAMs may be configured with up to four dual cards with 62 seconds each.","The data from DRAMREC includes each DRAM or EDRAM and the cards configured for each one. The data also lists the announcement phrases stored on each card.","Announcement phrases are associated with announcement CLLIs in switch translations. When a call scenario requires an announcement, the appropriate announcement CLLI is identified by translation entries. In turn, the announcement CLLI is linked to one or more phrases that are accessed from a DRAM or EDRAM. The DRAM or EDRAM plays the selected phrase(s) over a speech path that is then connected by the switch network to the appropriate time slot.","Referring to , after building the initial inventory of announcements in step , the next several steps create associations between fields of the inventory of announcements. For each step, the dashed arrow lines of  indicate the interim data tables from which the associations are made. Accordingly, as shown in step  of , data from tables DMS Maxconn, DMS DRAMTRK, and DMS DRMUSERS is used to compile a list of announcement CLLIs and associated phrases. The phrases from the DMS Announcement table are associated with announcement CLLIs.","In step , the announcement CLLIs are associated with the TM and Circuit fields in the DMS TM CHNL table, and the ANNTYPE, MaxConnect and MAXCYC fields in the DMS Maxconn table.","In step , the TM field in the DMS TM CHNL table is associated with the TME and FRTYPE fields in the DMS TME table.","In step , the TM, TME and FRTYPE fields are then associated with the announcement CLLI in the DMS Announcement table.","In step , the announcement CLLIs in the DMS Announcement table are associated with the TGN field in the DMS TGN table and the OFRT field in the DMS OFRT table.","In step , the OFRT is then associated with the Test Number in the DMS DNROUTE table.","Finally, in step , the announcement CLLIs may be associated with the test numbers.","As a result of associating the fields in steps \u2013, the local workstation in communication with the switch contains an announcement inventory table having the following fields: CLLI; DRAM_NUM; ANNOUNC_NUM; LIST_NUM; STD_ABBRV; MAX_CONN; CARD_TYPE; SEC_USED; TMNO; TME; CHNL; MTM_FOR_DTM; CARD_POS; CYCLES; ANNC_TYPE; TGN; OFRT; and TESTNUM.","Referring now to , with the announcement inventory table stored on the local workstation, the table is ready to be uploaded to the database of a server (e.g., a server in communication with network  such as server ) that can be accessed by multiple users (to provide access to the recorded announcement information as described for step  of ). This database can be of any type that allows multiple access, such as relational databases that use structure query language (SQL) calls.","Before uploading the table to the server, however, in step  (), data for the switch corresponding to the table is extracted from the server and stored in one or more \u201ccarry-over\u201d tables. In other words, prior to populating tables of the server database with the new data downloaded from the switch and reformatted in the local workstation, the existing data for the switch is extracted from the server database. This extraction preserves data that the translation tables of the switch may not contain. For example, data that was populated during the assignment of new announcements might not be stored in the switch. As another example, announcements may have been assigned in the server database but not yet built into the switch translation tables. The one or more carry-over tables ensure that these types of data are not lost.","In step , after the interim data tables are built, associated, and stored on the local workstation, integrity checks are performed to ensure that the new data is sound. In each subroutine, any errors trigger an alert that halts further action. This step is especially important in anticipation of the next step of deleting the current switch data from the server database.","With the new data validated and ready for uploading, in step , the existing switch data is deleted from the server database.","Then, in step , the newly built inventory of information in the local workstation is uploaded to the server database. In a representative embodiment, the data from the tables on the local workstation populate three tables in the server database. First, DRAM circuit data from the DMS TM CHNL table is loaded into a DRAM_CKTS table. Second, the data in the local Announcement table is aggregated to the DRAM\/EDRAM card level to populate a FRAME table. Lastly, the data from the interim announcement table is loaded into an ANNOUNCEMENT table on the database server (e.g., server  of ).","With the new data loaded, in step , the data from the carry-over tables is compared to the newly built inventory to determine which announcements are not yet translated in the switch. The data not found in the translation tables is then used to populate the server database.","Finally, in step , after the new data and the existing carry-over data has been loaded into the server database tables, additional integrity checks are performed to ensure that all of the announcements have been loaded properly.","Referring again to , after collecting and formatting the inventory information, the present invention provides users with access to the formatted inventory information to facilitate the assignment and maintenance of recorded announcements.

When adding an office, the administrator preferably manually enters the CLLI and SwType in the appropriate fields.","Referring to , an embodiment of the present invention provides a feature that allows a user to display the announcements that are associated with a particular \u201cNotice ID.\u201d Preferably, a Notice ID is shown on an email message or other communication that an administrator sends when new announcements are assigned. To use the Notice ID feature, the user selects the View option  from the menu bar, and then selects the Notice ID option from the drop-down menu that results (not shown). In response, a text box  labeled \u201cEnter Notice ID\u201d is displayed, along with other controls. To display announcements associated with a Notice ID, the user enters the Notice ID in text box  and presses enter. In response, the announcements associated with the entered Notice ID are displayed in a window . In this embodiment, in response to a user's clicking one of the announcements displayed in window , the interface application displays in fields  other information regarding the office and frame at which the selected announcement is recorded.","Making Assignments to Recorded Announcement Equipment","A further embodiment of the present invention enables a user to make new announcement assignments or change existing assignments. As shown in , with the desired office(s) displayed in field , the process begins with the user's selecting \u201cModify Eqpt\u201d from the Edit option  on the menu bar. In response, the interface application displays a second row of drop-down boxes, such as the fields  shown in . Some of these boxes are used to enter parameters associated with equipment as described below in the section \u201cProvisioning Recorded Announcement Equipment.\u201d The a other boxes are used to enter parameters associated with announcements as described below in this section. However, not all parameters are entered through the use of drop-down boxes. Drop-down boxes are provided for parameters that have pre-defined values. The other parameters are entered by manually typing the appropriate values. Also, values for any of the fields may be manually entered even if there are associated drop-down boxes.","To make or change assignments, a user selects the desired unit in the Equipment window  (see ). To make the assignments, a user specifies announcement-related parameters as follows.","First, the user chooses a tape list number or standard abbreviation from drop-down fields  and  (see ). In response, Announcement window  () displays the \u201cPhraseID\u201d that corresponds to the list number, and the \u201cAnncCLLI\u201d that corresponds to the standard abbreviation. The two drop-down boxes  and  are synchronized so that if a user selects a value from one box, the correct corresponding value for the other appears. Values are provided for all known recorded announcements. A user may, however, manually enter parameters to identify new or specialized announcements. The server database provides the length in seconds for known announcements. Users can enter the length in seconds for manually entered announcements. The wording for announcements that are in the drop-down lists may be displayed by double-clicking either of the labels above the drop-down lists, or by double-clicking an announcement that has been entered in Announcement window .","An embodiment of the present invention also provides for the tracking of announcement requests and notices. When a user makes a new assignment to a unit, the interface application displays a window that allows the user to enter information regarding the request or notice associated with the new announcement. This embodiment allows the user to retain a record of newly assigned announcements, which includes the services and due dates associated with the announcement. Each record has a unique tracking number called a Notice ID. If a user is assigning multiple announcements associated with one request, the user can use the same Notice ID against all the announcements.","If there is no available space for an announcement, but a user wants to enter a Notice record for it, the interface application allows the user to hold down the shift key and press the PageUp key. The interface application then displays window in which the user can enter information associated with the announcement, including a note indicating that no space is currently available. Later, when the announcement is assigned to a unit that has been made available, the previously entered Notice record may be associated with the announcement.","The interface application enables a user to display an existing Notice record for an announcement by holding down the shift key and pressing the PageUp key. The interface application then displays a window in which the user can edit the information or delete the Notice record.","Referring to , the interface application also enables a user to display all Notice records of a particular state or region by selecting the \u201cView Notices\u201d under the Tools option  on the menu bar.","In continuing to make the assignment, after choosing the tape list or standard abbreviation and entering a notice if desired, the user specifies trunks and MaxConnect. For non-incorporated switches such as 1AESS\u2122 switches, the user manually enters the quantity of trunks in a QtyTrks field and the trunk group number in a TGN field. The server database computes and populates the capacity for the indicated quantity of trunks. For non-incorporated switches such as 5ESS\u2122, the user manually enters the values for MaxCalls, TGN, and TMN.","For incorporated switches such as DMS\u2122 switches, the user manually enters the values for MaxConn, TGN, Chnl (also referred to as Trk Ckt), and OFRT. The Ckt and OFRT are fields determined as part of setting the translations. Each announcement may be assigned one or more Channels (Ckts). To make the channel assignments, the user clicks the Ckt field, in response to which the interface application displays another window containing the currently assigned Ckts. On this window, after the user clicks the desired available Ckt, the interface application displays the standard abbreviation in the same row. Alternatively, if a user needs to assign several Ckts, the user enters a currently vacant Ckt or range of Ckts in a text box to assign to the selected announcement. When the user presses enter, the interface application displays the standard abbreviation next to the selected Ckts.","After assigning the circuits, in continuing to make the assignment, the user specifies trunk order code (TOC), card type, and\/or equipment code, depending on the type of switch. For non-incorporated switches such as 1AESS\u2122 switches, the user chooses TOC from the drop-down lists. For non-incorporated switches such as 5ESS\u2122 switches, the user chooses TOC and Eqpt Code from the drop-down lists. For incorporated switches such as DMS\u2122 switches, the user chooses CardType and Eqpt Code from the drop-down lists.","Finally, the user finishes making the assignment by manually entering the RouteIndex, the Test Number, a B or I in a B\/I (BroadCast\/Interactive) field, and the Access Code.","Selecting Offices Based on Available Capacity","A further embodiment of the present invention provides a process that allows a user to select offices based on available capacity. The steps described above in the section \u201cSelecting Offices to Make Assignments\u201d (to select the desired State, Switch Type and Office) would be executed prior to choosing one of the functions described below in selecting offices based on available capacity.","To evaluate an office or offices, a user chooses \u201cOfcs Needing Eqpt\u201d, \u201cOfcs with Spares\u201d or \u201cEqpt with Spares\u201d from function drop-down box  (). Each of these functions returns capacity-related information in different forms. For example, the \u201cOfcs Needing Eqpt\u201d function indicates where additional recorded announcement equipment may be needed, which is helpful for users such as switch capacity managers. The \u201cOfcs with Spares\u201d function indicates where announcements can be added by listing all of the equipment of offices having spare capacity. This information is especially useful for users such as planners. The \u201cEqpt with Spares\u201d function is similar to the \u201cOfcs with Spares\u201d function, except that only the equipment having spare capacity is displayed rather than all of the equipment of offices having spare capacity.","Thus, activating the \u201cOfcs Needing Eqpt\u201d function displays the offices where additional recorded announcement equipment may be needed. The criteria for determining which offices need equipment are reflected in the fields relating to the capacities of recorded announcement equipment (total seconds , seconds per card , circuits , and channels ).","The total seconds field , seconds per card field , and circuits field  relate to incorporated switches (e.g., DMS100\/200\u2122 offices). The total seconds field  refers to the available number of seconds in an office. If there are fewer seconds available for assignment than the quantity shown, then all units in that office will be displayed. Available seconds are counted for each DRAM\/EDRAM card only if they exceed the quantity shown in the seconds per card field . This parameter is included to ensure that an announcement could actually be assigned to a unit. For example, if a user wants to identify offices having less than 40 spare seconds but is provisioning announcements that each require at least 10 seconds, the user would want to only count the cards that have 10 seconds or more of spare capacity. It would not be helpful to have only 1 or 2 seconds spare capacity on each of several cards in an office, even if they totaled 40 or more seconds.","The circuits field  refers to the circuits or channels that connect a DRAM or EDRAM to the switch network. This parameter is also used to ensure that an announcement could actually be assigned to a unit. Typically, at least one circuit is needed for each announcement (although multiple phrases may be assigned to the same circuit), and there are 29 circuits available in each DRAM\/EDRAM for announcement assignments. The user preferably sets this parameter to the value corresponding to the number of circuits that will be required for the announcements anticipated for the services being deployed. If a DRAM or EDRAM has fewer circuits than the value selected, that DRAM or EDRAM is considered unavailable for announcement assignment.","The channels field  relates to non-incorporated switches (e.g., 1AESS\u2122 and 5ESS\u2122 switches). If an office has fewer spare channels than the quantity shown, all units in that office will be displayed.","Activating the \u201cOfcs with Spares\u201d function displays all equipment in only the offices where there is the specified spare capacity of recorded announcement equipment. This function complements the \u201cOfcs Needing Eqpt\u201d function. The criteria for specifying how much spare capacity is needed are also reflected in the fields relating to the capacities of recorded announcement equipment (total seconds , seconds per card , circuits , and channels ).","The total seconds field , seconds per card field , and circuits field  again relate to incorporated switches (e.g., DMS100\/200\u2122 offices). The total seconds field  refers to the available number of seconds in an office. If the spare capacity is equal to or greater than the quantity shown, all units in that office are displayed. Available seconds are counted for each DRAM\/EDRAM card only if they exceed the quantity shown in the second per card field . This parameter is included to ensure that an announcement could actually be assigned to a unit. For example, if a user wants to assign an announcement that is 10 seconds in length, the user needs a card that has 10 seconds of spare capacity. It would not be helpful to have five separate cards with only 2 seconds of spare capacity each.","Again, the circuits field  refers to the circuits or channels that connect a DRAM or EDRAM to the switch network. If a DRAM or EDRAM has fewer circuits than the value selected, that DRAM or EDRAM is considered unavailable for announcement assignment.","The channels field  again relates to non-incorporated switches (e.g., 1AESS\u2122 and 5ESS\u2122 switches). If the spare capacity is equal to or greater than the quantity shown, all units in that office are displayed.","Activating the \u201cEqpt with Spares\u201d function displays only the equipment that meets the selection parameters. This is similar to the \u201cOfcs with Spares\u201d function except that only a portion of the equipment from some offices is displayed. The use of the selection parameters is the same.","Any time that a user wants to refresh the display of offices, the user selects a refresh option from the Function drop-down box .","Searching for a Specific Announcement","A further embodiment of the present invention enables a user to locate where a particular announcement is assigned. To use this feature, the interface application provides a search function, which is listed, for example, as an option in the Function drop-down box . In response to a user's selecting the search function, the interface application displays additional drop-down boxes that allow the user to indicate which announcement the user needs to locate. Announcements can be identified by list or standard abbreviation. If the announcement that a user needs to locate does not appear in the drop-down boxes, the user can enter an identifying text in a designated field. Clicking a drop-down box or pressing enter on the search text begins the search process.","Wildcard characters may be used to enhance the search for an announcement. For example, an asterisk may be used as a substitute for an indefinite number of characters. As another example, a question mark may be used as a substitute for a single character.","If a user does not know exactly how the announcement was entered in the database, the user can specify some part of the list number or standard abbreviation, along with wild card characters, to find announcements that include that series of characters. For example, if a user want to find an Internet Call Waiting announcement, the user can enter \u201c*ICW*\u201din the search text box. After the user presses the Enter key, the interface application searches for announcements with \u201cICW\u201d anywhere in either the list number or standard abbreviation.","Provisioning Recorded Announcement Equipment","A further embodiment of the present invention provides a process for editing (including additions) information related to recorded announcement equipment. These additions or edits can be executed after an office and its associated recorded announcement equipment has been populated in the server database, as described above in reference to, for example, . As described above, for incorporated switches, information is extracted from switch translation tables. For non-incorporated switches, information is collected from available sources and then entered in the server database. When a switch is initially added to the server database, the equipment parameters are populated in the database along with the announcements that are assigned to it.","With the recorded announcement information of a particular switch entered into the server database, this embodiment enables a user to add new equipment or edit existing equipment. If a user makes these additions or revisions, the user preferably ensures that the changes are reflected at the switch (i.e., translation tables) as well. If a user neglects to coordinate the changes, however, the present invention includes safeguards to preserve the entered additions or revisions. Specifically, as described above in reference to , the additions and revisions would be captured in the carry-over tables as the current data from a switch is uploaded to the server database.","The process for adding or editing information related to recorded announcement equipment begins by executing the steps described above under \u201cSelecting Offices to Make Assignments\u201d (i.e., select the desired State, Switch Type, and Office). To add information for a new recorded announcement unit, a user clicks the last existing unit listed in the Equipment window  (see ), and then selects \u201cAdd Eqpt\u201d from the Edit option  on the menu bar. If a user is adding or changing equipment parameters for existing equipment, the user clicks a row in Equipment window  to highlight the desired unit, and then selects \u201cModify Eqpt\u201d from the Edit option  on the menu bar.","Preferably, the interface application displays a second row of drop-down boxes when a user selects \u201cAdd Eqpt\u201d or \u201cModify Eqpt.\u201d Some of these boxes are used to enter parameters associated with equipment as described below. The other boxes are used to enter parameters associated with announcements as described above in the section \u201cMaking Assignments to Recorded Announcement Equipment.\u201d However, not all parameters are entered through the use of drop-down boxes. Drop-down boxes are provided for parameters that have pre-defined values. The other parameters are entered by manually typing the appropriate values. Also, values for any of the fields may be manually even if there are associated drop-down boxes.","In the preferred embodiment, messages are used to notify certain groups regarding new announcements. After a new announcement is added, an administrator may create a mail message by first holding down the shift key and clicking the announcement. To view the message, the administrator would select a \u201cSend Mail Message\u201d from the \u201cTools\u201d option on the menu bar. A window will appear that displays the mail message. By clicking a \u201cBuild Message\u201d command button, the proper recipients are added to the recipient list. By clicking the \u201cSend Message\u201d command button, the message is sent.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, instructions adapted to be executed by a processor to perform a method are stored on a computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium can be a device that stores digital information. For example, a computer-readable medium includes a hard disk, a floppy disk, a tape and a compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), all as known in the art for storing software. The computer-readable medium is accessed by a processor suitable for executing instructions adapted to be executed. The term \u201cadapted to be executed\u201d is meant to encompass any instructions that are ready to be executed in their present form (e.g., machine code) by a processor, or require further validation (e.g., compilation, decryption, or provided with an access code, etc.) to be ready to be executed by a processor.","In describing representative embodiments of the present invention, the specification may have presented the method and\/or process of the present invention as a particular sequence of steps.
