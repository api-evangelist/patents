To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug\/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w\/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0 C.). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [I]VEGF(109) are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest, (e.g., Fab-12 (Presta et al., (1997) 57:4593-4599)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates had dried, 150 ul\/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized target molecule hVEGF (8-109) CM5 chips at \u02dc10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human VEGF is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 \u03bcg\/ml (\u02dc0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl\/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of human VEGF, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl\/min. Association rates (k) and dissociation rates (k) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\/k. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) 293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-VEGF antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of human VEGF short form (8-109) or mouse VEGF as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. Similar binding assays can be performed for determining the Kd of an anti-\u03b15\u03b21 Fab or antibody using \u03b15\u03b21 as the target.","As used herein, a subject to be treated is a mammal (e.g., human, non-human primate, rat, mouse, cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat, etc.).

No. 4,675,187), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance (e.g., small molecule) that is less cytotoxic to diseased cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman, \u201cProdrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy\u201d 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al., \u201cProdrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,\u201d , Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985).

Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.","\u201cIsolated,\u201d when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a cell or cell culture from which it was expressed. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and can include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells, since at least one component of the polypeptide natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.","An \u201cisolated\u201d polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid or other polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid. An isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.","The term \u201ccontrol sequences\u201d refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.","Nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.","\u201cStringent conditions\u201d or \u201chigh stringency conditions\u201d, as defined herein, can be identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride\/0.0015 M sodium citrate\/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 C; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v\/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin\/0.1% Ficoll\/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone\/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42 C; or (3) overnight hybridization in a solution that employs 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 \u03bcg\/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42\u00b0 C., with a 10 minute wash at 42\u00b0 C. in 0.2\u00d7SSC (sodium chloride\/sodium citrate) followed by a 10 minute high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1\u00d7SSC containing EDTA at 55\u00b0 C.","The amino acid sequences described herein are contiguous amino acid sequences unless otherwise specified.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmunoadhesin\u201d designates antibody-like molecules that combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an \u201cadhesin\u201d) with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity that is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is \u201cheterologous\u201d), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand\u2014such as a VEGFR or a fibronectin ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin can be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2), IgE, IgD, or IgM. Peptibodies, which often comprise a sequence derived from phage display selection of sequences that specifically bind a target fused to an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, can be considered immunadhesins herein.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, for example, single monoclonal antibodies (including agonist, antagonist, and neutralizing antibodies), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, polyclonal antibodies, single chain anti-antibodies, and fragments of antibodies (see below) as long as they specifically bind a native polypeptide and\/or exhibit a biological activity or immunological activity of this invention. According to one embodiment, the antibody binds to an oligomeric form of a target protein, e.g., a trimeric form. According to another embodiment, the antibody specifically binds to a protein, which binding can be inhibited by a monoclonal antibody of this invention (e.g., a deposited antibody of this invention, etc.). The phrase \u201cfunctional fragment or analog\u201d of an antibody is a compound having a qualitative biological activity in common with an antibody to which it is being referred. For example, a functional fragment or analog of an antibody of this invention can be one which can specifically bind to VEGF or \u03b15\u03b21. In one embodiment, the antibody can prevent or substantially reduce the ability of a VEGF to induce cell proliferation.","An \u201cisolated antibody\u201d is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and can include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains (an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional polypeptide called J chain, and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites, while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units along with J chain). In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to a H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V) followed by three constant domains (C) for each of the \u03b1 and \u03b3 chains and four Cdomains for \u03bc and \u03b5 isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V) followed by a constant domain (C) at its other end. The Vis aligned with the Vand the Cis aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (C1). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a Vand Vtogether forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see, e.g., BCI8th edition, Daniel P. Stites, Abba I. Ten and Tristram G. Parslow (eds.), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.","The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (C), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03bc, respectively. The \u03b3 and \u03b1 classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in Csequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and define specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the 110-amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead, the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called \u201chypervariable regions\u201d that are each 9-12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., SPII5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).","The term \u201chypervariable region\u201d when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (e.g. around about residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the V, and around about 31-35B (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the V(in one embodiment, H1 is around about 31-35); Kabat et al., supra and\/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (e.g. residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the V, and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the V; Chothia and Lesk 196:901-917 (1987)).","Throughout the present specification and claims, the Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately, residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain) (e.g, Kabat et al., supra (1991)). The \u201cEU numbering system\u201d or \u201cEU index\u201d is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (e.g., the EU index reported in Kabat et al., supra (1991) expressly incorporated herein by reference). Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residues numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that can be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they can be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention can be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al., 256:495 (1975), or can be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial, eukaryotic animal or plant cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d can also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991), Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991) or using the methods set forth in the Examples below.","The monoclonal antibodies herein include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit a biological activity of this invention (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey, Ape etc), and human constant region sequences.","An \u201caffinity matured\u201d antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al., 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and\/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al., 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al., 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al., 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, 226:889-896 (1992).","A \u201cblocking\u201d antibody or an \u201cantagonist\u201d antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. For example blocking or antagonist anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies partially or completely inhibit the angiogenesis by binding \u03b15\u03b21.","An \u201cagonist\u201d antibody is one which enhances or increases biological activity of the antigen it binds. For example agonist antibodies anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies enhance angiogenesis by binding \u03b15\u03b21.","An \u201cintact\u201d antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding site as well as a Cand at least heavy chain constant domains, C1, C2 and C3. The constant domains can be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., 8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","The expression \u201clinear antibodies\u201d generally refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al., Protein Eng., 8(10):1057-1062 (1995). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (V), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (C1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab\u2032)fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the C1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab\u2032)antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab\u2032 fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.","The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.","A \u201cvariant Fc region\u201d comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one \u201camino acid modification\u201d as herein defined. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. In one embodiment, the variant Fc region herein will possess at least about 80% homology, at least about 85% homology, at least about 90% homology, at least about 95% homology or at least about 99% homology with a native sequence Fc region. According to another embodiment, the variant Fc region herein will possess at least about 80% homology, at least about 85% homology, at least about 90% homology, at least about 95% homology or at least about 99% homology with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide.","The term \u201cFc region-comprising polypeptide\u201d refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin (see definitions below), which comprises an Fc region. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly, a composition comprising polypeptides, including antibodies, having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides populations with all K447 residues removed, polypeptide populations with no K447 residues removed or polypeptide populations having a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.","\u201cFv\u201d is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.","\u201cSingle-chain Fv\u201d also abbreviated as \u201csFv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d are antibody fragments that comprise the Vand Vantibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see , vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994); Borrebaeck 1995, infra.","The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10 residues) between the Vand Vdomains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two \u201ccrossover\u201d sFv fragments in which the Vand Vdomains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al., 90:6444-6448 (1993).","\u201cHumanized\u201d antibodies are forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies that are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from the non-human antibody. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired antibody specificity, affinity, and capability. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, 2:593-596 (1992).","A \u201cspecies-dependent antibody\u201d is an antibody which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody \u201cbind specifically\u201d to a human antigen (i.e., has a binding affinity (Kd) value of no more than about 1\u00d710M, no more than about 1\u00d710or no more than about 1\u00d710M) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second non-human mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be of any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.","In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition to a \u201cnon-target\u201d protein will be less than about 10% of the binding of the polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition to its particular target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). With regard to the binding of a polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition to a target molecule, the term \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, or greater. In one embodiment, the term \u201cspecific binding\u201d refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.","Antibody \u201ceffector functions\u201d refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors; and B cell activation. A \u201cnative sequence Fc region\u201d comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Examples of Fc sequences are described in, for example, but not limited to, Kabat et al., supra (1991)).","\u201cPercent (%) amino acid sequence identity\u201d or \u201chomology\u201d with respect to the polypeptide and antibody sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the polypeptide being compared, after aligning the sequences considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2.

The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.","The terms \u201cFc receptor\u201d or \u201cFcR\u201d are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In one embodiment, an FcR of this invention is one that binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes includes receptors of the Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc\u03b3RII receptors include Fc\u03b3RIIA (an \u201cactivating receptor\u201d) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (an \u201cinhibiting receptor\u201d), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain Inhibiting receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see review M. in Da\u00ebron, 15:203-234 (1997)). The term includes allotypes, such as Fc\u03b3RIIIA allotypes: Fc\u03b3RIIIA-Phe158, Fc\u03b3RIIIA-Val158, Fc\u03b3RIIA-R131 and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA-H131. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \u201cFcR\u201d herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., 24:249 (1994)).","The term \u201cFcRn\u201d refers to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is structurally similar to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and consists of an \u03b1-chain noncovalently bound to \u03b22-microglobulin. The multiple functions of the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn are reviewed in Ghetie and Ward (2000) 18, 739-766. FcRn plays a role in the passive delivery of immunoglobulin IgGs from mother to young and the regulation of serum IgG levels. FcRn can act as a salvage receptor, binding and transporting pinocytosed IgGs in intact form both within and across cells, and rescuing them from a default degradative pathway.","WO 00\/42072 (Presta) and Shields et al. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The contents of those publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference.","The \u201cCH1 domain\u201d of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as \u201cC1\u201d of \u201cH1\u201d domain) usually extends from about amino acid 118 to about amino acid 215 (EU numbering system).","\u201cHinge region\u201d is generally defined as stretching from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (Burton, 22:161-206 (1985)). Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter-heavy chain S\u2014S bonds in the same positions.","The \u201clower hinge region\u201d of an Fc region is normally defined as the stretch of residues immediately C-terminal to the hinge region, i.e. residues 233 to 239 of the Fc region. In previous reports, FcR binding was generally attributed to amino acid residues in the lower hinge region of an IgG Fc region.","The \u201cCH2 domain\u201d of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as \u201cC2\u201d of \u201cH2\u201d domain) usually extends from about amino acid 231 to about amino acid 340. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N-linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It has been speculated that the carbohydrate may provide a substitute for the domain-domain pairing and help stabilize the CH2 domain. Burton, 22:161-206 (1985).","The \u201cCH3 domain\u201d (also referred to as \u201cC2\u201d or \u201cH3\u201d domain) comprises the stretch of residues C-terminal to a CH2 domain in an Fc region (i.e. from about amino acid residue 341 to the C-terminal end of an antibody sequence, typically at amino acid residue 446 or 447 of an IgG).","A \u201cfunctional Fc region\u201d possesses an \u201ceffector function\u201d of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary \u201ceffector functions\u201d include C1 q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays as herein disclosed, for example.","\u201cC1 q\u201d is a polypeptide that includes a binding site for the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. C1 q together with two serine proteases, C1r and C1s, forms the complex C1, the first component of the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathway. Human C1q can be purchased commercially from, e.g. Quidel, San Diego, Calif.","The term \u201cbinding domain\u201d refers to the region of a polypeptide that binds to another molecule. In the case of an FcR, the binding domain can comprise a portion of a polypeptide chain thereof (e.g. the alpha chain thereof) which is responsible for binding an Fc region. One useful binding domain is the extracellular domain of an FcR alpha chain.","An antibody or peptibody with a variant IgG Fc with \u201caltered\u201d FcR binding affinity or ADCC activity is one which has either enhanced or diminished FcR binding activity (e.g, Fc\u03b3R or FcRn) and\/or ADCC activity compared to a parent polypeptide or to a polypeptide comprising a native sequence Fc region. The variant Fc which \u201cexhibits increased binding\u201d to an FcR binds at least one FcR with higher affinity (e.g., lower apparent Kd or IC50 value) than the parent polypeptide or a native sequence IgG Fc. According to some embodiments, the improvement in binding compared to a parent polypeptide is about 3 fold, preferably about 5, 10, 25, 50, 60, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 fold, or about 25% to 1000% improvement in binding. The polypeptide variant which \u201cexhibits decreased binding\u201d to an FcR, binds at least one FcR with lower affinity (e.g, higher apparent Kd or higher IC50 value) than a parent polypeptide. The decrease in binding compared to a parent polypeptide may be about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or more decrease in binding.","\u201cAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cADCC\u201d refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound to Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies \u201carm\u201d the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 or in the Examples below may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. () 95:652-656 (1998).","The polypeptide comprising a variant Fc region which \u201cexhibits increased ADCC\u201d or mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of human effector cells more effectively than a polypeptide having wild type IgG Fc or a parent polypeptide is one which in vitro or in vivo is substantially more effective at mediating ADCC, when the amounts of polypeptide with variant Fc region and the polypeptide with wild type Fc region (or the parent polypeptide) in the assay are essentially the same. Generally, such variants will be identified using the in vitro ADCC assay as herein disclosed, but other assays or methods for determining ADCC activity, e.g. in an animal model etc, are contemplated. In one embodiment, the preferred variant is from about 5 fold to about 100 fold, e.g. from about 25 to about 50 fold, more effective at mediating ADCC than the wild type Fc (or parent polypeptide).","\u201cComplement dependent cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cCDC\u201d refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., 202:163 (1996), may be performed.","Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551 and WO 99\/51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Idusogie et al. 164: 4178-4184 (2000).","\u201cHuman effector cells\u201d are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. According to one embodiment, the cells express at least Fc\u03b3RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.","Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie 1997, Hinton 2004). Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g, in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides. In one embodiment, specifically the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies of the invention having a variant IgG Fc exhibits increased binding affinity for human FcRn over a polypeptide having wild-type IgG Fc, by at least 2 fold, at least 5 fold, at least 10 fold, at least 50 fold, at least 60 fold, at least 70 fold, at least 80 fold, at least 100 fold, at least 125 fold, at least 150 fold. In a specific embodiment, the binding affinity for human FcRn is increased about 170 fold.","For binding affinity to FcRn, in one embodiment, the EC50 or apparent Kd (at pH 6.0) of the polypeptide is less than 1 \u03bcM, more preferably less than or equal to 100 nM, more preferably less than or equal to 10 nM. In one embodiment, for increased binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIII (F158; i.e. low-affinity isotype) the EC50 or apparent Kd less is than or equal to 10 nM, and for Fc\u03b3RIII (V158; high-affinity isotype) the EC50 or apparent Kd is less than or equal to 3 nM. According to another embodiment, a reduction in binding of an antibody to a Fc receptor relative to a control antibody (e.g., the Herceptin\u00ae antibody) may be considered significant relative to the control antibody if the ratio of the values of the absorbances at the midpoints of the test antibody and control antibody binding curves (e.g, A\/A) is less than or equal to 40%. According to another embodiment, an increase in binding of an antibody to a Fc receptor relative to a control antibody (e.g., the Herceptin\u00ae antibody) may be considered significant relative to the control antibody if the ratio of the values of the absorbances at the midpoints of the test antibody and control antibody binding curves (e.g, A\/A) is greater than or equal to 125%.","A \u201cparent polypeptide\u201d or \u201cparent antibody\u201d is a polypeptide or antibody comprising an amino acid sequence from which the variant polypeptide or antibody arose and against which the variant polypeptide or antibody is being compared. Typically the parent polypeptide or parent antibody lacks one or more of the Fc region modifications disclosed herein and differs in effector function compared to a polypeptide variant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native sequence Fc region or an Fc region with pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications (such as additions, deletions and\/or substitutions).","Antibodies of this invention can be derived from phage display. As used herein, \u201clibrary\u201d refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment sequences, or the nucleic acids that encode these sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.","\u201cPhage display\u201d is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman, 3:355-362 (1992), and references cited therein. In a monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells, 3:205-0216 (1991).","A \u201cphagemid\u201d is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., Co1E1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.","The term \u201cphage vector\u201d means a double stranded replicative form of a bacteriophage containing a heterologous gene and capable of replication. The phage vector has a phage origin of replication allowing phage replication and phage particle formation. The phage is preferably a filamentous bacteriophage, such as an M13, fl, fd, Pf3 phage or a derivative thereof, or a lambdoid phage, such as lambda, 21, phi80, phi81, 82, 424, 434, etc., or a derivative thereof.","Covalent modifications of polypeptides such as peptibodies, immunoadesins, antibodies and short peptides are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of a polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of the polypeptide. Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful, for instance, for crosslinking the polypeptide to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface for use in the method for purifying antibodies, and vice-versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxy-succinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3\u2032-dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-1,8-octane and agents such as methyl-3-[(p-azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate.","Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively, hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the \u03b1-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains [T. E. Creighton, , W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)], acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group.","Other modifications include the conjugation of toxins to the antagonists such as maytansine and maytansinoids, calicheamicin and other cytotoxic agents.","Another type of covalent modification of the polypeptide comprises linking the polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337.","The polypeptide of the present invention can also be modified if advantageous in a way to form a chimeric molecule comprising the polypeptide fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence (e.g., immunoadhesins or peptibodies).","In one embodiment, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the polypeptide with a protein transduction domain which targets the polypeptide for delivery to various tissues and more particularly across the brain blood barrier, using, for example, the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein (Schwarze et al., 1999, Science 285: 1569-72).","In another embodiment, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the polypeptide with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti-tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino- or carboxyl-terminus of the polypeptide. The presence of such epitope-tagged forms of the polypeptide can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also, provision of the epitope tag enables the polypeptide to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are known in the art. Examples include poly-histidine (poly-His) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-His-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 [Field et al., 8:2159-2165 (1988)]; the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto [Evan et al., 5:3610-3616 (1985)]; and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody [Paborsky et al., 3(6):547-553 (1990)]. Other tag polypeptides include the Flag-peptide [Hopp et al., 6:1204-1210 (1988)]; the KT3 epitope peptide [Martin et al., 255:192-194 (1992)]; an \u03b1-tubulin epitope peptide [Skinner et al., 266:15163-15166 (1991)]; and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag [Lutz-Freyermuth et al., 87:6393-6397 (1990)].","In an alternative embodiment, the chimeric molecule can comprise a fusion of the polypeptide with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (e.g., an \u201cimmunoadhesin\u201d), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. Ig fusions of this invention include polypeptides that comprise approximately or only residues 94-243, residues 33-53 or residues 33-52 of human in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CH1, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG1 molecule.

or quantifying the amount of a substance. The term thus refers to the use of the materials, compositions, and methods of the present invention for qualitative and quantitative determinations. In general, the particular technique used for detection is not critical for practice of the invention.","For example, \u201cdetecting\u201d according to the invention may include: observing the presence or absence of \u03b15 gene product, a \u03b21 gene product (e.g., mRNA molecules), or an \u03b15 or \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide; a change in the levels of an \u03b15 or \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide or amount bound to a target; a change in biological function\/activity of an \u03b15 or \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide. In some embodiments, \u201cdetecting\u201d may include detecting wild type \u03b15 or \u03b15\u03b21 levels (e.g., mRNA or polypeptide levels). Detecting may include quantifying a change (e.g., an increase or decrease) of any value of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%, or more when compared to a control. Detecting may include quantifying a change of any value of at least about 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, or more e.g., 20-fold, 30-fold, 4-fold, 50-fold, 60-fold, 70-fold, 80-fold, 90-fold, 100-fold or more.","\u201cLabel\u201d when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody. The label may itself be detectable by itself (e.g., radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable.","Antibodies that can bind human \u03b15\u03b21 and competitively inhibit the binding of the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 18C12 antibody to human \u03b15\u03b21 are provided herein. Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention provides antibodies comprising a variable light (VL) sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 and a variable heavy (VH) sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14. Human or chimeric (including, e.g., humanized) forms of the antibodies of the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies described herein are also contemplated.","According to one embodiment, the antibody binds a human \u03b15\u03b21 with a Kd between 500 nM and 1 pM. In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u22661 \u03bcM, \u2266100 nM, \u226610 nM, \u22661 nM, \u22660.1 nM, \u22660.01 nM, or \u22660.001 nM (e.g. 10M or less, e.g. from 10M to 10M, e.g., from 10M to 10M). According to another embodiment, the antibody does not bind \u03b1V\u03b23 or \u03b1V\u03b25 or \u03b1V\u03b21. According to another embodiment, the antibody comprises an Fc sequence of a human IgG, e.g., human IgG1 or human IgG4. In another embodiment, an Fc sequence has been altered or otherwise changed so that it that lacks antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector function, often related to their binding to Fc receptors (FcRs). There are many examples of changes or mutations to Fc sequences that can alter effector function. For example, WO 00\/42072 and Shields et al. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The contents of those publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. The antibody can be in the form of a Fab, Fab\u2032, a F(ab)\u2032, single-chain Fv (scFv), an Fv fragment; a diabody and a linear antibody. Also, the antibody can be a multi-specific antibody that binds to \u03b15\u03b21 and is an \u03b15\u03b21 antagonist, but also binds one or more other targets and inhibits their function (e.g., VEGF) or a multi-specific antibody that binds to two or more different sites on \u03b15\u03b21. The antibody can be conjugated to a therapeutic agent (e.g., cytotoxic agent, a radioisotope and a chemotherapeutic agent) or a label for detecting \u03b15\u03b21 in patient samples or in vivo by imaging (e.g., radioisotope, fluorescent dye and enzyme).","Nucleic acid molecules encoding the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies, expression vectors comprising nucleic acid molecules encoding one or both variable domains, and cells comprising the nucleic acid molecules are also contemplated. These antibodies can be used in the therapies described herein and to detect \u03b15\u03b21 protein in patient samples (e.g., using FACS, immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA assays) or in patients.","A. Monoclonal Antibodies","Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared, e.g., using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, 256:495 (1975) or can be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) or can be produced by the methods described herein in the Examples below. In a hybridoma method, a hamster, mouse, or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent (e.g., an \u03b15, \u03b21, or \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide alone or in combination with a suitable carrier) to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro.","The immunizing agent will typically include a polypeptide or a fusion protein of the protein of interest or a composition comprising the protein. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes (\u201cPBLs\u201d) are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell. Goding, MA: PP(New York: Academic Press, 1986), pp. 59-103. Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine, and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells can be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies. Kozbor, 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., MAPTA(Marcel Dekker, Inc.: New York, 1987) pp. 51-63.","The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the polypeptide. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, 107:220 (1980).","After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. Goding, supra. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.","The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.","The monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., supra) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.","The antibodies can be monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are known in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy-chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking.","In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly Fab fragments, can be accomplished using, but not limited to, techniques known in the art.","B. Human Antibodies","In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. Human antibodies are described generally in van Dijk and van de Winkel, 5: 368-74 (2001) and Lonberg, 20:450-459 (2008).","Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal's chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, 23:1117-1125 (2005). See also, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 describing XENOMOUSE\u2122 technology; U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,429 describing HM\u00ae technology; U.S. Pat. No. 7,041,870 describing K-M MOUSE\u00ae technology, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007\/0061900, describing VM\u00ae technology). Human variable regions from intact antibodies generated by such animals may be further modified, e.g., by combining with a different human constant region.","Human antibodies can also be made by hybridoma-based methods. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described. (See, e.g., Kozbor 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., , pp. 63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., 147: 86 (1991).) Human antibodies generated via human B-cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li et al., 103:3557-3562 (2006). Additional methods include those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,826 (describing production of monoclonal human IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines) and Ni, 26(4):265-268 (2006) (describing human-human hybridomas). Human hybridoma technology (Trioma technology) is also described in Vollmers and Brandlein, 20(3):927-937 (2005) and Vollmers and Brandlein, 27(3):185-91 (2005).","Human antibodies may also be generated by isolating Fv clone variable domain sequences selected from human-derived phage display libraries. Such variable domain sequences may then be combined with a desired human constant domain. Techniques for selecting human antibodies from antibody libraries are described below.","C. Library-Derived Antibodies","Antibodies of the invention may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2001) and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty et al., 348:552-554; Clackson et al., 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., 222: 581-597 (1992); Marks and Bradbury, in 248:161-175 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003); Sidhu et al., 338(2): 299-310 (2004); Lee et al., 340(5): 1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, 101(34): 12467-12472 (2004); and Lee et al., 284(1-2): 119-132 (2004).","In certain phage display methods, repertoires of VH and VL genes are separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be screened for antigen-binding phage as described in Winter et al., 12: 433-455 (1994). Phage typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned (e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., 12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, 227: 381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,373, and US Patent Publication Nos. 2005\/0079574, 2005\/0119455, 2005\/0266000, 2007\/0117126, 2007\/0160598, 2007\/0237764, 2007\/0292936, and 2009\/0002360.","Antibodies or antibody fragments isolated from human antibody libraries are considered human antibodies or human antibody fragments herein.","D. Chimeric and Humanized Antibodies","In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a chimeric antibody. Certain chimeric antibodies are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., 81:6851-6855 (1984)). In one example, a chimeric antibody comprises a non-human variable region (e.g., a variable region derived from a mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or non-human primate, such as a monkey) and a human constant region. In a further example, a chimeric antibody is a \u201cclass switched\u201d antibody in which the class or subclass has been changed from that of the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen-binding fragments thereof.","In certain embodiments, a chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Typically, a non-human antibody is humanized to reduce immunogenicity to humans, while retaining the specificity and affinity of the parental non-human antibody. Generally, a humanized antibody comprises one or more variable domains in which HVRs, e.g., CDRs, (or portions thereof) are derived from a non-human antibody, and FRs (or portions thereof) are derived from human antibody sequences. A humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of a human constant region. In some embodiments, some FR residues in a humanized antibody are substituted with corresponding residues from a non-human antibody (e.g., the antibody from which the HVR residues are derived), e.g., to restore or improve antibody specificity or affinity.","Humanized antibodies and methods of making them are reviewed, e.g., in Almagro and Fransson, 13:1619-1633 (2008), and are further described, e.g., in Riechmann et al., 332:323-329 (1988); Queen et al., 86:10029-10033 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337, 7,527,791, 6,982,321, and 7,087,409; Kashmiri et al., 36:25-34 (2005) (describing SDR (a-CDR) grafting); Padlan, 28:489-498 (1991) (describing \u201cresurfacing\u201d); Dall'Acqua et al., 36:43-60 (2005) (describing \u201cFR shuffling\u201d); and Osbourn et al., 36:61-68 (2005) and Klimka et al., 83:252-260 (2000) (describing the \u201cguided selection\u201d approach to FR shuffling).","Human framework regions that may be used for humanization include but are not limited to: framework regions selected using the \u201cbest-fit\u201d method (see, e.g., Sims et al. 151:2296 (1993)); framework regions derived from the consensus sequence of human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chain variable regions (see, e.g., Carter et al. 89:4285 (1992); and Presta et al. 151:2623 (1993)); human mature (somatically mutated) framework regions or human germline framework regions (see, e.g., Almagro and Fransson, 13:1619-1633 (2008)); and framework regions derived from screening FR libraries (see, e.g., Baca et al., 272:10678-10684 (1997) and Rosok et al., 271:22611-22618 (1996)).","E. Multi-Specific Antibodies","In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a multispecific antibody, e.g. a bispecific antibody. Multispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for \u03b15\u03b21 and the other is for any other antigen (e.g., VEGF). In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of \u03b15\u03b21. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express \u03b15\u03b21. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments.","Techniques for making multispecific antibodies include, but are not limited to, recombinant co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs having different specificities (see Milstein and Cuello, 305: 537 (1983)), WO 93\/08829, and Traunecker et al., 10: 3655 (1991)), and \u201cknob-in-hole\u201d engineering (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168). Multi-specific antibodies may also be made by engineering electrostatic steering effects for making antibody Fc-heterodimeric molecules (WO 2009\/089004A1); cross-linking two or more antibodies or fragments (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, and Brennan et al., 229: 81 (1985)); using leucine zippers to produce bi-specific antibodies (see, e.g., Kostelny et al., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992)); using \u201cdiabody\u201d technology for making bispecific antibody fragments (see, e.g., Hollinger et al., 90:6444-6448 (1993)); and using single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers (see, e.g. Gruber et al., 152:5368 (1994)); and preparing trispecific antibodies as described, e.g., in Tutt et al. 147: 60 (1991).","Engineered antibodies with three or more functional antigen binding sites, including \u201cOctopus antibodies,\u201d are also included herein (see, e.g. US 2006\/0025576A1). The antibody or fragment herein also includes a \u201cDual Acting FAb\u201d or \u201cDAF\u201d comprising an antigen binding site that binds to \u03b15\u03b21 as well as another, different antigen (see, US 2008\/0069820, for example).","F. Antibody Variants","In certain embodiments, amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies provided herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and\/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and\/or insertions into and\/or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics, e.g., antigen-binding.","1. Substitution, Insertion, and Deletion Variants","In certain embodiments, antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the HVRs and FRs. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \u201cconservative substitutions.\u201d More substantial changes are provided in Table 1 under the heading of \u201cexemplary substitutions,\u201d and as further described below in reference to amino acid side chain classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened for a desired activity, e.g., retained\/improved antigen binding, decreased immunogenicity, or improved ADCC or CDC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0186","num":"0185"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Original","Exemplary","Preferred"]},{"entry":[{},"Residue","Substitutions","Substitutions"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Ala (A)","Val; Leu; Ile","Val"]},{"entry":[{},"Arg (R)","Lys; Gln; Asn","Lys"]},{"entry":[{},"Asn (N)","Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg","Gln"]},{"entry":[{},"Asp (D)","Glu; Asn","Glu"]},{"entry":[{},"Cys (C)","Ser; Ala","Ser"]},{"entry":[{},"Gln (Q)","Asn; Glu","Asn"]},{"entry":[{},"Glu (E)","Asp; Gln","Asp"]},{"entry":[{},"Gly (G)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":[{},"His (H)","Asn; Gln; Lys; Arg","Arg"]},{"entry":[{},"Ile (I)","Leu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe; Norleucine","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},"Leu (L)","Norleucine; Ile; Val; Met; Ala; Phe","Ile"]},{"entry":[{},"Lys (K)","Arg; Gln; Asn","Arg"]},{"entry":[{},"Met (M)","Leu; Phe; Ile","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},"Phe (F)","Trp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr","Tyr"]},{"entry":[{},"Pro (P)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":[{},"Ser (S)","Thr","Thr"]},{"entry":[{},"Thr (T)","Val; Ser","Ser"]},{"entry":[{},"Trp (W)","Tyr; Phe","Tyr"]},{"entry":[{},"Tyr (Y)","Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser","Phe"]},{"entry":[{},"Val (V)","Ile; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala; Norleucine","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;","(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;","(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;","(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;","(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;","(6) aromatic: Tip, Tyr, Phe.","Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.","One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further study will have modifications (e.g., improvements) in certain biological properties (e.g., increased affinity, reduced immunogenicity) relative to the parent antibody and\/or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated, e.g., using phage display-based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly, one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity (e.g. binding affinity).","Alterations (e.g., substitutions) may be made in HVRs, e.g., to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR \u201chotspots,\u201d i.e., residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process (see, e.g., Chowdhury, 207:179-196 (2008)), and\/or SDRs (a-CDRs), with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., (2001).) In some embodiments of affinity maturation, diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods (e.g., error-prone PCR, chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis). A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR-directed approaches, in which several HVR residues (e.g., 4-6 residues at a time) are randomized. HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified, e.g., using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 in particular are often targeted.","In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example, conservative alterations (e.g., conservative substitutions as provided herein) that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may be outside of HVR \u201chotspots\u201d or SDRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above, each HVR either is unaltered, or contains no more than one, two or three amino acid substitutions.","A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called \u201calanine scanning mutagenesis\u201d as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) 244:1081-1085. In this method, a residue or group of target residues (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively, or additionally, a crystal structure of an antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties.","Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and\/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.","2. Glycosylation Variants","In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to an antibody may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed.","Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., Wright et al. 15:26-32 (1997). The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the \u201cstem\u201d of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.","In one embodiment, antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. For example, the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 65%, from 5% to 65% or from 20% to 40%. The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 (e.g. complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008\/077546, for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (Eu numbering of Fc region residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about \u00b13 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003\/0157108 (Presta, L.); US 2004\/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Examples of publications related to \u201cdefucosylated\u201d or \u201cfucose-deficient\u201d antibody variants include: US 2003\/0157108; WO 2000\/61739; WO 2001\/29246; US 2003\/0115614; US 2002\/0164328; US 2004\/0093621; US 2004\/0132140; US 2004\/0110704; US 2004\/0110282; US 2004\/0109865; WO 2003\/085119; WO 2003\/084570; WO 2005\/035586; WO 2005\/035778; WO2005\/053742; WO2002\/031140; Okazaki et al. 336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. 87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. 249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003\/0157108 A1, Presta, L; and WO 2004\/056312 A1, Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (see, e.g., Yamane-Ohnuki et al. 87: 614 (2004); Kanda, Y. et al., 94(4):680-688 (2006); and WO2003\/085107).","Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides, e.g., in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and\/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 2003\/011878 (Jean-Mairet et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.); and US 2005\/0123546 (Umana et al.). Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 1997\/30087 (Patel et al.); WO 1998\/58964 (Raju, S.); and WO 1999\/22764 (Raju, S.).","3. Fc Region Variants","In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein, thereby generating an Fc region variant, so as to enhance, e.g., the effectiveness of the antibody in treating a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and\/or vascular permeability or leakage. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.","In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and\/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction\/depletion of CDC and\/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc\u03b3R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. 83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, I et al., 82:1499-1502 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, M. et al., 166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACTI\u2122 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96\u00ae non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., C1q and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006\/029879 and WO 2005\/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et al., 202:163 (1996); Cragg, M. S. et al., 101:1045-1052 (2003); and Cragg, M. S. and M. J. Glennie, 103:2738-2743 (2004)). FcRn binding and in vivo clearance\/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Petkova, S. B. et al., 18(12):1759-1769 (2006)).","Antibodies with reduced effector function include those with substitution of one or more of Fc region residues 238, 265, 269, 270, 297, 327 and 329 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056). Such Fc mutants include Fc mutants with substitutions at two or more of amino acid positions 265, 269, 270, 297 and 327, including the so-called \u201cDANA\u201d Fc mutant with substitution of residues 265 and 297 to alanine (U.S. Pat. No. 7,332,581).","Certain antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs are described. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056; WO 2004\/056312, and Shields et al., 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).)","In certain embodiments, an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which improve ADCC, e.g., substitutions at positions 298, 333, and\/or 334 of the Fc region (EU numbering of residues).","In some embodiments, alterations are made in the Fc region that result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) C1q binding and\/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551, WO 99\/51642, and Idusogie et al. 164: 4178-4184 (2000).","Mutations or alterations in the Fc region sequences can be made to improve FcR binding (e.g., FcgammaR, FcRn). According to one embodiment, an antibody of this invention has at least one altered effector function selected from the group consisting of ADCC, CDC, and improved FcRn binding compared to a native IgG or a parent antibody. Examples of several useful specific mutations are described in, e.g., Shields, R L et al. (2001) 276(6)6591-6604; Presta, L. G., (2002) 30(4):487-490; and WO 00\/42072. Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., 24:249 (1994)), are described in US2005\/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.). Those antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Such Fc variants include those with substitutions at one or more of Fc region residues: 238, 256, 265, 272, 286, 303, 305, 307, 311, 312, 317, 340, 356, 360, 362, 376, 378, 380, 382, 413, 424 or 434, e.g., substitution of Fc region residue 434 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,371,826).","See also Duncan & Winter, 322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260; U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; and WO 94\/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.","4. Cysteine Engineered Antibody Variants","In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies, e.g., \u201cthioMAbs,\u201d in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments, the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine, reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties, such as drug moieties or linker-drug moieties, to create an immunoconjugate, as described further herein. In certain embodiments, any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine: V205 (Kabat numbering) of the light chain; A118 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain; and S400 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain Fc region. Cysteine engineered antibodies may be generated as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541.","In some embodiments, cysteine residue(s) can be introduced into the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated can have improved internalization capability and\/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See, Caron et al., 176: 1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, 148: 2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity can also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al., 53: 2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered that has dual Fc regions and can thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See, Stevenson et al., -3: 219-230 (1989).","5. Antibody Derivatives","In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein may be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. The moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody include but are not limited to water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene\/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide\/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and\/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.","In another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (Kam et al., 102: 11600-11605 (2005)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody-nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.","G. Immunoconjugates","The invention also provides immunoconjugates comprising an anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibody herein conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents or drugs, growth inhibitory agents, toxins (e.g., protein toxins, enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or radioactive isotopes.","In one embodiment, an immunoconjugate is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in which an antibody is conjugated to one or more drugs, including but not limited to a maytansinoid (see U.S. Pat.

In one embodiment, an \u201cindividual\u201d is a human.","In a further aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising any of the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies provided herein, e.g., for use in any of the above therapeutic methods. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies provided herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies provided herein and at least one additional therapeutic agent, e.g., as described herein.","Combination therapies described herein encompass combined administration (where two, three, four, or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to, simultaneously, and\/or following, administration of the additional therapeutic agent and\/or adjuvant. Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.","In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a VEGF antagonist (e.g., an anti-VEGF antibody such as, for example, bevacizumab). In some embodiments, the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies are administered in combination with a VEGF antagonist. The anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibody and additional agent (e.g., a VEGF antagonist) can be administered concurrently or sequentially. Alternatively, the subject can be treated with the VEGF antagonist and subsequently administered the \u03b15\u03b21 antagonist, e.g., treating with the VEGF antagonist until the subject is unresponsive to VEGF antagonist treatment and then treating the subject is treated with an \u03b15\u03b21 antagonist. According to one embodiment, the subject is treated with the VEGF antagonist when the cancer is non-invasive and then treated with the \u03b15\u03b21 antagonist when the cancer is invasive. Some patients who experience elevated \u03b15\u03b21 levels naturally or in response to VEGF antagonist therapy, compared to non-diseased patients or control, can be especially responsive to this combination treatment. Combinations further comprising a therapeutic agent (e.g., an anti-neoplastic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, a growth inhibitory agent and a cytotoxic agent) are contemplated. For example, patients who are to be treated with chemotherapy (e.g., irinotecan) and \u03b15\u03b21 antagonists, or who have been treated with chemotherapy and \u03b15\u03b21 antagonists, can benefit from VEGF antagonist therapy. Alternatively, patients who have been treated with chemotherapy and VEGF antagonists can benefit from \u03b15\u03b21 antagonist therapy. In one embodiment, the anti-VEGF antibody is bevacizumab. In another embodiment, the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibody is an anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibody described herein.","An antibody of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic. Various dosing schedules including but not limited to single or multiple administrations over various time-points, bolus administration, and pulse infusion are contemplated herein.","Antibodies of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically\/clinically determined to be appropriate.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg\/kg-10 mg\/kg) of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg\/kg, 2.0 mg\/kg, 4.0 mg\/kg or 10 mg\/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.","Depending on the indication to be treated and factors relevant to the dosing that a physician of skill in the field would be familiar with, the antibodies of the invention will be administered at a dosage that is efficacious for the treatment of that indication while minimizing toxicity and side effects.","Cancer treatments can be evaluated by, e.g., but not limited to, tumor regression, tumor weight or size shrinkage, time to progression, duration of survival, progression free survival, overall response rate, duration of response, quality of life, protein expression and\/or activity. Because the anti-angiogenic agents described herein target the tumor vasculature and not necessarily the neoplastic cells themselves, they represent a unique class of anticancer drugs, and therefore can require unique measures and definitions of clinical responses to drugs. For example, tumor shrinkage of greater than 50% in a 2-dimensional analysis is the standard cut-off for declaring a response. However, the \u03b15\u03b21 antagonists and VEGF antagonists of the invention may cause inhibition of metastatic spread without shrinkage of the primary tumor, or may simply exert a tumouristatic effect. Accordingly, approaches to determining efficacy of the therapy can be employed, including for example, measurement of plasma or urinary markers of angiogenesis and measurement of response through radiological imaging.","Evaluation of treatments for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) includes, but it is not limited to, a decrease in the rate of further vision loss or the prevention of further vision loss. For AMD therapy, efficacy in vivo can, for example, be measured by one or more of the following: assessing the mean change in the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to a desired time, assessing the proportion of subjects who lose fewer than 15 letters in visual acuity at a desired time compared with baseline, assessing the proportion of subjects who gain greater than or equal to 15 letters in visual acuity at a desired time compared with baseline, assessing the proportion of subjects with a visual-acuity Snellen equivalent of 20\/2000 or worse at desired time, assessing the NEI Visual Functioning Questionnaire, assessing the size of CNV and amount of leakage of CNV at a desired time, as assessed by fluorescein angiography, and the like.","The anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies can be formulated with suitable carriers or excipients so that they are suitable for administration. Suitable formulations of the antibodies are obtained by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as olyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Exemplary antibody formulations are described in WO98\/56418, expressly incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carriers herein further include insterstitial drug dispersion agents such as soluble neutral-active hyaluronidase glycoproteins (sHASEGP), for example, human soluble PH-20 hyaluronidase glycoproteins, such as rHuPH20 (HYLENEX\u00ae, Baxter International, Inc.). Certain exemplary sHASEGPs and methods of use, including rHuPH20, are described in US Patent Publication Nos. 2005\/0260186 and 2006\/0104968. In one aspect, a sHASEGP is combined with one or more additional glycosaminoglycanases such as chondroitinases. Lyophilized formulations adapted for subcutaneous administration are described in WO97\/04801. Such lyophilized formulations may be reconstituted with a suitable diluent to a high protein concentration and the reconstituted formulation may be administered subcutaneously to the mammal to be treated herein.","The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide an anti-neoplastic agent, a growth inhibitory agent, a cytotoxic agent, and\/or a chemotherapeutic agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disease or disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.","The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antagonist, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","Lipofectins or liposomes can be used to deliver the polypeptides and antibodies or compositions of this invention into cells. Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example, based upon the variable-region sequences of an antibody, peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and\/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See, e.g., Marasco et al., 90: 7889-7893 (1993).","The active ingredients can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's PS, supra.","Sustained-release preparations can be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and \u03b3 ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they can denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37\u00b0 C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S\u2014S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization can be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.","The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","Labeled anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies, and derivatives and analogs thereof, which specifically bind to an \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases and\/or disorders associated with the expression, aberrant expression and\/or activity of \u03b15\u03b21. For example, the anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies of the invention can be used in in situ, in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro diagnostic assays or imaging assays.","Methods for detecting expression of an \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide in cells (e.g., tissue) or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies of this invention and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.","Additional embodiments of the invention include methods of diagnosing a disease or disorder associated with expression or aberrant expression of \u03b15\u03b21 in an animal (e.g., a mammal such as a human). The methods comprise detecting \u03b15\u03b21 molecules in the mammal. In one embodiment, after administering a VEGF antagonist, diagnosis comprises: (a) administering an effective amount of a labeled anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibody to a mammal (b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled \u03b15\u03b21 antibody to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the \u03b15\u03b21 molecule is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); (c) determining background level; and (d) detecting the labeled molecule in the subject, such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with expression or aberrant expression of \u03b15\u03b21. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Jalkanen, et al., 101:976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, et al., 105:3087-3096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), and technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, Ru; luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","Techniques known in the art may be applied to labeled antibodies of the invention. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of bifunctional conjugating agents (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,065; 5,714,631; 5,696,239; 5,652,361; 5,505,931; 5,489,425; 5,435,990; 5,428,139; 5,342,604; 5,274,119; 4,994,560; and 5,808,003).","According to one specific embodiment, \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide expression or overexpression is determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay after administration of a VEGF antagonist therapeutic agent by evaluating levels of \u03b15\u03b21 present on the surface of a cell (e.g., via an immunohistochemistry assay using anti-\u03b15\u03b21 antibodies). Alternatively, or additionally, one can measure levels of \u03b15\u03b21 polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid or mRNA in the cell, e.g., via fluorescent in situ hybridization using a nucleic acid based probe corresponding to an \u03b15\u03b21-encoding nucleic acid or the complement thereof; (FISH; see WO98\/45479 published October, 1998), Southern blotting, Northern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR(RT-PCR). One can also study \u03b15\u03b21 overexpression by measuring shed antigen in a biological fluid such as serum, e.g., using antibody-based assays (see also, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,294 issued Jun. 12, 1990; WO91\/05264 published Apr. 18, 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,638 issued Mar. 28, 1995; and Sias et al., 132:73-80 (1990)). Aside from the above assays, various in vivo and ex vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one can expose cells within the body of the mammal to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g., a radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to the can be evaluated, e.g., by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a sample (e.g., a biopsy or other biological sample) taken from a mammal previously exposed to the antibody.","Another embodiment of the invention is an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of cancer (e.g. tumors), ocular disease (e.g., wet AMD) or autoimmune diseases and related conditions. The article of manufacture can comprise a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. Generally, the container holds a composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a VEGF antagonist or an \u03b15\u03b21 antagonist or an VEGF agonist or an \u03b15\u03b21 agonist of the invention.
