Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a car control method and, specifically, to a car control method for suitably controlling drive or braking force applied to wheels and suppressing disturbance applied to tires and an apparatus for use in the method.","2. Description of the Prior Art","In the prior art, to control the running state of a car by controlling drive force applied to drive wheels, in the case of an engine-drive car, the target engine speed is calculated based on the input acceleration signal, and the opening of a throttle valve is controlled to adjust the engine speed so that the actual car speed detected by a car speed sensor becomes a car speed calculated from the above target engine speed so as to control drive torque applied to an output shaft connected to the drive wheels.","In an electric car in which drive wheels are driven or braked by an electric motor, as shown in the control flow of , the output torque of an electric motor M for driving or braking drive wheels R is detected by drive torque detection means , the wheel speed is detected by a wheel speed sensor , the target wheel speed in a sticky state is calculated from the target drive force (motor torque instruction value) for obtaining required drive torque and the detected output torque of the motor by target wheel speed calculating means  so that the above detected wheel speed becomes the above target wheel speed, and drive or braking force generated by the above electric motor M is controlled by motor drive and control means  to adjust drive or braking force applied to the drive wheels R. At this point, the ratio of the above wheel torque to car body drive force is controlled to become equal to the ratio of the mass of the wheels to the mass of the car body. The motor drive and control means  controls the size of a current running through the above electric motor M by detecting the torque of the output shaft of the motor or directly detecting a motor current.","When the vibration of the car is caused by fluctuations in the output torque of the electric motor M, as means of controlling this vibration, for example, there are proposed a method in which motor torque is detected as a motor revolution angle \u03b8m or a motor revolution speed \u03c9m, the difference \u201ce\u201d between this \u03b8m or \u03c9m and the estimated value \u03b8me of the motor revolution angle or the estimated value \u03c9me of the motor revolution speed based on a plant model is calculated and disturbance torque is estimated from this difference \u201ce\u201d to control motor torque to be input into the actual plant (for example, see Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2000-217209) and a method in which the difference \u0394\u03c9 between the average revolution \u03c9M of the motor and the average revolution \u03c9b of the drive wheels is calculated by detecting these and a torque instruction value \u03c4M to be input into the motor is corrected with a correction value \u03c4\u2032 obtained by multiplying this difference \u0394\u03c9 by a gain k (for example, see Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2002-152916).","For a car having an SR motor driven by a switching circuit, there is also proposed a method in which a signal having a resonance frequency band is extracted from a motor revolution signal detected from the motor by a bandpass filter and fed back to reduce fluctuations in the revolution of a motor shaft caused by the vibration of the motor due to the resonance of the motor or the car body (for example, see Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2002-171778).","In the above car control, to control the attitude of the car or car speed detected by a yaw rate sensor or car speed sensor, drive or braking force applied to the drive wheels is controlled according to the time constant of the behavior of the car to be controlled.","Stated more specifically, a high-frequency component which becomes a noise component to the behavior of the car is removed by a low-pass filter in the loop to control drive or braking force applied to the drive wheels at a control cycle of about 100 msec to 10 sec in an engine-drive car or at a control cycle of about 1 msec to 10 sec in an electric car.","When the car runs on a road having a low coefficient of friction, the running state of the car is controlled based on the estimated coefficient of road friction. As means of estimating the coefficient of road friction, for example, there is proposed a method in which the vibration of the wheel speed is extracted to improve the accuracy of response output to an input into a wheel resonance system including friction characteristics between the tires and the road surface, only a cyclic vibration is selected from this vibration of the wheel speed, and the transmission function of the wheel resonance system is identified based on this cyclic vibration (see Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 11-178120).","To suppress the spinning of the wheels when a car suddenly starts to run on a road having a low coefficient of friction, as shown in , the car body speed is detected by a car body speed sensor , the slip ratio which is determined by the speed difference between the wheel speed and the car body speed generated by the spinning of the wheels from the above detected car body speed and the wheel speed detected by the wheel sensor  is calculated by slip ratio calculating means , and the above target wheel speed is corrected so that the above slip ratio becomes a preset slip ratio to suppress a rise in the above slip ratio, thereby shorting the drive or braking distance. Since drive or braking force applied to the drive wheels is controlled based on information on the behavior of the car, this control is also carried out at the same control frequency.","There is also proposed a method in which the acceleration of the drive wheels is detected by an acceleration sensor in place of the slip ratio calculated from the speed difference between the car body speed and the wheel speed and it is judged whether the car slips or not from the relationship between the output of this acceleration sensor and an increase in the revolution of the drive wheels. When it is judged that the car slips, the motor torque is reduced (for example, see Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 11-178120).","There is further proposed a method in which, by applying micro-vibration having a higher frequency than the response frequency of the car body to the tires according to the condition of the road in order to change friction force between the tires and the road surface, the running state of the car is controlled by adjusting the friction force of the tires while the slip ratio or slip angle of the tires is kept constant (for example, see the pamphlet of WO02\/00463).","However, since the influence of disturbance (micro-vibration) applied to the tires caused by fluctuations in the contact pressure of the tires due to changes in the condition of the road and changes in the vibration of unsprung mass including the suspension and having a cycle of 100 msec or less cannot be compensated for by the general control of the above engine-drive car, the road holding properties of the tires deteriorate. Meanwhile, in the electric car, although shorter cyclic control than that of the engine-drive car is possible, a higher frequency band fluctuating component than the response frequency of the car body included in the above detected motor torque and wheel speed cannot be specified, thereby making it impossible to compensate for the influence of disturbance applied to the tires.","Since only the friction force of the tires is controlled in the method in which micro-vibration is directly applied to the tires, it cannot be said that the control of the attitude of the car and the car speed is satisfactory.","Further, as the control of the attitude of the car and the car speed and the control of the slip ratio are carried out at the same control frequency range, over-feedback occurs for the control of the attitude of the car and the car speed. Thus, satisfactory car control is impossible.","It is an object of the present invention which has been made in view of the above problems of the prior art to provide a car control method capable of improving the road holding properties of the tires by compensating for disturbance applied to the tires and the driving stability of the car and an apparatus used in the method.","The inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies and have found that the running state of a car can be stabilized by extracting a change in wheel speed or car body drive force and suppressing the extracted change in wheel speed or car body drive force. The present invention has been accomplished based on this finding. Stated more specifically, a change in the attitude of the car body or car speed included in any one of wheel speed detected by a wheel sensor and car body drive force for moving forward the car body generated on the tire contact surface and obtained from drive force and wheel torque applied to each drive wheel and further fluctuating components caused by the disturbance of each tire are separated and extracted to be fed back to the target drive force directly, or drive force or braking force to be applied to the drive wheel is controlled according to these fluctuating components, and further vibration is applied to the tire to suppress the deformation of the tire caused by the above tire disturbance, thereby suppressing vibration caused by a change in drive force or the above disturbance. Thus, stable car control becomes possible.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method comprising the steps of:","detecting drive force and wheel torque applied to each drive wheel;","calculating car body drive force from the above detected drive force and wheel torque;","extracting at least one frequency band fluctuating component of the calculated car body drive force; and","driving or braking the wheel or applying vibration to the wheel based on the extracted fluctuating component of the car body drive force to control the running state of the car.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein multiple frequency band fluctuating components of the calculated car body drive force are extracted to control drive or braking force applied to the drive wheel based on the extracted fluctuating components of the car body drive force. Thereby, the controls of driving or braking the car, car attitude, the suppression of a rise in slip ratio and the compensation of tire disturbance can be carried out at the same time and accurately.","According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein, in an engine-drive car, drive force applied to the output shaft of the drive wheel is detected, and fluctuating components including at least a frequency band of 10 Hz to 1 kHz are extracted from car body drive force calculated from the drive force and wheel torque to control the running state of the car based on the above extracted fluctuating components. Thereby, the influence of disturbance (micro-vibration) applied to each tire caused by a change in the vertical pressure of the tire due to a change in the condition of the road and a change in the vibration of unsprung mass including the suspension and having a cycle of 100 msec or less can be compensated for, and the road holding properties of the tire can be thereby improved.","According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein, in a car driven or braked by a motor, drive or braking force generated by a motor for driving or braking the drive wheel is detected, and fluctuating components including at least a frequency band of 10 Hz to 10 kHz are extracted from car body drive force calculated from the drive or braking force and wheel torque. Thereby, the influence of disturbance (micro-vibration) applied to each tire caused by a change in the vertical pressure of the tire due to a change in the condition of the road and a change in the vibration of unsprung mass including the suspension and having a cycle of 100 msec or less can be compensated for without fail, and the road holding properties of the tire can be thereby further improved.","According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein a 10 Hz to 200 Hz fluctuating component out of the fluctuating components of the car body drive force is extracted to suppress a change in the car body drive force. Thereby, disturbance at a tire dynamic frequency band lower than the micro-vibration caused by the influence of the pattern block or sipe of the tread and caused by the natural vibration of a tire case out of the above 10 Hz to 10 kHz fluctuating components is suppressed to reduce a change in the car body drive force.","According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein a 30 to 100 Hz fluctuating component out of the fluctuating components of the car body drive force is extracted to suppress a change in the car body drive force. Thereby, disturbance at a frequency close to the resonance frequencies of the longitudinal spring and front and rear springs of the tire out of the above 10 Hz to 10 kHz fluctuating components can be suppressed.","According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein left and right drive wheels are controlled independently. Unlike torque distribution by a differential such as a gear in the prior art, there is no limitation by the drive torque of the other drive wheel, thereby making it possible to set the drive torques of the left and right drive wheels to suitable values.","According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, therein the left and right drive wheels are controlled independently based on a change in steering properties. Since a change in steering properties can be thereby suppressed, the attitude of the car and the car speed can be controlled without fail.","According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein the running state of the car is controlled based on a vertical load applied to each tire. A change in friction force between the tire and the road surface caused by a change in the vertical load applied to the tire can be compensated for, thereby making it possible to further improve the controllability of the car.","According to a tenth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method, wherein at least one frequency band change in the wheel such as wheel speed or wheel torque is extracted and the drive wheel is driven or braked so that a change in the wheel is suppressed based on the extracted change in the wheel.","According to an eleventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control method; wherein a change including at least a frequency band of 10 Hz to 10 kHz in the wheel is extracted and the drive or braking force of the motor for driving or braking the drive wheel is controlled with this extracted change in the wheel.","According to a twelfth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus comprising:","means of detecting the wheel speed of each drive wheel;","means of calculating wheel torque from the detected wheel speed;","means of detecting drive force applied to the drive wheel;","means of calculating car body drive force from the drive force and wheel torque;","means of extracting at least one frequency band fluctuating component from the calculated car body drive force; and","running state control means for controlling the running state of a car based on the extracted fluctuating component of the car body drive force.","A change in the attitude of the car or the speed of the car included in the fluctuating component of the car body drive force and further a fluctuating component caused by tire disturbance are separated and extracted to control the running state of the car based on these fluctuating components, thereby improving the controllability of the car.","According to a thirteenth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein drive or braking force generated by a motor for driving or braking the drive wheel is detected to detect drive or braking force applied to the drive wheel.","According to a fourteenth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein the running state control means has means of driving or braking the wheel based on the extracted fluctuating component of the car body drive force.","According to a fifteenth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein means of calculating the speed difference between the car body speed and the wheel speed by extracting a 0.2 Hz to 100 Hz frequency band fluctuating component of the car body drive force is provided to drive or brake the wheel based on the calculated speed difference.

Thereby, the stability of attitude control can be further improved.","According to a nineteenth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein the running state control means has means of applying vibration to the tire to compensate for the influence of micro-vibration applied to the tire.","According to a twentieth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein means of calculating disturbance applied to the tire by extracting a 10 Hz to 10 kHz frequency band fluctuating component of the car body drive force is provided to apply vibration to the tire based on the calculated disturbance.","According to a twenty-first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein a 10 Hz to 200 Hz frequency band fluctuating component out of the fluctuating components of the car body drive force is extracted to suppress disturbance at a tire dynamic frequency band caused by the natural vibration of a tire case included in the fluctuating component, thereby reducing a change in the car body drive force.","According to a twenty-second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein a 30 Hz to 100 Hz frequency band fluctuating component out of the fluctuating components of the car body drive force is extracted to suppress disturbance at a frequency near the resonance frequencies of the longitudinal spring and front and rear springs of the tire included in the above fluctuating component, thereby reducing a change in the car body drive force.","According to a twenty-third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus, wherein means of detecting a vertical load applied to the tire is provided to control the running state of the car based on the detected vertical load. Since a change in friction force between the tire and the road surface caused by a change in the vertical load applied to the tire can be thereby compensated for, the controllability of the car can be further improved.","According to a twenty-fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a car control apparatus which further comprises means of detecting the displacement of a suspension, means of detecting the normal acceleration of the wheel and means of calculating the vertical load from the detected displacement of the suspension and the normal acceleration of the wheel.

The slip ratio control drive force for correcting the above drive force is calculated so that the above calculated slip ratio becomes a preset slip ratio and the above main drive force is corrected with the above slip ratio control drive force to control the slip ratio.","Stated more specifically, as drive force is not transmitted to the surface of a road having a low coefficient of friction when the car moves into this road such as a water pool from a normal road (\u03bc\u22481) the wheels run idle. Therefore, the extracted wheel speed Vrises and the speed difference between the wheel speed Vand the car body speed V is produced by a rise in the fluctuating component of the extracted wheel speed V, thereby increasing the slip ratio. When the target slip ratio is represented by \u03bb, slip ratio control drive force which ensures that the wheel speed Vbecomes V=(1\u2212\u03bb)Vis obtained.

The slip ratio control drive force does not become effective even when a change in time constant much faster than a time constant at the time of a change in the behavior of the car body is compensated for. In this embodiment, a 0.2 Hz to 100 Hz frequency band component Fsuitable for the control of the wheel speed is used to obtain slip ratio control drive force at that frequency band, thereby making possible the accurate control of the slip ratio.","Further, in this embodiment, the high-frequency component extracting means C extracts a 10 Hz to 10 KHz frequency band component F, and the tire disturbance compensation drive force calculating means  calculates tire disturbance compensation drive force for compensating for a change in drive force caused by the disturbance Nof the above tire contact surface and the vibration Nof unsprung mass and applies this tire disturbance compensation drive force to the above wheel control means  to superimpose it on the main drive force. Thus, the influence of the disturbance of the tire contact surface or the vibration of unsprung mass is compensated for. The above disturbance may be suppressed by applying micro-vibration to the tires separately.","In general, when the control cycle becomes short, the control cycle becomes close to the response time constant of the tires. In this embodiment, each wheel (drive wheel) is not considered as an integrated unit of the wheel and a tire but disturbance applied to each tire is detected by extracting a drive force component having a frequency band caused by the dynamics of the tire to control the dynamic properties of the tire. The fluctuating component having the above frequency band of the drive force is generated between the tire and the road surface and much faster than the behavior of the car body and the operation speed of a driver and deteriorates the road holding properties of the tire.

Further, a 30 Hz to 100 Hz fluctuating component is extracted from the above fluctuating component of the car body drive force, and a change in drive force at a frequency near the resonance frequencies of the longitudinal spring and the front and rear springs of the tire which is increased by the above disturbance is suppressed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIGS. 6(","FIG. 7"],"i":["a","b"],"b":"6","sub":["m ","w ","m ","w ","d ","d "]},"Since friction force between the tire and the road surface is in proportion to the vertical pressure (vertical load), to improve controllability, the above main drive force must be corrected to become proportional to the above vertical load.","In this embodiment, the above vertical load is detected by the vertical load detection means  to correct the main drive force. More specifically, as shown in , the normal accelerometers L and R are attached to the left and right drive wheels L and R to calculate forces applied to unsprung mass, and the suspension displacement meters L and R are attached to the suspensions to calculate forces applied to the suspensions from the displacements of the suspensions and displacement accelerations and to add up these two forces to calculate a displacement load. A load at a standstill obtained from the displacement of the suspension when the car is at a standstill is added to this displacement load to detect the above vertical load on a real-time basis.","A description is subsequently given of the turning stability control of the present invention.","The running state detection means  detects a change in steering properties from steering angle signals from the steering angle detection means  and yaw rate signals from the yaw rate sensors  to adjust the sizes of drive or braking forces for the left and right drive wheels L and R. In this embodiment, unlike the drive force control of the prior art, the left and right drive wheels L and R are controlled independently. That is, as the total of drive torques is constant in the control of the prior art, the drive torque of one drive wheel is limited by the other drive torque. In this embodiment, the left and right drive wheels L and R are driven or braked independently.","For instance, when the car speed becomes close to the critical speed for the turning radius and the behavior of the car body is changed to over-steering (O\/S), the distribution of drive forces to the drive wheels L and R is controlled to change the behavior of the car body to under-steering (U\/S), thereby keeping turning while suppressing spinning. In the present invention, the running state detection means  comprising the steering property detection means  and the car body instability judging means  is provided to detect a change in steering properties from steering angle signals and yaw rate signals in order to judge the instability of the car body and to control drive forces for the left and right drive wheels L and R according to the change in steering properties.","For instance, when the car speed becomes close to the critical speed for the turning radius, drive force on the inner side of turning is increased and drive force on the outer side of turning is reduced to generate drive force in the under-steering (U\/S) direction. Since the tire stress becomes the largest and the vertical load on the outer side of turning becomes high when drive force is not generated, the car can be turned without impairing its turning speed by the control of turning in this embodiment.","The car body instability judging means  judges the instability of the car body from the size of an instability parameter which is the distance between the broken line  showing the relationship between steering angle (deg) and yaw rate (deg\/sec) at the time of normal operation determined by the characteristics of the car and the center point of the locus of a spinning point (X, Y) representing the steering angle (X coordinate) and yaw rate (Y coordinate) at the time of turning, represented by the arrow  in .","Since the spinning point (X, Y) is located below the broken line  in the figure and the car is turning to the left, the car tends to be over-steered. Therefore, when the above instability parameter is much larger than that of the above case and it is judged that the car body is unstable, drive force on the inner side of turning is increased and drive force on the outer side of turning is reduced in proportion to the above distance (instability parameter) while the current drive force is maintained. Thereby, the hysteresis of the steering angle decreases and both the operation ease and stability of the car can be improved.","When the car does not turn in only one direction but needs to change its direction abruptly, drive force is applied to the opposite (back) side according to circumstances not to impair driving stability. It is needless to say that the above slip ratio control, tire disturbance compensation and vertical load compensation are made on drive wheels in which drive force still remains to achieve car stability.","The electric motors L and R used in the present invention are preferably an outer rotor or inner rotor type direct drive in-wheel motor for directly driving or braking the drive wheels L and R as described above, respectively. However, as a double-inertia system is employed when the gears are back-crashed, unnecessary vibration is generated. Accordingly, a gearless direct drive in-wheel motor is preferably used. As the gearless direct drive in-wheel motor is free from the back-crash of the gears, control at a high frequency can be carried out without fail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["40","40","40","40","40","40","40","40","42","41","41","41","41","40","44","43","40"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","j","a ","a ","b ","a ","b "]},"The above flexible coupling  comprises a hollow disk-like motor-side plate , a hollow disk-like wheel-side plate attached to the wheel  and a plurality of cross guides  for interconnecting the above plates and . Each of the cross guides  is a combination of crossing two-axis direct-driven guides as shown in ), and a motor-side guide rail A and a wheel-side guide rail B can move in crossing directions along the guide grooves and of a cross guide body C.","As shown in ), the flexible coupling  has four cross guides  at equal intervals (90\u00b0) between the motor-side plate and the wheel-side plate , and the moving directions of the motor-side guide rails A of the above cross guides  are all at 45\u00b0 from the radial direction of the above rotor R. Therefore, the moving directions of the motor-side guide rails A are all the same (45\u00b0), and the moving directions of all the wheel-side guide rails B become perpendicular to the moving directions of the motor-side guide rails A.","Accordingly, torque from the rotary case of the in-wheel motor  is applied to the motor-side guide rails A through the motor-side plate . The force in the circumferential direction applied to the motor-side guide rails A is transmitted to the wheel-side guide rails B through the cross guide bodies C to drive the wheel .","When the gearless direct drive in-wheel motor  is used as the electric motor and mounted to the knuckle  as a car wheel part by the buffer mechanism  as described above, and the rotary case is attached to the wheel  through the flexible coupling , vibration caused by the disturbance of the contact surface applied from the tire  and vibration caused by fluctuations in the road holding force of the tire such as the vibration of unsprung mass can be suppressed. Therefore, as vibration applied to the wheel is further reduced, the frequency range to be controlled is narrowed, the degree of freedom of choosing a control frequency increases, and the fluctuation level itself becomes low, control at a high frequency range can be carried out easily and more stable and highly accurate control becomes possible.","According to this embodiment, the car control apparatus comprises the wheel speed sensor  for detecting the wheel speed Vof each drive wheel , the wheel torque calculating means  for calculating wheel torque Ffrom the above wheel speed V, the drive force detecting means  for detecting drive force F(drive or braking forces) generated by the electric motor  for driving or braking the dive wheel , the car body drive force calculating means  for calculating car body drive force Ffrom the above drive force Fand the wheel torque F, the car body drive force fluctuating component extracting means  for extracting multiple frequency band fluctuating components of the above car body drive force F, and the drive or braking force control unit  for controlling the running state of the car by calculating main drive force for driving the drive wheel , slip ratio control drive force for controlling drive or braking force applied to the drive wheel  based on the slip ratio calculated from the speed difference between the car body speed and the wheel speed and tire disturbance compensation drive force for compensating for disturbance applied to the tire. The optimum drive force to be applied to the drive wheel  is calculated from the above calculated main drive force, slip ratio control drive force and tire disturbance compensation drive force and supplied to the motor controller  to drive or brake the drive wheel  and to apply micro-vibration to the tire in order to suppress micro-vibration generated between the tire and the road surface. Therefore, the car control apparatus can control the attitude of the car and the car speed without fail and can improve the road holding properties of the tires. Therefore, the driving stability can be improved and car control characteristics can also be improved.","Since the left and right drive wheels are controlled independently, the turning stability of the car can be improved.","The car control apparatus  further comprises the steering angle detection means  for detecting the steering angle of a steering system, the yaw rate sensor  for detecting the yaw rate of the car body, the steering property detection means  for detecting the changed condition of steering, that is, over-steering or under-steering from the above detected steering angle and yaw rate, and the car body instability judging means  for judging the instability of the car body from a change in the above steering properties. When it is judged that the car body is unstable, one or both of drive force on the inner side of turning and drive force on the outer side of turning are increased or reduced according to the change in steering properties, thereby making it possible to greatly improve the turning stability of the car.","Since the vertical load detecting means L and R for detecting a vertical load to be applied to each tire are provided to control the above drive force based on the detected vertical load, a change in friction force between the tire and the road surface caused by a change in the vertical load applied to the tire can be compensated for, thereby making it possible to further improve the controllability of the car.","In this embodiment, the electric car has been described. In the case of an engine-drive car, drive force and wheel torque are detected to calculate car body drive force, and multiple frequency band fluctuating components are extracted from a change in the car body drive force to control drive force applied to each drive wheel based on the extracted fluctuating components of the car body drive force. Thereby, the same effect as above can be obtained. Since the control cycle of the engine-drive car is longer than that of the electric car, a frequency band component including a frequency of 10 Hz to 1 kHz is extracted from the car body drive force to control the above drive force.","Although tire disturbance is compensated for by superimposing tire disturbance compensation drive force obtained by the tire disturbance compensation drive force calculating means  on the main drive force in the above embodiment, an actuator for applying micro-vibration in the revolution direction or width direction of the wheels to the drive wheels L and R or the coupled wheels L and R is provided and driven to apply micro-vibration to the tires based on the above calculated tire disturbance compensation drive force in order to reduce the influence of the above tire disturbance.","While a two-wheel drive car having rear wheels as drive wheels and front wheels as coupled wheels has been described in this embodiment, it is needless to say that the same control can be applied to a two-wheel drive car or four-wheel drive car. In this embodiment, the drive force detection means L and R detect drive forces generated by the electric motors  for driving the drive wheels L and R and output from the motor controllers L and R, respectively. The above drive forces generated by the electric motors  may be obtained by detecting the torques of the output shafts of the above motors  or by directly detecting the drive currents of the motors .","In the above embodiment, three frequency band fluctuating components are extracted from the fluctuating components of the car body drive force. The number and bandwidths of frequency bands used for control are not limited to those of the above embodiment and suitably determined by the performance and target specifications of the car.","In the above embodiment, car body drive force Fis calculated from drive force Fand wheel torque Fgenerated by the electric motor  for driving or braking the drive wheel , and the drive wheel  is driven or braked based on the multiple fluctuating components of the above car body drive force F, or micro-vibration is applied to the tire. Since vibration caused by a change in the road holding force of the tire at a frequency band of 10 Hz to 10 kHz which is higher than the behavior of the car or the operation speed of a driver is reflected on a change in each wheel such as a change in the wheel speed or wheel torque, even when the change in the wheel is suppressed by detecting the change in the wheel itself and controlling drive or braking force for driving or braking the drive wheel with only the detected change in the wheel, the road holding properties of the tire can be fully improved. Stated more specifically, as shown in , the wheel speed of the drive wheel  is detected by the wheel speed sensor , a fluctuating component of the above wheel speed is extracted, drive force proportional to the fluctuating component of the above wheel speed is subtracted from the instruction value of drive force Fto be applied to the motor controller  for controlling the electric motor  in order to cancel a change in the wheel speed, that is, a change in the wheel caused by a change in the road holding force of the tire such as a fluctuating component caused by the disturbance Nof the tire contact surface or a fluctuating component caused by the vibration Nof unsprung mass. The fluctuating component of the wheel speed detected by the wheel speed sensor  used for control is a 10 Hz to 10 kHz frequency band fluctuating component as described above. Alternatively, in place of the above fluctuating component of the wheel speed, a fluctuating component of the wheel torque calculated from the wheel speed is obtained to control the above electric motor  so as to cancel this fluctuating component of the wheel torque.","To verify the effect of the present invention, a two-wheel independently controlling electric car is used as a test car to carry out a turning and running test so as to measure its critical turning speed. The friction coefficient of the test road was 0.4, and the radius of turning was 30 m. The car kept turning by increasing its car speed and the speed when the amount of steering exceeded a threshold value was taken as a critical speed. The test car was apt to be over-steered at a critical range. Therefore, when the car turned to the left, the steering angle indicator swung to the right so as to suppress spinning at the critical range. The speed when the steering angle indicator swung to the right was taken as the above critical speed.","Table 1 below shows the comparison of the critical speed between the control (no control) of the prior art and the control of the present invention.
