Anderson, and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MITIGATING INTERFERENCE FROM TERRESTRIAL BROADCASTS SHARING THE SAME CHANNEL WITH SATELLITE BROADCASTS USING AN ANTENNA WITH POSTERIOR SIDELOBES,\u201d all of which application is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to systems and methods receiving broadcast signals, and in particular to a system and method for receiving simultaneous terrestrial and satellite broadcasts sharing the same channel using an antenna with posterior sidelobes and anterior nulls.","2. Description of the Related Art","It has been proposed to cooperatively share the current Broadcast Satellite Service (BSS) frequency bands to allow additional programming material to be transmitted to BSS users or subscribers using the same frequency bands as currently used by BSS satellites. This is implemented through the use of terrestrial based transmitters to transmit the additional programming.","One such system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,761,605, issued to Tawil et al. on Jun. 2, 1998, which patent is hereby incorporated by reference herein. This patent describes a system in which transmissions from the terrestrial transmitter are received by a second antenna at the user's premises that faces in the opposite azimuthal direction from the BSS satellite receive antenna.","Fundamental to any such system, including the system disclosed in the '605 patent, is that the isolation between the signals from the terrestrial source and the satellite source must be sufficient to prevent interference. While the foregoing system applies to simultaneous channel sharing between satellite and terrestrial transmitters, it requires a BSS satellite ground antenna having highly directional, monocular sensitivity characteristics in order to realize low interference levels. Such antennae can be difficult and expensive to design and produce. Further, it is impractical to replace or modify the several million BSS satellite receive antennae now in use which do not have the desired highly-directional monocular sensitivity. Thus, any simultaneous use of the BSS bandwidth for terrestrial transmissions according to the '605 patent would cause large areas of unacceptably high interference with existing systems.","What is needed is a system and method that provides significantly improved interference isolation to provide simultaneous channel sharing without requiring a satellite ground antenna (e.g. a BSS antenna) with highly directional sensitivity characteristics. Preferably, such a system and method would permit terrestrial re-use of the subject BSS broadcast frequencies, with reduced and more acceptable potential interference levels, particularly when used with standard BSS antennae already in widespread use. The present invention satisfies that need.","To address the requirements described above, the present invention discloses a method and apparatus for simultaneously receiving a first signal from a non-terrestrial source and a second signal from a terrestrial source on the same or overlapping channels.","In one embodiment, the apparatus comprises at least one terrestrial transmitter transmitting information on at least one frequency simultaneously usable by at least one satellite transmitting to a satellite receive antenna having a sensitivity characterizable by a primary sensitive axis directed substantially at the satellite. The terrestrial transmitter includes an azimuthal gain characteristic directed substantially away from the Earth's Equator. In another embodiment, the terrestrial transmitter is disposed at a location defining a vector angularly displaced from the primary sensitive axis by an angle of less than 90 degrees.","In still another embodiment, the apparatus comprises a terrestrial receive antenna for receiving a first signal from a terrestrial transmitter on a frequency usable by at least one satellite transmitting to a satellite receive antenna having a sensitivity characterizable by a primary sensitive axis directed substantially at the satellite. The terrestrial receive antenna includes a primary sensitive axis directed substantially in the direction of the Earth's Equator. In another embodiment, the terrestrial receive antenna sensitive axis is displaced away from the satellite receive antenna primary sensitive axis by an offset angle of less than 90 degrees.","In yet another embodiment, the present invention includes a first antenna having a sensitivity characteristic with a plurality of lobes and nulls therebetween and a second antenna having a sensitivity characteristic with a plurality of lobes and nulls therebetween. The first antenna includes an anteriorly arranged main lobe and one or more posteriorly arranged sidelobes. At least one of the lobes of the first antenna is directed substantially at the non-terrestrial source and at least one of the nulls of the first antenna is directed substantially at the terrestrial source so that the first antenna receives the first signal from the non-terrestrial source, while substantially rejecting the second signal from the terrestrial source. At least one of the second antenna nodes is directed substantially at the terrestrial source so that the second antenna may receive the second signal. In one embodiment, to further enhance isolation between the first signal and the second signal, the second antenna is directed so that in addition to the foregoing, one of the second antenna nulls is directed substantially at the non-terrestrial source.","The present invention is also embodied in a method of transmitting information on at least one frequency simultaneously usable by at least one satellite transmitting to a satellite receive antenna having a sensitivity characterizable by a primary sensitive axis directed substantially at the satellite and a posterior secondary sensitive axis. The method is performed by transmitting the information from a terrestrially-based transmitter to a terrestrial receive antenna in a direction substantially away from the Equator. In another embodiment, the invention is embodied by a method for receiving information transmitted on at least one frequency simultaneously usable by at least one satellite transmitting to a satellite receive antenna having a sensitivity characterizable by a primary sensitive axis directed substantially at the satellite, and a posterior secondary sensitive axis. In this embodiment, the method is performed by receiving the information with a terrestrial receive antenna from a terrestrially-based transmitter transmitting the information in a direction substantially away from the Equator.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","108","104","110","112","102","104"]},"Depending on the sensitivity and rejection characteristics of the satellite receive antenna  and the sensitivity characteristic  used to transmit the terrestrial signal , the terrestrial signal  may impinge on the satellite receive antenna , whether or not the terrestrial receive antenna  is present. This terrestrial signal  will be detected by satellite receive antenna  as determined by the sensitivity or gain characteristic of the satellite receive antenna  in the direction of the terrestrial transmitter , and the received power flux density level of the interfering terrestrial signal  at the subscriber premises.","Some portion of the satellite signal  also impinges on the terrestrial receive antenna , whether or not the satellite receive antenna  is present. This satellite signal  is detected by the terrestrial receive antenna  as determined by the sensitivity or gain characteristic of the terrestrial receive antenna  in the direction of the satellite transmitter , and the received power flux density level of the interfering satellite signal at the subscriber premises .","One approach to reduce the above-described signal interference is to use a satellite receive and terrestrial receive antennae  and  with highly directional gain characteristics. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,761,605 relies on the use of a satellite receive antenna  with a \u201cmaximum directional reception range\u201d das measured from the satellite receive antenna center line. In this approach, the satellite receive antenna  is designed so that only signals inside the directional reception range can be received, and signals outside of this reception range cannot be received by the satellite receive antenna . The difficulty with this approach is that antennae with such characteristics are difficult to design and produce inexpensively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106","202","104","204","206","208","202","204","202"]},"The polar sensitivity characteristic of the satellite receive antenna  is a function of a number of interrelated physical and electrical antenna characteristics. These characteristics include, among other things, the sensitivity characteristics and physical location of the LNB  relative to the reflector , and the shape of the surface of the reflector .","For example, the LNB  may be disposed closer to the surface of the reflector , but the focus of the parabolic reflector  (and hence its external surface contour) must be changed to account for this modified LNB location. Further, the beamwidth of the sensitive axis of the LNB  must be modified to achieve the desired antenna sensitivity. Similarly, the LNB  may be placed farther away from the reflector , and other antenna  parameters must be modified to reflect this difference.","To maximize the antenna sensitivity along its centerline , it is desirable that the beamwidth of the sensitive axis of the LNB  be wide enough to accept signals from as much of the reflector  surface as possible, including the outer periphery. At the same time, if the beamwidth of the LNB  is too wide (exceeding the periphery of the reflector ), spillover from behind the reflector  can be received by the LNB . In such cases, the sensitivity characteristic of the antenna  will include sidelobes in the posterior (rear) side of the antenna  having a significant sensitivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3B","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"b":["106","106","106"]},"The sensitivity characteristic shown in  show that for all elevation angles, the antenna gain response is relatively high for sidelobes at  and  angles of 50 degrees on either side of the back antenna centerline (at locations corresponding to approximately 50 degrees  and 310 degrees ). At these angles, the antenna gain is approximately 0 dBi, due at least on part, to spillover from the LNB . Thus, interference sources located behind the antenna will be received by the antenna at the indicated significant gain levels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":"106"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["402","404","410","410","406","406","412","412","410","410","406","406","412","412","414","414","406","406","408","408","406","406","202","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B"],"b":["402","416","416","418","418","422","422","422","422","402","416","416","402","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["106","102","106","408","408","502","406","202","106","102"]},"Returning to , for an interference source located in front of the satellite receive antenna , the worst case or highest relative gain at the horizon (where a terrestrial transmitter  would be located) occurs at angles very close to the front antenna centerline  (reference angles depicted in  as near 180 degrees). Note, however, that the gain values near reference angles of 180 degrees are only troublesome for an elevation angle of about 10 degrees (or, equivalently, 10 degrees below the front antenna centerline ). That is, at an elevation angle of 10\u00b0, the gain of the antenna at a 180\u00b0 reference angle (the front of the antenna) is greater than the gain at reference angles of about 50\u00b0 (at ) and at about 310\u00b0 (at ). At higher elevation angles, the gain of the satellite receive antenna at the 180\u00b0 reference angle is in fact significantly lower that the gain seen off the back of the antenna at the 50\u00b0 and 310\u00b0 reference angles. This is because at sufficiently high elevation angles, the interfering source is being received at an angle sufficiently far away from the main beam of the antenna that there is sufficient isolation. At elevation angles of 10 degrees and below, the interfering source is within the main lobe of the antenna and isolation becomes poor.","For satellite receive antennae  with the foregoing characteristics, the interference regions for all but the lowest elevation angles is reduced when the terrestrial transmitter  or other interference source is located in front of the satellite receive antenna , not behind the satellite receive antenna  as is the case with the high-directivity antennae used in the Tawil patent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["106","102","116","506","110","110","518","520","102","110","522","524","520","522","522","520"]},"Unfortunately, the terrestrial transmitter C also transmits the second signal to the satellite receive antenna  along path . However, in this channel sharing system, the terrestrial transmitters A-D (hereinafter alternatively referred to as terrestrial transmitter(s) ) are disposed so that the offset angle  of their transmissions from the axis defined by the path  are greater than a particular offset angle  from the axis defined by path . This offset angle (which can be defined in terms of an elevation component and an azimuth component) depends on the beamwidth of the main lobe of the satellite receive antenna . So long as the terrestrial transmitters are disposed so that the offset angle in azimuth and elevation is greater than the effective beamwidth of the satellite receive antenna , sufficient isolation can be realized. It is also noted that, for the continental United States (CONUS), these low elevation angles are only associated with two narrow azimuth ranges, one near 105\u00b0 (almost due East), and one near 225\u00b0 (almost due West). Conversely, the significant posterior side lobes are a significant factor over a much wider azimuth range.","In one embodiment of the invention, the terrestrial transmitter can be disposed anywhere in front of the satellite receive antenna  (including directly in front of it), so long as a minimum elevation angle is maintained. When the sensitivity characteristic of the satellite receive antenna  in the direction of terrestrial transmitter C is either in a null or in one of the low sensitivity lobes, the second signal is greatly attenuated when compared to the signal received from the satellite transmitter , thus providing improved isolation between the first signal from the satellite transmitter  and the second signal from the terrestrial transmitter C. Similarly, terrestrial transmitter D, also undesirably transmits the second signal to the satellite receive antenna . However, since the satellite receive antenna  is elevated by elevation angle , terrestrial transmitter D is substantially aligned with null axis B, and thus, within null B. Hence, the signal from terrestrial transmitter D transmitted along path  is sufficiently attenuated so that the second signal from the terrestrial transmitter D does not interfere with the first signal transmitted along path . The main lobe  (and hence the primary axis ), however, is substantially aligned with the path  to the satellite transmitter . Hence, the satellite receive antenna  will receive a strong signal from this source.","Hence, unlike the system disclosed in the Tawil patent, which requires the use of a satellite receive antenna  with a highly directive monocular antennae gain characteristic, the present system is usable with a satellite receive antenna  described by a sensitivity characteristic which may include significant posteriorly-disposed sidelobes. Since transmission paths ( and ) from all of the potentially interfering transmitters (C-D respectively) are at sufficient offset angle (determined by the combination of the azimuth offset component and the elevation offset component of the angle between the satellite receive antenna  and the terrestrial transmitter ), interference is minimized.","As can be seen by the foregoing, all but the lowest elevation angles create smaller interference zones when the interference source is located in front of, and not behind, the satellite receive antenna . For the Northern Hemisphere, this means that the preferred direction for a potentially interfering terrestrial transmission is from a southerly direction so that the transmissions are received on the anterior side (but below the main beam ) of the satellite receive antenna .","This technique can be applied in either hemisphere. For example, for use in the Southern Hemisphere, the terrestrial transmission system is designed to transmit in a southerly direction so that the interference source is in front of the satellite receive antennas which face north. This concept is also extendable to use with other overlapping transmission channels where there is a desire to minimize interference between terrestrial transmissions and satellite transmissions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, elevation angle  is selected to be at least approximately 10 degrees. This value provides a reasonable angular distance from the main lobe, while making the most of the transmitting satellite coverage. For 45 cm diameter satellite receive antennae , elevation angles below 10 degrees are at the edge of coverage for a satellite transmitter  because the satellite receive antennae  appear (from the satellite transmitter's perspective) to be very close to the limb of the Earth.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the terrestrial receive antenna  can also be described by a polar sensitivity characteristic having lobes and nulls. The terrestrial receive antenna  can be aligned so that one of the nulls of the terrestrial receive antenna is substantially aligned with an axis  between the terrestrial receive antenna  and the satellite transmitter , while a lobe (preferably the main lobe) of the terrestrial receive antenna is substantially aligned with an axis  between the terrestrial receive antenna  and the terrestrial transmitter C.","Satellite transmitters  are typically designed such that the transmitted power levels fall off from higher to significantly lower values at the edge of the primary coverage area, allowing transmitted power to be concentrated on this primary coverage area. Because of this reduced transmitted power at edge of coverage, larger (and typically more expensive) ground receive antennas are required to receive these signals. These larger antennas have greater gain and smaller beamwidths. Thus, they provide increased isolation to in-line terrestrial transmitters relative to the isolation that could be achieved with 45 cm antennas. This improved isolation compensates for the reduced vertical separation angle between any in-line terrestrial transmitters and the beam peak, and should tend to maintain the advantage of northerly directed transmissions over southerly-directed transmissions for some range of elevation angles below 10 degrees.","As described above, the present invention describes a system which can cooperatively share the current Broadcast Satellite Service (BSS) frequency bands to allow additional programming material to be transmitted to BSS users or subscribers using the same frequency bands as currently used by BSS satellites. Further, the present invention achieves this goal without requiring expensive specially designed satellite receive antennae .","Although not necessary to practice the present invention the terrestrial receive antenna  may be disposed proximate the satellite receive antenna . For example, the terrestrial receive antenna  and the satellite receive antenna  may be attached to the same support structure, or installed on different portions of the customer's residence. However, it is noted that in the general case, the transmit receive antenna  will be used by different customers than the satellite receive antenna , and generally, will not be located proximate the satellite receive antenna.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["102","102","106","110","102","102","106","110"]},"A useful yardstick to measure the performance of the two systems depicted in  is to determine the size of the interference zones for each system.

While the present invention reduces the size of these \u201cinterference zones,\u201d they are not entirely eliminated. Hence, even with the substantially improved performance offered by the present invention, satellite communications will be negatively affected by the use of the channel-sharing terrestrial transmission system.

The terrestrial transmitter includes a azimuthal gain characteristic directed substantially away from the Earth's Equator. In an alternative embodiment, the terrestrial transmitter is disposed at a location defining a vector angularly displaced from the primary sensitive axis by an angle of less than 90 degrees.","A method of transmitting information has also been disclosed. In this method the information is transmitted on at least one frequency simultaneously usable by at least one satellite transmitting to a satellite receive antenna having a sensitivity characterizable by a primary sensitive axis directed substantially at the satellite and a posterior secondary sensitive axis. The method is performed by transmitting the information from a terrestrially-based transmitter to a terrestrial receive antenna in a direction substantially away from the Equator.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.","For example, in the foregoing discussion, mention is made of lobes and nulls in the satellite receive antenna  and the terrestrial receive antenna . It should be understood, that the antenna nulls do not necessarily reflect a region of zero antenna sensitivity. In practice, some residual sensitivity exists, even at the antenna null points. Hence, such nulls include regions where the gain of the antenna is such that the relevant signal is essentially rejected. Further, it should be noted that although the foregoing invention has been described in terms of a satellite receive antenna  and a terrestrial receive antenna  disposed proximate thereto, it is possible and perhaps desirable in some instances to fashion both antennae from a single structure with shared components. Hence, the satellite receive antenna  and the terrestrial receive antenna  can be broadly described as antennas, which may or may not share structural components. For example it is possible to design a dual feed antenna with a single reflector (perhaps of a more complex shape) to implement the foregoing invention.","Further, in the foregoing description, mention is made of frequency sharing between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial transmission networks. However, it is understood that there exist transmission networks using modulation techniques such as code division multiple access (CDMA), in which frequency sharing can be described in terms of channel sharing.","It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto. The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention.
