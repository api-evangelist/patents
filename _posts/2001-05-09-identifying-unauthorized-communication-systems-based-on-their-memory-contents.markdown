title: Identifying unauthorized communication systems based on their memory contents
abstract: An authorized client communication system seeking access to a host communication system may be identified by locating a memory segment within the client communication system that stores client software used to access the host computer system. The memory segment then is examined to determine whether the client software stored in the memory segment corresponds to client software for an official client communication system. Communications from the client communication system are terminated when the client software in the memory segment is determined to diverge from software for an official client communication system.

No. 09\/749,638, filed Dec. 28, 2000, now abandoned, and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/218,243, filed Jul. 14, 2000, which is incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to identifying unauthorized communication systems.","For two or more computer systems to communicate, at least one of those systems is generally configured with software enabling the communication. For instance, in a computer network configured for client-server communications, the client system is configured with client software that enables access to and interaction with the server system.","Systems employing client-server communications may be subject to security attacks. One form of security attack involves the use of an unauthorized client system that imitates an authorized client system to achieve the access ordinarily reserved for authorized client systems.","A host communication system (e.g., an online service provider) may defend against certain security attacks by determining whether a client communication system (e.g., a personal computer) is an authorized communication system. The determination may be performed during an initiation of the communication session, or at some later time.","In one general aspect, an authorized client communication system seeking access to a host communication system may be identified by locating a memory segment within the client communication system that stores client software used to access the host computer system. The memory segment then is examined to determine whether the client software stored in the memory segment corresponds to client software for an official client communication system. Communications from the client communication system are terminated when the client software in the memory segment is determined to diverge from client software for an official client communication system.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, locating the memory segment may include identifying a type or version of the client software being used by the client communication system to enable communication, and locating the memory segment of the client communication system based on the identified type or version. The type or version of the client software may be identified by, for example, receiving information from the client communication system indicating the type or version of the client software. This information may be received when the communication session is initiated, or at some other time. The type or version also may be determined by performing a diagnostic on the client communication system to automatically determine the type or version.","Locating the memory segment may include locating a memory segment of the client communication system that includes client software remaining unchanged in a corresponding memory segment of an official client communication system, where the memory segment that is located may be user independent. Locating the memory segment also may include identifying a memory segment based on a random selection among several memory segments that store client software, that are user independent, and\/or that remain unchanged between different systems.","To determine whether the client software stored in the located memory segment corresponds to predictable client software for an official client communication system, the client software stored in the memory segment may be compared with the corresponding client software of the official client communication system. This comparison may be made by performing a mathematical computation on the contents of the memory segment and comparing the result of the mathematical computation against the results of a corresponding mathematical computation on the corresponding client software of the official communication system. The mathematical computations may include, for example, a check sum, a hashing algorithm, a MessageDigest\u2122 (MD5) algorithm, or a Securehash algorithm (SHA1).","Implementations may include a method or process, an apparatus or system, or computer software on a computer medium.","The details of one or more implementation are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","For illustrative purposes,  describe a communications system for implementing techniques for transferring files between subscribers of an instant messaging host complex. For brevity, several elements in the figures described below are represented as monolithic entities. However, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, these elements each may include numerous interconnected computers and components designed to perform a set of specified operations and\/or dedicated to a particular geographical region.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging data between a client system  and a host system  through a communications link .

The client system  may be arranged to operate within or in concert with one or more other systems, such as for example, one or more LANs (\u201cLocal Area Networks\u201d) and\/or one or more WANs (\u201cWide Area Networks\u201d).","The client device  is generally capable of executing instructions under the command of a client controller . The client device  is connected to the client controller  by a wired or wireless data pathway  capable of delivering data.","The client device  and client controller  each typically includes one or more hardware components and\/or software components.

An example of client controller  is a software application loaded on the client device  for commanding and directing communications enabled by the client device . Other examples include a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the client device  to interact and operate as described herein. The client controller  may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to the client device .","The communications link  typically includes a delivery network  making a direct or indirect communication between the client system  and the host system , irrespective of physical separation. Examples of a delivery network  include the Internet, the World Wide Web, WANs, LANs, analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN, and xDSL), radio, television, cable, satellite, and\/ or any other delivery mechanism for carrying data. The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  that enable communications through the one or more delivery networks  described above. Each of the communication pathways ,  may include, for example, a wired, wireless, cable or satellite communication pathway.","The host system  includes a host device  capable of executing instructions under the command and direction of a host controller . The host device  is connected to the host controller  by a wired or wireless data pathway  capable of carrying and delivering data.","The host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and\/or host controllers . For example, the host system  may include one or more general-purpose computers (e.g., personal computers), one or more special-purpose computers (e.g., devices specifically programmed to communicate with each other and\/or the client system ), or a combination of one or more general-purpose computers and one or more special-purpose computers.

In particular, the host system  and communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to host system  and communications link  of , respectively. Likewise, the client system  of  typically has attributes comparable to and may illustrate one possible embodiment of the client system  of FIG. .","The client device  typically includes a general purpose computer  having an internal or external storage  for storing data and programs such as an operating system  (e.g., DOS, Windows\u2122, Windows 95\u2122, Windows 98\u2122, Windows 2000\u2122, Windows NT\u2122, OS\/2, and Linux) and one or more application programs. Examples of application programs include authoring applications  (e.g., word processing, database programs, spreadsheet programs, and graphics programs) capable of generating documents or other electronic content; client applications  (e.g., AOL client, CompuServe client, AIM client, AOL TV client, and ISP client) capable of communicating with other computer users, accessing various computer resources, and viewing, creating, or otherwise manipulating electronic content; and browser applications  (e.g., Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer) capable of rendering standard Internet content.","The general-purpose computer  also includes a central processing unit  (CPU) for executing instructions in response to commands from the client controller . In one implementation, the client controller  includes one or more of the application programs installed on the internal or external storage  of the general-purpose computer . In another implementation, the client controller  includes application programs externally stored in and performed by one or more device(s) external to the general- purpose computer .","The general-purpose computer typically will include a communication device  for sending and receiving data. One example of the communication device  is a modem. Other examples include a transceiver, a set-top box, a communication card, a satellite dish, an antenna, or another network adapter capable of transmitting and receiving data over the communications link  through a wired or wireless data pathway . The general-purpose computer  also may include a TV (\u201ctelevision\u201d) tuner  for receiving television programming in the form of broadcast, satellite, and\/or cable TV signals. As a result, the client device  can selectively and\/or simultaneously display network content received by communications device  and television programming content received by the TV tuner .","The general-purpose computer  typically will include an input\/output interface  to enable a wired or wireless connection to various peripheral devices . Examples of peripheral devices  include, but are not limited to, a mouse , a mobile phone , a personal digital assistant  (PDA), a keyboard , a display monitor  with or without a touch screen input, and\/or a TV remote control  for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers. Other examples may include voice recognition and synthesis devices.","Although  illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone , a PDA , and a TV remote control  as being peripheral with respect to the general-purpose computer , in another implementation, such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general-purpose computer  and operate as the client device . For example, the mobile phone  or the PDA  may include computing and networking capabilities and function as a client device  by accessing the delivery network  and communicating with the host system . Furthermore, the client system  may include one, some or all of the components and devices described above.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to .

The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system  and other elements of the host device . The host device  also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP (\u201cOnline Service Provider\u201d) host complex  and IM (\u201cInstant Messaging\u201d) host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers, the client system  may include communication software, for example, an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber's interactions with the respective services and, in particular, may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes. For example, Instant Messaging allows a subscriber to use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web.","Typically, the OSP host complex  supports different services, such as email, discussion groups, chat, news services, and Internet access. The OSP host complex  is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex  to communicate with each other, certain protocols (i.e., standards, formats, conventions, rules, and structures) being employed to enable the transfer of data. The OSP host complex  ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex  may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common, underlying proprietary protocol.","The IM host complex  is generally independent of the OSP host complex , and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber's network or Internet access. Thus, the IM host complex  allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages, whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex  may support associated services, such as administrative matters, advertising, directory services, chat, and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex  has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data, the IM host complex  employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.","The host device  may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes, such as the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex  gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex  with the IM host complex  through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily, when used to facilitate a link between complexes, the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway  are privy to information regarding a protocol anticipated by a destination complex, which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance, the OSP host complex  and IM host complex  may use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway  and\/or the IM host complex gateway .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to .

Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and may illustrate one possible embodiment of the host systems , , and  shown in , respectively. However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex .","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex  using OSP protocols that may or may not be exclusive or proprietary. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an IM client application and\/or an Internet browser application, for communicating with the IM host complex  and the Internet .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications between client systems  and various elements of the host system , including elements such as OSP host complex  and IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to one or more of these elements.","The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are typically connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and EM host complex gateway  may generally perform protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between one or more of the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","The OSP host complex  supports a set of services to be accessed through and\/or performed by from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex  may communicate using the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex  may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example, servers may be arranged in large centralized clusters identified as farms  or in localized clusters identified as pods .","More specifically, farms  are groups of servers located at centralized locations within the OSP host complex . Farms  generally are dedicated to providing particular functionality and services to subscribers and clients from a centralized location, regardless of the location of the subscriber or client. Farms  are particularly useful for providing services that depend upon other remotely-located or performed processes and services for information, such as, for example, chat, email, instant messaging, news, newsgroups, search, stock updates, and weather. Thus, farms  tend to rely on connections with external resources such as the Internet  and\/or other servers within the OSP host complex .","By contrast to farms , pods  are clusters of localized servers that provide some services offered by the OSP host complex  from a location local to the service or information recipient, thus reducing and avoiding time delays and congestion inherent in centralized processing. Each pod  includes one or more interrelated servers capable of operating together to provide one or more services offered by the OSP host complex  in a geographically localized manner, the servers within a pod  generally operating independently rather than relying on resources external to the pod  to operate. A pod  may cache content received from external sources, such as farms  or the Internet , making frequently requested information readily available to the local service or information recipients served by the pod . In this way, pods  are particularly useful in providing services that are independent of other processes and servers such as, for example, routing to other localized resources or recipients, providing access to keywords and geographically specific content, providing access to routinely accessed information, and downloading certain software and graphical interface updates with reduced processing time and congestion. The determination of which servers and processes are located in the pod  is made by the OSP according to load distribution, frequency of requests, demographics, and other factors.","In addition to farms  and pods , the implementation of  also includes one or more non-podded and non-farmed servers . In general, the servers  may be dedicated to performing a particular service or information that relies on other processes and services for information and may be directly or indirectly connected to resources outside of the OSP host complex , such as the Internet  and the IM host complex , through an OSP gateway  within OSP host complex gateway . In the event that subscriber usage of a particular service or information of the servers  becomes relatively high, those servers  may be integrated into a farm or pod as appropriate.","In the implementation of , one particular exemplary pod  is shown in more detail. Pod  includes a routing processor . In a packet-based implementation, the client system  may generate information requests, convert the requests into data packets, sequence the data packets, perform error checking and other packet-switching techniques, and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system , the routing processor  may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . In general, the routing processor  will examine an address field of a data request, use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request, and direct the data request to the appropriate destination.","For example, in the event that a data request from the client system  can be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request to a local server  in the pod . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request internally to one or more farms , one or more other pods , or one or more non-podded servers  in the OSP host complex , or the routing processor  may direct the data request externally to elements such as the IM host complex  through an OSP\/pod gateway .","The routing processor  also may direct data requests and\/or otherwise facilitate communication between the client system  and the Internet  through the OSP\/pod gateway . In one implementation, the client system  uses an OSP client application to convert standard Internet content and protocols into OSP protocols and vice versa, where necessary. For example, when a browser application transmits a request in a standard Internet protocol, the OSP client application can intercept the request, convert the request into an OSP protocol and send the converted request to the routing processor  in the OSP host complex . The routing processor  recognizes the Internet  as the destination and routes the data packets to an IP (\u201cInternet Protocol\u201d) tunnel . The IP tunnel  converts the data from the OSP protocol back into standard Internet protocol and transmits the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel  also converts the data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the data to the routing processor  for delivery back to the client system . At the client system , the OSP client application converts the data in the OSP protocol back into standard Internet content for communication with the browser application.","The IP tunnel  may act as a buffer between the client system  and the Internet , and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example, the IP tunnel  can check parental controls settings of the client system  and request and transmit content from the Internet  according to the parental control settings. In addition, the IP tunnel  may include a number a caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches, the IP tunnel  may send the information to the client system  from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .","In another implementation, the client system  may use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access pods  and the Internet . For example, the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system  to generate a request in standard Internet protocol, such as HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d). In a packet-based implementation, data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol, such as, for example, UDP (\u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d), and routed to a web tunnel . The web tunnel  may be a L2TP (\u201cLayer Two Tunneling Protocol\u201d) tunnel capable of establishing a point-to-point protocol (PPP) session with the client system . The web tunnel  provides a gateway to the routing processor  within the pod , the Internet , and a web proxy .","The web proxy  can look up subscriber information from the IP address of the client system  to determine demographic information such as the subscriber's parental control settings. In this way, the web proxy  can tailor the subscriber's content and user interfaces. The web proxy  can also perform caching functions to store certain URLs (\u201cUniform Resource Locators\u201d) and other electronic content so that the web proxy  can locally deliver information to the client system  and avoid the need to access the Internet  in the event that data requested by the client system  has been cached.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks .

However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex .","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex  utilizing exclusive IM protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an OSP client application and\/or an Internet browser application, for communicating with elements such as the OSP host complex  and the Internet .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications between client systems  and various elements of the host system , including elements such as the OSP host complex  and IM host complex ; login server  is also capable of authorizing access by the client system  and those elements. The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to one or more of the elements. The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","To access the IM host complex  to begin an instant messaging session, the client system  establishes a connection to the login server . The login server  typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex  by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex , the login server  employs a hashing technique on the subscriber's screen name to identify a particular IM server  for use during the subscriber's session. The login server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular IM server , gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie), and breaks the connection. The client system  then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server  through the communications link , and obtains access to that IM server  using the encrypted key. Typically, the client system  will be equipped with a winsock API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) that enables the client system  to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .","Once a connection to the IM server  has been established, the client system  may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server  and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server  supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers  may support associated services, such as, for example, administrative matters, directory services, chat and interest groups. The domain servers  can be used to lighten the load placed on the IM server  by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server  and\/or the domain server , a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web.","In the implementation of , IM server  is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway  facilitates the connection between the IM server  and one or more alert multiplexors . For example, routing gateway  may serve as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers  to several alert multiplexors . In general, an alert multiplexor  maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.","Once the client system  is connected to the alert multiplexor , a subscriber can register for and\/or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system  and the alert multiplexor  is determined by employing a hashing technique at the IM server  to identify the particular alert multiplexor  to be used for the subscriber's session. Once the particular multiplexor  has been identified, the IM server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor  and gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie) used to gain access to the identified multiplexor . The client system  then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor  through the communication link  and obtains access to the alert multiplexor  using the encrypted key.","The alert multiplexor  is connected to an alert gate  that, like the IM host complex gateway , is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to enable communication with the OSP host complex . The alert gate  is the interface between the IM host complex  and the physical servers, such as servers in the OSP host complex , where state changes are occurring. In general, the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However, the alert multiplexor  also may communicate with the OSP host complex  through the IM gateway , for example, to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex  with certain information gathered from the alert gate .","The alert gate  can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert.","The alert gate  may include a piece of code (alert receive code) capable of interacting with another piece of code (alert broadcast code) on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general, the alert receive code installed on the alert gate  instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate  upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Thereafter, upon detecting an alert feed, the alert gate  contacts the alert multiplexor , which in turn, informs the appropriate client system  of the detected alert feed.","In the implementation of , the IM host complex  also includes a subscriber profile server  connected to a database  for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server  may be used to enter, retrieve, edit, manipulate, or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation, a subscriber's profile data includes, for example, the subscriber's buddy list, alert preferences, designated stocks, identified interests, geographic location and other demographic data. The subscriber may enter, edit and\/or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system  to interact with the subscriber profile server .","Because the subscriber's data is stored in the IM host complex , the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex  using a new or different client system . Accordingly, when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex , the IM server  can instruct the subscriber profile server  to retrieve the subscriber's profile data from the database  and to provide, for example, the subscriber's buddy list to the IM server  and the subscriber's alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server  also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex  to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively, user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems , , ,  and  and communications links , , ,  and  of , respectively. Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and may illustrate one possible embodiment of the host systems , , ,  and  shown in , respectively. However,  describes several aspects of one implementation of the host system  in greater detail, focusing primarily on one particular implementation of the login server  and IM host complex .","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the IM host complex . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex  utilizing exclusive IM protocols.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications between client systems  and various elements of the host system , including elements such as the IM host complex  and the OSP host complex ; login server  is also capable of authorizing access by the client system  and those elements. The IM host complex  includes an IM server network , a routing gateway , an alert multiplexor network , and one or more alert gates . The IM server network  may include an interconnected network of IM servers and the alert multiplexor network  may include an interconnected network of alert multiplexors. In the implementation of , the IM server network  and the alert multiplexor network  are interconnected by a routing gateway  that serves as a common hub to reduce the number of connections. Each IM server within IM server network  can directly or indirectly communicate and exchange information with one or more of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network . Each of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network  may be connected to several alert gates  that receive different types of alerts.","During a session, a subscriber typically will be assigned to one IM server in the IM server network  and to one alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  based on one or more hashing techniques. In one implementation, for example, each IM server in the IM server network  may be dedicated to serving a particular set of registered subscribers. Because all of the IM servers can communicate with each other, all subscribers can communicate with each other through instant messaging. However, the IM servers and the alert multiplexors are capable of storing subscriber information and other electronic content that may be accessed by the other IM servers and alert multiplexors. Thus, in another implementation, each alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  may be dedicated to storing information about a particular set or subset of alerts. Because all of the alert multiplexors can communicate with each other, all registered subscribers can receive all types of alerts. This networking arrangement enables the load to be distributed among the various servers in the IM host complex  while still enabling a subscriber to communicate, share information, or otherwise interact with other subscribers and servers in the IM host complex .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-6","FIGS. 1-6"],"b":["700","105","205","305","405","505","605","110","210","310","410","510","610"]},"As shown, the memory contents  of the client communication system include system software , client software , and other software . The system software  generally includes programs and data enabling operation of the client communication system, and the other software  generally includes other programs and data enabling the performance of applications and storage and retrieval of data using the client communication system. The system software  and other software  are generally stored in the memory of a client device such as that shown and described with respect to items , , , , , and  of .","The client software  generally includes programs and data files capable of enabling communication between the client communication system and the host communication system. The client software  is generally stored on the client communication system and loaded into the memory of a client controller, such as that shown and described with respect to items , , , , , and  of , when communications are to be initiated with a host communication system.","The client software  generally includes configuration data for a communication device (e.g., modem) resident on the client communication system, and information for contacting the host communication system. The client software  also generally includes information (e.g., login and password information) for performing handshaking with the host communication system, and may include other information such as user preference information.","The client software  generally includes several modules (not shown) for performing various functions. Modules of the client software  may include user-dependent software , user-independent software , or a combination of the two. User-dependent software  includes data related to particular users, such as demographic data, personalizable configuration data, and user-specific login data. The software  also may include data reflecting user system attributes, such as modem type and speed, and processor characteristics. By contrast, user-independent software  generally includes static information within the client software, such as fixed instructions and read only modules.","As will be described, identification of unauthorized client communication systems will generally be performed based on an inspection of user-independent software  since the contents of the user-independent software  can be predicted for the machines of different users. However, it may be possible to otherwise classify the client software to enable identification based on different criteria.","In general, the client software  is loaded at a predesignated location within the memory of the client communication system. However, because that memory may include other software loaded at the predesignated location, at least a portion of the client software  may be configured to load into an alternative location within the client communication system memory. This alternative location may be predesignated in the client software  or may be selectable by the client communication system. One implementation uses this distinction to classify the client software  based on the potential for volatility of the software's location within the memory of the client communication system. Specifically, portions of the client software  may be distinguished based on whether their contents are permitted to be loaded at locations that differ from predesignated memory locations. Similarly, portions of the client software may be distinguished based on whether their contents may be changed by their relocation or the relocation of other portions of the client software, e.g., due to an addressing scheme interrelating the portions of the client software .","Based on criteria of this type, the client software  may be parsed into virtual segments that remain static and virtual segments that may be dynamic. By combining this classification with the classification among user-dependant and user-independent segments discussed above with respect to , it is possible to identify the specific portions of the client software  that remain unchanged, notwithstanding variations in the user or memory location. Specific portions of client software  may be deemed unchanged for purposes of identification when, for instance, they are stored without interruption in the memory of a client communication system (i.e., no pointers to relocated code), or when they are simply unchanged with respect to the user or user's system (i.e., unmodified content). Specific portions of the client software  that are known to remain unchanged may be located on the client communication system and used for authentication as described below.","Although the software - shown by  appears to have a sequential orientation left-to-right, the relative orientation of these memory contents  may be arranged in any manner designated by the client communication system. Furthermore, although shown as being positioned at a single portion of the memory, at least the client software  may be disbursed among several portions of the memory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIGS. 1-6"],"b":["800","110","210","310","410","510","610"]},"The method  includes locating a memory segment of a client communication system that stores client software (step ), determining whether the client software stored in the memory segment of a client communication system seeking access is official client software (step ), and sending a message to the client communication system and suspending or terminating communication with the client communication system when the client software is not official client software (step ).","Locating a memory segment may include identifying a type or version of the client software, in which the memory segment storing client software is known. Locating the memory segment also may include receiving information from the client communication system during or after an initiation of communications, and determining the type or version of the client software being used by the client communication system to enable communications with a host communication system. For example, during or after an initiation of communications, performing a diagnosis on the client communication system may be performed to automatically determine the type or version of the client software.","Using the identified client type and\/or version, it may be possible to locate a memory segment of the client communication system that stores client software by locating a memory segment that includes static client software that remains unchanged in memory segments of the official client communication systems, regardless of the client communication system upon which it is stored. For instance, one or more memory segments may be identified as including static client software that remains unchanged based on the particular type of client communication system upon which it is stored. The memory segment may also be located based on a random selection among several memory segments that include the client software, or based on a random selection among only the several memory segments that include client software that remains unchanged as described above.","To determine whether the software stored in the memory segment includes official software (step ), the client software stored in the memory segment of the client communication system seeking access may be compared against corresponding client software within an official client communication system. This comparison may involve a comparison of the actual software stored on the memory segment with official client software from an official client communication system, or it may instead involve a comparison of the results of mathematical computations performed on each. For instance, the comparing may include performing a mathematical computation on the contents of the identified memory segment, performing the same computation on the corresponding segment of the official system, and comparing the results from the mathematical computations. The mathematical computations may include a hashing algorithm, such as a message digest algorithm (e.g., MD3, MD5) or a secured hash algorithm (e.g., SHA1), or other algorithms.","As illustrated in , several actions may be taken in response to a failure to authenticate, including one or more of terminating the communication session immediately or after a delay, requesting additional authenticating information, displaying an error message, and blocking further communication from the Internet protocol (IP) address of the accessing system.

In the implementation shown by FIG.  and referenced by , four (4) elements are specifically called out\u2014client , host , timer , and archive .","Client  represents software loaded in the memory of a client communication system, such as that shown and described above with reference to .","Host  represents software loaded in the memory of a host communication system, such as that shown and described above with reference to . As described previously with respect to , the client  and host  may communicate using the Internet or some other communication medium.","Timer  represents a timing mechanism that may be implemented using hardware and\/or software, e.g., a hardware device together with controlling software. Timer  is typically integrated into the operating system of the host communication system. As such, host  may program timer  to provide an alert after a specified interval has elapsed.","Archive  represents a storage medium (e.g., a disk) storing one or more versions (e.g., database) of officially sanctioned client software currently available to access the host communication system. The archive may reside in storage on the host communication system, or in storage on another computer or communication system that is accessible to the host communication system. The archive may be indexed using client platform (e.g. Windows, Macintosh) and version number, or otherwise as appropriate.","Process A of  illustrates an example of an initial exchange between the client  and host . Specifically, during the sign-on stage, the client  sends a message (step ) identifying its platform (i.e. hardware and operating system) and implementation version to host . Based on this information, host  requests a memory map of client  from archive  (steps , , ). The requested memory map distinguishes locations in the memory of client  that remain unchanged, and hence remain predictable, from locations within the client memory that remain subject to change. The unchanged portions of memory tend to maintain identical contents both in client  and in archive . Therefore, using the memory map, host  randomly selects (step ) one or more contiguous segments from the unchanged locations. For each selected segments, the host  then transmits a descriptor (step ) identifying the segment location to client . The descriptor typically includes the location of the segment module, its offset within that module, and its length. Concurrently, the host  starts () the timer .","Thereafter, a first scenario, depicted in , maybe experienced by official and unofficial clients. Under this scenario, upon receiving the segment descriptors, the client computes a message digest of the requested segments (steps  and ). In one implementation, two digest algorithms are used: the \u201cnull\u201d algorithm, which simply returns a concatenation of the bytes in the segments, and the message-digest algorithm (e.g., MD5 developed by RSA Data Security, Inc). Various digest algorithms may be substituted for the message-digest algorithm, but message digests in which it is computationally infeasible to produce two different messages with the same digest are preferred. Both the null algorithm and MD5 have this property.","Upon receiving the digest, the host  stops the timer  (step ), and retrieves its own copy of the selected segments from the archive  (steps ,  and ). It then independently computes the digest (step ) and compares its result with the digest obtained from the client  (step ). If the digests match, the client  is permitted to stay online. If the digests do not match, the client  is presumed an unauthorized communication system that is therefore disconnected (step ).","Conversely, a second scenario, depicted in , may arise when clients  do not respond with a digest. If the host  does not receive a digest from the client , it will not stop the timer  (step ). The timer  will expire approximately 30 seconds from the time it was started and will notify the server  (step ). At this point, the host  will disconnect the client  (step ).","Any or all of the processes described above may be implemented during an initiation of communications between the client communication system and the host communication system, or at any time thereafter. For instance, the above process may be implemented after communications have been ongoing for a fixed or random period of time.","A number of implementations have been described above. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","For instance, the above features may be applied to any system involving communication between two or more computer systems where it is necessary for one or more of the computer systems to authenticate another of the computer systems. Particular utility exists for application service providers (e.g., instant messaging application providers) and e-commerce driven systems seeking to authenticate computer systems seeking or receiving access thereto. When used in this manner, this process and system may prevent access to host communication systems by unauthorized computer systems, thereby preventing harms such as loss of advertising revenue, loss of revenue otherwise generated through the controlled redirection of those users, and loss of service contract revenues resulting from defection of clients otherwise chasing service contracts under the host communication systems.","The above system and process may also be used to verify that other types of specified software applications are loaded and operating on any machine being checked, and the like.","As described, one aspect of the above implementations authenticates a client communication system by focusing on properties of an official client communication system rather than on the peculiarities in the behavior of impostor clients.","Another aspect of the above implementations involves the random use of various memory contents for authentication, thus requiring an impostor client to duplicate virtually every aspect of the official client software object code in order to consistently authenticate. Such duplication may increase the size of the imposter client system software, requiring increased the download time and footprint size therefor.","Still other aspects of the above implementations involve varying the timing of the authentication, and varying the response to unauthorized client communication systems. Taken independently or in combination with variations in the memory location being used for authentication, these aspects make it difficult for third parties to determine how this authentication is performed, and thus difficult to defeat.","Yet another aspect of the overall implementation involves the transfer and comparison of results from mathematical computations performed on memory segments, rather than transferring and comparing the contents of the memory segments themselves. Using this manner, bandwidth requirements and download time are reduced."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-6","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-10C","b":"9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
