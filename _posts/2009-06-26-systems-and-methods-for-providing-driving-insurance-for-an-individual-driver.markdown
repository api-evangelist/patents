{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Currently, the vehicle insurance framework requires insurance for each vehicle a member owns, even if they are a single member. Adding to the problem is that the discounts for lower mileage cars are not significant enough to truly be a benefit to the insurance customer. Today, one of the larger rating factors deals with the damage that the vehicle itself can visit upon other vehicles. As the vehicles on the road become more homogenous, the risks presented by the vehicles themselves become less differentiated between them. Thus, providing vehicle insurance to a driver based on what specific vehicle they drive is becoming less important and is not needed. Also, current insurance models and frameworks may not accurately risk the driver themselves and may impose higher than needed premiums based on the number of vehicles on an insurance policy rather than the risk of driving in general.","In this regard, there is a need for systems and methods that overcome the shortcomings described above and others.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In consideration of the above-identified shortcomings of the art, systems methods for providing driving insurance for an individual driver are described herein.

A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor , computer  may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter .

For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures, whether coupled to the Internet or not, may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.","A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The \u201cclient\u201d is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client\/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the example of , any entity , , , , , ,  and  can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances.","A server is typically, though not necessarily, a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.","Client(s) and server(s) communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer(s). For example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web (WWW), or \u201cthe Web.\u201d Typically, a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium, e.g., client(s) and server(s) may be coupled to one another via TCP\/IP connection(s) for high-capacity communication.","In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in  and the further diversification that can occur in computing in a network environment such as that of , the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture. Instead, the embodiments should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.","Referring next to  shown is a block diagram of an example insurance policy record for a traditional insurance policy. Traditionally, insurance policies may include a number of specific drivers that are insured for driving specific vehicle. For example, the specific drivers may be those members of a particular family and the specific vehicles may be those owned by various members of the family. Shown as an example in  is the insurance policy record  stored on a computer readable medium of an insurance company. As part of the insurance policy record shown are the specific divers covered under the insurance policy (e.g., Driver A  and Driver B ). Also shown are the specific vehicles covered under the insurance policy  (e.g., Vehicle A , Vehicle B  and Vehicle C ). In the example provided in , Driver A and Driver B are only insured for liability arising from a vehicle accident while driving Vehicle A , Vehicle B  or Vehicle C . If Driver A  or Driver B  were to drive other vehicles (such as a friend's vehicle, for example) they would not be covered under the insurance policy associated with the Insurance Policy Record .","Referring next to , shown is a block diagram of an example insurance policy record according to providing driving insurance for an individual driver for driving any vehicle. Shown as an example in  is the insurance policy record  stored on a computer readable medium of an insurance company. As part of the insurance policy record shown is a specific diver covered under the insurance policy (e.g., Driver A ). However, under the insurance policy of insurance policy record , Driver A  is insured for liability arising from a vehicle accident while driving all vehicles  instead of only one or more specific vehicles. In this way, Driver A is free to drive any vehicle (friends' cars, rental cars, etc.) knowing that he or she has insurance coverage under their insurance policy.","Referring next to , shown is a block diagram of an example insurance policy record according to providing driving insurance for an individual driver for driving particular types of vehicles. Shown as an example in  is the insurance policy record  stored on a computer readable medium of an insurance company. As part of the insurance policy record  shown is a specific diver covered under the insurance policy (e.g., Driver A ). However, under the insurance policy of insurance policy record , Driver A  is insured for liability arising from a vehicle accident while driving 3 specific types, categories or classes of vehicles (e.g., Vehicle Type A , Vehicle Type B , Vehicle Type C ). In this way, Driver A is free to drive any vehicle (friends' cars, rental cars, etc.) of a specific type, category or class as indicated in the insurance policy record , knowing that he or she has insurance coverage under their insurance policy for driving a vehicle of that specific type, category or class. The number of vehicle types under the insurance policy record  may vary and be more or less than that shown in ","The types, categories or classes of vehicles may be defined based on various factors or characteristics of vehicles including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: vehicle size, vehicle weight, vehicle engine type, vehicle model, classification as a sports car, classification as a truck, classification as a farm vehicle, vehicle brand, age of vehicle, safety features of vehicle, state, country or province in which vehicle is licensed, etc. Optionally, the types of vehicles for which Driver A  may be insured under the insurance policy record  may also change automatically depending on various characteristics of Driver A  that may change over time including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: age of driver, driver's driving record, previous vehicle accidents of driver, education of driver, school grades of driver, whether driver has completed a driver education course, previous experience driving particular types of vehicles, etc. these types may be automatically added or removed from the insurance policy record  and electronic notifications automatically sent to Driver A  or others accordingly.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for providing driving insurance for an individual driver for driving any vehicle. First, a risk is electronically calculated  of insuring a driver for liability arising from a vehicle accident regardless of the vehicle driven by the driver. This may be calculated based on factors having to do with an individual driver including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: age of driver, driver's driving record, previous vehicle accidents of driver, education of driver, school grades of driver, whether driver has completed a driver education course, previous experience driving particular types of vehicles, average damage costs to others arising out of vehicle accidents of drivers having similar characteristics of the driver, etc. An insurance premium rate is then electronically and automatically calculated  based on the previously calculated risk. An insurance policy is then electronically prepared  according to the calculated premium rate wherein the insurance policy provides liability vehicle insurance for the driver regardless of the vehicle driven by the driver. The insurance policy may be prepared  in electronic format and have all the driver information and insurance rates inserted automatically and then sent electronically to the driver for their electronic signature, for example. This process may result in an electronic insurance policy record  such as that shown in , for example, being created on a computer readable medium of an insurance company providing the insurance policy. The process above may be applied to other types of vehicles, classes of vehicles and other forms of insurable transportation as well. For example, the process may be applied to providing driver's\/operating insurance for personal watercraft, boats, motorcycles, and airplanes, etc.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for providing driving insurance for an individual driver for driving specific types of vehicles. First, a risk is electronically calculated  of insuring a driver for liability arising from a vehicle accident for each type, category or class of vehicle (hereinafter referred to collectively as type), within a plurality of types that may be driven by driver. The specific type or types desired may be selected by the driver applying for vehicle driver insurance, for example. This may be calculated based on factors having to do with an individual driver including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: age of driver, driver's driving record, previous vehicle accidents of driver, education of driver, school grades of driver, whether driver has completed a driver education course, previous experience driving particular types of vehicles, average damage costs to others arising out of vehicle accidents of drivers having similar characteristics of the driver, etc. The risk may also be calculated based on various factors or characteristics of vehicles of the particular type including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: vehicle size, vehicle weight, vehicle engine type, vehicle model, classification as a sports car, classification as a truck, classification as a farm vehicle, vehicle brand, age of vehicle, safety features of vehicle, state, country or province in which vehicle is licensed, etc. Included in the calculation based on one or more of the factors above may be averages or statistics of damages to others arising from vehicle accidents involving vehicles having one or more of the above characteristics.","An insurance premium rate is then electronically and automatically calculated  based on the previously calculated risk. An insurance policy is then electronically prepared  according to the calculated premium rate wherein the insurance policy provides liability vehicle insurance for the driver while driving any of the selected types of vehicles. The insurance policy may be prepared  in electronic format and have all the driver information, insurance premium rates, and types of vehicles for which the driver is insured, inserted automatically and then sent electronically to the driver for their electronic signature, for example. This process may result in an electronic insurance policy record  such as that shown in , for example, being created on a computer readable medium of an insurance company providing the insurance policy. The process above may be applied to other types of vehicles, classes of vehicles and other forms of insurable transportation as well. For example, the process may be applied to providing driver's\/operating insurance for personal watercraft, boats, motorcycles, and airplanes, etc.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for allowing operation of a vehicle depending on whether an individual driver attempting to operate the vehicle is insured. Whether a particular driver is insured is often an important issue in allowing a driver to operate a vehicle. For example, whether a particular driver is insured may be important when one is lending another their car, when renting cars to others, or as a way to enforce insurance laws or process insurance claims, and settle legal disputes. In many cases it may be helpful to have a technological way to prevent one from operating a vehicle when they do not have insurance. Shown in  is an example process illustrating such a technological solution. First, an identification of an individual driver is received  electronically. The identification may be triggered to be sent and received wirelessly any number of ways. For example this identification may be received wirelessly from a mobile device associated with the driver or from a device embedded in a vehicle key, key fob, or other device associated with the driver. The sending of the identification may be triggered by the driver by interacting with the mobile device or by inserting the key into an ignition of a vehicle, for example, which then sends a wireless signal from the vehicle or the mobile device to send the identification of the driver. The identification of the driver may be the driver's name, social security number, driver license number, insurance company member number, or other number or keycode associated with the driver. Also, the driver identification may be received by one or more systems of an insurance company, law enforcement, vehicle owner or any other entity.","Next, or in conjunction with the receiving of the driver identification, an identification of a vehicle that the driver is attempting to drive may be received . The identification of the vehicle may also be received  wirelessly in the same manner as the driver identification above and may originate from the vehicle itself, for example. Sending of the vehicle identification may be triggered by the sending of the driver identification or when the driver inserts a key into the ignition of the vehicle. The vehicle identification may be communicated to the mobile device of the driver and sent along with the driver identification or soon thereafter or before the driver identification is sent. The vehicle identification may alternatively be communicated directly from a device within the vehicle itself. The driver identification, however, is associated with the vehicle identification and may be included as a single \u201cdrive request\u201d that may be received  . The vehicle identification may include for example, a vehicle identification number (VIN), license plate number, or any other code or number that may identify the particular vehicle. Also, an indication of a type, class or category of the vehicle may also be sent and received  along with or as part of the vehicle identification.","It is then automatically determined  if the diver is insured for driving the type of vehicle identified. This determination may be made by electronically comparing the vehicle identification received to data from various electronically availably insurance records. For example, insurance records such as those shown in  may be automatically accessed for reasons of comparison. A particular driver's insurance record may be accessed by using the received identification of the driver. Then, the insurance record may be automatically read to determine the types of vehicles the driver is insured for. The types of vehicles the driver is insured for may then be compared to the type of the vehicle associated with the vehicle identification received. If the type of vehicle identified appears on the insurance policy of the driver, then it is electronically determined that the driver is insured for driving that type of vehicle. If the type of vehicle identified does not appear on the insurance policy of the driver, then it is electronically determined that the driver is not insured for driving that type of vehicle. The identification of the type of vehicle may have been received with or as part of the vehicle identification received, or may be determined based on the vehicle identification received. For example, the type of vehicle may be determined based on a VIN received.","If it is electronically determined that the driver is insured for driving that type of vehicle, then a signal is sent  to allow the vehicle to start. The signal may include a code or the like which the vehicle may receive via a wireless device within the vehicle. An ignition source or other mechanical device within the vehicle that allows the vehicle to start may be configured to only be enabled operable by receiving such a code that enables a switch to be activated (e.g., through a computer processor) that allows the flow of electricity needed to start the vehicle, for example. Also, the signal sent to allow the vehicle to start may first be received by a mobile device of the driver and then communicated wirelessly to the vehicle itself. Other means for allowing the vehicle to start are also contemplated and may be used.","If it is electronically determined that the driver is not insured for driving that type of vehicle, then a signal is sent  to prevent the vehicle to start. Alternatively, the vehicle may be prevented from starting by not sending a signal that enables operation of the vehicle. The signal to prevent the vehicle from operating may include a code or the like which the vehicle may receive via a wireless device within the vehicle. An ignition source or other mechanical device within the vehicle that allows the vehicle to start may be configured to be disabled by receiving such a code that enables a switch to be activated (e.g., through a computer processor) that disrupts the flow of electricity needed to start the vehicle, for example. Also, the signal sent to prevent the vehicle from starting may first be received by a mobile device of the driver and then communicated wirelessly to the vehicle itself. Other means for preventing the vehicle from starting are also contemplated and may be used. The process above may be applied to other types of vehicles, classes of vehicles and other forms of insurable transportation as well. For example, the process may be applied to providing driver's\/operating insurance for personal watercraft, boats, motorcycles, and airplanes, etc.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for tracking the operation of a vehicle of an individual insured driver. First, an identification of an individual driver may be received  electronically as described above with reference to . Next, or in conjunction with the receiving of the driver identification, an identification of a vehicle that the driver is attempting to drive may be received  as described above with reference to .","Next, an indication may be received  wirelessly from the vehicle itself or through a wireless device of the driver that the vehicle is running. This indication may originate from an on-board computer and\/or telematics system of the vehicle equipped with one or more wireless communications devices operable for communicating such information. This information such as the time the vehicle started running may be electronically recorded or noted in a law enforcement database an insurance policy record of the driver, or other database for example. Next, an indication may be received  wirelessly from the vehicle itself or through a wireless device of the driver that the vehicle has stopped running. This indication may originate from an on-board computer and\/or telematics system of the vehicle equipped with one or more wireless communications devices operable for communicating such information. This information such as the time the vehicle stopped running may be electronically recorded or noted in a law enforcement database, an insurance policy record of the driver, or other database for example.","It may then be electronically recorded  that the identified individual was operating the identified vehicle during the time period between the indications received that the vehicle is running and that the vehicle has stopped running. This information may be electronically recorded  or noted in a law enforcement database, an insurance policy record of the driver, or other database, for example.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for allowing operation of and tracking the operation of a vehicle of an individual insured driver.

Also, the driver identification may be received by one or more systems of an insurance company, law enforcement, vehicle owner or any other entity.","Next, or in conjunction with the receiving of the driver identification, an identification of a vehicle that the driver is attempting to drive may be received . The identification of the vehicle may also be received  wirelessly in the same manner as the driver identification above and may originate from the vehicle itself, for example. Sending of the vehicle identification may be triggered by the sending of the driver identification or when the driver inserts a key into the ignition of the vehicle. The vehicle identification may be communicated to the mobile device of the driver and sent along with the driver identification or soon thereafter or before the driver identification is sent. The vehicle identification may alternatively be communicated directly from a device within the vehicle itself. The driver identification, however, is associated with the vehicle identification and may be included as a single \u201cdrive request\u201d that may be received  . The vehicle identification may include for example, a vehicle identification number (VIN), license plate number, or any other code or number that may identify the particular vehicle. Also, an indication of a type, class or category of the vehicle may also be sent and received  along with or as part of the vehicle identification.","It is then automatically determined  if the diver is insured for driving the type of vehicle identified. This determination may be made by electronically comparing the vehicle identification received to data from various electronically availably insurance records. For example, insurance records such as those shown in  may be automatically accessed for reasons of comparison. A particular driver's insurance record may be accessed by using the received identification of the driver. Then, the insurance record may be automatically read to determine the types of vehicles the driver is insured for. The types of vehicles the driver is insured for may then be compared to the type of the vehicle associated with the vehicle identification received. If the type of vehicle identified appears on the insurance policy of the driver, then it is electronically determined that the driver is insured for driving that type of vehicle. If the type of vehicle identified does not appear on the insurance policy of the driver, then it is electronically determined that the driver is not insured for driving that type of vehicle. The identification of the type of vehicle may have been received with or as part of the vehicle identification received, or may be determined based on the vehicle identification received. For example, the type of vehicle may be determined based on a VIN received.","If it is electronically determined that the driver is insured for driving that type of vehicle, then a signal is sent  to allow the vehicle to start. The signal may include a code or the like which the vehicle may receive via a wireless device within the vehicle. An ignition source or other mechanical device within the vehicle that allows the vehicle to start may be configured to only be enabled operable by receiving such a code that enables a switch to be activated (e.g., through a computer processor) that allows the flow of electricity needed to start the vehicle, for example. Also, the signal sent to allow the vehicle to start may first be received by a mobile device of the driver and then communicated wirelessly to the vehicle itself. Other means for allowing the vehicle to start are also contemplated and may be used.","Next, after sending  of the signal to allowing the vehicle to start, an indication may be received  wirelessly from the vehicle itself or through a wireless device of the driver that the vehicle is running. This indication may originate from an on-board computer and\/or telematics system of the vehicle equipped with one or more wireless communications devices operable for communicating such information. This information such as the time the vehicle started running may be electronically recorded or noted in a law enforcement database an insurance policy record of the driver, or other database for example. Next, an indication may be received  wirelessly from the vehicle itself or through a wireless device of the driver that the vehicle has stopped running. This indication may originate from an on-board computer and\/or telematics system of the vehicle equipped with one or more wireless communications devices operable for communicating such information. This information such as the time the vehicle stopped running may be electronically recorded or noted in a law enforcement database, an insurance policy record of the driver, or other database for example.","It may then be electronically recorded  that the identified individual was operating the identified vehicle during the time period between the indications received that the vehicle is running and that the vehicle has stopped running. This information may be electronically recorded  or noted in a law enforcement database, an insurance policy record of the driver, or other database, for example.","If it is electronically determined that the driver is not insured for driving that type of vehicle, then a signal is sent  to prevent the vehicle to start. Alternatively, the vehicle may be prevented from starting by not sending a signal that enables operation of the vehicle. The signal to prevent the vehicle from operating may include a code or the like which the vehicle may receive via a wireless device within the vehicle. An ignition source or other mechanical device within the vehicle that allows the vehicle to start may be configured to be disabled by receiving such a code that enables a switch to be activated (e.g., through a computer processor) that disrupts the flow of electricity needed to start the vehicle, for example. Also, the signal sent to prevent the vehicle from starting may first be received by a mobile device of the driver and then communicated wirelessly to the vehicle itself. Other means for preventing the vehicle from staring are also contemplated and may be used.","Also, other information may be received during the operation of the vehicle originating from an on-board computer and\/or telematics system of the vehicle equipped with one or more wireless communications devices operable for communicating such information. Such information may be associated with a driver identified as associated with the starting of the vehicle and recorded  or noted in a law enforcement database, an insurance policy record of the driver, or other database. This information may originate directly from the vehicle or be first communicated to a mobile device associated with the driver and then communicated to other remote systems (e.g., insurance or law enforcement systems). This information may also be used in the calculation of determining future insurance rates, premiums, for providing feedback to the driver regarding their driving, for parental tracking of children's driving, as evidence regarding vehicle accidents, and as evidence in other legal disputes, etc. The process above may be applied to other types of vehicles, classes of vehicles and other forms of insurable transportation as well. For example, the process may be applied to providing driver's\/operating insurance for personal watercraft, boats, motorcycles, and airplanes, etc.","It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purposes of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention.
