The mobility of landline based calls is limited compared to mobile devices. Additionally, landlines may have multiple extensions, and privacy during a call may be impeded by another individual picking up an extension. However, transferring calls from a landline to a mobile device is too cumbersome and disruptive and may not be an option for resolving the disadvantages of a landline call.","According to some embodiments, call transfer management may include receiving, by a network device connected to a landline, an indication that a call on the landline should be transferred to a mobile device. An indication may be received from a mobile device and may be a request to transfer a call on a landline to the mobile device. According to some embodiments, a network device connected to a landline may detect a call on the landline and may apply rules to determine whether a call should be transferred to a mobile device.","According to one or more embodiments, the method may include receiving a phone call over a landline and determining, using a device connected to the landline, that the phone call over the landline should be transferred to a mobile device.

According to some embodiments, transfer request initiation module  may receive a request for initiation of a transfer from transfer logic module .","Transfer logic module  may contain one or more rules for determining whether a call should be transferred. According, to some embodiments, transfer requests may be received at a network element connected to a landline from wireless devices. If a wireless device is authenticated to a network element this may be sufficient to allow a transfer request to proceed. For example, network element  may require authentication or other security measures prior to permitting wireless connections from wireless device  and network client . If wireless device  is connected to network element , then transfer logic module  may permit a call transfer request from wireless device . A user of wireless device  may press a button, a function key, or other control to initiate a request of a transfer of a call currently on a landline (e.g., telephone ) to wireless device .

For example, transfer logic module  may receive call information from one or more of: caller id, calling line identification, calling number identification, and automatic number identification. Transfer logic module  may contain or access rules and mapping information to determine whether a call associated with certain call information should be transferred to a mobile device. For example, a phone number of a caller on a landline based call may be used to query a table or other data structure to determine whether the caller should be transferred to a mobile device. A user may specify that calls meeting certain conditions (e.g., originating from one or more specified numbers or area codes) are to be transferred to a mobile device. Other rules may include applying schedules to determine if a call should be transferred to a mobile device at a specified time or if it should be allowed to remain on a landline.","According to some embodiments, transfer logic module  may determine whether a transfer request received from a mobile device should be permitted (e.g., a user may not permit a child to receive call transfers to a mobile device during certain hours). According to some embodiments, transfer logic module  may initiate a call transfer from a landline to a mobile device without receiving a request from the mobile device. For example, a user may specify work hours during which calls from specified numbers to a home landline may be transferred to a mobile device (e.g., a user's cell phone at their office). According to some embodiments, other conditions may be detected and used to determine whether a call should be transferred. For example, if a landline has call waiting and is currently in use, a second call may be transferred to a mobile device. According to some embodiments, transfer logic module may receive information about a mobile device and may use this information to determine whether to transfer a call. If a mobile device is currently connected to a network device (e.g., network element ) then it may be determined that the mobile device is active and available for a call transfer.","According to some embodiments, a mobile device may be polled, queried, or prompted by transfer logic module . For example, network client  may be polled to determine whether a VOIP application is available and running. Transfer logic module  may send a notification to a user of a mobile device prompting them about a current landline call. For example, transfer logic module  may send a notification via WiFi, bluetooth, or another protocol to a wireless device. A notification may contain call information (e.g., a caller name and number) and may prompt a user to inquire whether they desire to transfer the call to the mobile device. According to some embodiments, MMS, SMS, email, or other messaging protocols may be used to provide a notification. A user of a mobile device may be able to respond to a notification using a same protocol to initiate a transfer of the landline based call to their mobile device.","Configuration and reporting module  may provide a user interface allowing configuration of call transfer management. Configuration and reporting module  may allow a user to provide a mapping of incoming calls to mobile devices using one or more of caller names, caller numbers, destination device numbers, destination device network addresses, and destination device ids. Configuration and reporting module  may allow a user to provide a schedule for permissible or impermissible call transfers (e.g., allowing or initiating the transfer of a call from a specified caller to a specified mobile device at certain times of the week and times of the day). Configuration and reporting module  may allow a user to specify one or more rules (e.g., transfer calls from a certain area code to a certain mobile device or do not permit the transfer of calls with blocked caller id information). Configuration and reporting module  may allow a user to add or remove devices that are permitted to transmit requests for call transfers and devices that are permitted to accept call transfers. According to one or more embodiments, configuration and reporting module  may generate logs of transferred calls, call transfer requests, and errors. Configuration and reporting module  may provide an interface that is accessible via a network for configuration, reporting, wireless authentication and security configuration, error notification and other call transfer management functionality.

According to some embodiments, a recipient of a call transfer request (e.g., network element ) may identify a target device via a connection used to send the transfer request. For example, network element  may determine that wireless device  is the intended call transfer target or destination based on a request transmitted over an authenticated wireless connection from wireless device .","According to some embodiments, it may be assumed that the call transfer request is for a call on a landline connected to a device receiving the call transfer request. For example, a user of wireless device  may press a button, issue a voice command, or provide other input requesting a transfer. Wireless device  may be connected to network element . According to some embodiments, network element  may identify wireless device  by a parameter in the request or by an attribute of the wireless connection to wireless device . In one or more embodiments, network element  may be configured to assume the transfer request is for a call presently on a landline connected to network element  (e.g., a call on phone ).","According to one or more embodiments, a device receiving a call transfer request may apply one or more mapping rules to identify a call to be transferred. For example, if there are multiple landlines or call waiting and a transfer requesting a mobile device is only permitted to transfer calls from one of the callers then a call for that caller may be transferred.

The call transfer request may also identify a transfer or target destination (e.g., a phone number or network address of a mobile device). If a call transfer has been requested by a user of a mobile device who is presently also engaged in the call on the landline, the user may hang up or terminate the call on the landline after submitting the request. According to one or more embodiments, after a call transfer request has been received and submitted to a switch, a confirmation tone on the landline, a light on network element , or another confirmation indicator may be provided indicating that the transfer request has been sent to the switch.
