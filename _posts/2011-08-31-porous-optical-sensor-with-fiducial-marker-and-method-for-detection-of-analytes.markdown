title: Porous optical sensor with fiducial marker and method for detection of analytes
abstract: The invention provides a porous sensor and sensing methods that use a porous sensor with a porous nanostructure having an optical response and having a portion of the porous nanostructure filled with a fiducial marker that is non-reactive to an analyte of interest. In a preferred sensing method, reflectance spectra from both the fiducial marker and reactive portions of the porous structure are acquired simultaneously. The fiducial marker provides an internal reference that permits compensation for humidity, as well as off angle measurements. In addition, simple visual observations can reveal the presence of an analyte, including human observations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM AND REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 from prior provisional application Ser. No. 61\/378,442, which was filed on Aug. 31, 2010, which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DMR-0452579 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Fields of the invention include porous optical sensors and chemical sensing. Example applications of the invention include remote chemical sensing, point of care biosensing, water quality monitoring, and air quality monitoring.","Porous films are well-suited to chemical sensing, as the optical response of the films shifts in a predetermined manner. However, ambient conditions can cause drift over time. Humidity, in particular, affects the baseline optical signal from a porous film, such as porous silicon, which can interfere with the ability to detect an analyte of interest via optical methods. The base line signal of a porous silicon film can also drift over time as oxidation caused by exposure to air reduces the natural hydrophobicity of an etched porous silicon layer over time, increasing the response of a porous silicon sensor to water vapor. The oxidation reaction thus leads to significant zero point drift. Another problem with optical interrogation of porous films concerns off-angle measurements. This is particularly problematic in remote sensing, where the angle of sensing is difficult to guarantee and replicate. A porous film that is optically interrogated at different angles can produce different signals. The variance in signals caused by angular variance in interrogation also interferes with the ability to detect or identify analytes of interest.","Optical reflectance is the most commonly used method used to interrogate porous sensors, and provides a convenient transduction mechanism that can be probed at a distance, either in free space or at the distal end of an optical fiber for remote detection of chemicals. In a free-space optical configuration, the intensity of one or more wavelengths of light reflected from the porous Si-based photonic structure is monitored using a laser or incoherent light source. Reflected intensity depends on the refractive index of the porous matrix, which is related to its chemical composition. Any adsorbate or chemical reaction that alters the chemical composition can, in principle, be detected. However, problems arise with signal drift as discussed above. In addition, the need to detect a reflectance spectrum requires optical sensing equipment that limits application.","A double layer sensor has been used to compensate for humidity drift. Ruminski, Moore & Sailor, \u201cHumidity-Compensating Sensor for Volatile Organic Compounds Using Stacked Porous Silicon Photonic Crystals,\u201d discloses double stack porous silicon sensors having a hydrophobic top stack and a hydrophilic bottom stack. The optical spectrum of the double-stack structure provides an effective structure to discriminate VOCs (volatile organic contaminants) from water vapor. Shifts in the peak frequencies from both photonic crystal stacks in the sensor are measured simultaneously. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic stacks respond differently to water and to VOC. The different response and the simultaneous measurement permits the effect of changing humidity to be nulled by calculating the weighted difference between the two peak frequencies. The method requires determination of a constant nulling factor for the double stack sensor.","Porous sensors can also be made chemically specific. Porous Si photonic crystals, for example, can be modified to incorporate a chemical reaction that is specific for an individual analyte or for a class of similar analytes. Oxidized porous Si is normally stable in air, but traces of HFreact with and remove the surface oxide, generating a blue shift in the reflectance spectrum. This reaction can be coupled to other reactions that produce HF, for example, the catalytic hydrolysis of fluorophosphonate nerve agents by copper-containing catalysts. Incorporation of a copper-based hydrolysis catalyst in a porous SiOmatrix generates a sensor that is specific for the P\u2014F bonds of the nerve agent sarin and related fluorophosphonates. See, e.g., H. Sohn, S. L\u00e9tant, M. J. Sailor, W. C. Trogler, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122, 5399 (2000). Another surface chemistry that is selective for certain classes of chemicals is silicon hydride. The electrochemical preparation of porous Si generates a surface that is covered with Si\u2014H, SiH, and SiHspecies. Though kinetically stable in air, this surface is rapidly degraded in corrosive environments (e.g. O, O, Cl, NO). The reactions convert Si\u2014Si and Si\u2014H bonds to Si\u2014O, which results in a decrease in refractive index of the porous Si matrix and a characteristic blue shift in the reflectance spectrum.","Detection of HF in environmental samples is commonly accomplished not with porous silicon but instead using a collection agent that is exposed for a prescribed period of time and subsequently subjected to a laboratory-based analysis. For example, filter paper impregnated with KHPOcan be used as a collection agent; after exposure the sample is eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate and the fluoride concentration is determined potentiometrically. This method can detect HF gas in the concentration range 0.68-5.45 ppm, over a period of 48 h. Polymer-based collection agents have also been employed; an alkaline impregnated polypropylene film detects HF gas in the concentration range 0.1-387 ppm in 4 h when subjected to electrochemical analysis using a fluoride selective-ion electrode. These dosimeters are designed to respond to HF in the gas phase only, and cannot detect aqueous hydrofluoric acid. Also, the methods do not monitor HF in real-time, but must be analyzed after exposure.","A common problem with porous sensors in general and any of the specific porous sensors discussed above is the aformentioned humidity and off angle measurement problems. Either or both of these issues can result in significant errors associated with detection of chemicals of interest in the environment using photonic materials, specifically, zero point drift of the measured spectrum and dependence of the spectrum on the observer-sample angle.","The invention provides a porous sensor and sensing methods using a porous nanostructure having an optical response and having a portion of the porous nanostructure filled with a fiducial marker that is non-reactive to an analyte of interest. In preferred embodiments, a nonreactive polymer, such as inert polystyrene, serves as the fiducial marker, which acts as an internal spectral reference. The polymer fiducial marker protects that portion of the sensor from reaction with analytes, including corrosive analytes.","In a preferred sensing method, reflectance spectra from both the polymer-filled and reactive portions of the porous nanostructure are acquired simultaneously. The fiducial marker provides an internal reference that permits compensation for humidity as the fiducial marker is not affected by humidity. The fiducial marker also allows elimination of artifacts associated with shifts of the resonance peak that result from variance of the angle of incidence of an optical probe.","The sensor and sensing methods including the fiducial marker also permit analyte detection that is unaided by complex optical equipment. A change in color relative to the fiducial marker permits analyte detection by a human observer or simple optical sensing and discrimination techniques based upon contrast that do not require more complex spectral analysis.","A particular preferred sensor and sensing method of the invention provides for sensitive detection of HF. High-temperature air or room-temperature ozone oxidation reactions are used to prepare the HF-reactive surface, and it is found that the ozone oxidation reaction produces a more sensitive HF sensor. Such a sensor also preferably includes a fiducial sensor.","Porous sensors and sensing methods of the invention incorporate a inert fiducial marker, preferably an inert polymer, as an internal standard to enable reliable detection of chemical or biological compounds. Preferred porous sensors are specific to particular compounds of interest except in the region of the fiducial marker that is substantially non-reactive and thereby provides a constant response that will not drift with changing humidity or in the presence of the analyte.","The incorporation of an internal standard into the sensor thus allows more reliable detection of chemical or biological compounds. A preferred sensor is formed of nanoporous material that is reactive towards a chemical or biological analyte(s) of interest, except in a portion of a fiducial marker. In the fiducial marker portion, the pores include a substance that is not reactive towards the intended chemical or biological analyte. The fiducial marker substance should also be selected to be substantially insensitive to environmental conditions that can adversely affect sensing. In preferred embodiments, the fiducial marker substance can be an organic polymer or polymer blend, a biopolymer or biopolymer blend, an organic compound or compounds, an inorganic compound or compounds, or a mixture of more than one of the above compounds.","Example preferred sensor material is porous silicon. Additional preferred embodiments include other porous semiconductors and insulators. A preferred silicon photonic crystal structure is anodically etched p type, B-doped, (100)-oriented crystalline silicon wafers in a solution of aqueous HF:ethanol. Exemplary etch parameters for an example rugate structure involve a sinusoidal current waveform oscillating between 10 and 35 mA\/cmwith 100 repeats and a periodicity of 10 s. Many variations of porous structures can be realized with different etching conditions, and many chemical and biological sensitivities can be created. Information for etching conditions and sensing affinities can be found, for example, in Sailor et al U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,042,570; 7,713,778; 7,443,811; 7,942,989; 7,318,903; 7,903,239; 7,759,129; and 7,889,954; and in Sailor et al U.S. Published Application Nos. 2005-0042764; 2006-0105043; 2007-0148695; 2007-0051815; 2007-0108465; and 2008-0296255. Such alternative etching conditions and sensing affinities as well as others that are known in the art can be used in preferred embodiment sensors of the invention that include a fiducial marker.","Preferred methods of fabrication form a sensor that is specific to an analyte of interest and that includes a fiducial marker and detection methods. In one embodiment a porous material is prepared to display an optical reflectivity spectrum that can be monitored using an optical reflectance spectrometer or by visual inspection. The porous material is treated to be specifically reactive toward a chemical or biological analyte of interest. Pores are filled in a marker area with a fiducial marker substance (e.g., an organic polymer) that is not reactive towards the intended chemical or biological analyte. In a method of sensing, the analyte is detected via instrumental or visual observation of a difference in spectral reflectivity or color between the chemically nonresponsive fiducial reference and the rest of the porous material. The fiducial marker method eliminates artifacts associated with varying angle of incidence of an optical probing detector relative to a one-dimensional photonic crystal sensor that lacks a fiducial marker. When a sensor of the invention is probed at an angle, the fiducial marker reflectivity peak wavelength shifts by the same nm amount as the reactive porous Si reflectivity peak. This permits a comparison between the wavelength position of both signals before and after a sensing event to eliminate errors in signal response resulting from changes in probing angle.","The porous sensor is preferably treated to provide specific reactivity toward an analyte of interest. For example, to achieve class specificity for chloramines, a reactive surface hydride or mixed surface hydride\/alkane can be fabricated. These surfaces react with oxidants to produce a spectral blue-shift. A portion of the porous sensor is infused with an inert polymer that serves as a fiducial marker for the reaction, enabling a determination of chloramine contamination by direct visual comparison either by human observation or by simple optical electronic equipment and analysis. The spectrum of the fraction of the porous Si material containing the inert polymer fiducial marker does not shift, or does not shift substantially compared to other portions of the sensor, upon exposure to chloramines. In addition to simple detection of analyte, such as chloramine, relative spectral shifts can be measured and correlated with chloramine concentration.","Experiments have demonstrated that the invention provides for accurate detection of HF acid as an example analyte. High-temperature air or room-temperature ozone oxidation reactions are used to prepare the HF-reactive surface, and it is found that the ozone oxidation reaction produces a more sensitive HF sensor. A porous sensor, in another example, is treated to exhibit specific reactivity for HF, by formation of a reactive surface oxide on the sensor. The reactive oxide surface is also stable in air, but it produces a spectral blue-shift in the presence of HF(g). A portion of the porous sensor is infused with an inert polymer that serves as a fiducial marker for the reaction, enabling a determination of HF contamination by direct visual comparison either by human observation or by simple optical electronic equipment and analysis. Relative spectral shifts be measured and correlated with HF concentration.","As another example treatment for specific reactivity to ozone, freshly etched porous silicon surfaces (H-terminated) can be optimized to respond to ozone. High-temperature air or room-temperature ozone oxidation reactions can be used to prepare the HF-reactive surface, and experiments have shown the ozone oxidation reaction produces greater sensitivity to HF (LLOD of 0.1% HF in water). Generally, treatments are selected according to analytes of interest.","Sensors of the invention and sensing methods can also be used, for example, as a protease sensor with appropriate treatment. Artisans will appreciate broader aspects of the invention from the following discussion of experiments and specific embodiments.","Referring now to , a porous nanostructure sensor  of the invention is shown. The sensor  is formed in a substrate  and includes a nanoporous sensor region . The sensor includes a fiducial marker  in a reference region and remaining portions of the nanoporous sensor region  accept analyte into the pores. In preferred embodiments, a nonreactive polymer, such as inert polystyrene, serves as the fiducial marker , which acts as an internal spectral reference. The polymer fiducial protects that portion of the sensor from reaction with analytes, including corrosive analytes. The fiducial marker fills the pores in that region and provides a constant optical reference, which is useful as a spectral reference in reflectance measurements, or in simple visual observations. The remaining portions of the nanoporous sensor regions are preferably prepared to be specific to an analyte of interest.","During sensing, the fiducial marker  provides an internal reference that can correct for signal drift and artifacts resulting from off axis measurement. The wavelength of a reflectance peak decreases at probing angles off of normal incidence. This property adds an extra variable that must be considered when analyzing sensor response. The angular dependence is particularly problematic in a remote sensing configuration, where the angle between the light source and the face of the porous sensor chip  cannot necessarily be fixed. The fiducial marker  provides a second reflectance peak that can be used to correct for angular fluctuations. In addition, the fiducial marker provides a distinct visual reference that can be used for simple detection of analytes that don't require spectral analysis of a reflectance spectrum from the sensor. Introduction of an analyte will introduce color change in the nanoporous sensor region  but not the region of the fiducial marker. This color change can be observed by a human observer or by simply optical detection techniques.","Experiments were conducted with porous silicon sensors including polymer fiducial markers. In the experiments, porous sensing regions were made specific to analytes of interest. Two reactive surface chemistries, silicon oxide and silicon hydride, to detect HF and Cl, respectively, were used as benchmarks in experiments. The experiments demonstrate additional features of the invention.","Experimental Data","Porous silicon photonic crystals were prepared by electrochemically etching boron-doped p-type crystalline silicon in a solution of aqueous hydrofluoric acid and ethanol. The doped silicon wafers were Single-crystalline highly doped p-type Si (0.0008-0.0012 \u03a9-cm resistivity, (100) polished, B-doped) was purchased from Siltronix Corp. The etching solution was Aqueous HF (49%), hydrochloric acid, methanol and hexane were purchased from VWR International. Polystyrene (MW=45,000 Da) was purchased from Aldrich, ethanol from Rossville Gold Shield Chemical Company, and oxygen from Westair Gases & Equipment.","A computer-controlled sinusoidal current density waveform was applied to the silicon anode, resulting in a multilayered porous Si film containing a pseudo-sinusoidal porosity gradient. The reflectance spectrum of the resulting material approximates a Rugate filter, displaying a peak corresponding to the stop band of the photonic crystal. The wavelength of the reflectance peak is controlled by the period and average value of the current density used in the electrochemical etch. Specifically, porous Si photonic crystals containing a single spectral reflectance peak were formed by anodization of highly doped p-type silicon wafers in a 3:1 v:v solution of aqueous hydrofluoric acid:ethanol in a two-electrode configuration using a platinum ring counter-electrode. Etching was performed in a Teflon etching cell using a galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research Model 363) under computer control (LabVIEW, National Instruments). The hydrofluoric acid solution was mixed during the etching process to minimize hydrogen bubble formation on the sample surface and to encourage etchant solution exchange. For the rugate samples, a cosine current density waveform varying between 13.3 and 39.8 mA\/cmwith a period of 12 s and 100 repeats was used to etch the porous layer. For gravimetric analysis, samples were etched at a constant current density of either 13.3 or 39.8 mA\/cmfor 10 min. Samples were etched on the polished side of the silicon wafer except for samples whose reflectivity spectra were probed at an incident angle of 40\u00b0\u2014these samples were etched on the non-polished side.","As-etched samples (\u201cSi\u2014H\u201d) were used without further processing for the Cl-reactive sensor experiments. HF-reactive sensors were prepared by oxidation. Two types of oxide-terminated surfaces were prepared: a thermal oxide prepared by oxidation in air at 600\u00b0 C. for 90 min, and an ozone-derived oxide prepared by exposure to ozone from a plasma source. Ozone-oxidized samples (\u201cSi\u2014OH\u201d) were prepared by placing as-etched, H-terminated porous Si samples in a flowing stream of ozone (Ozone Solutions, product ID OZV-8, flux of 8 g h) for 4 min., followed by heating at 180\u00b0 C. for 30 min to partially dehydrate the oxide. Thermally oxidized samples (\u201cSi\u2014O\u2014Si\u201d) were prepared by etching silicon with a cosine waveform of the same current density minimum and maximum, but to with a period of 14 sec. and 86 repeats. Samples were then inserted into a tube furnace (Lindberg\/Blue M) under air at 600\u00b0 C. for 90 min.","A fiducial marker consisting of polystyrene was added by pipeting a solution of polystyrene in toluene (1 \u03bcL, 12% by mass) onto the porous film prior to heating in an oven at 180\u00b0 C. for 30 min","Surface chemistry was characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.  shows ATR-FTIR spectra of porous Si samples before and after oxidation. The as-etched material (\u201cSi\u2014H\u201d) is predominantly covered with silicon hydride species. Ozone oxidation (\u201cSi\u2014OH\u201d) produces a more hydrophilic, hydroxylated surface, whereas thermal oxidation (\u201cSi\u2014O\u2014Si\u201d) generates a dehydrated silicon oxide. The black traces represent full-scale spectra, and the portion of the spectrum shown in gray (>1300 cm) is multiplied by 10 and offset along the y-axis for clarity. For both oxidation methods, sample spectra display strong bands associated with Si\u2014O vibrations (1020 cm). The ozone-oxidized samples also display a prominent band at 3300 cmassigned to OH stretching vibrations.","The thickness of the porous silicon layer was determined by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results are presented in Table 1. Gravimetric analysis was used to measure porosity of the etched films (Table 1). Three types of etches were used to characterize the properties of each surface chemistry type: samples etched with a cosine current waveform, samples etched for 10 min at a constant current representing the minimum current density of the cosine waveform, and samples etched for 10 min at a constant current representing the highest current density of the waveform. Porosity of the as-etched rugate structures decreases upon oxidation, because oxidation causes a volume expansion that effectively reduces the diameter of the pores.","Results obtained for both ozone-oxidized and thermally oxidized rugate samples are reported in Table 1. As expected, the average porosity value of oxidized rugate samples falls between the porosity values of the two samples prepared at the lower and upper constant current values. Again, both the experimental data and the calculations show that porosity decreases upon oxidation, consistent with the volume expansion of the pore walls that can be expected when the silicon surface is converted to silicon oxide. The calculated volume percentages of silicon dioxide for rugate samples are in good agreement with the results obtained on constant current-etched samples: 6.9%\u00b10.3% after ozone oxidation for 4 min.; 11.7%\u00b11.7% after thermal treatment at 180\u00b0 C. for 30 min. of ozone-oxidized samples; and 40.3%\u00b10.6% for samples thermally oxidized at 600\u00b0 C. for 90 min.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Measured and Calculated Porosity and Thickness of Porous Si"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Sample","Current density","Thickness (\u03bcm)","Average porosity (%)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["chemistry","etching profile","SEM","Calculated","Gravimetric","Calculated"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Si\u2014H","13.3 mA cm","\u20024.7 \u00b1 0.1","\u20024.3 \u00b1 0.1","61 \u00b1 1","57.6 \u00b1 0.1"]},{"entry":["(as-etched)","39.8 mA cm","13.6 \u00b1 0.2","12.7 \u00b1 0.1","67.8 \u00b1 0.5","60.8\u00b1 0.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Rugate","17.7 \u00b1 0.2","15.9 \u00b1 0.1","67.5 \u00b1 0.6","58.8 \u00b1 0.1"]},{"entry":["Si\u2014OH","13.3 mA cm","\u20024.59 \u00b1 0.08","\u20024.2 \u00b1 0.6","51 \u00b1 2","50.2 \u00b1 0.6"]},{"entry":["(ozone","39.8 mA cm","13.6 \u00b1 0.4","12.2 \u00b1 0.2","59.3 \u00b1 0.6","53.4 \u00b1 0.2"]},{"entry":["oxidized)","Rugate","18.3 \u00b1 0.3","15.9 \u00b1 0.2","59 \u00b1 1","51 \u00b1 1"]},{"entry":["Si\u2014O\u2014Si","13.3 mA cm","\u20024.57 \u00b1 0.07","\u20024.0 \u00b1 0.1","37 \u00b1 3","35.7 \u00b1 0.3"]},{"entry":["(furnace","39.8 mA cm","14.0 \u00b1 0.3","11.9 \u00b1 0.2","49.6 \u00b1 0.7","40.7 \u00b1 0.4"]},{"entry":["oxidized)","rugate","18.7 \u00b1 0.1","15.5 \u00b1 0.2","48 \u00b1 1","37.6 \u00b1 0.3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":["a","\u22122"]}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"b"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"c"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"d"}}]}}]}}},"A portion of the porous matrices prepared in experiments were filled with an inert material fiducial material, polystyrene, to provide a chemically stable optical signature that could serve as a reference for the reactive chemical sensor. Polystyrene readily infiltrates the porous Si samples and it is substantially unreactive with HF. The fiducial marker optical reference was infused into a portion of the ozone-oxidized sample by spotting a small area of the surface with a solution of polystyrene in toluene, followed by 30 min of heating at 180\u00b0 C. to remove the toluene solvent and to fully infiltrate the depth of the pores with polystyrene. Reflectance spectra obtained from the resulting samples display two distinct peaks, at 600 and 700 nm, corresponding to the stop bands of the air-filled and polystyrene-filled regions of the porous rugate filter, respectively.","Immersion of the sample in water shifts the position of the 600 nm peak (corresponding to the air-filled region of the film) to 650 nm, as seen in , while the peak corresponding to the polymer-filled region shows no significant spectral shift.  shows the reflectance spectra of an ozone-oxidized porous Si sample containing an impregnated polystyrene fiducial marker, before and during exposure to aqueous HF (1.5%). The spectrometer optics encompassed both the polymer-filled and the unfilled regions of the film equally, spectra were acquired at the ozone oxidized porous silicon\/polystyrene infused porous silicon interface. A cross-sectional schematic of the structure containing the polystyrene fiducial marker is shown in the inset. From top to bottom: reflectance peak of sample in deionized water, after 1 min., 2 min., and 10 min. exposure to 1.5% HF. Spectra were obtained on samples submerged in either water or 1.5% aqueous HF. As seen in , the fiducial marker provides a constant reference peak that is near 700 nm. The separation between the constant reference peak and the peak attributable to the HF infiltration into reactive portions of the sensor provides a powerful means for determination of HF and that is insensitive to probe angle variation and changing humidity.","The HF reaction mechanism in the reactive portion of the porous silicon sensor is of interest. Exposure of an ozone-oxidized porous Si photonic crystal to an aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution results in removal of the surface oxide via Eq. (1):\n\nSiO+6HF\u2192Si+2H+2HO\u2003\u2003(1)\n","As the oxide is removed, the net refractive index of the film decreases, resulting in a blue shift of the photonic resonance. The solution does not attack polystyrene-filled porous Si, and the reflectance spectrum from this region of the film does not change.  shows the evolution of the reflectance spectrum, obtained with the optical probe beam overlapping both polymer-filled and unfilled regions of the chip, showing how the resonance from the polymer-filled photonic crystal can act as an internal standard, or fiducial marker, for the sensor. The intensity of the stop band peak associated with the open, actively dissolving region of the porous Si chip increases during the initial stages of dissolution. The intensity of the stop band depends on the index contrast between the repeating layers of the photonic crystal; the intensity increase observed in the early stages of dissolution indicates that the index contrast is increasing, presumably associated with the dissolution process. This effect might be attributable to the removal of silicon oxide or the generation of gas bubbles within the pore structure as the material dissolves.","Theoretical calculations of the reflectance spectra of porous Si containing the polystyrene fiducial markers were performed to verify the sample parameters of thickness and porosity, to predict the response of the samples to HF exposure, and to interpret the angular dependence of the reflectance spectra. Optical reflectance spectra were fit to numerical calculations that incorporated the wavelength dependent refractive index of silicon, the Bruggeman effective medium model, and the optics equations describing the various structures used in the experiments. Reflectance spectra were acquired in the range 500 to 1000 nm for all sample types (constant current etch, rugate etch, freshly etched, thermal and ozone oxidized, with and without polymer fiducial marker). Typical reflectance spectra of porous Si samples etched using constant and cosine-modulated current are presented in .  include experimental and calculated reflectance spectra of as-anodized samples etched with constant current density of 13.3 mA\/cmfor 10 min. (), 39.8 mA\/cmfor 10 min. (), and with a cosine modulated current (). The cosine function was bounded by a maximum current density of 39.8 mA\/cmand a minimum current density of 13.3 mA\/cm","Samples etched at a constant current contain a uniform porous layer that acts as a Fabry-Perot cavity; the optical reflectance spectra display a series of fringes corresponding to constructive and destructive interference. The samples etched with a sinusoidal current density waveform display a strong resonance peak in the reflectance spectrum that corresponds to the stop band of the photonic crystal (rugate filter). The spectra depend on the physical morphology and optical properties of the porous Si layers: thickness and refractive index for constant-current etched samples; modulation period and refractive index for sinusoidal-current etched samples. Oxidation treatments as well as infiltration of the porous matrix with solvent or polymer produce predictable changes in the Fabry-Perot fringes and the rugate peak position that were quantitatively fit to the theoretical curves.","Porosity and thickness of as-etched (Si\u2014H) samples etched for 10 min. with a constant current density (13.3 mA\/cmor 39.8 mA\/cm), were calculated using data obtained from reflectance spectra acquired in air. Additionally, reflectance spectra collected with different media filling the porous layer provide information that can yield the properties of thickness and porosity for a given porous Si sample. Infiltration of a liquid into the porous structure leads to predictable changes in the position of the reflectance peaks (typically a red shift relative to air). This approach is referred to as SLIM, for Spectroscopic Liquid Infiltration Method. Calculations of the reflectance spectrum of air and liquid-infiltrated samples yield results that agree well with the gravimetric and SEM measurements for thickness and porosity reported in Table 1. A difference of a few percent between theoretical and measured values is observed, which is attributed to inaccuracies of the gravimetric, SEM, and optical measurements and the calculations employed. For instance, the gravimetric measurement is a destructive method that determines the average porosity of the entire film, whereas the optical measurement is determined from the reflectance spectrum originating from a single (mm-diameter) spot on the sample. Thus, variations in thickness or porosity in the x-y plane of the sample are not accounted for with the optical fitting method.","The samples used in the experiments contain two or more components: silicon, silicon oxide, air, a liquid, or the polymer fiducial. In order to calculate the porosity and thickness from the experimental reflectance spectra, an appropriate effective medium model must be employed. The Bruggemann approximation was used for this purpose.

Oxidation of the internal pore surface is assumed to occur uniformly throughout the entire film thickness. To be consistent with Eq. 2, here V; is defined as the volume of silicon that was present in the porous Si matrix prior to oxidation. Reaction of silicon with oxygen produces a 2.27-fold volume increase in the silicon skeleton. Assuming that the volume fraction of silicon oxide is V, the volume fraction of silicon is reduced by V\/2.27 and the void volume fraction is (1.27\/2.27)V, relative to as-etched samples. For oxidized samples, the porosity depends on the fraction of silicon in the porous matrix before oxidation (V), the as-etched porosity (P=1\u2212V), and the volume fraction of silicon dioxide present after oxidation (V). Once the initial porosity P=1\u2212V; is known, a wavelength-dependent value for the refractive index of the oxidized porous Si sample, n(\u03bb,P, V), can be obtained by solving Eq. 3 for a given oxide volume.

As expected, the average porosity of the rugate samples is midway between the porosity values found for samples etched at constant current density, using the minimum and maximum current values that were employed in the current waveform that etched the rugate samples.

The wavelength-dependent refractive index of silicon was used. Two- and three-component Bruggemann approximations were used to calculate the wavelength-dependent refractive index of porous silicon for a given porosity value, according to the methods described above.

The dynamic range of the HF response for ozone-oxidized samples is slightly larger than that of the furnace-oxidized samples. The greater sensitivity of the Si\u2014OH surface to low concentrations of HF corresponds to a larger reaction rate for the Si\u2014OH surface relative to the Si\u2014O\u2014Si surface. This is attributed to the nature of the surface oxides; thermal oxidation is carried out at a high temperature, which anneals the film somewhat and generates stable surface Si\u2014O\u2014Si species. In contrast, processing of the ozone-oxidized samples occurs at lower temperature, resulting in a more hydrophilic and more reactive surface oxide. Thermal oxidation also creates a thicker oxide.

The discrepancy is attributed to the lower accuracy with which incident and reflected angles can be measured on the experimental setup used for these measurements.","Ozone-oxidized samples containing polystyrene fiducial markers were exposed to aqueous HF solutions at concentrations of 6.8, 1.7, 0.46 and 0.11% for 10 min, and reflectance peak positions were monitored at 3 probing angles: 0, 9 and 40 degrees from normal incidence.  shows shift in wavelength, relative to a fiducial marker, of the reflectance peak maximum from ozone-oxidized porous Si samples (Si\u2014OH) after 10 min. exposure to the indicated mass percentage concentrations of HF. Values measured at the indicated probing angles \u03b8, as defined in , are compared. The fiducial marker in the experiments consists of a small region on each porous Si sample that is filled with inert polystyrene, which provides a reflectivity peak at a wavelength, \u03bb(ps), that is different from the wavelength of the solution-filled regions of the HF exposed porous Si film, \u03bb(aq). \u0394Wavelength is defined as \u03bb(ps)\u2212\u03bb(aq).

The porosity as measured by the gravimetric method is also the same. The value of \u03bbfor the aqueous HF solution-filled region of the chip shifts to the blue with increasing HF concentration. By contrast, the value of \u03bbfor the polymer-filled region of the chip does not change at any value of HF concentration studied.

Specifically,  plot shift in wavelength of the maximum of the reflectance peak measured from the reactive-open (black diamond) and polystyrene-filled (gray square) regions of an ozone-oxidized porous Si sample, as a function of time exposed to 0.46% HF. for measurement angles of 0\u00b0, 9\u00b0 and 40\u00b0. Results indicate that the angle of incidence does not significantly affect the separation between the reflectance peak maximum of porous silicon and the polystyrene filled fiducial marker, meaning the fiducial marker reduces errors that would result from measurement angle changes. The results show that a polystyrene-infused porous Si fiducial allows the sensor response to be separated from the effects of probing angle. Subtraction of the reflectance peak wavelength of the ozone oxidized, aqueous solution-filled region of the porous Si sample from the polystyrene-filled, nonreactive region results in a difference (\u201c\u0394Wavelength\u201d in Table 4) of \u02dc43 nm at all probing angles before introduction of HF.

The reaction of the Si\u2014H surface of porous Si with Clcould proceed via attack at both Si\u2014Si and Si\u2014H bonds, although prior studies have indicated that halogens attack Si\u2014Si bonds more readily than Si\u2014H bonds on porous Si surfaces (Eq. 9). Studies of the reactivity of the Si\u2014Cl species on Si (111) and (100) surfaces indicate that hydrolysis generates Si\u2014O\u2014Si (Eq. 10) in preference to Si\u2014OH.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"66.21mm","wi":"76.28mm","file":"US08778690-20140715-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":"2"},"All surface chemistry types exhibited an instantaneous red shift in the spectral reflectance peak of several nm upon introduction of the Clanalyte.

The reflectance peaks from the ozone-oxidized and furnace-oxidized samples stabilize relatively quickly and exhibit no further change under the experimental conditions.

Direct comparison of gas phase with liquid-phase measurements is not exact, but the concentrations of HF detected by preferred sensors and methods are significantly larger than the gas-phase work discussed in the background. The lowest concentration tested in experiments discussed above is 0.11% by mass, which corresponds to 1100 ppm. However, the timescale of the present experiments is significantly shorter than in the prior methods discussed in the background (10 min vs. 4-48 h). It is expected that longer exposure times will yield lower limits of detection. The fundamental response depends on the stoichiometric quantity of HF that has reacted with the sensor element, and the time-dependence of this response must be taken into account in order to yield quantitative results.","As shown in the experimental data preferred sensors of the invention provide a fiducial marker that can reduce zero point drift due to humidity changes and can compensate for changes in observation angle. The ability to probe the sensor with a remote optical detector, without the need to physically collect the specimen after analyte exposure, is a key need for many remote monitoring applications.","The inert fiducial marker in preferred porous sensors and sensing methods creates a self-referenced sensor that can be probed with a free-space optical detector, and can also be monitored by simple visual observations. The fiducial marker generates a separate, chemically stable reflectance peak in reflectance spectra that acts as an internal standard, eliminating zero point drift associated with variable sample-optics angles. Zero point drift related to humidity can also be compensated. In preferred sensors, because of the specificity of the chemical reactions used to prepare the porous silicon for HF and Clanalytes (silicon oxide for HFand silicon hydride for Cl), minimal analyte cross reactivity is observed between the two sensor types.","Coating the nanoengineered silicon photonic crystals with the appropriate molecules can also produce assay devices for many important classes of enzymes (proteases, RNAase, DNAase, etc.). The system is suitable to detect the activity of any enzyme and other catalytic or noncatalytic analytes of interest that can degrade a substrate carried by the porous optical sensor. Because the mode of action of chloramines is to react with lipids and other biological species comprising the protective machinery of bacteria, biopolymer coatings that possess a specific reactivity with chloramines can be evaluated. Films can also contain a region that is protected with an unreactive polymer providing a fiducial marker, which allows quick evaluation of the sensor by visual comparison of the color of the two spots on the chip.","In a preferred embodiment, the reactive surface type used to detect triggered oxidation is hydrophobic surface that contains surface hydrides. These species, though kinetically stable in air, are rapidly degraded in corrosive environments (e.g. ozone, NO). This surface type will is also expected to be responsive to chloramines.","While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
