No. 61\/324,899 filed Apr. 16, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Eukaryotic cells divide by a directed, step-wise process referred to as the cell cycle. Cells must first replicate their DNA in S phase before separating their sister chromatids in mitosis (karyokinesis) and splitting off into two daughter cells (cytokinesis). In mammalian cells, DNA replication must be initiated at multiple sites (replication origins) throughout the genome to ensure that all the genetic material is duplicated prior to mitosis. To maintain genome integrity, DNA must be replicated only once per cell cycle, and so this process is highly regulated and governed by checkpoints. Before replication is initiated, origins must be licensed through the formation of pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) in early G1.","Formation of pre-RCs involves the step-wise binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to origins followed by the binding of the loading factors Cdc6 and Cdt1. These proteins then recruit the putative DNA replicative helicase complex, MCM2-7. Once this pre-RC is formed, replication initiation requires the activation of S-phase-promoting serine\/threonine kinases, Cyclin\/Cdks and Cdc7\/Dbf4. These kinases consist of an enzymatic subunit (CDKs and Cdc7) and a regulatory sub-unit (Cyclins for CDKs; Dbf4 or Drfl for Cdc7). They phosphorylate multiple MCMs in pre-RCs in a sequential manner, thereby activating the helicase and recruiting other DNA replication factors (Cdc45, GINS complex, etc.) for DNA synthesis (for reviews, see Kim et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007; Stillman, 2005). MCM2 Serine-40 and Serine-53 are well-characterized phosphorylation sites for Cdc7\/Dbf4 (Cho et al., 2006; Montagnoli et al., 2006; Tsuji et al., 2006).","Inhibiting regulators of replication initiation, such as Cdc6, Cdc7\/Dbf4 or Cdc7\/Drf1, has lethal consequences in cancerous cells, whereas normal cells are able to arrest and resume normal divisions once initiation activity is restored (Feng et al., 2003; Montagnoli et al., 2004; see Lau and Jiang, 2006, for review). Small molecule inhibitors of the protein kinase Cdc7 are thus attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention in cancer, inflammation and other cell proliferative disorders.","The present invention has numerous embodiments.

The meaning and scope of the terms should be clear, however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. In this application, the use of \u201cor\u201d means \u201cand\/or\u201d unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term \u201cincluding\u201d, as well as other forms, such as \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d, is not limiting. With reference to the use of the words \u201ccomprise\u201d or \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccomprising\u201d in this patent application (including the claims), Applicants note that unless the context requires otherwise, those words are used on the basis and clear understanding that they are to be interpreted inclusively, rather than exclusively, and that Applicants intend each of those words to be so interpreted in construing this patent application, including the claims below. For a variable that occurs more than one time in any substituent or in the compound of the invention or any other formulae herein, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Combinations of substituents are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Stable compounds are compounds which can be isolated in a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture.","It is meant to be understood that proper valences are maintained for all combinations herein, that monovalent moieties having more than one atom are attached through their left ends, and that divalent moieties are drawn from left to right.","As used in the specification and the appended claims, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated:","The term \u201calkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight-or branched-chain saturated hydrocarbyl substituent typically containing from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-amyl, and hexyl and the like.","The term \u201calkenyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more double bonds and typically from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethenyl (vinyl), 2-propenyl, 3-propenyl, 1,4-pentadienyl, 1,4-butadienyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, and 3-butenyl and the like.","The term \u201calkynyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more triple bonds and typically from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethynyl, 2-propynyl, 3-propynyl, 2-butynyl, and 3-butynyl and the like.","The term \u201ccarbocyclyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d), partially saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkenyl\u201d), or completely unsaturated (i.e., \u201caryl\u201d) hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms (\u201cring atoms\u201d are the atoms bound together to form the ring or rings of a cyclic substituent). A carbocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure.","A carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure, which typically contains from 3 to 8 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single-ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl (cyclopropanyl), cyclobutyl (cyclobutanyl), cyclopentyl (cyclopentanyl), cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl (cyclohexanyl), cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enyl, and adamantanyl. In a fused-ring carbocyclyl system, two or more rings may be fused together, such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of two- or three-fused ring carbocyclyls include naphthalenyl, tetrahydronaphthalenyl(tetralinyl), indenyl, indanyl(dihydroindenyl), anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, and decalinyl.","The term \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms. A cycloalkyl may be a single carbon ring, which typically contains from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms and more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of single-ring cycloalkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. A cycloalkyl may alternatively be polycyclic or contain more than one ring. Examples of polycyclic cycloalkyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls.","The term \u201caryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic carbocyclyl containing from 6 to 14 carbon ring atoms. Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, and indenyl.","In some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix \u201cC-C-\u201d, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, \u201cC-C-alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C-C-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms.","The term \u201chydrogen\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as \u2014H.","The term \u201chydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014OH.","The term \u201ccarboxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014OH.","The term \u201camino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014NH.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014I).","If a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted\u201d, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","The prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus, for example, the term \u201cperfluoro\u201d means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate, the term \u201cperfluoroalkyl\u201d means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.","The term \u201ccarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014.","The term \u201caminocarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014NH.","The term \u201coxo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means (\u2550O).","The term \u201coxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an ether substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014O\u2014.","The term \u201calkylhydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-OH.","The term \u201calkylamino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-NH.","The term \u201calkyloxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an alkylether substituent, i.e., \u2014O-alkyl.

Such a substituent may be depicted as \u2014S\u2014. This, for example, \u201calkyl-thio-alkyl\u201d means alkyl-S-alkyl (alkyl-sulfanyl-alkyl).","The term \u201cthiol\u201d or \u201csulfhydryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a sulfhydryl substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014SH.","The term \u201c(thiocarbonyl)\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a carbonyl wherein the oxygen atom has been replaced with a sulfur.

To illustrate, the term \u201calkylcycloalkyl\u201d contains two components: alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus, the C-C- prefix on C-C-alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; the C-C-prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further, the prefix \u201chalo\u201d on haloalkyloxyalkyl indicates that only the alkyloxy component of the alkyloxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If halogen substitution may alternatively or additionally occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as \u201chalogen-substituted alkyloxyalkyl\u201d rather than \u201chaloalkyloxyalkyl.\u201d And finally, if the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as \u201calkyloxyhaloalkyl.\u201d","The terms \u201ctreat\u201d, \u201ctreating\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a disease and\/or its attendant symptoms.","The terms \u201cprevent\u201d, \u201cpreventing\u201d and \u201cprevention\u201d refer to a method of preventing the onset of a disease and\/or its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring a disease. As used herein, \u201cprevent\u201d, \u201cpreventing\u201d and \u201cprevention\u201d also include delaying the onset of a disease and\/or its attendant symptoms and reducing a subject's risk of acquiring a disease.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to that amount of the compound being administered sufficient to prevent development of or alleviate to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being treated.","The term \u201cmodulate\u201d refers to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function, or activity, of a kinase. \u201cModulation\u201d, as used herein in its various forms, is intended to encompass antagonism, agonism, partial antagonism and\/or partial agonism of the activity associated with kinase. Kinase inhibitors are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate signal transduction. Kinase activators are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize or up regulate signal transduction.","The term \u201ccomposition\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.","The \u201csubject\u201d is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice and the like.

The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides.

The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032-and\/ or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand.","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies.
