title: System for signal mixing and method thereof
abstract: A system and methods are provided for mixing input signal data values with values of a sinusoidal waveform. The sinusoidal waveform is normalized at a value greater than one and sampled to generate a fixed set of values for every period of the sinusoidal waveform. The fixed set of values is then converted to a plurality of bit-shift summation sets. The bit-shift summation sets are applied to the input signal by binary shifting the input signal data values. The binary shifts represent a mixing of the fixed set of values associated with the sinusoidal waveform and the input signal values.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to signal mixing and more specifically to modifying sinusoidal representation for signal mixing.","Digital signal mixing combines two separate digital signals into a single mixed signal having characteristics of both of the separate digital signals. Such mixing techniques are generally known in communications applications. Generally, signal mixing is used in heterodyning. In heterodyning, an input signal having a center frequency and a particular baseband spectrum, is mixed with a locally generated signal to generate a mixed signal. The mixed signal represents the input signal, keeping the same baseband spectrum as the input signal; however, with a different center frequency from the input signal. Shifting the center frequency of a signal allows for specific filtering or sample-rate matching.","A method of digital signal mixing is direct mixing, in which sampled values of an input signal are mixed with values from a sinusoid of a particular frequency. A processor may be used to combine sets of sampled values from the input signal and the sinusoid to generate the mixed signal. The processor performs several calculations to generate each value of the mixed signal. A first set of calculations is performed to generate or obtain values of the sinusoid. A second set of calculations is performed to combine values of the input signal with values of the sinusoid. The calculations may be difficult to implement during real-time signal processing.","The time available to perform signal mixing calculations is limited by the highest rate of the input signal accepted. To be performed real-time, signal-mixing calculations must generally be performed at speeds faster than the rate used to receive values of the input signal. If the calculations take too long to perform, data values from the input signal may be lost. Current methods of digital signal mixing are too processor intensive.","Methods of reducing processor overhead in calculating mixed signals have been attempted. To reduce calculations performed during the generation of the sinusoid, values of a pre-generated sinusoid are stored in a lookup table, eliminating a need to calculate the sinusoid as part of real-time mixing calculations. However, pre-calculating the sinusoid only offers limited success, because the processor must still perform the mixing calculations between the input signal values and the lookup table sinusoid values in real time.","Another limitation of conventional methods of mixing digital signals is that some of the values associated with the sinusoid are floating point values, which further increase computational complexity during mixing operations. To reduce calculation complexity, conventional methods sometimes represent the sinusoid using the values 1, 0, \u22121, and 0. Mixing operations using the values of 1, 0, \u22121, and 0 simplify mixing calculations; however the values are not always appropriate because the mixing frequency that is convenient from using the values of 1, 0, \u22121, and 0 may not be the correct frequency in the desired application. Using the sequence of values of 1, 0, \u22121, and 0 generates a sinusoid at one quarter of sampling rate used. The forced relationship of one quarter a sampling rate may not be practical as the sampling rate could be fixed due to analog circuit constraints; while, the mixing frequency could be fixed due to external standards bodies. From the above discussion, it should be clear that a less processor intensive method of mixing digital signals is needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 1\u20134"},"Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating a system for shifting an input signal in frequency is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. An input signal waveform, input signal , is received through input port  and mixed with a sinusoidal function  to generate a mixed signal . The mixed signal  represents the input signal  shifted in frequency. The mixed signal  is filtered to generate a filtered signal , which is provided through output port . The sinusoidal function  is represented by a set of bit-shift summation values as will be discussed further in reference to .","In the illustrated embodiment, input signal  represents a bandpass signal with an energy spectrum , as defined by a function G(f). Energy spectrum  describes the energy of the bandpass signal at particular frequencies. Input signal  is a real valued signal, so energy spectrum  includes a positive envelope portion  (indicating a response at positive frequencies) and negative envelope portion  (indicating response to negative frequencies) symmetric to positive envelope portion . It should be noted that while a signal with only real components is discussed, the present disclosure may be applied to complex signals.","Both positive envelope portion  and negative envelope portion  may be defined as having a bandwidth of B hertz. For purposes of discussion, we will designate a reference frequency exactly between the positive envelope portion  and the negative envelope portion . In energy spectrum , the reference frequency  lies at the zero frequency point.","In one embodiment, it is desirable to shift the input signal  to a higher frequency. The shift in frequency may be to accommodate a new sampling rate, to accommodate transmission in a different frequency band, or some other purpose. To shift input signal  in frequency, a mixer  is provided. Mixer  applies a sinusoidal function  to input signal . By mixing input signal  with sinusoidal function , input signal  may be shifted in frequency by an amount approximately equal to the frequency of the sinusoidal function . In one embodiment, the sinusoidal waveform used for mixing is defined using an amplitude, \u201cA\u201d, a frequency, \u201c\u03c9\u201d, a time, \u201ct\u201d, the constant for the base of the natural logarithm, \u201ce\u201d, and the imaginary component term, \u201cj\u201d, such as in the sinusoid equation:\n\nAe.\n","The above sinusoid equation is mathematically equivalent to:\n\n[COS(\u03c9)\u2212SIN(\u03c9)].\n","The sinusoid equation \u201cCOS(\u03c9t)\u2212j SIN(\u03c9t)\u201d represents a sinusoid having a period of \u201c\u03c9t\u201d and an amplitude of \u201cA\u201d. \u201cCOS(\u03c9t)\u201d represents a real component of the sinusoidal waveform, while the imaginary component term, \u201cj\u201d (equivalent to the square root of negative one), identifies the \u201cSIN(\u03c9t)\u201d as being part of an imaginary component of the sinusoidal waveform. Time may be used to identify particular data points on both input signal  and sinusoidal function . Accordingly, the same value of \u201ct\u201d will indicate a particular data point and a corresponding point in sinusoidal function .","In one embodiment, it is desired to use eight sampled values per period of the sinusoidal function used for mixing, such as sinusoidal function . The frequency, \u201c\u03c9\u201d, may be defined as \u201c\u03c9\/8\u201d indicating a sampling frequency, \u201c\u03c9\u201d needed to allow eight values of the sinusoidal function  to be sampled, at a frequency of \u201c\u03c9\u201d, for every period of the sinusoidal function . Accordingly, the sinusoidal function  may be defined according to the following function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"A","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"COS","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","s"]},"mn":"8"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"t"}}},{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"SIN","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","s"]},"mn":"8"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"t"}}}}],"mo":"-"}}},"mo":"."}}}},"As mixer  mixes input signal  with sinusoidal Function , a mixed signal  is generated. Mixed signal  is a representation of input signal  shifted in frequency. Mixed signal  includes an energy spectrum , as defined by a function G(f). Energy spectrum  includes a first portion , having a bandwidth of B hertz, related to positive envelope signal  and a second portion  related to negative envelope portion . The reference frequency, marking a frequency exactly between first portion  and second portion , may be found in energy spectrum  as reference frequency , at a frequency of \u03c9\/8, indicating input signal  has been shifted in frequency by \u03c9\/8 as dictated by sinusoidal function .","In one embodiment, the resultant second portion  is undesired for transmission as second portion  may interfere with other signals to be transmitted. Accordingly, a filter  may be used to remove second portion . Filter  may include a bandpass filter used to severely attenuate signals within the frequencies represented by second portion . Filter , when used, generates a filtered signal  from mixed signal . An energy spectrum , as defined by a function G(f), still includes first portion ; however, second portion  has been removed by filter . The filtered signal  may then be output through output port . The filtered signal  may then be provided to other components of a communications system (not shown). It should be noted that while input signal  represents a particular bandpass signal, other forms of signals may be mixed using the methods described herein. Furthermore, while input signal  is described to as a signal with only real components, complex signals may also be applied without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore, while sinusoidal function  is shown as having real and imaginary portions, sinusoidal function  could be real only or imaginary only without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","To simplify calculations needed to perform a mixing of sinusoidal function  with input signal , the amplitudes of samples of sinusoidal function  are represented using bit-shift summation sets. The values of sinusoidal function  are normalized to a value greater than one, sampled and converted into values that may be represented during mixing by accumulating one or more bit-shifts of the in input signal  values, as discussed further in reference to . For example, real values of sinusoidal function  may be normalized between 17\/16 and \u2212 17\/16. A sample of sinusoidal function  may include a maximum value of 17\/16, also represented as \u201c1+ 1\/16\u201d. Since a division of a value by sixteen may be generated using four binary shifts of the value to the right, a value of the input signal may be mixed with a value of \u201c1+ 1\/16\u201d by adding the input signal value with a value of itself binary shifted four times to the right.","Referring now to , a diagram identifying points on a sinusoidal function represented by bit-shift summation sets is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A sinusoidal waveform , normalized at a value greater than one, is sampled at particular points, such as points \u2013, along a period  of the sinusoidal waveform  to generate sampled values. The sampled values are then represented using values that may be realized using binary shifting and addition, such as defined by bit-shift summation sets \u2013.","In the illustrated embodiment, a real part of a mixing function, such as sinusoidal function  () is represented using sinusoidal waveform . Sinusoidal waveform  is normalized at a value of 17\/16 and is represented using the function:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["17","16"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"COS","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","s"]},"mn":"8"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"t"}}}},"mo":","}}}},"where the amplitude of sinusoidal waveform  is 17\/16 and the frequency of sinusoidal waveform  is \u03c9\/8.","Accordingly, a sampler defined at a rate of \u201c\u03c9\u201d would receive eight points of sinusoidal waveform  for a full period, such as period . The points, such as points \u2013, may be sampled substantially equidistant from each other in time. In the illustrated embodiment, points \u2013 are sampled from sinusoidal waveform  for mixing operations. In other systems, the values of points \u2013 would be multiplied with values of an input signal, such as input signal  (). Since the values include decimal values or fractions, the calculations to perform multiplications during mixing may get complex and generate intense processing overhead to calculate a mixed signal. To simplify mixing calculations, the values of points \u2013 may be represented using bit-shift summation sets \u2013.","For example, point  corresponds to a value of 17\/16, equivalent to 1.0625. However, 17\/16 is equivalent to one plus 1\/16. Using binary operations, a division of a value by sixteen may be represented as four binary shifts of the value to the right. Therefore, point  may be represented by bit-shift summation set . A mixed value of point  with an input signal value should represent a multiplication of \u201cone plus 1\/16\u201d by the input signal value, equivalent to the input signal value plus the input signal value divided by 16, according to the associative law of mathematics. Accordingly, bit-shift summation set  indicates that a mixing of an input value with point  may be performed by adding the input signal value with the input signal value binary shifted four places to the right. Similarly, a point  is identified by the value \u2212 17\/16. A related bit-shift summation set  may be performed similar to bit-shift summation set , with a negation on the generated result. It should be noted that if a two's compliment form of negation is being used, the mixed value may need to be converted to a two's compliment negative value.","Point  represents a maximum value of sinusoidal waveform . In one embodiment, the maximum value of sinusoidal waveform, point , is not only chosen to allow point  to be represented using bit-shift summation sets, such as bit-shift summation set , but to also allow a midpoint, such as point  (midway between point  representing a maximum value and point  representing a minimum value), to be represented using bit-shift summation sets, such as bit-shift summation set . Point  corresponds to a value of 0.751 on sinusoidal waveform . The value of point  may be approximated using a value of 0.75. The value of 0.75 may be represented as \u00bd plus \u00bc. It should be noted that a value may be divided by two using a single binary shift to the right. Furthermore, a value may be divided by four using two binary shifts to the right. Accordingly, a bit-shift summation set  may be generated for point  indicating a single binary shift of the input value to the right added with a double binary shift of the input value to the right. Point  corresponds to a value of \u22120.751. Point  is simply a negative value of point ; accordingly, a bit-shift summation set , corresponding to point , may be defined using bit-shift summation set , with a negation on the resultant mixed value. Point  corresponds to the same value as point ; accordingly, bit-shift summation set  may be used for point . As point  corresponds to the same value as point , bit-shift summation set  may also be used to represent a mixing of point . It should be noted that in the discussed embodiment, the only error present is in the use of bit-shift summation sets  and  used for points , ,  and , wherein the error for representing 0.751 with 0.75 is within 1.4 thousandths.","Points  and  correspond to a value of zero. As a real value multiplied by zero is still zero, a mixing of an input value with point  or point  will result in zero. While sinusoidal waveform  has been described for generating a real component of a mixed waveform using a sinusoidal function, such as sinusoidal function  (), similar bit-shift summation techniques may be performed to calculate an imaginary portion for complex signal mixing. Accordingly, bit-shift summation sets \u2013 may be used to represent sampled values of a sine function, as defined in the imaginary portion of the complex function defined by sinusoidal function , without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","It may be desired that bit-shift summation sets \u2013 represent associated points \u2013 within a particular level of accuracy. In one embodiment, bit-shift summation sets \u2013 can be used to represent associated points \u2013 within 45 dB. For example, bit-shift summation set  is equivalent to a value of 0.75 whereas a represented point  is equivalent to a value of 0.751. Accordingly, bit-shift summation set  can be used to represent point  within accuracy of 57 dB. Furthermore, note that all values can be shifted a functionally equivalent number of places to the left or to the right without changing the accuracy of relative points. It should be noted that such shifting is equivalent to scaling the sinusoid by a factor of two. For example, point  may be represented by a bit-shift summation set of \u00bd+ 1\/32 and point  may be represented by a bit-shift summation set of \u00bc+\u215b. Such shifting, or scaling, may be performed without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrating an improved method of mixing a sinusoidal waveform with values of an input signal is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. Bit-shift summation sets are generated to represent portions of a sinusoidal waveform. The bit-shift summation sets are then applied to input signal values to generate mixed waveform values.","In step , the bit-shift summation sets are generated to represent sinusoid values. As previously discussed in reference to , a sinusoidal waveform, normalized at a value greater than one, is sampled to generate a set of sampled values for mixing with input signal values. The sinusoid waveform represents a portion of a function to be mixed with an input signal. The bit-shift summation sets indicate a number of binary shifts to be performed on the input signal values to generate mixed signal values. In step , a first bit-shift summation set is identified for application with the first received input signal value. The first bit-shift summation set is selected from the whole set of bit-shift summation sets to be applied to the first sampled value of the sinusoidal waveform.","In step , the first input signal value is received. The input signal value is a single value associated with a plurality of values that represent the input signal. In step , the selected bit-sift summation set is applied to the received input signal value. As discussed in reference to , the selected bit-shift summation set may be applied to the received input signal value by performing a series of binary shifts on the received input signal value and adding the results of the binary shifts. In step , the resultant value of the bit-shift summation set applied to the received input signal value is output as a mixed signal value. In step , a bit-shift summation set is selected to represent a next sampled point on the sinusoidal waveform. The process may return to step  to receive a next input signal value to be mixed with the newly selected bit-shift summation set.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating a system for mixing points of a sinusoidal function with data values from an input signal is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. An input signal  is read through an input port . The input signal  is to be mixed with a sinusoidal waveform. Values from the sinusoidal waveform are represented using bit-shift summation sets. Binary shifters \u2013 are used to provide shifting associated with the bit-shift summation sets. The binary shifters \u2013 may be used to generate values to be output through output port  as part of a mixed signal, such as output signal .","Binary shifters \u2013 represent divisions to be performed on values from input signal , in support of mixing operations. For example, a shift-by-four binary shifter  may be used to divide a particular value received from input signal  by sixteen. An accumulator  adds a value received from input signal  with the output form shift-by-four binary shifter . Accordingly, the accumulator  may perform a mix of a received input value by \u201c1+ 1\/16\u201d, representing a mixing of the input value with a point on the sinusoidal waveform, such as point  ().","Shift-by-two binary shifter  performs a double binary shift on an input signal value. Accordingly, shift-by-two binary shifter  may perform a division of the input signal value by four. Shift-by-one binary shifter  performs a single binary shift on an input signal value to represent a division of the input signal value by two. Accumulator  performs an addition of the outputs of shifters  and . Accordingly, accumulator  represents a mixing of an input signal value with (\u00bd+\u00bc), such as to perform a mixing with point  () of the sinusoidal waveform. A zero value  may be provided to provide a zero in place of a mixing between an input value and any points corresponding to a value of zero on the sinusoidal waveform.","A selector  may be provided to select among accumulators  or , or zero value , dependent on a point on the sinusoidal waveform to be represented in the mixing operations. A control circuit  may be used to track the point on the waveform to be represented in the mixing operations. Control circuit  may include bit-shift summation sets to dictate which accumulator  or  or zero value  to select. For example, a counter (not shown) may be used to track a point or bit-shift summation set to use. A sign selector  may be used to select between the value chosen through selector  and a negative version of the value generated through two's compliment module . As some of the points on the waveform represent negative values, such as points \u2013 (), the binary shied and accumulated values may need to be negated before being output. Accordingly, control circuit  may track the portion of the sinusoidal waveform being used in mixing operations and select either the value output by selector  or a negated value output by two's compliment module . The value selected by sign selector  may then be output through output port  as part of an output signal .","In one embodiment, the selectors  and  include hardware multiplexers. It should be noted that the components described herein may be part of hardware within a communications system or programmed as part of a firmware without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The components described herein may also form part of mixing operations being performed within a monolithic semiconductor device. The mixing operations described may be performed as part of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signal component mixing operations. It should be noted that waveforms defined by other substantially sinusoidal functions may also be used for mixing operations without departing from the scope of the disclosure.","The systems described herein may be part of an information handling system. The term \u201cinformation handling system\u201d refers to any system that is capable of processing information or transferring information from one source to another. An information handling system may be a single device, such as a computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a hand held computing device, a cable set-top box, an Internet capable device, such as a cellular phone, and the like. Alternatively, an information handling system may refer to a collection of such devices. It should be appreciated that the system described herein has the advantage of simplifying mixing operations performed within a communications system.","In the preceding detailed description of the embodiments, reference has been made to the accompanying drawings which form a part thereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the disclosure may be practiced.
