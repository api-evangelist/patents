title: Announced session control
abstract: A method and system manages media stream connections in a media session, for example a multimedia conference, that is to take place over multicast capable links provided in networks configured for Internet Protocol operation, (i.e., the communications network known as the MBone (Internet Protocol Multicast Backbone)). The method comprises receiving a session description of a media session by way of a session announcement over a network; parsing the session description to determine appropriate media application program(s) for processing at least one media stream of the session description, and connecting the one or more selected media streams to one or more respective media application programs utilising a session control configured for managing media stream connections for the one or more media application programs.

Technical Field","The present invention relates to the announcement of media stream connections for a media session over a communications network.","2. Description of Related Art","Multicast transmissions are becoming increasingly common on the Internet. In contrast to standard Internet Protocol (IP) point to point transmissions (unicast), IP multicast allows the simultaneous transmission of information to a group of recipients from a single source. Routing support for IP multicast transmissions is provided by the MBone (IP Multicast Backbone) which is a virtual network layered on top of the Internet.","IP multicast allows real-time communications over wide area IP networks and typical transmissions include video and audio conferencing, live multimedia training, university lectures and transmission of live television programmes.","A multicast transmission usually consists of a multimedia session made up of several individual media streams typically carrying video, audio, whiteboard or raw data. Some sessions are persistent, but the majority exist for a specific period of time, although need not be continuous. Multicast based transmissions on the MBone differ from unicast IP transmissions in that any user receiving the transmission can join the session (unless the transmission is encrypted) and to receive a transmission, a user need only know the appropriate transmission address and timing information.","Prior to a multicast transmission an appropriate announcement containing a session description is made, usually at an IP group multi-cast address. Standard session descriptions are generated using a Session Description Protocol (SDP), as defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force's draft RFC 2327. SDP is a simple ASCII text based protocol that is used to describe real time multimedia sessions and their related scheduling information. SDP messages are wrapped in a carrier protocol, known as a Session Announcement Protocol (SAP), which, in addition to containing the necessary IP addressing and routing information for transmission across the Internet or MBone, allows the SDP message to be encrypted, signed or compressed. An announcement can then be sent at regular intervals to the announcement group address. As an alternative to SAP, a session may be announced by placing an SDP message on a World Wide Web site (WWW) or by sending it to individuals by email or as a unicast transmission inviting them to participate.","An SDP message conveys information about each media stream in the multicast multimedia session to allow the recipients to participate in the session. A typical SDP message will include the session name and purpose, the time(s) and date(s) the session will be active, the component media streams of the session and information required to participate in each media stream (IP multicast address, port, media format). The SDP message may also include details of the session's bandwidth requirements, an encryption key necessary to participate in a secure multicast transmission using public key encryption, contact information for the organiser of the multicast session, and a Unique Resource Indicator (URI) pointing to a WWW or an Intranet web site where further information on the session may be found, for example, background information relating to the conference.","The level of participation a user may make in a session or stream depends on its purpose. In a multicast television session, typically users would only be able to receive the session streams whilst in a multicast conference session the communication would be bidirectional with a central server (such as group address ) receiving each participants transmissions and relaying them to the other participants. The level of participation expected of a user in a session or stream may be explicitly stated in the session description or it may be inherent from the session description, for example when a receive-only application is associated with a media stream type in the session description.","A common front end interface used by multicast end users is known as Session Directory Rendezvous (SDR). This interface takes the received announcements, decodes the SDP message and displays the names of those sessions that are still current in a list. The end user may then select one of the listed announcements to view further technical and user-oriented details of the announced session. From the displayed information, the end user can then select to join individual streams of the session or to join the entire session. Once the streams to be joined are selected, SDR starts the necessary multicast-enabled multimedia application on the end user's computer, such as Vic and Vat, and passes the relevant stream information (a transport port address) from the announcement onto the application allowing the application to establish the link to the associated IP multicast address and participate in the stream at transmission time. Having initiated the applications and passed the relevant transport port address SDR plays no further part in the session.","Recent increased usage and demand for (multi)media sessions has highlighted a number of limitations in SDP. SDP limits session descriptions to defining a session having a single set of timings that apply to all of the streams within it. A session in which a stream starts mid-way through the transmission cannot easily be described using SDP. The structure of a session description written in SDP must be a simple linear list of streams which may not reflect the intuitive structure of a complex session. SDP supports a limited and predefined set of applications which can receive the streams and a limited and predefined set of transport mechanisms (e.g. Simple layering, RTP and UDP). As guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) is becoming more and more desirable to the consumer and the supplier, the need to define QoS policies for the entire session and individual streams in terms of required system resources, bandwidth requirements and supported applications also needs to be met. There may also be requirements on the prioritisation of streams and subsessions or more complicated rules about receiving streams. A further requirement on the part of the supplier will be the need for charging facilities permitting the charging of an end user for a multicast transmission to which they subscribe according to the QoS and types of streams received etc. There is little scope to include information about QoS policies or charging within the conventional structure of an SDP session description, or any metadata about the session.","A problem faced by providers of current (multi)media sessions and the developers of the associated (multimedia applications is the spread of skills required to implement an application that can initiate and manage a real-time data connection over a communications network and perform the (multi)media functions the end user would expect. For example, developers of multimedia applications require teams with skills in audio and video coding, network transport protocols, real time programming, user interface design and integration techniques. Furthermore, until now the only way a QoS policy could be implemented was to process a session description to determine which streams of a session could or should be run and then to initialise the applications so they connect to the respective streams. This required the communications manager not only to know about the session requirements and available system resources but also the capabilities of each application.","According to the first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of managing media stream connections for a media session, said method comprising the steps:\n\n","Preferably, the selection of the one or more media streams is carried out by the session control according to predetermined criteria.","In particular exemplary embodiments, the predetermined criteria are specific to the preferences of at least one of the group consisting of an end-user, the terminal and the one or more media application programs.","Conveniently, the media applications select one or more of the media streams identified in the session description which are required and pass respective connection requests to the session control.","The method may further comprises the step of passing at least a portion of the session description to the one or more media applications.","In particular exemplary embodiments the media applications generate or modify a quality of service policy for the connection requests for use by the session control.","Conveniently, the media applications modify the session description for changing the subsequent management of connections by the session control system.","The session control may passes the connection requests to a terminal communications manager which determines whether the connection requests are viable and subsequently initiates the connections.","In particular exemplary embodiments, the session control prioritises the connection requests from the media applications according to the quality of service policy to create a set of connection requests which are passed to the communications manager.","Conveniently, the communications manager determines resources required for each connection request and whether the requests can be met given available resources.","If the connection requests can be met the connections are initiated. If a connection request cannot be met and the connection request is for an optional media stream of the media session then the communications manager proceeds by declaring the connection request unviable and moves to the next connection request. if a connection request cannot be met and the connection request is for a mandatory media stream of the media session then the communications manager proceeds by attempting to free resources to meet the connection request, and if the communications manager is unable to free sufficient resources to meet the connection request, the connection request is declared unviable and the communications manager refuses to join the media session.","In particular exemplary embodiments the method further comprises the step of obtaining a missing part of the session description by following a link or links in the session description before parsing the session description.","According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a system for managing media stream connections derived from a session description for a media session, the system comprising a session control for parsing the session description to determine appropriate media application programs for processing at least one media stream of the session description; a communications manager for determining based on available resources whether participation in the media session is viable using a quality of service policy based on quality of service data provided in said session description; and the session control being configured to manage media stream connections for the media applications programs.","In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention media modules of a modular session description are checked by the respective multimedia client application prior to QoS management, thereby reducing the workload of the communications manager. That is, the respective client applications determine whether the media modules can be supported. The applications may also add to or modify the session description to include their own QoS policies or to change the way in which the session and\/or its initiation will be managed. Furthermore, applications need only request streams from the session control system associated with the client since the session control now handles centrally the creation and management of streams in real time. In this way the exemplary embodiment simplifies application development and service provision.","A further problem is that applications should be able to adapt to available network and host resources. This is particularly important for multi-party applications operating in heterogeneous environments where each party may have different resources available to them. Furthermore the nature of the heterogeneity may vary over the lifetime of the session, for example as network congestion varies or as the terminal resources are shared with other applications or other users. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is able to use a QoS policy incorporated within the session description to prioritise the allocation of resources and to determine whether participation in the session is viable.","A further problem is that the application developer and service provider typically need to address security and charging requirements. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention allows security and charging policies to be incorporated within the session description for use within the session control system to invoke appropriate charging and security procedures. Instead of having to develop security and charging functions the application developer and service provider need only specify appropriate policies.","In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, application development is simplified by using the session description to drive the dynamic management of communication channels and to adapt to available resources. It also reduces the problem of handling charging and security requirements to a matter of specifying charging and security policies within the session description.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the modular session description described in this patent application and which is also the subject of our co-pending UK patent application 9826158.9.","An example of an IP multicast transmission system is described with reference to . Prior to a multicast transmission, an appropriate announcement containing a session description is made, thereby allowing end users \u2013to elect to receive the transmission. Each end user electing to receive the transmission is linked to a group IP Multicast address  associated with the transmission. At the transmission time of the multicast session, the session streams are transmitted from a source , or a plurality of sources, to the group address. At the group address, the transmission is disseminated along the links  to those end users who have elected to receive it (in this example end users \u2013).","An example of an announcement and election system is described with reference to . Most public multicast sessions are announced at a single group IP multicast address  dedicated to the transmission of announcements to multicast end users. End users \u2013electing to receive the announcements are linked to the announcement group address and, in the same way as an actual session transmission, each announcement arriving at the announcement group address is disseminated to the end users. A front end interface  on each end user's computer displays information obtained from the associated session description for each announcement. The minimum information a session description may contain is a time and date that the session will be active and the group IP multicast address(es) from which the end user may elect to receive one or more media streams and to which they could send their own streams for the session. Using the front end interface, an end user can select the announced session(s), or their component stream(s) they wish to participate in.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320"]},"The base module  contains user oriented data relating to the session including the title and timing information.

Alternatively, this could be done by reducing the number of layers received from a layered stream transmission. If sufficient resources cannot be found an exception is reported to the user and the connection request is marked as viable. If the media stream that cannot be received is defined as mandatory in a QoS policy for a media session or subsession, all the connection requests for that media session or subsession are cancelled in step . If, however, the media stream is optional, the communications manager continues processing further connection requests in step . Once all pending connection requests have been processed, the communications manager reports those that are viable to the session control system.","The processing of a session description will now be described with reference to  and session description example 4 which is the session description generated for Track  (modules  and \u2013 of ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(","# overall conference session"]},{"entry":[{},"type=(base)"]},{"entry":[{},"id=(410)"]},{"entry":[{},"info=(title=\u201cMultimedia98 Conference\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"source=(owner=\u201cJoe Bloggs\u201d email=joe@nowhere.com)"]},{"entry":[{},"media=(video=(client=RealPlayerG2) whiteboard=(client=wb))"]},{"entry":[{},"time(start=\u201c09:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d stop=\u201c13:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"options=(oc=0010)"]},{"entry":[{},"modules=(b=420 b=430 b=440 oc=411)"]},{"entry":")"},{"entry":["(","# conference track 1"]},{"entry":[{},"type=(base)"]},{"entry":[{},"id=(420 410)"]},{"entry":[{},"info=(title=\u201cMM98 Systems and Applications Track\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"source=(owner=\u201cJoe Bloggs\u201d email=joe@nowhere.com)"]},{"entry":[{},"media=(video=(client=RealPlayerG2) whiteboard=(client=wb))"]},{"entry":[{},"time(start=\u201c09:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d stop=\u201c11:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"options=(osq=424)"]},{"entry":[{},"modules=(m=421 m=422 m=423 osq=424)"]},{"entry":")"},{"entry":["(","# video for track 1"]},{"entry":[{},"type=(media)"]},{"entry":[{},"id=(421 420)"]},{"entry":[{},"info=(title=\u201cMM98 Systems and Applications Track Video\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"source=(owner=\u201cJoe Bloggs\u201d email=joe@nowhere.com)"]},{"entry":[{},"media=(video=(type=live client=RealPlayerG2))"]},{"entry":[{},"connection=(226.0.0.100\/1000)"]},{"entry":[{},"time=(start=\u201c09:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d stop=\u201c11:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d)"]},{"entry":")"},{"entry":["(","# audio for track 1"]},{"entry":[{},"type=(media)"]},{"entry":[{},"id=(422 420)"]},{"entry":[{},"info=(title=\u201cMM98 Systems and Applications Track Audio\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"source=(owner=\u201cJoe Bloggs\u201d email=joe@nowhere.com)"]},{"entry":[{},"media=(audio=(type=live format=g711))"]},{"entry":[{},"connection=(226.0.0.101\/1001)"]},{"entry":[{},"time=(start=\u201c09:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d stop=\u201c11:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d)"]},{"entry":")"},{"entry":["(","# whiteboard for track 1"]},{"entry":[{},"type=(media)"]},{"entry":[{},"id=(423 420)"]},{"entry":[{},"info=(title=\u201cMM98 Systems and Applications Track Whiteboard\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"source=(owner=\u201cJoe Bloggs\u201d email=joe@nowhere.com)"]},{"entry":[{},"media=(whiteboard=(client=wb))"]},{"entry":[{},"connection=(226.0.0.102\/1002)"]},{"entry":[{},"time=(start=\u201c09:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d stop=\u201c11:00 GMT 25\/12\/98\u201d)"]},{"entry":")"},{"entry":["(","# session QoS for track 1"]},{"entry":[{},"type=(option-sQoS)"]},{"entry":[{},"id=(424 420)"]},{"entry":[{},"mandatory=(421 422)"]},{"entry":[{},"optional=(423)"]},{"entry":")"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The session control system, having received the above session description, processes the tree structure of the session description starting at base module . The first module encountered is base module . As this is not a media module but it does have sub-modules, the session control system continues down this branch to media module.","The media field of the media module  already defines the multimedia client application required as RealPlayerG2 (a multimedia application of Real Networks Inc) thus the session control system ignores it and continues to the next media module. The media field of the media module  does not have a multimedia client application defined, however a format for the audio data is specified. The session control system recognises that this particular audio format can be supported by RealPlayerG2 so it amends the media field to read client=RealPlayerG2. The next media module  has already defined a client application as wb so it ignores this module, and it also ignores the option module .","The session control system parses the tree structure again in order to launch client applications. The first media module  specifies that RealPlayerG2 should be launched, hence the session control system launches the application on the end user's system and keeps a record of this activity. The second media module  specifies an application that has already been launched and so the session control system ignores it and continues to the next media module. The media module  specifies that wb should be launched, so the session control system launches the application and keeps a record of this activity.","RealPlayerG2 is passed the media module , base module  and modules \u2013. The application processes the media modules given to determine which it can handle, and in this case it identifies  and . Having determined which streams it can handle, the application sends a connection request back to the session control system requesting connection to the media streams of modules  and . Similarly, wb is passed the media module , base module , modules \u2013, and the module . The application processes the given modules as described previously, and requests connection to the media stream of modules .","The above connection requests are assembled by the session control system into a list, this list is then passed to the communications manager along with the session QoS policy module . The communications manager determines whether each request is viable according to the steps of .","Assuming there are sufficient resources for all the connection requests for mandatory media streams, the communications manager passes back a list of viable streams to the session control system which then processes the tree again to determine the connection data held in the connection field of each media module so it can request that the communications manager initiate a connection to the appropriate media stream for each of the viable connection requests according to the connection data. The session control system then manages the session and its media stream connections as is described with reference to steps  to  of .","Due to the heterogeneity of the Internet and differing capabilities and operating environments of end user computer systems, the session control system described has been implemented in Java (Java is a Trade Mark of Sun Microsystems Inc.).
