title: Coordinating use of independent external resources within requesting grid environments
abstract: A method, system, and program for coordinating use of independent external resources within requesting grid environments. A external resource dispatcher receives requests for use of external resources. The external resource dispatcher controls the dispatch of a pool of external resources hidden from the grid management systems of requesting grid clients. In particular, the external resource dispatcher coordinates dispatch of a selection of the external resources for temporary registration with a requesting grid client management system. The requesting grid client management system registers the external resources for use within the grid client and monitors whether the external resources are still needed. When a requesting grid client no longer needs a dispatched external resource, the external resource dispatcher controls detachment of the dispatched external resource and returns the external resource to the available pool of external resources.

Technical Field","The present invention relates in general to improved performance and efficiency in grid environments and in particular to a method for controlling use of independent external resources by requesting grid management systems. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to controlling dispatch, metering use, and monitoring connectivity of a selection of independent external resources made accessible to a particular requesting grid management system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Ever since the first connection was made between two computer systems, new ways of transferring data, resources, and other information between two computer systems via a connection continue to develop. In typical network architectures, when two computer systems are exchanging data via a connection, one of the computer systems is considered a client sending requests and the other is considered a server processing the requests and returning results. In an effort to increase the speed at which requests are handled, server systems continue to expand in size and speed. Further, in an effort to handle peak periods when multiple requests are arriving every second, server systems are often joined together as a group and requests are distributed among the grouped servers. Multiple methods of grouping servers have developed such as clustering, multi-system shared data (sysplex) environments, and enterprise systems. With a cluster of servers, one server is typically designated to manage distribution of incoming requests and outgoing responses. The other servers typically operate in parallel to handle the distributed requests from clients. Thus, one of multiple servers in a cluster may service a client request without the client detecting that a cluster of servers is processing the request.","Typically, servers or groups of servers operate on a particular network platform, such as Unix or some variation of Unix, and provide a hosting environment for running applications. Each network platform may provide functions ranging from database integration, clustering services, and security to workload management and problem determination. Each network platform typically offers different implementations, semantic behaviors, and application programming interfaces (APIs).","Merely grouping servers together to expand processing power, however, is a limited method of improving efficiency of response times in a network. Thus, increasingly, within a company network, rather than just grouping servers, servers and groups of server systems are organized as distributed resources. There is an increased effort to collaborate, share data, share cycles, and improve other modes of interaction among servers within a company network and outside the company network. Further, there is an increased effort to outsource nonessential elements from one company network to that of a service provider network. Moreover, there is a movement to coordinate resource sharing between resources that are not subject to the same management system, but still address issues of security, policy, payment, and membership. For example, resources on an individual's desktop are not typically subject to the same management system as resources of a company server cluster. Even different administrative groups within a company network may implement distinct management systems.","The problems with decentralizing the resources available from servers and other computing systems operating on different network platforms, located in different regions, with different security protocols and each controlled by a different management system, has led to the development of Grid technologies using open standards for operating a grid environment. Grid environments support the sharing and coordinated use of diverse resources in dynamic, distributed, virtual organizations. A virtual organization is created within a grid environment when a selection of resources, from geographically distributed systems operated by different organizations with differing policies and management systems, is organized to handle a job request.","A problem encountered in most network systems, whether organized in clusters or grids, is how to handle requests during peak usage times. One solution for handling requests during peak usage is to register sufficient resources with the resource manager of the cluster or grid so that the network can access sufficient resources to handle predicted peak usage. This solution helps to ensure maintenance of performance standards, however, it may also be cost ineffective to purchase resources that are only used for short bursts of time. Another solution for handling requests during peak usage is to register a pool of reserve or on-demand resources to the resource manager so that the network can access these reserved resources only during peak usage times and may pay only for use of the reserved resources. While both of these solutions provide methods of maintaining performance during peak usage, both are limited in that the pool of additional resources are registered as on reserve with the resource manager of a particular resource manager.","In view of the foregoing, it would be advantageous to provide a method, system, and program for controlling use of independent external resources by multiple requesting grid resource managers. In particular, it would be advantageous to control external resources available in a resource pool independent of a requesting grid resource manager. Further, it would be advantageous to provide a method, system, and program for dispatching independent external resources among multiple requesting grids, metering the use of independent external resources by multiple requesting grids, and polling the external resources to ensure connectivity to the multiple requesting grids.","In view of the foregoing, the method, system, and program provide improved performance in grid environments and in particular provide for controlling use of independent external resources by requesting grid management systems. Still more particularly, the method, system, and program provide for controlling dispatch, metering use, and monitoring connectivity of a selection of independent external resources made accessible to a particular requesting grid management system.","According to one aspect of the invention, an external resource dispatcher receives requests for use of resources. The external resource dispatcher controls the dispatch of a pool of external resources hidden from the grid management systems of requesting grid clients. The external resource dispatcher may first authenticate the identity of a requesting grid client and determine whether the requesting grid client is authorized to receive the requested resources. Then, the external resource dispatcher determines whether there are any external resources available to meet the resource request. In particular, the external resource dispatcher tracks and controls the availability status of the external resources. The external resource dispatcher coordinates dispatch of a selection of the external resources for temporary registration with a requesting grid management system. The requesting grid management system registers the external resources and monitors whether the external resources are still needed. When a requesting grid client no longer needs a dispatched external resource, the external resource dispatcher controls detachment of the dispatched external resource and returns the external resource to the available pool of external resources.","According to another aspect of the invention, the external resource dispatcher establishes heartbeats with the grid management system and the dispatched external resource. The external resource dispatcher polls the grid management system to determine if there is connectivity between the grid management system and the dispatched external resource. If the external resource dispatcher does not detect a heartbeat, the external resource dispatcher will detach the dispatched external resource and return the external resource to the available external resource pool. In addition, if the external resource dispatcher does not detect a heartbeat from the dispatched external resource, then the external resource dispatcher will mark the dispatched external resource as failed and dispatch a replacement resource to the grid management system.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, the external resource dispatcher is self-registering with an external resource dispatcher directory. Thus, multiple grid management systems may access and send requests for external resources to the external resource dispatcher.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the external resource dispatcher meters the use of dispatched external resources by grid clients. Advantageously, external resource dispatcher independently meters usage such that costs for use of external resources can be determined based on an independent metering of usage. In one example, a grid management system may be registered with an external resource dispatcher with limits on the number of hours or cost per period of time available for metering use of external resources used by the grid management system. Additional aspects of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed description.","Referring now to the drawings and in particular to , there is depicted one embodiment of a computer system which may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. As will be further described, the grid environment includes multiple computer systems managed to provide resources. Additionally, as will be further described, the present invention may be executed in a variety of computer systems, including a variety of computing systems, mobile systems, and electronic devices operating under a number of different operating systems managed within a grid environment.","In one embodiment, computer system  includes a bus  or other device for communicating information within computer system , and at least one processing device such as processor , coupled to bus  for processing information. Bus  preferably includes low-latency and higher latency paths that are connected by bridges and adapters and controlled within computer system  by multiple bus controllers. When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple processors designed to improve network servicing power.","Processor  may be a general-purpose processor such as IBM's PowerPC\u2122 processor that, during normal operation, processes data under the control of operating system and application software accessible from a dynamic storage device such as random access memory (RAM)  and a static storage device such as Read Only Memory (ROM) . The operating system may provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user. In a preferred embodiment, application software contains machine executable instructions that when executed on processor  carry out the operations depicted in the flowchart of , and other operations described herein. Alternatively, the steps of the present invention might be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps, or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.","The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, included on a machine-readable medium having stored thereon the machine executable instructions used to program computer system  to perform a process according to the present invention. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d as used herein includes any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  or other components of computer system  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Common forms of non-volatile media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, magnetic tape or any other magnetic medium, a compact disc ROM (CD-ROM) or any other optical medium, punch cards or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically EPROM (EEPROM), a flash memory, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which computer system  can read and which is suitable for storing instructions. In the present embodiment, an example of a non-volatile medium is mass storage device  which as depicted is an internal component of computer system , but will be understood to also be provided by an external device. Volatile media include dynamic memory such as RAM . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire or fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio frequency or infrared data communications.","Virtual resource  may include a virtual representation of the resources accessible from a single system or systems, wherein multiple systems may each be considered discrete sets of resources operating on independent platforms, but coordinated as a virtual resource by a grid manager. Communications interface  provides a two-way data communications coupling to network link  that may be connected, for example, to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that provide access to network . In particular, network link  may provide wired and\/or wireless network communications to one or more networks, such as network , through which use of virtual resources, such as virtual resource , is accessible.","As one example, network  may refer to the worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use protocols, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), to communicate with one another. Network  uses electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. It will be understood that alternate types of networks, combinations of networks, and infrastructures of networks may be implemented.","When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple communication interfaces accessible via multiple peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridges connected to an input\/output controller. In this manner, computer system  allows connections to multiple network computers.","Additionally, although not depicted, multiple peripheral components and internal\/external devices may be added to computer system , connected to multiple controllers, adapters, and expansion slots coupled to one of the multiple levels of bus . For example, a display device, audio device, keyboard, or cursor control device may be added as a peripheral component.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in  may vary. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrates one embodiment of the general types of components within a grid environment. In the present example, the components of a grid environment  include a client system  interfacing with a grid management system  which interfaces with server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks . For purposes of illustration, the network locations and types of networks connecting the components within grid environment  are not depicted. It will be understood, however, that the components within grid environment  may reside atop a network infrastructure architecture that may be implemented with multiple types of networks overlapping one another. Network infrastructure may range from multiple large enterprise systems to a peer-to-peer system to a single computer system. Further, it will be understood that the components within grid environment  are merely representations of the types of components within a grid environment. A grid environment may simply be encompassed in a single computer system or may encompass multiple enterprises of systems.","The central goal of a grid environment, such as grid environment  is organization and delivery of resources from multiple discrete systems viewed as virtual resource . Client system , server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , networks  and the systems creating grid management system  may be heterogeneous and regionally distributed with independent management systems, but enabled to exchange information, resources, and services through a grid infrastructure enabled by grid management system . Further, server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks  may be geographically distributed across countries and continents or locally accessible to one another.","In the example, client system  interfaces with grid management system . Client system  may represent any computing system sending requests to grid management system . In particular, client system  may send job requests and jobs to grid management system . Further, while in the present embodiment client system  is depicted as accessing grid environment  with a request, in alternate embodiments client system  may also operate within grid environment .","While the systems within virtual resource  are depicted in parallel, in reality, the systems may be part of a hierarchy of systems where some systems within virtual resource  may be local to client system , while other systems require access to external networks. Additionally, it is important to note, that systems depicted within virtual resources  may be physically encompassed within client system .","One function of grid management system  is to manage job requests and jobs from client system  and control distribution of each job to a selection of computing systems of virtual resource  for use of particular resources at the available computing systems within virtual resource . From the perspective of client system , however, virtual resource  handles the request and returns the result without differentiating between which computing system in virtual resource  actually performed the request.","To implement grid environment , grid management system  facilitates grid services. Grid services may be designed according to multiple architectures, including, but not limited to, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). In particular, grid management system  refers to the management environment which creates a grid by linking computing systems into a heterogeneous network environment characterized by sharing of resources through grid services.","Grid environment , as managed by grid management system , may provide a single type of service or multiple types of services. For example, computational grids, scavenging grids, and data grids are example categorizations of the types of services provided in a grid environment. Computational grids may manage computing resources of high-performance servers. Scavenging grids may scavenge for CPU resources and data storage resources across desktop computer systems. Data grids may manage data storage resources accessible, for example, to multiple organizations or enterprises. It will be understood that a grid environment is not limited to a single type of grid categorization.","According to an advantage of the present invention, when grid management system  detects a need for additional resources beyond the resources registered and included in virtual resource , grid management system  may send requests for independent external resources to external resource dispatchers, such as external resource dispatchers -. Each of external resource dispatchers -control a pool of independent external resources.","As will be further described, external resource dispatchers -may dispatch independent external resources to grid environment  for temporary management by grid management system . In particular, the pools of independent external resources preferably remain hidden from grid management system  until proper authentication is performed to allow grid management system  to temporarily manage sections of independent external resources. External resource dispatchers -meter the use of external resources, lock the external resources while in use by grid management system , and poll the external resources to ensure connectivity and functionality.","It will be understood that the pools of external resources managed by external resource dispatchers -may be accessible by multiple grid management systems. In particular, external resource dispatchers -preferably operate independent of any one grid environment and are self-registering with a directory of external resource dispatchers.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrates one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment. As depicted, an architecture  includes multiple layers of functionality. As will be further described, the present invention is a process which may be implemented in one or more layers of an architecture, such as architecture , which is implemented in a grid environment, such as the grid environment described in . It is important to note that architecture  is just one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. Further, it is important to note that multiple architectures may be implemented within a grid environment.","Within architecture , first, a physical and logical resources layer  organizes the resources of the systems in the grid. Physical resources include, but are not limited to, servers, storage media, and networks. The logical resources virtualize and aggregate the physical layer into usable resources such as operating systems, processing power, memory, I\/O processing, file systems, database managers, directories, memory managers, and other resources.","Next, a web services layer  provides an interface between grid services  and physical and logical resources . Web services layer  implements service interfaces including, but not limited to, Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and eXtensible mark-up language (XML) executing atop an Internet Protocol (IP) or other network transport layer. Further, the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OSGI) standard  builds on top of current web services  by extending web services  to provide capabilities for dynamic and manageable Web services required to model the resources of the grid. In particular, by implementing OGSI standard  with web services , grid services  designed using OGSA are interoperable. In alternate embodiments, other infrastructures or additional infrastructures may be implemented a top web services layer .","Grid services layer  includes multiple services. For example, grid services layer  may include grid services designed using OGSA, such that a uniform standard is implemented in creating grid services. Alternatively, grid services may be designed under multiple architectures. Grid services can be grouped into four main functions. It will be understood, however, that other functions may be performed by grid services.","First, a resource management service  manages the use of the physical and logical resources. Resources may include, but are not limited to, processing resources, memory resources, and storage resources. Management of these resources includes receiving job requests, scheduling job requests, distributing jobs, and managing the retrieval of the results for jobs. Resource management service  preferably monitors resource loads and distributes jobs to less busy parts of the grid to balance resource loads and absorb unexpected peaks of activity. In particular, a user may specify preferred performance levels so that resource management service  distributes jobs to maintain the preferred performance levels within the grid.","Second, information services  manages the information transfer and communication between computing systems within the grid. Since multiple communication protocols may be implemented, information services  preferably manages communications across multiple networks utilizing multiple types of communication protocols.","Third, a data management service  manages data transfer and storage within the grid. In particular, data management service  may move data to nodes within the grid where a job requiring the data will execute. A particular type of transfer protocol, such as Grid File Transfer Protocol (GridFTP), may be implemented.","Finally, a security service  applies a security protocol for security at the connection layers of each of the systems operating within the grid. Security service  may implement security protocols, such as Open Secure Socket Layers (SSL), to provide secure transmissions. Further, security service  may provide a single sign-on mechanism, so that once a user is authenticated, a proxy certificate is created and used when performing actions within the grid for the user.","Multiple services may work together to provide several key functions of a grid computing system. In a first example, computational tasks are distributed within a grid. Data management service  may divide up a computation task into separate grid services requests of packets of data that are then distributed by and managed by resource management service . The results are collected and consolidated by data management system . In a second example, the storage resources across multiple computing systems in the grid are viewed as a single virtual data storage system managed by data management service  and monitored by resource management service .","An applications layer  includes applications that use one or more of the grid services available in grid services layer . Advantageously, applications interface with the physical and logical resources  via grid services layer  and web services , such that multiple heterogeneous systems can interact and interoperate.","With reference now to , an illustrative representation depicts one embodiment of a grid management system interacting with an external dispatcher in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention.","Within a grid environment, such as grid , a grid management system  manages grid resources  registered and available within grid . In particular, grid management system  may include multiple grid management components distributed across multiple resources. In the example, however, logically, grid management system  includes a resource monitor  for registering and monitoring resource availability. In addition, grid management system  includes a grid scheduler  that controls the scheduling and distribution of jobs to grid resources . Grid scheduler  also manages time synchronization between the various resources handling a particular job. The status and results of jobs are tracked within a job queue .","A requesting agent  within grid management system  requests external resources from external resource dispatcher  via network . While in the example depicted there is a single external resource dispatcher, it will be understood that requesting agent  may send requests for external resources to multiple external resource dispatchers. In addition, requesting agent  may access a directory of external resource dispatchers, where the directory indicates the types of resources, costs, performance specifications, and other information about the external resource pools controlled by each of the external resource dispatchers in the directory.","In the embodiment depicted, external resource dispatcher  manages the distribution of a pool of external resources, such as external resources , , and , to requesting grid clients. External resources , , and  may include, but are not limited to, non-grid computing systems or another grid which presents itself as a resource that can be requested as an external resource.","In particular, when requesting agent  requests external resources from external resource dispatcher , the actual resources are hidden grid management system  until proper authentication is performed. In particular, responsive to receiving a request for external resources, external resource dispatcher  may determine if a client requesting external resource is authenticated. A client connection authentication database  preferably stores the identity information needed to authenticate registered clients. In addition, as a client uses resources, the metered use may be added to the client connection authentication database entries, such that if a client registers for a limited amount of resources, that resource use is calculated and updated in client connection authentication database . Table 1 depicts an example of the types of information that may be included in client connection authentication database . It will be understood that multiple types of identity authentication may be performed including, but not limited to, public\/private key encryption authentication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example Client Connection Authentication Database Entries"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Grid","Grid",{}]},{"entry":[{},"client ID","Client Key","Resource Authorization"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Grid A","ghd3k4","All"]},{"entry":[{},"Grid B","erk20we","Processing power"]},{"entry":[{},"Grid C","dkd3k3","All; 1 hour per day"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In addition, in responsive to receiving a request for external resources, external resource dispatcher  determines whether there are resources available to meet the external resource request.

Thus, external resource dispatcher  can register as an external controller independent of any one grid. In addition, external resource dispatcher  can independent monitor the use of external resources by grid clients.","Referring now to , there is depicted a block diagram of the components of an external resource dispatcher in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, an authentication controller  within external resource dispatcher  controls authentication of a grid client and the resource a grid client is authorized to request. A resource availability controller  registers external resources into an external resource pool and updates the status of the resources as they are used. In addition, when an external resource is dispatched to a grid client, resource availability controller  preferably locks the external resource against other use. A dispatch controller  controls the dispatch of the registered external resources to authenticated grid clients by communicating with the grid client and the external resources. A metering controller  controls the metering of the use and costs associated with use of external resource by grid clients. In addition, a connectivity controller  monitors heartbeats from the external resource and the grid client to ensure connectivity of an external resource to a grid client and to detect failed external resources. If connectivity is no longer detected, then connectivity controller  may alert metering controller  to stop metering for use of the external resource and alert dispatch controller  to retrieve the resource. If a failed external resource is detected, then connectivity controller  alerts dispatch controller  to retrieve the failed resource and dispatch a replacement resource. It will be understood that additional operational controllers, database, and other components may be included in external resource dispatcher .","With reference now to , there is depicted a flow diagram of the connections and communication implemented between a grid client, an external resource dispatcher, and an external resource. As depicted at reference numeral , a grid client sends a request for resources to an external resource dispatcher (ERD). At this point, the grid client has reached a resource threshold for one or more resources and needs external resources such as process power, storage space, or other external resources. Next, as depicted at reference numeral , the ERD authenticates the grid client and determines whether external resources are available to meet the request. If the grid client is not authenticated or no external resource are available to meet the request, then an \u201cunavailable\u201d message is returned to the grid client, as depicted at reference numeral . If the grid client is authenticated and external resource are available to meet the request, then a request is send to the selected external resource to join the grid, as depicted at reference numeral .","Next, as depicted at reference numeral , the network address and permissions for the resource to join the grid client are sent to the grid client. As depicted at reference numeral , the grid client will register the resource in the resource directory managed by the grid client resource management system. Next, as depicted at reference numeral , the grid client sends an acknowledgement (ACK) that the resource may join the grid client to the external resource. Thereafter, as depicted at reference numeral , the external resource attaches to the grid client and establishes a heartbeat to the external resource and the grid client. As depicted at reference numeral , the external resource notifies the ERD that the resource has attached to the grid client.","After the external resource attaches to the grid client, the grid client monitors whether the resource is needed, as depicted at reference numeral , and the ERD meters resource use, as depicted at reference numeral . When the grid client no longer needs the external resource, the grid client sends the ERD a detach request, as depicted at reference numeral . The ERD then sends an acknowledgement of the request from the grid client, as depicted at reference numeral , and sends a detach request signal to the external resource, as depicted at reference numeral . The external resource then detaches, as depicted at reference numeral  and the external resource sends a detach acknowledge signal to the ERD, as depicted at reference numeral . The ERD then updates the external resource status to available, as depicted at reference numeral , and stops metering, as depicted at reference numeral .","In addition, although not depicted, once a heartbeat is established between the ERD and the grid client, the ERD monitors connectivity and will retrieve the dispatched external resource if connectivity is no longer detected. In addition, once a heartbeat is established between the ERD and the dispatched external resource, the ERD monitors for failure and will retrieve the dispatched external resource and replace it with an active external resource if failure is detected.","Referring now to , there is depicted an illustrative representation of an external resource dispatched to a grid in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted in the example, external resource  from  is dispatched to grid . In particular, once external grid  joins grid , external resource  is logically part of grid resource  of grid . Resource manager  will manage resource  and job scheduler  will control scheduling and distribution of jobs to resource . In addition, resource manager  will control the return of external resource  to external resource dispatcher  when external resource  is no longer needed for job scheduler .","When an external resource managed by external resource dispatcher  is dispatched to a client grid, such as grid , preferably, heartbeats are established from external resource dispatcher  to grid  and to external resource . In the example, a heartbeat  is depicted connecting external resource  with external resource dispatcher . Heartbeat connection  allows external resource dispatcher  to monitor when a resource has failed. In addition, a heartbeat  is depicted connecting grid  with external resource dispatcher . In particular, heartbeat connection  allows external resource dispatcher  to monitor whether there is connectivity between grid  and external resource .","With reference now to , there is depicted a high level logic flowchart of a process and program for controlling an external resource dispatcher in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, the process starts at block  and thereafter proceeds to block . Block  depicts a determination whether a request for resource is received from a grid client. As long as a request for resources is not received from a grid client, then the process iterates at block . If a request for resources is received from a grid client, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts a determination whether the requesting grid client is properly authenticated. If the requesting grid client is not properly authenticated, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts returning a lack of authentication message to the requesting grid client, and the process ends. If the request grid client is properly authenticated, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts comparing the resource request with the resource available in the resource availability database. Next, block  illustrates a determination whether the requested resource is available. If the requested resource is not available, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts returning a lack of resource availability message to the requesting grid client. If the requested resource is available, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts sending a signal to the available external resource to joint the grid client. Next, block  depicts sending the IP address and permission for the external resource to the grid client. Thereafter, block  depicts a determination whether an attachment signal is received from the external resource. The process iterates at block  until an attachment signal is received. Alternatively, if no attachment signal is received, after a particular time, the process may time out. If an attachment signal is received, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts updating the status of the external resource as currently dispatched. Next, block  depicts starting metering of use of the external resource by the grid client. Thereafter, block  depicts a determination whether a detach request is received. If a detach request is not received, then the process iterates at block . A detach request may also be invoked if the external resource dispatcher does not detect a heartbeat from a resource or from a grid connection to a resource. In addition, a detach request may also be invoked if the period of time allowed in the privileges for the grid client to use a resource expires. Once a detach request is received, the process passes to block .","Block  depicts sending a detach signal to the external resource. Next, block  depicts a determination whether a detach acknowledge is received from the external resource. The process iterates at block  until a detach acknowledge is received and then passes to block . Block  depicts updating the status of the external resource as available. Next, block  depicts stopping the metering for use of the external resource by the grid client, and the process ends.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The novel features believed characteristic of the invention are set forth in the appended claims.
