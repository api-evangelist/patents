title: Determination of weapons fratricide probability
abstract: A method is provided for determining fratricide probability of projectile collision from a projectile launcher on a platform and an interception hazard that can be ejected or launched from a deployment position. The platform can represent a combat vessel, with the projectile launcher being a gun, the interception hazard being a missile, and the deployment position being a vertical launch cell. The projectile launcher operates within an angular area called the firing zone of the platform. The method includes determining the firing zone, calculating an angular firing area, quantifying a frontal area of the interception hazard, translating the resulting frontal area across a flight trajectory, sweeping the projectile launcher to produce a slew angle, combining the slew and trajectory, and dividing the combined interception area by the firing area. The firing and interception areas are calculated using spherical projection.

In particular, techniques are presented to enable systematic and comparative fratricidal interceptions from concurrently conflicting weapons systems.","Weapon fratricide represents a long-standing safety concern for weapon systems. Fratricide is defined as an attack on friendly forces by other friendly forces. Calculating the probability of fratricide has proven to be technically challenging. Manual resources devoted to these efforts yield limited results due to their time-consuming nature and the simplifying assumptions necessary to render the mathematical calculations tractable on a reasonable scale.","Conventional fratricide probability techniques yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, conventional systems introduce errors that expand exponentially with increasing field coverage. Additionally, the absence of systematic characterization of the gun-restriction firing zone and ordnance that present interception hazards render manual calculations tedious and time-consuming.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a method for determining fratricide probability of projectile collision from a projectile launcher on a platform and an interception hazard that can be ejected or launched from a deployment position. The platform can represent a combat vessel, with the projectile launcher being a gun, the interception hazard being a missile, and the deployment position being a vertical launch cell.

The fire and interception areas are calculated using spherical projection.","Various exemplary embodiments calculate the angular firing zone by an integral for a rectangular solid angle as: \u03a9=\u222b\u222bcos \u03c6d\u03b8d\u03c6, where \u03b8and \u03b8are azimuth bounds and \u03c6and \u03c6are elevation of the firing zone.

These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments describe the development of techniques for calculating fratricide probabilities between a gun projectile and other ship-fired ordnance. These embodiments provide flexibility to analyze any combination of ship, layout, gun, and surface-launched ordnance system. Various collected data are mathematically manipulated to calculate the probability of fratricide using solid angle geometry. These calculations account for ordnance fly-out paths as well as gun-slewing action. This development aids and improves accurate prediction of fratricide potential of a weapon system safety engineer between various shipboard weapons systems and to thereby quantify the risk of personnel injury and equipment damage.","In the context of this disclosure, fratricide involves intersection of ordnance on one's own ship (ownship ordnance) with other ownship ordnance. Collision of such ordnance can cause an energetic reaction leading to catastrophic damage and\/or death. One such tragic example occurred on Jul. 29, 1967 aboard the U.S.S. Forrestal (CV-59) in which an accidentally launched Zuni rocket struck a bomb-laden A-4 Skyhawk causing a conflagration that cost  lives, many of whom from thermal cook-off of exposed munitions. This analysis procedure aids in the determination of the probability of such an incident to advise proper authorities of the level of risk associated with this hazard and institute appropriate mitigation measures.","Conventionally, fratricide analysis is performed manually. Various exemplary embodiments describe development and utilization of an automated Fratricide Probability Calculator (FPC), which more precisely calculates fratricide probabilities for user defined ship classes and layouts, as well as various gun weapon systems (i.e., projectile launcher) and missile launching systems (e.g., potential interception hazard).","Conventional analytical efforts have incorporated cylindrical modeling to calculate the probability. Preferably, spherical modeling can provide more accurate results by taking into consideration the various fly-out paths as well as various stewing actions of the gun. The FPC can employ this spherical modeling along with other enhancements to provide an automated capability to provide quick and accurate probabilities of fratricide for a myriad of weapon systems combinations.","The calculation of fratricide probability can be analogized as a ratio of the total amount of area being presented by a target relative to the total area available in which the gun can fire. A blindfolded person randomly throwing darts at a dart board on a wall represents a hypothetical example. Assuming that the person can only strike within the boundaries of the wall, for a dart board that represents one-tenth the presented area of the wall, the chances that the person hits the board is ten-percent (10%). The calculation of fratricide probability introduces greater complexity than the simple random dart-throwing analogy assumes, particularly for combat vessels (e.g., naval ships) with intricate restrictions depending on positions of superstructure components, antenna masts, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","140","150","160","170"]},"First Step : The model determines the gun firing zones for a warship or other combat vessel from the gun-mount view over a missile system that contains a plurality of missiles. The gun firing zone is defined as the region within which the gun can fire without striking any portion of the ship. Irrespective of type or class, each ship possesses a unique layout and therefore different firing zones from other ships. The gun firing zones are defined in terms of their azimuth and elevation boundaries. For the example described herein, the entire gun firing zone can be divided into separate sectors, depending on the minimum elevation angles.","Second Step : The model identifies which sector to which each missile corresponds. Aegis-equipped warships house vertically containerized missiles launched from cells. , described subsequently, illustrate the missile positions as located within the second-through-fourth sectors of the five shown. If a missile cell overlaps two sectors, the cell can be selected as corresponding to the sector which contained half or more of the cell area for calculation purposes.","Third Step : The model calculates the distance R between the center of each missile cell and the gun. This determination can be performed using the Pythagorean Theorem using orthogonal rectangular coordinates.","Fourth Step : The model calculates the field-of-fire area A, above each missile cell using cylindrical geometry.

However, future analyses are expected to involve greater ranges in azimuth, necessitating reduction or elimination of this error source, which can be accomplished with spherical modeling. Such an adjustment corrects distortion in the firing height Hthat increases asymptotically.","Spherical Modeling Method: The FPC provides a tool that can quickly and accurately calculate the probability of fratricide between a gun and another weapon system. This tool enables automation of the process to be executable on a standard desktop computer, thereby enabling analysis of any combination of ship type, layout, gun, and ship launched ordnance system while considering the three dimensional relationship between the gun and other ordnance.","Analysis efforts focus on ship-launched missiles, due to the criticality and detrimental effects of the fratricide mishap. However, ordnance also includes ship self-defense weapons and gun projectiles. In special cases, a gun barrel may also be modeled as the ordnance to be examined. Consideration can be given to the vulnerability of the ordnance as well as the total elapsed time in which the missile is within the field-of-view of the gun.","For the purpose of alterations and reproducibility, the operator is assumed to be able to create and save a database of ordnance, gun, ship types, and layouts, as well as missile motion parameters and gun firing scenarios. Additional fidelity in the predictions can be gained through the use of Monte Carlo scenarios in which combinations of variables could be modified with respect to one another.","Parameter Inputs: The main inputs are the gun firing zones, gun firing parameters, physical dimensions of the ordnance, and ordnance flyout parameters, including trajectory. The gun firing zones are defined in terms of their azimuth and elevation boundaries, as depicted in , and can be easily stored and retrieved in tabular form, such as a spreadsheet file.","The gun firing parameters are defined by the path along which the gun is trained and the duration of time the gun fires a round. For simplicity, the path can be defined as a straight line between starting and ending coordinates (azimuth and elevation). The duration can be defined as either a period of time or a single shot. For simplicity in these examples, the passage of the ordnance between two rounds can be neglected.","A \u201ccollision\u201d occurs if the gun points at the ordnance at any time while firing. The physical dimensions of the ordnance may be loaded into the program via a Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) file, while the ordnance's flyout parameters can be modeled as a series of orthogonal coordinates related to the position of the ordnance over a series of time-steps. Additional accuracy can be added by incorporating gun-firing probability zones and ordnance vulnerability maps into the calculation.","Description of Mathematical Method: One significant difference between cylindrical and spherical modeling involves the absence of a physical surface to yield an area of the gun firing zone against which to compare to the target's area facing the gun. The target as described herein represents a fratricide hazard, although these principles can be extended to intended interception scenarios.","Therefore, a sounder approach compares the angular area of the target to that of the firing zone presented to the gun. Angular areas, called solid angles \u03a9, are measured in steradians, in the same manner that standard angles can be measured in radians. The solid angle of a sphere equals 4\u03c0 steradians.

The technique enables comparative analysis of multiple firing times, slewing paths, and ordnance flyout courses against one another. The resultant fratricide probabilities can then be averaged together to achieve a more confident result.","Development of the Fratricide Probability Calculator adds significant capability in determining the fratricide probability between two shipboard weapon systems. Inclusion of spherical modeling of the ship environment leads to a better representation of the relationship between the gun and the ordnance. The technique facilitates a mathematical determination of the effects of a complicated ordnance fly-out path and slewing gun on the fratricide probability. Thus, these techniques generate higher fidelity probabilities and expand the variables that can be analyzed.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
