title: Assembly for launching bodies from an underwater platform
abstract: An assembly for launching bodies from an underwater platform having a pressure hull, and an outer hull subject to free flooding. The assembly includes a module having a proximal end outboard of the pressure hull portion of the platform, a distal end disposed proximate and in alignment with a launch opening in the outer hull portion, and a chamber in the module extending from the distal end of the module to proximate the proximal end of the module, the module chamber being adapted to receive and retain one of the bodies. Support structure on the platform retains the module. A pump on the platform is in communication with water outside the pressure hull, and an impulse tank on the platform is in communication with the pump. A manifold is in communication with the impulse tank for directing outflow of water from the impulse tank to the chamber to eject the body from the chamber.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The invention relates to naval submarine design and construction, and is directed more particularly to a novel assembly for underwater launching of bodies, such as torpedoes, mines, missiles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and the like.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The horizontal launch of torpedoes and other weapons and devices from submarines has traditionally been conducted with torpedo tubes, typically arranged in groups of two. An impulse tank ports water from an ejection pump to each of the two tubes. Two impulse tank and tube group assemblies are located at the bow of the boat, one assembly on the starboard side and one assembly on the port side.","The aft ends of the tubes are located in a torpedo room and penetrate the forward pressure hull to provide a path to the outboard sea environment. The torpedo room is among the most complex and expensive aspects of submarine design and construction, due in large part to the inherent risk of large pressure hull penetrators, i.e., torpedo tubes of at least twenty-one inches in diameter.","There is a need for a new submarine launch system which does not require large or multiple pressure hull penetrations, in which the bodies to be launched may be stored outside of the pressure hull, and which is, in general, of less cost, weight and complexity than existing systems.","An object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a launch assembly for submarines, which assembly is devoid of large and multiple pressure hull penetrations, provides for storage outside the pressure hull of bodies to be launched, and which is less expensive than present systems, lighter in weight, and of less complexity.","With the above and other objects in view, as will hereinafter appear, a feature of the present invention is the provision of an assembly for launching bodies from an underwater platform having a pressure hull, and an outer hull subject to free flooding. The assembly includes a module having a proximal end for disposition outboard of the pressure hull portion of the platform, and a distal end for disposition proximate and in alignment with a launch opening in the outer hull portion. A chamber in the module extends from the distal end of the module to proximate the proximal end of the module, the module chamber being adapted to receive and retain one of the bodies. A support structure on the platform retains the module. A pump on the platform is in communication with water outside the pressure hull. An impulse tank on the platform is in communication with the pump. The module is provided with a manifold adapted to be placed in communication with the impulse tank for directing outflow of water from the impulse tank to the chamber to eject the body from the chamber.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , it will be seen that the launch assembly  is disposed between a pressure hull  and an outer hull  of a submarine . This area is free-flooded when the submarine is submerged.","A bow portion  of the outer hull  is provided with an opening . A support structure, such as a sleeve , is disposed at a forward end  thereof in the opening  and extends aft therefrom. The sleeve  is adapted to receive a payload module  having therein a selected number of chambers , each chamber being adapted to receive and retain a body  to be launched.","In , there is shown a payload module  having a selected number of chambers  therein for torpedoes. Other payload modules (not shown) are configured with appropriate chambers to retain, for example, selected numbers of mines, or missiles, or at least one unmanned underwater vehicle.","The support structure  preferably includes not only the sleeve shown in the drawings, but additional support structure as needed to retain the sleeve in position.","Preferably, a forward end  of the payload module  is conformed to the configuration of the outer hull .","At an aft end  of the support structure sleeve , there is disposed an impulse tank  which is in communication by way of a conduit , with a pump . The pump  receives sea water through conduit , pressurizes the sea water and forces the pressurized sea water through the conduit  to the impulse tank .","The pump  is in driving communication with an electric motor , as by a drive shaft . The electric motor  is in electrical communication with an interior portion  within the pressure hull , as by a cable  extending through a pressure hull penetration .","Each module  is provided at its aft end  with a manifold  having an inlet  in communication with the impulse tank  and an outlet  which is movable by rotational movement of the manifold  to align with a selected one of the chambers .","A manifold controller  serves to detect the current position of the manifold  and move the manifold in accordance with instructions received from the submarine interior portion  by way of a cable  which extends through a pressure hull penetration .","In operation, instructions as to which chamber  is to be fired are sent from the interior portion  of the submarine  through the cable  to the controller  which detects where the manifold outlet  is disposed and, if warranted, moves the manifold  rotatably until the outlet  is in alignment with the appropriate chamber . By signal through the cable , the electric motor  drives the pump  which pressurizes water received from the conduit  and forces the water into the impulse tank  and thence through the manifold  and into the appropriate chamber  to launch body , such as a torpedo.","There is thus provided a novel launch system for submarines which includes only two very small pressure hull penetrations, in which the launch bodies are stored outside the pressure hull, to render space available within the pressure hull, and which is of less cost, weight and complexity than traditional torpedo rooms and attendant systems.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts in the two views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
