{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/894,422, filed on Jun. 28, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Not Applicable.","The present invention relates generally to data storage and, more particularly, to data replication systems.","As is known in the art, computer systems that process and store large amounts of data typically include one or more processors in communication with a shared data storage system in which the data is stored. The data storage system can include one or more storage devices, such as disk drives. To minimize data loss, the computer systems can also include a backup storage system in communication with the primary processor and the data storage system.","Known backup storage systems can include a backup storage device (such as tape storage or any other storage mechanism), together with a system for placing data into the storage device and recovering the data from that storage device. To perform a backup, the host copies data from the shared storage system across the network to the backup storage system. Thus, an actual data file can be communicated over the network to the backup storage device.","The shared storage system corresponds to the actual physical storage. For the host to write the backup data over the network to the backup storage system, the host first converts the backup data into file data, i.e., the host retrieves the data from the physical storage system level, and converts the data into application level format (e.g. a file) through a logical volume manager level, a file system level and the application level. When the backup storage device receives the data file, the backup storage system can take the application level data file, and convert it to its appropriate format for the backup storage system. If the backup storage system is a tape-based device, the data is converted to a serial format of blocks or segments.","The EMC Data Manager (EDM) is capable of such backup and restore over a network, as described in numerous publications available from EMC of Hopkinton, Mass., including the EDM User Guide (Network) \u201cBasic EDM Product Manual.\u201d An exemplary prior art backup storage architecture in which a direct connection is established between the shared storage system and the backup storage system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,047,294, assigned to assignee of the present invention, entitled Logical Restore from a Physical Backup in Computer Storage System, and incorporated herein by reference.","For large databases, tape-based data backup and restore systems, which are well known in the art, can be used. In general, files, databases and the like are copied to tape media at selected times. Typically, data is periodically backed up to prevent the loss of data due to software errors, human error, hardware failures. Upon detection of an error, in an online database, for example, the backed up data can be restored to effect recovery of the data. While restore refers to obtaining backed up data, data recovery refers to the entire process in which applications can access and use the retrieved data. Transactions since the time of backup can be recreated using so-called redo logs.","Tape-based backup and restore systems have a number of disadvantages. For example, due to the significant amount of time and overhead associated with backing up and restoring data to tape, such operations are performed relatively infrequently. The longer the period between backup and restoration, the more complicated and time consuming the overall recovery process becomes since, for example, this may render it more difficult to determine the point at which an error occurred. In addition, improvements in the data restore process, such as faster tape access times, provide only incremental advances in the overall data recovery process.","Further, data on tape cannot be accessed until it is restored to disk. Only when the data has been restored can a host computer examine the data. The data must be reformatted for each transition between tape and disk, which requires significant processing resources and elapsed time.","A further disadvantage associated with tape-based data storage systems is associated with the data recovery process itself. For example, after an error has occurred an operator, such as a database administrator, evaluates the error in an attempt to find a correct the error. However, the administrator has to deal with limitations imposed by the nature of tape-based storage. For a large mission critical database, it can be prohibitively expensive to shut down the database and perform a restoration from tape. If all possible, the administrator will attempt to perform a repair of the database. However, the risks of corrupting the entire database, causing additional errors, and failing to remedy the error, are significant.","In addition, it is not always known at what time the database became corrupted. In the case where data must be restored from tape, correction of the error can be an iterative and time-consuming process. The administrator may select a first set of tapes for restoration, after which the database can be examined to determine if the error is corrected. If it is not, another set of tapes, which is typically an earlier backup, must be restored. Data examination steps are then performed until the error is corrected.","Once the error is corrected, the error may be re-introduced into the database as post backup transactions are added to the database from the redo logs. The point at which the error occurs must be identified. The time and effort associated with iterative tape restores and error identification can be quite substantial.","One known attempt to identify errors includes so-called data scrubbing tools. These tools, which can be run periodically, are used in an endeavor to detect errors as soon as possible. While such tools may detect errors, many production databases, like those used by Internet-based vendors, are mission critical and cannot handle the loading required by such tools. In many applications, data scrubbing tools are not a practical option.","In addition, there are times at which it is desirable to recover only a portion of a database. However, known systems do not readily enable recovery of less than the entire database. While a portion of a database may be possible in conventional data backup and restore systems, a high level of skill is required to manually recover a portion of a database.","It would, therefore, be desirable to overcome the aforesaid and other disadvantages.","The present invention provides a data recovery system having mountable data volume replications that significantly enhance error detection and correction in comparison to conventional data backup systems. While the invention is primarily shown and described in conjunction with recovering databases, it is understood that the invention is applicable to other systems in which it is desirable to detect and remove errors from stored data.","In one aspect of the invention, an information recovery system replicates one or more original data volumes to examine the integrity of the replicated or original data volumes. Upon detecting an error, the system can be used to correct the error by repair and\/or data restoration. After successful error detection, the data volumes still having the error can then be corrected.","In a further aspect of the invention, an information recovery system provides mounting of partial database replications, such as one or more selected table spaces. With this arrangement, a user can select tablespaces for recovery from a replication of an original database. In one embodiment, the partial mounting can be started in a variety of modes.","In another aspect of the invention, an information recovery system provides automated replication storage selection. With this arrangement, the information recovery system automatically discovers potential storage locations that can be used to replicate an existing data volume, such as a database, and selects storage meeting predetermined requirements so as to obviate the need for a database administrator to manually identify the storage. While the invention is primarily shown and described in conjunction with replicating databases to disk, such as Oracle databases, it is understood that the invention is applicable to storage systems in general in which it is desirable to backup digital information on various replication technologies for subsequent restoration.","In one embodiment, an IR server obtains a list of potential replication storage locations, e.g., BCVs, production data volumes, e.g., standard volumes, that have been requested to be replicated. A user can specify that certain BCVs must have specified criteria, such as BCV storage previously configured by the user. The system then selects potential BCVs for each standard volume and evaluates each standard\/BCV pair. In one embodiment, a pair score is determined based upon the level of resource contention, e.g., disk spindle, bus, etc., for the standard\/BCV pair. The resources can be weighted to reflect the level of performance degradation due to contention on the resource. A group score is determined from the pair scores for evaluation of whether an acceptable storage solution has been found.","It is understood that certain terminology, such as BCV, standard volume, and others, are used to facilitate an understanding of the invention and should not be construed to limit the invention.","In general, the information recovery system of the present invention provides users with the ability to make replications of logical objects, such as databases and mail systems, and to restore the replicated objects instantly, i.e., as fast as the underlying storage technology supports. While the invention is primarily shown and described in conjunction with an exemplary storage technology known as Symmetrix by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass., it is understood that the invention is applicable to a variety of storage technologies and operating systems.","In one particular embodiment, the information restore system targets various databases, such as Oracle and SQL Server databases. The system enables users to configure a database, or portion thereof, e.g., one or more table spaces, for replication. The configured portion of the database is referred to a replication object (RO). That is, the RO describes the application to be replicated. For each RO, one or more Activities describe how the replication of the RO should be performed. Exemplary information includes how to interact with the database, e.g., online or offline, pre and post scripts, mounting and recovery options, and storage selection criteria. Activities can be run on demand or scheduled for predetermined times. Mounting details, e.g., where and how, can be defined during activity creation.","Storage for the activity can be selected by the system in a variety of ways. For example, the system can look for free or previously established storage business continuance volumes (BCVs). As used herein, business continuance volumes refer to a mirror of a standard volume a part of the database. Also, users can define attributes on BCVs to create storage pools and select storage by attributes in the activity. The user can also explicitly assign BCVs to Standard Devices (STDs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","108","102","106","108","108","108","108","102","102","102","110","110","102","102","102","104"],"i":["a ","a ","b","c","b ","c ","a ","b ","b "]},"The system  further includes application hosts , e.g., Oracle database server hosts, that are under client control via an application agent and storage service module . The application agent in the IR application client processes user databases, which reside in the storage area network . This client control module , which can be provided as a daemon, handles and dispatches client operations. Application agents , e.g., plug-ins, for each supported application handle work requests. The IR application clients  can also communicate with third party vendors via call outs, for example, for driving a third party product to backup a replication of the user database. It is understood that hosts that are used for mounting replications can also be application hosts .","While shown as three separate hosts, it is understood that one or more of the user, application client and IR server can reside on a single host or machine. It is further understood that the illustrated embodiments, architectures and configurations can be readily modified by one of ordinary skill in the art to meet the requirements of a particular application without departing from the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["150","150","152","1","2","154","156","158","160","160","160","158"],"i":["a","b","c"]},"In general, hosts and applications become visible to the system upon installation.

"]},"Additional screen displays (not shown) can query the user for additional information. For example, a further screen display can prompt the user for application specific information about the replication object, such as how to access the database (username and password), as well as what portions of the database to backup, e.g., an entire database, tablespaces for an Oracle database, etc. Another screen display enables the user to create activities for the RO. There can be many activities that can be run individually or scheduled for specific times. More particularly, an activity can provide regularly scheduled replications, make a decision support database, and support disaster recovery.","In one embodiment, a replication or checkpoint has an expiration time, i.e., how long the replication remains valid. The user can indicate whether it is anticipated that the checkpoint (replicated database) will be mounted. This information may be required when choosing a replication technology (RT), since not all replication technologies allow mountable copies of the checkpoint. The user, when defining storage selection, can choose a replication technology or allow the system to select the RT, as mentioned above.","In addition, for each activity the user can provide attributes that are specific to mount, storage and application. Mount attributes define what should be done with the object when it is mounted, such as recovering the database, running a verify program, and doing a tape backup. Storage attributes define what storage should be used to make the replication. Application attributes define when the replication is made and what application specific things need to be done, such as putting the database in on-line backup mode, and using a user script to shut the database down.","Selecting the mount options for the replication object allows the user to specify things that should be done with a replication after it is taken. This same set of options can be displayed to the user if the user manually chooses to mount a replication. One option the user has is whether to mount and restore the replication, and where to make it visible. Running an activity can include mounting the replication, which can be fully or partially mounted.","After selecting how the application should be mounted, the user can choose what to do with the application, such as choosing which programs to run, running a backup and mounting the application after completion. Multiple programs or backups can be selected for execution. Unmounting involves bringing the application down and removing any storage references that were created to make the replication visible on the target operating system.","Storage can be made explicitly known to the IR system either by assigning attributes to it or by explicitly associating standards with replication storage. In one particular embodiment, in the define attributes storage screen, the user is presented with a list of BCVs that were discovered on the data storage device, e.g., Symmetrix, attached to the client machines. The user can then select one or more BCVs and assign attributes to them.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","302","302","110"]},"In general, a local volume is replicated to a business continuance volume (BCV). A local system that employs mirroring allows access to production volumes while performing backup is also described in the '497 patent incorporated herein. The data storage system  includes a system memory  and sets or pluralities of multiple data storage devices or data stores . In an exemplary embodiment, the system memory  includes a buffer or cache memory. The storage devices  can comprise disk storage devices, optical storage devices and the like. However, in an exemplary embodiment the storage devices are disk storage devices. The storage device  represent an array of storage devices in any of a variety of known configurations.","Host adapters (HA) provide communications between host systems and the system memory  and disk adapters (DA) ,a,b provide pathways between the system memory  and the storage device sets . A bus  interconnects the system memory , the host adapters  and the disk adapters . Each system memory is used by various elements within the respective systems to transfer information and interact between the respective host adapters and disk adapters.","An optional backup storage system  can be connected to the data storage system . The backup storage system can be provided as an EMC Data Manager (EDM) connected to the data storage system as described in Symmetrix Connect User Guide, P\/N 200-113-591, Rev. C, December 1997, available from EMC Corporation. The direct connection between the shared storage system and the backup storage system may be provided as a high-speed data channel  such as a SCSI cable or one or more fiber-channel cables. In this system, a user may be permitted to backup data over the network or the direct connection.","The backup system  includes a backup\/restore server , logic  as part of the server, and a tape library unit  that may include tape medium (not shown) and a robotic picker mechanism (also not shown) as is available on the preferred EDM system.","In general, the data storage system  operates in response to commands from the host systems  via the host adapters . The host adapters  transfer commands to a command buffer that is part of system memory . The command buffer stores data structures and write requests that the disk adapters generate. The disk adapters  respond by effecting a corresponding operation using the information in a command buffer. The selected disk adapter then initiates a data operation. Reading operations transfer data from the storage devices to the system memory  through a corresponding disk adapter and subsequently transfer data from the system memory  to the corresponding host adapter when the host system  initiates the data writing operation.","It is understood that the computer host systems  may be any conventional computing system, each having an operating system, such as systems available from Sun Microsystems, and running the Solaris operating system (a version of Unix), an HP system running HP-UX (a Hewlett-Packard client, running a Hewlett-Packard version of the Unix operating system) or an IBM system running the AIX operating system (an IBM version of Unix) or any other system with an associated operating system such as the WINDOWS NT operating system. The storage system may be any conventional storage system, including a Symmetrix storage system, as described above.","A short description of concepts useful for understanding this invention and known in the art is now given. A physical disk is formatted into a \u201cphysical volume\u201d for use by management software, such as Logical Volume Manager (LVM) software available from EMC. Each physical volume is split up into discrete chunks, called physical partitions or physical extents. Physical volumes are combined into a \u201cvolume group.\u201d A volume group is thus a collection of disks, treated as one large storage area. A \u201clogical volume\u201d consists of some number of physical partitions\/extents, allocated from a single volume group. A \u201cfilesystem\u201d refers to a structure or a collection of files.","Below is a short description of other useful terminology which may be understood in more detail with reference to the incorporated '497 patent. When a mirror is \u201cestablished\u201d the data storage system  creates a mirror image (copy or replication) of a source or standard volume. When using the preferred Symmetrix such a mirror is denoted as a business continuance volume (BCV), also referred to in general terms as a mirrored disk, and in such a context as a BCV device. If data on the standard volume changes, the same changes are immediately applied to the mirrored disk.","When a mirror is \u201csplit\u201d the Symmetrix data storage system isolates the mirrored version of the disk and no further changes are applied to the mirrored volume. After a split is complete, the primary disk can continue to change but the mirror maintains the point-in-time data that existed at the time of the split. Mirrors can be \u201csynchronized\u201d in either direction (i.e., from the BCV to the standard or visa versa). For example, changes from the standard volume that occurred after a split to the mirror can be applied to the BCV or mirrored disk. This brings the mirrored disk current with the standard volume. If synchronized in the other direction, the primary disk can be made to match the mirror. This is often the final step during a restore.","The operation of a BCV device and its corresponding BCV volume or volumes is more readily understood in terms of data sets stored in logical volumes and is useful for understanding the present invention. Any given logical volume may be stored on a portion or all of one physical disk drive or on two or more disk drives.","Referring to , in this particular embodiment, operations on a series of physical disks are controlled in terms of logical volumes. The segmentation or hypering of physical disks into logical volumes is well known in the art. A disk adapter (not shown) interfaces logical volumes  interface to the data storage system bus. Each of these volumes  is defined as a Business Continuation Volume and is designated a BCV device. Each BCV device comprises a standard disk controller and related disk storage devices configured to independently support applications and processes. The use of these BCV devices enables a host such as host , described from here on as the \u201csource\u201d host computer system to utilize instantaneous copies of the data in the standard volumes . In a conventional operation, there typically will be at least one BCV volume assigned to each host device that will operate on a data set concurrently. However, as will be explained below, the BCV volumes established for use by one host may be used by another host, such as host , described from here on as the \u201ctarget\u201d host computer system.","The source host may continue online transaction processing (such as database transaction processing) or other processing without any impact or load on the standard volumes , while their respective mirror images on the BCVs  are used to back up data in cooperation with backup system . However, the BCVs may be established for use on another host substantially automatically under control of a computer program, rather than requiring intervention of an operator all along the way.","The direction of data flow for backup is from the data storage system  to the backup system  as represented by arrow . The direction of data flow for restore is to the data storage system is in the opposite direction), but the BCVs  may be mounted on another host other than the one originally established in accordance with the method of this invention.","The optional backup system , such as the EDM system, offers several options for controlling mirror behavior before and after a backup or restore. Mirror policies are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary pre-backup mirror options include bring mirrors down, verify mirrors are down, bring mirrors down if needed, and bring mirrors down after establishing and post backup mirror options include bring mirrors up, leave mirrors down, and leave mirrors as found.","The system establishes one or more mirrored copies of data (BCVs) that are copies of one or more volumes of data (Standard Volumes). The BCVs are established in a conventional manner as described in the incorporated '497 patent. The BCVs are separated or split from the respective one more volumes of data in a conventional manner and which is also described in the incorporated '497 patent.","The system discovers logical information related to the standard volumes that are part of the volume group on the source computer system . A map of the logical information to physical devices on the source computer system is created. In one embodiment, the map can be provided as an XML message. Alternatively, the map takes the form of a flat file that may be converted into a tree structure for fast verification of the logical information. That map is used to build a substantially identical logical configuration on the target computer system , preferably after the logical information has been verified by using a tree structure configuration of the logical information.","The logical configuration is used to mount a duplicate of the BCVs on the target computer system (denoted as mounted target BCVs). The newly mounted target BCVs then become part of a second volume group on the target computer system ","Prior to transferring data, the backup system exercises a series of functions. A discovery\/mapping function discovers and maps logical to physical devices on the source host , and includes such information as physical and logical volumes, volume groups, and file system information. An establish\/split function establishes BCVs or splits such from standard volumes, depending on the pre- and post-mirror policies in effect on source host ","A build\/mount function exports the BCVs established on the source host to the target host . It creates volume group, logical volume, and file system objects on the target host computer system.","An optional backup\/restore function performs backup of the target host BCV data that has been exported or migrated from the source host. The dismount\/cleanup function removes all volume group, logical volume, and filesystem objects from the target host.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["400","402","404","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["500","502","504","506","508"]},"Referring now to , in one embodiment, in step  the discovered logical volume information, which can correspond to flat file, is used to create a tree structure. This structure can be built by a unix function call from information in the mapping files described above. It may be built on both the target host computer system and the source host computer system. It is referred to as a tree because the Volume group information may be placed as the root of the tree and the branches represent the device information within the group and the logical volumes within the group. The tree structure is used in step  to verify the accuracy of the map file before the map file is sent to the target host. The tree is converted to a map preferably as a flat file in step . This flat file map is then sent back to the target in step .","Alternatively, discovery is in manner similar to that performed by the EMC Data Manager (EDM), which is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the map is sent as an XML message.","Referring to , the process of establishing\/splitting with a backup system is started in step . A mirror policy, if any, is checked in step . An inquiry is posed in step  to determine if BCVs are established in accordance with the mirror policy. If the answer is no then BCVs are established in step . The BCVs are split from the source host in step . The BCVs are made not ready to the host in step .","Referring to , the process of beginning to build\/mount logical information so the BCVs can be mounted on the target is begun in step . The volume groups are created on the target is step . Logical volumes are verified on the target in step . The filesystem is checked and fired up on the target in step . The device mount may now be completed with this logical information related to the BCVs on the target host in step .","As shown in , the newly mounted target BCVs may now be optionally backed up in tape in step . The application is then shut down on the target in step . And following the backup of the target BCV's cleanup steps and notification take place in step .","If the software application on the target host in the source host is a database, then information related to the data may also be backed up, with the effect that essentially the entire database is backed up. Important information from the database includes any transactional data performed by the database operations, and related control files, table spaces, and archives\/redo logs.","Regarding databases, further terminology is now discussed. While terminology for an Oracle database is used, one skilled in the art will recognize that other databases may be used without departing from the invention.","Control files contain information about the Oracle database, including information that describes the instance where the datafiles and log files reside. Datafiles may be files on the operating system filesystem. A tablespace is the lowest logical layer of the Oracle data storage structure. The tablespace includes one or more datafiles. The tablespace provides the finest granularity for laying out data across datafiles.","In the database there are archive files known as redo log files or simply as the redo log. This is where all information that may have to be recovered is kept. Without the redo log files a system failure would render the data unrecoverable. When a log switch occurs, the log records in the filled redo log file are copied to an archive log file if archiving is enabled.","Referring now to , the process for restoring source standard volumes is shown beginning at step  for the optional backup system. In step , the system poses an inquiry to determine if the restore is to be from the BCVs on the target or somewhere else. In accordance with the answer, the standard volumes are synchronized from the target mounted BCVs or tape, for example, respectively in steps  or . Step  begins the notification and cleanup steps which are generally described in .","The cleanup\/dismount process begins in step in  as shown in . The BCVs are dismounted from the target in step . This may be accomplished for example with the UNIX umount command. The objects related to volume group, logical volume, and filesystem or move the target in steps  and . The cleanup is completed in step . The BCVs are re-established on the source (i.e., made ready to the host) in step in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 15","sub":"e "},"In one embodiment, a data volume replication, e.g., a copy of the database, resides on disk as a BCV, which is mounted on a remote host and verified with so-called data scrubbing tools. Data scrubbing tools for examining data integrity are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, while it is understood that a variety of data scrubbing tools can be used to evaluate the integrity of the replications, one suitable data scrubbing tool can be provided from the Patrol family of products by BMC Software of Redwood Shores, Calif. Since data is stored on disk in accordance with the present invention, data scrubbing can significantly reduce the latent error time, i.e., the time during which errors are undiscovered.","In contrast, in many conventional systems, the error is not discovered until a person, such as a customer, queries the database operator regarding an irregularity with the customer's account, for example. As known to one of ordinary skill in the art, data living on tape cannot be examined without data restoration and recovery.","After confirmation that an error has occurred, a time TEE elapses in which the error is evaluated to determine potential corrective measures. For example, an operator can evaluate the type of error, how the error occurred, how widespread the error is, what is the impact of the error, when the error occurred, and how the error may be corrected. The level of expertise of the operator, e.g., database administrator, largely determines the time required to evaluate the error.","During error evaluation, the system can create an on-demand replica of the database for mounting on another host. This enables multiple evaluations to be performed in parallel by one or more evaluation teams. In addition, destructive evaluations can be performed on alternate hosts since the production database is available for further replications.","In general, after evaluation of the error an operator decides to correct the error during a time TCE. The operator can restore backed up data (checkpoint) or attempt repair of the production database. By creating another replication prior to attempting repair, the operator can freely attempt repair of the live database. That is, the operator can attempt risky \u201cshot in the dark\u201d repairs since multiple checkpoints exist. In the case where the operator's attempted solution fails to repair the error, or makes it worse, a checkpoint can be readily restored, recovered, and updated from the redo logs. A further copy of the database can be used for trying additional potential solutions. Alternatively, solutions can be tried on a copy of the database prior to modifying the production database.","If a restore is selected over repair, the user must decide which backup is to be restored. Ideally, this is the most recent backup before the database became corrupt. If the exact time at which the error occurred is not known, the user may have to guess which backup is to be restored.","In prior art systems, the user had to do a restore from the selected backup. After completion of the restore, which can be many hours later, the user can check if the selected backup is free of corruption. If not, the user must do another restore from a further backup. Such multiple restores are rendered unnecessary by the IR system of the present invention since the user can mount the selected backup on another host and check the backup for errors. Upon finding an error-free backup, a single restore can be performed.","In many prior art systems, so called surgical repair of the production database is the preferred option due to time and effort associated with restoring data from tape. For relatively large databases, e.g., more than a Terabyte, data restoration from tape can take many hours. In addition, for certain mission critical databases, surgical repair is virtually the only option in view of the incredible costs associated with bringing down a database. However, the concomitant risks of damaging such a database in attempting to repair an error are readily apparent.","During a further time TRF, after restore of the checkpoint, the roll forward process attempts to place the database up to date with transactions that occurred since the database copy was frozen, which are recorded in the redo log RL. The roll forward process is iterative since the database should be checked for errors as the recorded transactions injected into the database. By incrementally rolling forward, the database can be updated at discrete points. If an error is detected, the roll forward process need only revert back to the last known error-free point. Conventional tape-based systems do not provide this ability due to the incompatible formats between tape and disk.","It is understood that an operator can readily vary the particular error detection and correction steps depending upon the requirements of a particular application. For example, varying scheduled and on-demand checkpoints can be generated for use in finding an error correction solution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"In a further aspect of the invention, a portion of a database replication can be mounted to a host computer. While the invention is described in conjunction with tablespaces in an Oracle database, it is understood that the invention is applicable to further database types and components. In addition, it is understood that Oracle terms are used to facilitate an understanding of the invention and should not be construed as limiting the invention to a particular database type or configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIGS. 17\u201318","FIG. 1","FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"b":["1200","1202","1204","1206","1208","1206"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, the production or original database ODB is located in the storage area network SAN and runs on the database server host DBS. The original database ODB includes first, second and third tablespaces TS, TS, TS, along with system information SYS. The replication RDB of the original database ODB also includes corresponding tablespaces TSR, TSR, TSR and system information SYSR. Generation of the database replication is described in detail above. The replication database ODB is visible to an IR user, e.g., mount host MH (). It is understood that the mount host MH and the database server DBS are substantially similar, e.g., running the same operating system, etc.","As described above, the IR daemon  runs on the IR server . Replication information, such as mapping files, is contained in the IR database . The IR database has the information required to mount and start up a replication. This information is captured during creation of the replication, as is also described above. The client control module or daemon  () runs on the database server DBS and the mount host MH. The client control module running on the mount host receives the data volume mapping file along with any other necessary information from the IR server  to mount the replication database RDB.","In general, the system can start up a partial replication database, e.g., tablespaces selected by a user as described above, in a variety of modes. For example, the operator can select table space one TS for startup so that the second and third table spaces TS, TS are ignored. After mounting, the first table space TS is available for user by an operator.","In one embodiment, a partial replication database, e.g., the first tablespace TS, can be started up in recovered mode, recovered read only mode, and no recover mode, which are described below. Further modes for meeting the requirements of a particular application will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1300","1302","1303","1304"]},"In one embodiment, the application layer of the client control daemon receives a mapping or tree file describing what is to be recovered. The original tree is generated during the replication of the application and is stored in the IRD catalog\/database on the IR server. This mapping is made available to the client control running on the mount host. The tree contains what needs to be mounted and is built from what the user requests. So the user selects a partial tree from the original tree. This partial tree file is compared to the original tree describing what is contained in the replication database. This allows the client control daemon to determine those tablespaces, e.g., TS and TS, that do not need to be recovered. The log files can be copied over to the target host, as well as other information files, such as the initinstance.ora file and two backup control files (a read-only version and a regular version) for Oracle applications.","For a start up in recovery mode, in step  the database volume groups and\/or raw devices are renamed from the original host names to new names on the target mount host. For example, Oracle statements are executed to make the Oracle database aware of the name changes. It is understood that the password file is brought over from the IR database for the replication. In one embodiment, the backup control files are automatically copied to the location where the real control files are supposed to be, ready for oracle to use. The backup control files are copied to the archive log directory on the mount host. The control files are copied to the locations described by the init<SID>.ora file of the application host for Oracle applications, at the time of replication. The description of this location is actually cataloged, e.g., by querying the database, at the time of the replication. Depending on whether it is a read-only recover or a recover, the appropriate backup control file is copied into the above-specified location. After copying the control files, the IR Application agent software will apply the appropriate permissions and ownership.","After applying the restored password file, in step  the unwanted information, e.g., TS, TS, is deleted so that only the tablespaces previously selected for recovery by the user, e.g., TS, are recovered. The recovery of the first tablespace TS is then executed in step . After copying the appropriate control files, the database is mounted and renamed if necessary. Unwanted datafiles are then dropped (dropping datafiles updates the control files), and then the entire database is recovered. Oracle ignores the dropped datafiles and recovers only the tablespaces that are selected for mounting as defined by the control files. In step , the Oracle database instance is then opened and available for use.","In the no recover mode, the oracle layer does not issue any oracle recovery commands. It simply keeps the tools available for the user. That is, the initinstance.ora, the logs, the data files and the backup control files are available. The user can then recreate a password file and execute the recovery manually.","In the readonly startup mode, the system behaves similarly to the recover mode except that the backup control file that is copied to the real control file location is the read-only version, and the instance is recovered and opened in standby mode.","One skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention based on the above-described embodiments.
