{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT\/JP2009\/003025 filed 30 Jun. 2009, which designated the U.S. and claims priority to JP Application No. 2008-175560 filed 4 Jul. 2008; and JP Application No. 2009-098298 filed 14 Apr. 2009, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a transparent conductive substrate having a conductive random network structure exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property, a process for producing the transparent conductive substrate, a transparent conductive transfer plate used for producing the transparent conductive substrate, and a process for producing the transparent conductive transfer plate. In addition, the present invention relates to a molded product obtained using the transparent conductive substrate which is in the form of an electromagnetic shielding material having a good visibility.","A transparent conductive substrate has been conventionally used as an antistatic film, a transparent electrode for touch panels or solar cells, an electromagnetic shielding material, etc. Among them, the electromagnetic shielding material has been intensively studied and researched in the various applications, and used for the purpose of suppressing emission of various kinds of electromagnetic waves from electronic equipments such as domestic appliances, cellular phones, personal computers and televisions. In particular, there is a fear that electromagnetic waves emitted from flat panel displays such as plasma displays and liquid crystal displays induce malfunction of devices and also have adverse influences on human bodies when exposed thereto for a long period of time. The methods for eliminating adverse influences from an electromagnetic wave generating source to suppress emission of the electromagnetic waves are generally classified into the following two types, i.e., (1) a method in which an electronic circuit is improved and designed so as to suppress emission of electromagnetic waves from the electromagnetic wave generating source; and (2) a method in which the electromagnetic wave generating source is covered with an electromagnetic shielding material. The above method (1) is more suitable as long as emission of electromagnetic waves is well suppressed, because no surplus members are needed therein. However, since the method (1) requires complicated procedures for identifying the source from which the electromagnetic waves are generated and further improving and designing the electronic circuit, there are many cases where use of the method (2) is more efficient and desirable rather than the method (1). Under this circumstance, studies have been made to develop a suitable electromagnetic shielding material.","As to the above method (2), there have been conventionally proposed several methods for producing a transparent conductive substrate that can be used in the applications of the electromagnetic shielding material. For example, there is known the method of forming a grid-like metal wiring. In this method, a metal foil such as a copper foil is formed into the grid-like metal wiring by photolithographic process (for example, refer to Patent Document 1). However, the photolithographic process requires not only complicated procedures but also a special apparatus which results in high costs. Also, there is disclosed the process in which Pd fine particles as a plating catalyst are applied onto a substrate and then the thus coated substrate is subjected to plating (for example, refer to Patent Document 2). However, in the above process, it is required to keep the plating solution under careful control which also results in complicated procedures and further causes the problem concerning environmental burden. In addition, there is disclosed the method for producing a transparent conductive substrate in which a printing ink prepared from metal fine particles is printed on a substrate by screen printing method and then heat-treated to form a grid-like metal wiring thereon (for example, refer to Patent Document 3). However, this method has such a problem that the metal wiring produced by such a printing method fails to have a sufficiently narrow width capable of conforming to still higher resolution of future displays.","Meanwhile, when the transparent conductive substrate having the grid-like metal wiring is applied to flat panel displays, etc., an \u201canti-moire\u201d property of the transparent conductive substrate is important. The moire means spots appearing when points or lines that are distributed in a geometrically regular manner are overlapped, and more specifically is such a phenomenon that striped patterns are observed on displays. For this reason, it has been pointed out that a metal wiring having a random network structure, for example, is preferably used in place of the grid-like metal wiring. As a method of producing a transparent conductive substrate having the above random network-shaped metal wiring without using a photolithographic method or a printing method, there is disclosed the method in which a dispersion solution of metal fine particles is applied on a substrate and then dried to form a random network structure of the metal fine particles by utilizing a self-organizing phenomenon of the metal fine particles (for example, refer to Patent Document 4). This production method is considered to be more excellent in view of costs and reduction of environmental burden.","Also, as the above electromagnetic shielding material, there are mentioned metal foils such as aluminum foils, copper foils and iron foils, conductive cloths prepared by plating a polyester fiber with copper or nickel, metal shielding screens produced by arranging metal wires such as stainless steel wires and copper wires on a transparent substrate in a grid-like manner, transparent conductive substrates produced by printing a conductive paste containing a silver filler on a substrate in a grid-like manner, transparent conductive substrates produced by laminating ITO (oxide of indium and tin) on a substrate by vapor deposition, etc.","On the other hand, in recent years, the above electromagnetic shielding materials are required to have not only an electromagnetic shielding property but also a visibility for rendering objectives to be shielded viewable from outside. This is because there is a demand for subjecting electronic equipments to visual inspection to inspect a substrate or a wiring disposed therewithin from an outside of a housing thereof after being assembled.","To meet the above demand, there has been proposed the method in which a housing prepared from a transparent resin is attached with an optically transparent electromagnetic shielding material selected from the above-mentioned electromagnetic shielding materials to ensure a good visibility thereof.","Examples of the electromagnetic shielding material having an optical transparency include conductive cloths prepared by plating a polyester fiber with copper or nickel, metal shielding screens produced by arranging metal wires such as stainless steel wires and copper wires on a transparent substrate in a grid-like manner, transparent conductive substrates produced by printing a conductive paste containing a silver filler on a substrate in a grid-like manner, transparent conductive substrates produced by laminating ITO on a substrate by vapor deposition, etc.","In addition, when reduction of costs is intended, rather than the above method of attaching the electromagnetic shielding material to the housing of electronic equipments after completion of assembly thereof, it is apparently preferred from industrial viewpoints to use the method in which the transparent resin substrate as a raw material of the housing is first imparted with an electromagnetic shielding property, and then the resulting electromagnetic shielding transparent resin substrate is subjected to molding process to produce the housing.","However, in the case where the above electromagnetic shielding material is subjected to molding process in place of the transparent resin substrate as a raw material of the housing, or in the case where the electromagnetic shielding material is attached or laminated onto a molding transparent resin substrate and then the resulting composite or laminate is molded and formed into a shape of the housing, there tends to arise such a problem that bent corner portions of the housing suffer from defects which therefore results in difficulty in production of the housing.","More specifically, when using the metal shielding screen or the transparent conductive substrate produced by printing a conductive paste containing a silver filler on a substrate, the wirings formed by the metal wire or silver filler tend to be broken at the bent portions of the housing, so that it may be difficult to ensure a current flow through an entire portion of the housing. As a result, it is required to connect the respective current-flowing portions to ground when the housing is grounded, or to subject the housing to a secondary treatment to form a bridge between the current-flowing portions to ensure a current flow through an entire portion of the housing.","In addition, when using the transparent conductive substrate produced by applying ITO onto a substrate by vapor deposition, the resulting ITO thin film tends to suffer from cracks at bent portions thereof, thereby failing to ensure a current flow through an entire portion of the housing.","On the other hand, there is disclosed a transparent conductive film having a random network structure formed from metal fine particles (Patent Documents 5 and 6). It is expected that the transparent conductive film is used as an electromagnetic shielding material having an excellent visibility because of a high optical transparency and a high electrical conductivity thereof.\n\n","Meanwhile, in the above method utilizing the self-organizing phenomenon, the metal fine particles are collected together upon dried to form a random network structure. However, in order to obtain a sufficiently low resistance, it is required to subsequently subject the random network structure to heat treatment or chemical treatment. The reason therefor is as follows. That is, although it is generally reported that metal fine particles undergo accelerated low-temperature sintering by reducing a particle size thereof, it is required to subject the metal fine particles to heat treatment or chemical treatment to remove therefrom an organic dispersant that is added to a dispersion solution of the metal fine particles for the purposes of preventing the metal fine particles from being unified together and keeping a good dispersibility thereof in the dispersion solution. In addition, since the organic solvent used in the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles is generally capable of well dissolving a resin therein, the substrate laminated with the transparent conductive film tends to be deteriorated during the treatment unless the substrate used has a high chemical resistance. Further, taking a good adhesion between the metal fine particles and the substrate into consideration, it is required to previously apply a heat-sensitive adhesive layer or a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer onto the substrate. However, when applying these layers, the substrate tends to suffer from change in surface properties thereof, thereby inhibiting the metal fine particles from being self-organized.","Thus, the method of producing the transparent conductive substrate by utilizing a self-organizing phenomenon of the metal fine particles is a method capable of readily producing the transparent conductive substrate having an excellent anti-moire property as compared to the photolithographic method, plating method or printing method. However, the substrate usable in the method is limited to those having a heat resistance or a chemical resistance and further is required to maintain surface properties even after applying a heat-sensitive adhesive layer or a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer thereonto. Therefore, in the above method, there still remain various problems to be solved and improved.","Further, in recent years, there is a more and more increasing demand for a good visibility of the electromagnetic shielding material. Therefore, the electromagnetic shielding material having a sufficiently high optical transparency which is capable of meeting the above requirement is limited only to metal shielding screens, transparent conductive substrates produced by printing a conductive paste containing a silver filler onto a substrate in a grid-like manner, transparent conductive substrates produced by laminating ITO on a substrate by vapor deposition, etc.","However, there are present only limited substrates which can exhibit a sufficient durability against both of the organic solvent used for forming a transparent conductive film having an excellent transparency and conductivity and the heat and\/or chemical treatments for improving a conductivity. Therefore, it may be difficult to obtain a transparent conductive substrate in which a transparent conductive film is laminated on a readily moldable inexpensive substrate. As a result, various problems still remain unsolved.","In addition, there are no conventional electromagnetic shielding materials or transparent conductive substrates which are capable of being readily molded into a housing, although they are sufficient in optical transparency and electromagnetic shielding property.","An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a transparent conductive substrate which is capable of readily producing the transparent conductive substrate having a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property without using a special apparatus and can be applied to production of various extensive substrates; a transparent conductive substrate; a process for producing a transparent conductive transfer plate used in the above process; and a transparent conductive transfer plate, as well as a transparent conductive substrate having a high durability.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a transparent conductive substrate which has a sufficiently high optical transparency and electromagnetic shielding property and can be readily subjected to molding process, as well as a transparent conductive molded product.","That is, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for producing a transparent conductive transfer plate, comprising the steps of:","applying a dispersion solution of metal fine particles capable of forming a self-organized film on a support having a heat resistance and\/or a chemical resistance and then drying the obtained coating layer; and","subjecting the resulting dried material to heat treatment and\/or chemical treatment to form a transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property and having a conductive random network structure on the support (Invention 1).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for producing a transparent conductive transfer plate, comprising the steps of:","applying a solution of a metal salt as a precursor of metal fine particles capable of forming a self-organized film on a support having a heat resistance and\/or a chemical resistance and then drying the obtained coating layer; and","reducing and precipitating the precursor of the metal fine particles by heating, irradiation with an ultraviolet ray or a reducing gas to form a transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property and having a conductive random network structure on the support (Invention 2).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided the process for producing a transparent conductive transfer plate as described in the above Invention 1 or 2, wherein prior to applying the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles or the solution of the metal salt on the support, the support is subjected to surface treatment (Invention 3).","In addition, according to the present invention, there is provided a transparent conductive transfer plate produced by the process for producing a transparent conductive transfer plate as described in any one of the above Inventions 1 to 3 (Invention 4).","In addition, there is provided a process for producing a transparent conductive substrate, comprising the steps of:","locating the transparent conductive transfer plate as described in the above invention 4 and a substrate such that the transparent conductive film formed on the transparent conductive transfer plate is opposite to one surface of the substrate each other;","subjecting the transparent conductive transfer plate and the substrate to compression-bonding or thermocompression-bonding to each other to transfer the transparent conductive film onto the substrate; and","releasing the support from the transparent conductive transfer plate (Invention 5).","In addition, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for producing a transparent conductive substrate, comprising the steps of:","forming a heat-sensitive adhesive layer, a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, a coupling agent layer or an organic gel layer on at least one of the surface of the transparent conductive transfer plate as described in the above Invention 4 on which the transparent conductive film is formed, and one surface of a substrate;","subjecting the transparent conductive transfer plate and the substrate to compression-bonding or thermocompression-bonding to each other to transfer the transparent conductive film onto the substrate; and","releasing the support from the transparent conductive transfer plate (Invention 6).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided a transparent conductive substrate produced by the process for producing a transparent conductive substrate as described in the above Invention 5 or 6 (Invention 7).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided the transparent conductive substrate as described in the above Invention 7, wherein the transparent conductive film is embedded in either the substrate only, both the substrate and the heat-sensitive adhesive layer, both the substrate and the pressure-sensitive layer, both the substrate and the coupling agent layer or both the substrate and the organic gel layer, or not embedded in the substrate but embedded in any of the layers by itself such that the surface of the transparent conductive film is aligned with a surface of the substrate, the heat-sensitive adhesive layer, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, the coupling agent layer or the organic gel layer on the same plane (Invention 8).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided the transparent conductive substrate as described in the above Invention 7, wherein the substrate is a thermoplastic resin substrate (Invention 9).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided the transparent conductive substrate as described in the above Invention 9, wherein the metal fine particles are formed of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, Zn, Al, Sn, Pd, Ti, Ta, W, Mo, In, Pt and Ru, or an alloy comprising at least two of the metal elements (Invention 10).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided the transparent conductive substrate as described in the above Invention 9 or 10, wherein the heat-sensitive adhesive layer or the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is a layer of a heat-sensitive adhesive or a pressure-sensitive adhesive which is formed of a thermoplastic resin (Invention 11).","Also, according to the present invention, there is provided the transparent conductive substrate as described in any one of the above Inventions 9 to 11, wherein the thermoplastic resin substrate is a resin substrate selected from the group consisting of an acrylic substrate, a polycarbonate substrate, a polypropylene substrate, a polyvinyl chloride substrate, an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate substrate, an ABS substrate, a polystyrene substrate and a laminated substrate of any two or more of these substrates (Invention 12).","In addition, there is provided a transparent conductive molded product produced by molding the transparent conductive substrate as described in any one of the above Inventions 9 to 12 (Invention 13).","When using the process for producing a transparent conductive transfer plate according to the present invention, it is possible to readily produce a transparent conductive transfer plate in which a transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property and having a conductive random network structure is formed on a support, without using a special apparatus. In particular, when selectively using the support suitable for forming the transparent conductive film, it is possible to subject the film to sufficient heat treatment and\/or chemical treatment, thereby enabling formation of the transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property.","Also, in the process for producing a transparent conductive substrate according to the present invention, the transparent conductive film formed on the transparent conductive transfer plate is transferred onto the substrate after production of the transparent conductive transfer plate. Therefore, the substrate is not limited to specific ones, so that it is possible to readily produce the transparent conductive substrate exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property, without using a special apparatus. As a result, the transparent conductive substrate having an excellent performance can be readily produced by using extensive substrates.","In addition, in the transparent conductive substrate according to the present invention, the transparent conductive film is embedded in either the substrate only, both the substrate and the heat-sensitive adhesive layer, both the substrate and the pressure-sensitive layer, both the substrate and the coupling agent layer or both the substrate and the organic gel layer, or not embedded in the substrate but embedded in any of the layers by itself. Therefore, the transparent conductive film can maintain a strength of a fine random network structure thereof and therefore can exhibit an excellent durability.","Further, the transparent conductive substrate according to the present invention exhibits a sufficiently high optical transparency and can be readily subjected to molding process, and therefore can be readily molded to form a housing for electronic equipments which has an electromagnetic shielding property and a visibility.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0061"},"b":["1","11","2","3","5","6","15","4","9","13","7","8","10","12","14","16"]},"The process for producing a transparent conductive substrate according to the present invention includes the step of laminating a transparent conductive film on a support to produce a transfer plate; and the step of transferring the transparent conductive film of the transfer plate onto a desired substrate to produce the transparent conductive substrate.","The \u201csupport\u201d used in the present invention means a resin film, etc., which is used for production of a transfer plate and has a thickness of about 1 to about 200 \u03bcm. The \u201csubstrate\u201d used in the present invention means a substrate to which any film material is transferred from the transfer plate, and includes a resin film, a resin plate, a glass plate or the like which is distinguished from the support used in the transfer plate and has a thickness ranging from 1 \u03bcm to 10 mm.","First, a dispersion solution of metal fine particles is applied on the support and then dried, and the resulting dried material is subjected to heat treatment and\/or chemical treatment, or a solution of a precursor of the metal fine particles is applied on the support and then dried, and thereafter the precursor of the metal fine particles thus applied is reduced and precipitated by heating, irradiation with an ultraviolet ray or a reducing gas, to thereby produce a transfer plate in which a transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property to a sufficient extent is laminated on the support.","Thereafter, the transfer plate is laminated onto a desired substrate and subjected to heat treatment, pressure treatment or any other treatment method to transfer the transparent conductive film from the transfer plate to the desired substrate, and then the support of the transfer plate is released therefrom, thereby obtaining the transparent conductive substrate exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property.","Upon transferring the transparent conductive film onto the desired substrate, a heat-sensitive adhesive layer, a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, a coupling agent layer or an organic gel layer (hereinafter referred to merely as a \u201cheat-sensitive adhesive layer or the like\u201d) may be interposed between the desired substrate and the transparent conductive film. The heat-sensitive adhesive layer, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, the coupling agent layer, the adhesive organic gel layer or the like is applied to a surface of the desired substrate and\/or a surface of the transfer plate, and then the desired substrate and the transfer plate are laminated on each other, followed by subjecting the resulting laminate to heat treatment and pressure treatment or any of these treatment or to irradiation with an ultraviolet ray when using an ultraviolet-curable type heat-adhesive layer, to thereby transfer the transparent conductive film from the transfer plate onto the desired substrate. Thereafter, the support is released from the transfer plate, thereby obtaining the transparent conductive substrate in which the transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property is laminated on the substrate.","Meanwhile, in the present invention, the \u201cheat-sensitive adhesive layer\u201d means a layer which exhibits no adhesion force at an ordinary temperature but generates an adhesion force when heated, whereas the \u201cpressure-sensitive adhesive layer\u201d means a layer which exhibits an adhesion force even at an ordinary temperature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1(","FIG. 1(","FIG. 1("],"b":["3","1","2","5","1","4","2","6","1","4","3","5","6","1","2","4","7","1","8","2","9","4","1"],"i":["a","b","c"]},"As the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles or the solution of a precursor of the metal fine particles, there may be used any dispersion solutions of the metal fine particles or any solutions of the precursor of the metal fine particles as long as when the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles or the solution of the precursor of the metal fine particles is applied onto the support and then dried, it is possible to form a random network structure of the metal fine particles owing to a self-organizing phenomenon thereof, and further when the resulting laminated substrate is subjected to heat treatment and chemical treatment or any of these treatments or when the precursor of the metal fine particles is reduced or precipitated by heat or light or by any chemical method, it is possible to form a transparent conductive film which can exhibit a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property. For example, there may be used a dispersion solution of metal fine particles and a solution of a precursor of the metal fine particles which are produced by referring to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) Nos. 2007-234299 and 10-312715 and Japanese PCT Application Laid-Open (TOKUHYO) No. 2005-530005.","As the metal fine particles contained in the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles or the solution of the precursor of the metal fine particles, there may be used fine particles of metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, Zn, Al, Sn, Pd, Ti, Ta, W, Mo, In, Pt and Ru, fine particles of alloys of the metals, and fine particles of oxides or sulfides of the metals, as well as carbon-containing carbon fine particles, so-called nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotube, fullerene and carbon nanohorn, silicon-containing silicon fine particles, fine particles of silicon alloys of silicon and other metals, silicon oxide fine particles, silicon carbide fine particles and silicon nitride fine particles (in the present invention, these carbon and silicon materials are also involved in the scope of the metal fine particles). In view of attaining a high conductivity, among them, dispersion solutions of the metal fine particles containing at least one element selected from Au, Ag and Cu or solutions of precursors of the metal fine particles are preferably used. In addition, among these metal elements, in view of an oxidation resistance and economy, Ag is preferably used.","The support of the transfer plate is formed of a material that is excellent in heat resistance and chemical resistance. In the process for producing a transparent conductive transfer plate according to the present invention, the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles is applied onto the support and then dried, and thereafter the resulting dried material is subjected to heat treatment and chemical treatment or any of these treatments, or the solution of the precursor of the metal fine particles is applied onto the support and then dried, and thereafter the precursor of the metal fine particles applied is reduced and precipitated by heating, irradiation with an ultraviolet ray or a reducing gas, to thereby form a transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property to a sufficient extent on the support. Therefore, the material of the support must be capable of withstanding these procedures and treatments. If the support is formed of an inappropriate material and therefore the metal fine particles or the precursor of the metal fine particles cannot be subjected to sufficient heat treatment, chemical treatment, ultraviolet-irradiation treatment or reduction and precipitation treatment by a reducing gas, it is not possible to obtain the transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property to a sufficient extent. For example, when the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles or the solution of the precursor of the metal fine particles comprises an organic solvent, the support is required to have a solvent resistance. When the support onto which the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles or the solution of the precursor of the metal fine particles is applied and then dried is dipped in a hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, the support is required to have an acid resistance. In addition, when the support applied with the dispersion solution or the solution is subsequently subjected to heat treatment, the material of the support must be selected from those materials having not only an acid resistance but also a heat resistance. Specific examples of the material used for the support include glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate, polyamides, polyimides and polyphenylene sulfides. In view of a good workability upon transferring, the support is preferably formed of a flexible resin. The support may be used repeatedly. The thickness of the support used may be about 1 to about 200 \u03bcm, and is preferably in the range of 50 to 150 \u03bcm.","Upon forming the transparent conductive film and conducting the transferring procedure, the support of the transfer plate is preferably previously subjected to surface treatments to facilitate smooth transfer of the transparent conductive film without breaking thereof. As the surface treatments, there may be used the method of applying a so-called primer such as silicone-based polymers and fluorine-based polymers, the method of roughening the surface of the support by corona treatment or plasma treatment, and the method of washing the surface of the support with acid or alkali substances. The surface treatments may be carried out to such an extent that the self-organizing phenomenon of the metal fine particles or the precursor of the metal fine particles is adversely inhibited thereby. For example, if the support has a poor wettability with the coating solution, the surface of the support may be modified so as to improve its wettability. However, when the wettability of the support is enhanced excessively, the resulting conductive film tends to become too dense owing to the self-organizing phenomenon, resulting in deteriorated transparency of the film.","As the method of applying the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles or the solution of the precursor of the metal fine particles on the support, there may be employed so-called general coating methods used upon coating treatments on ordinary supports such as those methods using a spin coater, a bar coater, a die coater and a dipping coater as well as a spray coating method.","The temperature used in the heat treatment to be conducted after the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles is applied on the support and then dried, may vary depending upon the material of the support, and is preferably in the range of 100 to 300\u00b0 C. and more preferably 100 to 200\u00b0 C. in order to form a conductive film having a sufficiently low resistance.","As the chemical treatment to be conducted after the dispersion solution of the metal fine particles is applied on the support and then dried, there may be used the method of immersing the resulting dried material in an organic solvent and an inorganic or organic acid which have a property capable of removing a dispersant or a resin contained in the metal fine particles and an effect of accelerating sintering between the metal fine particles. By using the above method, it is possible to obtain a transparent conductive film exhibiting a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property. Examples of the suitable organic solvent include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; and ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone. Examples of the suitable inorganic acid include hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. Examples of the suitable organic acid include formic acid and acetic acid.","The heat treatment and chemical treatment may be conducted singly or in combination thereof.","Upon reducing the precursor of the metal fine particles, there may be used the methods such as heating, irradiation with light such as ultraviolet ray and radiation, and a reducing gas, or by combination of these methods.","For the purpose of further functionalizing conductive portions of the transparent conductive film, fine particles of a metal, a metal oxide, a metal sulfide, etc., which have a catalytic property may be added thereto. Also, in order to prevent deterioration in weather resistance and chemical resistance and deterioration owing to oxidation reduction potential, the surface of the conductive portions of the transparent conductive film may be subjected to plating.","The properties of the transparent conductive film produced in the form of the transfer plate by the above method may vary depending upon the kind of support to which the film is applied and the treating method. However, the surface resistivity of the transparent conductive film is preferably in the range of not more than 100\u03a9\/\u25a1, and the transmittance of the film is preferably in the range of not less than 60%. More preferably, the surface resistance is not more than 30\u03a9\/\u25a1, and the transmittance is not less than 70%. In particular, in the case of the transparent conductive substrate (Invention 7) produced in Invention 5 or 6, the surface resistivity is preferably not more than 20\u03a9\/\u25a1 and more preferably not more than 10\u03a9\/\u25a1. When the surface resistivity is more than 100\u03a9\/\u25a1, the transparent conductive film tends to be insufficient in electromagnetic shielding property. Whereas, when the transmittance is less than 60%, an imaging device using the transparent conductive film tends to require a stronger light source or tends to be deteriorated in resolution. The lower limit of the surface resistivity of the transparent conductive film is not particularly limited, and is usually about 0.01\u03a9\/\u25a1.","The material of the substrate to which the transparent conductive film formed on the transfer plate is transferred may be selected from extensive materials according to the respective applications thereof. Examples of the material of the substrate include glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), amorphous polyethylene terephthalate (A-PET), polyethylene naphthalate, polyamides, polyimides, polyphenylene sulfide, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polycarbonates, acrylic resins, ABS, Si substrates and porous ceramics.","The resins corresponding to materials of the heat-sensitive adhesive layer, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, the coupling agent layer or the adhesive organic gel layer which may be applied onto the surface of the substrate to which the transparent conductive film is to be transferred, and\/or the surface of the transfer plate upon transferring the transparent conductive film onto the desired substrate, are illustrated as follows.","As the material of the heat-sensitive adhesive layer, there may be used adhesives formed of various thermoplastic resins, and curing-type adhesives.

Although the surface resistivity measured between the points A and B (A-B) of the film before molding was 32\u03a9\/\u25a1, the surface resistivity measured between the points AA and BB (AA-BB) of the molded product was too high and therefore became unmeasurable. Thus, the conductivity of the molded product was considerably deteriorated.","A commercially available transparent conductive PET film provided thereon with a mesh-like metal thin wiring was press-molded into a box-shaped molded product by using a press molding machine. Although the surface resistivity measured between the points A and B (A-B) of the film before molding was 0.1\u03a9\/\u25a1, the surface resistivity measured between the points AA and BB (AA-BB) of the molded product was too high and therefore became unmeasurable. Thus, the conductivity of the molded product was considerably deteriorated. In addition, when observing a ridge portion of the molded product between the points AA and BB (AA-BB), it was confirmed that the metal thin wire was broken thereat.","The transparent conductive substrate of the present invention exhibits a low resistance, a high transmittance and an excellent anti-moire property. According to the process for producing a transparent conductive substrate according to the present invention, it is possible to readily produce the transparent conductive substrate without using any special apparatus, and further the process is applicable to production of various extensive substrates. Therefore, the transparent conductive substrate of the present invention can be suitably used as an electromagnetic shielding material, etc.","The transparent conductive substrate, the process for producing the transparent conductive substrate and the transparent conductive molded product according to the present invention are excellent in visibility and electromagnetic shielding property. Therefore, the molded product obtained by molding the transparent conductive substrate can be suitably used as an electromagnetic shielding material."],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","Problem to be Solved by the Invention","Means for Solving the Problem","Effect of the Invention","EXPLANATION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS","PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION","EXAMPLES","Preparation of Silver Fine Particles 1","Example 1","Example 2","Example 3","Example 4","Example 5","Example 6","Example 7","Example 8","Example 9","Example 10","Example 11","Comparative Example 1","Comparative Example 2","Comparative Example 3","Example 12","Example 13","Example 14","Example 15","Example 16","Comparative Example 4","Comparative Example 5","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
