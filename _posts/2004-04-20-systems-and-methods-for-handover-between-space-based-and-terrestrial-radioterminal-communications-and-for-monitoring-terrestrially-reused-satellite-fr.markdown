title: SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR HANDOVER BETWEEN SPACE BASED AND TERRESTRIAL RADIOTERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS, AND FOR MONITORING TERRESTRIALLY REUSED SATELLITE FREQUENCIES AT A RADIOTERMINAL TO REDUCE POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE
abstract: A satellite communications system includes a satellite that is configured to wirelessly communicate with radioterminals in a satellite coverage area over a satellite frequency band, and an ancillary terrestrial component that is configured to wirelessly communicate with radioterminals in the satellite coverage area over at least some of the satellite frequency band, to thereby terrestrially reuse at least some of the satellite frequency band. Wireless communications with a radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, and a received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component. Downlink wireless radiation that is received at the radioterminal from a satellite may be monitored to determine potential interference created by the uplink radiation of the radioterminal due to the terrestrial reuse of at least some of the satellite frequency band.

Such systems and methods are described, for example, in published U.S. patent application Ser. No. 2003\/0073436 A1 to Karabinis et al., entitled Additional Systems and Methods for Monitoring Terrestrially Reused Satellite Frequencies to Reduce Potential Interference, published Apr. 17, 2003, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if set forth fully herein. As described in this published patent application, a satellite radioterminal system includes a space based component such as a satellite and an Ancillary Terrestrial Network (ATN) that includes a plurality of Ancillary Terrestrial Components (ATC). The space based component is configured to wirelessly communicate with radioterminals, also referred to as \u201cradiotelephones\u201d, in a satellite footprint over a satellite radioterminal frequency band. The ancillary terrestrial network is configured to wirelessly communicate with radioterminals in the satellite footprint over at least some of the satellite radioterminal frequency band, to thereby terrestrially reuse at least some of the satellite radioterminal frequency band.","Satellite radioterminal communications systems and methods that may employ terrestrial reuse of satellite frequencies are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,684,057 to Karabinis, entitled Systems and Methods for Terrestrial Reuse of Cellular Satellite Frequency Spectrum; and Published U.S. patent application Ser. Nos.

See, REPORT AND ORDER AND NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING, FCC 03-15, Flexibility for Delivery of Communications by Mobile Satellite Service Providers in the 2GHz Band, the L-Band, and the 1.6\/2.4 Bands, IB Docket No. 01-185, Adopted: Jan. 29, 2003, Released: Feb. 10, 2003, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cFCC Order\u201d. The FCC Order specified that the L-band ATC shall maintain 18 dB of link margin at the edges of its service region in order to achieve in-building penetration and also to suppress radioterminal Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), using closed-loop power control, when the radioterminal is radiating outside of signal attenuating structures.","Conventional uplink power control techniques can reduce a radioterminal's EIRP to significantly below a maximum, when a radioterminal is communicating with an ATC in an area of low signal attenuation (i.e., outside of a building). Thus, the potential for interference to satellite systems that may use the same frequencies as the ATC can be reduced or minimized. Moreover, when the radioterminal is inside of a signal attenuating structure such as a building, conventional uplink power control techniques may allow the uplink transmit power to increase and even attain a maximum, so as to overcome the additional penetration loss of the signal attenuating structure. This can be acceptable in terms of interference to co-channel satellites since, by definition, the signal attenuating structure in conjunction with closed-loop power control can ensure, relative to the co-channel satellite system, a level of interference signal suppression approximately equal to the return link (uplink) margin provided by the ATC (e.g., 18 dB).","Some embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for handing over wireless communications in a satellite communications system. The satellite communications system includes a satellite that is configured to wirelessly communicate with radioterminals in a satellite coverage area over a satellite frequency band, and an ancillary terrestrial component that is configured to wirelessly communicate with radioterminals in the satellite coverage area over at least some of the satellite frequency band, to thereby terrestrially reuse at least some of the satellite frequency band. Handover systems and methods according to some embodiments of the present invention hand over wireless communications with a radioterminal from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold and a received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component.","In other embodiments of the invention, wireless communications with the radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, an aggregate radioterminal interference exceeds a limit, and the received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component. In other embodiments of the present invention, wireless communications with the radiotermianl are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, the received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, and the radioterminal is a predetermined distance away from the ancillary terrestrial component (such as a fixed distance or a percentage of the ancillary terrestrial component coverage area), even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component.","In still other embodiments of the present invention, wireless communications with the radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, an aggregate radioterminal interference exceeds a limit, the received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, and the radioterminal is a predetermined distance away from the ancillary terrestrial component, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component. In still other embodiments, wireless communications with the radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, an aggregate radioterminal interference exceeds a limit, and the received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, independent of position of the radioterminal relative to the ancillary terrestrial component, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component.","In still other embodiments of the present invention, the radioterminals are further configured to wirelessly communicate with a cellular\/PCS base station in a cellular\/PCS coverage area. In some of these embodiments, wireless communications with the radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the cellular\/PCS base station if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, a received satellite signal quality is below a threshold, and the radioterminal is at least a predetermined distance away from the ancillary terrestrial component, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component. In still other embodiments, wireless communications with the radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite or to the cellular\/PCS base station if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, a received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, and the radioterminal is at least a predetermined distance away from the ancillary terrestrial component, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component.","In yet other embodiments, wireless communications with the radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the cellular\/PCS base station if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, a received satellite signal quality is below a threshold, an aggregate radioterminal interference exceeds a limit and the radioterminal is at least a predetermined distance away from the ancillary terrestrial component, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component. In yet other embodiments, wireless communications with the radioterminal are handed over from the ancillary terrestrial component to the satellite or to the cellular\/PCS base station if the radioterminal transmit power exceeds a threshold, a received satellite signal quality exceeds a threshold, an aggregate radioterminal interference exceeds a limit, and the radioterminal is at least a predetermined distance away from the ancillary terrestrial component, even though the radioterminal is able to wirelessly communicate with the ancillary terrestrial component.","As was described above, one of the criteria that may be used to govern handover is a determination whether the aggregate radioterminal interference exceeds a limit. In some embodiments of the present invention, a determination is made as to whether a radioterminal's interference exceeds a limit by monitoring downlink wireless radiation that is received at the radioterminal from a satellite, to thereby determine potential interference created by the uplink radiation of the radioterminal due to the terrestrial reuse of at least some of the satellite frequency band. Monitoring of potential interference may thereby be performed at the radioterminals themselves. In some embodiments, the power of a downlink wireless signal, such as a broadcast control channel that is received at the radioterminal from a satellite, is monitored, to thereby determine potential interference created by the uplink radiation of the radioterminal due to the terrestrial reuse of at least some of the satellite frequency band. It will also be understood that monitoring at the radioterminal may be used according to some embodiments of the present invention, independent of methods for handing over wireless communications in a satellite communications system, to thereby determine potential interference created by the uplink radiation of the radioterminal due to the terrestrial reuse of at least some of the satellite frequency band.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","It will be understood that although the terms first and second are used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element below could be termed a second element, and similarly, a second element may be termed a first element without departing from the teachings of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","Some embodiments of the present invention may arise from a realization that, as a radioterminal moves to the edge and\/or outside of the coverage area of an ATC, it may continue to receive signals from the ATC, even though the radioterminal is located near and\/or outside the outer edge of an ATC coverage area. When the radioterminal moves to the edge and\/or outside of the ATC coverage area, conventional power control may attempt to maintain communications link closure by increasing the radioterminal's power up to a maximum power, and may thus cause potentially increased interference to co-channel systems, such as co-channel satellite systems, when the radioterminal is communicating with a clear or substantially clear propagation path to such systems. Embodiments of the present invention can provide intelligent handover from the ATC mode to a non-ATC mode (such as cellular, and\/or PCS, and\/or satellite mode), to reduce the likelihood that power control methods may cause increased interference to co-channel systems.","Some embodiments of the present invention may also arise from realization that the interference potential of a radioterminal that radiates co-channel satellite-band frequencies may be measured at the radioterminal itself, by measuring one or more characteristics of a satellite downlink signal that is received at the radioterminal. These downlink measurements at individual radioterminals may be used to monitor a measure of the net return link (uplink) interference potential at a victim satellite by determining an aggregate power that is radiated by the ensemble of all active radioterminals at one or more satellite frequencies. Monitoring of aggregate interference can be used as part of a handover technique as described above, and\/or for other purposes.","In the following description, systems and methods for intelligent handover from an ATC mode, to a non-ATC mode to reduce potential interference to co-channel systems, will first be described. Then, systems and methods for monitoring of interference potential via downlink measurements obtained by the radioterminal will be described. Finally, systems and methods for intelligent handover that incorporate monitoring at the radioterminal and\/or at another part of the system, such as a satellite, will be described.","Handover Based Upon Radioterminal Transmit Power and Received Satellite Signal Quality","Conventionally, uplink (return link) power control may be based on a combination of open- and\/or closed-loop methods. In open loop power control, a radioterminal estimates a transmit power level, which may maintain a desired signal quality and\/or strength at a base transceiver system (BTS) or base station, by monitoring its own received signal quality. In closed loop power control, the BTS advises the radioterminal of adjustments to the transmit power level (that may have initially been set by open loop power control). This form of power control (open- and\/or closed-loop) may increase the radioterminal's EIRP up to a maximum in order to maintain link connectivity and\/or acceptable link quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["140","112","110","110","132","120","110","130","120","110","120","140","142","110","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["140","110","120","130","142","1","112","122","110","110"]},"The radioterminal  may be configured to periodically monitor the signal qualities of its own and\/or other alternative services, such as cellular\/PCS and\/or satellite, which are potential recipients of a service handover from the ATC . Many techniques for monitoring signal quality are known to those having skill in the art and need not be described in detail herein. Handover systems and methods according to embodiments of the invention may be based on the following recognition:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["150","310","310","310","320","140","110","140","110","330","140","140","140"],"sub":["th","th"]},"Thus, at Block , if the radioterminal  is within a predetermined distance from a serving ATC base station , such as a certain percentage of the coverage area or cell size, the answer to \u201cIs position OK?\u201d is Yes, and handover need not be performed. Handover need not be performed because the implication is that the radioterminal  is inside a building within the ATC coverage area , so that high power transmission may not create unacceptable levels of interference. In contrast, at Block , if the radioterminal  is outside the predetermined distance from the serving ATC base station , the answer to \u201cIs position OK?\u201d is No, and a handover is made to the cellular\/PCS system at Block . Handover is made on the assumption that the radioterminal  is in the clear, near and\/or outside the edge of the serving ATC cell  and is transmitting high power in an attempt to maintain link closure and\/or link quality. At Block , handover is not made to the satellite system, because relatively low signal strength and\/or quality is received from the satellite system based on the test of Block .","Continuing with the description of , at Block , if the received satellite signal quality measure is greater than the threshold at Block , a test is also made as to whether the radioterminal's position is OK. If the position is within a predetermined distance and\/or percentage of cell size from the serving ATC BTS , then handover need not be made, because the radioterminal  is operating within the appropriate ATC service area. On the other hand, at Block , if the position is not OK because the radioterminal is at a greater than the predetermined distance from the serving ATC BTS , the implication is that the terminal is radiating high transmit power in an attempt to continue communications with the serving ATC. In this scenario, handover is performed to the satellite  or to the cellular\/PCS system  at Block . Handover may be made to the satellite  because the satellite signal quality was acceptable at Block .","Accordingly, embodiments of  can hand over to a satellite or cellular\/PCS system when the radioterminal is transmitting high power in an attempt to continue to communicate with a serving ATC at the fringes and\/or outside of the ATC's coverage area, but need not hand over when the radioterminal is inside of an ATC service area and is transmitting high power due to building and\/or other signal blockage.","Monitoring of Interference Potential Via Measurements Performed by the Radioterminal","The above-cited published U.S. patent application publication 2003\/0073436 A1 describes many techniques for monitoring wireless radiation at the space based component or satellite, which is produced by the ancillary terrestrial network and\/or the radioterminals, and adjusting the radiation by the ancillary terrestrial network and\/or the radioterminals in response to the monitoring. Some embodiments of the invention, which now will be described, can monitor interference potential via measurements that are performed by an ensemble of radioterminals. In particular, according to some embodiments of the present invention, the power received by a radioterminal on a downlink (forward link) signal, from a system's own satellite, may be used as a measure of uplink interference that may be received by the system's own and\/or other systems' satellite(s) from that radioterminal. Alternatively, or in combination, the radioterminal may also monitor a downlink (forward link) signal of a satellite other than its own.","In particular, each radioterminal that is communicating in ATC mode may periodically report to the system the received signal power of the own-satellite broadcast control channel (e.g. S-BCCH in GMR-2) as detected by the radioterminal in the serving satellite spot-beam. The serving satellite spot-beam is the spot-beam serving the location where the radioterminal is situated. As a normal part of maintaining handover readiness, the radioterminal may also periodically be monitoring the signal strength\/quality of neighboring terrestrial cells (both of the ATC and\/or cellular\/PCS) as well as of the serving satellite spot-beam, and potentially, the signal strength\/quality of neighboring satellite spot beams.","The broadcast control channel(s) of the system's own satellite may be radiated at a fixed power level, without being subject to power control. This is true of the BCCH in GSM and S-BCCH in GMR-2. Knowledge of this power level, conventionally available to the satellite system operator, together with the corresponding received power level at the radioterminal (conventionally reported to the network control center) may be used to derive an uplink received power at both the system's own satellite and at any other satellite.
