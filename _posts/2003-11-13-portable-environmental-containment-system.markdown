title: Portable environmental containment system
abstract: A temporary berm or bin system, easily transported, erected without tools, and easily dismantled. A set of panels or planks is joined with sliding clips to form a bin having vertical or near vertical sides. The bin is lined with an impervious sheet of geocloth to form a containment berm for use in controlling the dispersal of hazardous material spilled from storage or work facilities. Spring loaded clamps hold the geocloth securely to the uppermost plank without nailing, sewing, or other labor consuming and/or tear prone methods. The berm is particularly suited to protect oil well drilling sites in environmentally sensitive environments such as arctic tundra. No excavation or other disturbance of the soil is required to erect the protective berm. The berm is secured to the ground by spiking through triangular support gussets. In the arctic, securing may be accomplished by freezing ice or mud as an “ice mortar” over the gusset feet and along the lower edge of the planking. The berm system may be transported by ordinary truck, specially adapted transport/laying truck, or on a portable drilling platform.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","INDEX OF DETAILED ELEMENTS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S):","OTHER EMBODIMENTS AND VARIATIONS","HOW TO USE THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application claims benefit of filing date of Provisional Application No. 60\/426,128 titled Portable Environmental Containment System, filed on Nov. 13, 2002, now abandoned.","The present application describes additional embodiments for the containment system described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,315,495. U.S. Pat. No. 6,315,495 is incorporated by reference.","1. Field of Invention","This invention pertains to temporary structures serving as retaining berms or bins for holding hazardous material against escaping. In particular, to prevent oil well drilling mud and other fluids released during drilling operations from escaping the site, and to protect the environment near the tank batteries used for holding drilling fluids, fuel, and supplies. The system may be stored and transported as part of a drilling rig.","2. Description of Prior Art","In environments where the soil may be disturbed, earth is piled up in berms to form a closed area then covered with an impervious sheet of geocloth or similar. Earth berms require heavy equipment to scoop and pile dirt and to push it back into place when the need for the holding pen is over. In environments where the soil cannot be disturbed, is too hard, or is delicate tundra, timbers such as old railroad ties are stacked as a pen and the impervious geocloth secured to the timbers by nailing. The timber berms require heavy equipment to place and remove. Timbers generally are too heavy to handle without machinery and if treated with creosote or other preservatives, they may leach toxic chemicals into the ground where they are placed. This small but significant contamination has to be scooped up and removed for proper disposal. The heavy timbers require larger hauling equipment and more storage space than the invention described herein.","The patent literature shows several portable or temporary holding, berm-like, structures. Most are for special purposes, not suitable for general or arctic use.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,220, by Carol Norman, shows a shallow pit lined with an impervious sheeting surrounding an oil well head. The marginal attachment is not shown and the text indicates that there are several methods in use. The railroad ties described above are likely to be one suitable means. Miss Norman's invention is intended for finished wells, and is insufficient for use as protection during the drilling operation.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,281, by Dennis Middleton, describes a polyurethane dike device (berm) for use on concrete floors. Sections of the berm or dike are joined by gluing a form-fitting molded splice piece across the interstitial space between adjacent linear sections. The assembly cannot be disassembled without destroying at least part of the components, rendering them not reusable.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,297, also by Dennis Middleton, is a similar device. It is foam filled and designed to be glued to a flat floor. Joining is by gluing a splice piece cut from sheet stock over the joint.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,091, by Edward Van Romer, is another dike similar to the Middleton invention, except that the supporting structure is pneumatic and the dike is sufficiently pliable to permit a wheeled vehicle to roll over the wall portion.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,520477, by Kevin Fink, uses honeycomb core panels connected by H shaped joiners in cooperation with clips having securing barbs. At first glance the clips resemble the membrane-holding clips of the present invention. However, examination discloses that the barbs are not for holding any third component (membrane) in place. They are intermediaries between the panel edges and the H joining bar. The barbs fit into cooperating grooves or holes in the panel and H bar. The Fink figures clearly show this. In particular, FIGS. 4\u201312.","The Fink panel joining and corner assemblies have no resemblance to the structures of the present invention.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,304, by Stuart Karten, et al, has a key-way cut into the ends of the panels and a key system sliding into the key-ways, thereby joining two panels together. The present invention has no key-ways.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,142, by Donald Siglin, et al, is a permanent containment dike comprising panels bolted to posts set into concrete and lined with an impervious sheet of geotextile, which is secured to the upper rim of the wall by bolted clamps. This system requires considerable labor, precision placement of the posts, and does environmental damage. In contrast to the present invention, Siglin bolts the panels at overlapping joints","The Siglin invention uses nuts and bolts as joining fasteners. Nuts and bolts rust tight, making the Siglin dike un-repairable in the best of working conditions. Stainless steel or brass nuts and bolts may reduce the seizing problems at great expense. However, under arctic conditions, the normally simple chore of starting a nut on a bolt, then tightening with a pair of wrenches is a very difficult task. Loosening and removing nuts and bolts which may be frozen in place with ice is also more difficult than expected. Nuts and bolts and wrenches are awkward to handle with arctic gloves and are likely to be dropped, leaving a litter.","The present invention has no nuts and bolts.","The Siglin dike uses posts set in concrete to support the wall sections. Concrete does not set well in freezing conditions. Thus, the Siglin dike cannot be installed in winter in many parts of the world, especially in permafrost zones.","The present invention does not rely on concrete. Furthermore, the present invention can utilize arctic cold to make an \u201cice mortar\u201d or \u201cice-crete\u201d of ice, frozen mud, or the like, for holding the structure in place.","It is an object of the present invention to construct a temporary containment berm using reusable panel modules and other component parts requiring no machinery or power tools to assemble or disassemble.","It is another object of the present invention to be reusable and leave no environmental impact behind when removed.","It is another object of the present invention to be able to construct a temporary containment berm using panel modules and other component parts fabricated from metal or composite sheet stock.","It is another object of the present invention to be able to repair the berm on-site with hand tools or common hand-held power tools.","It is another object of the present invention that the invention be usable under arctic conditions including while wearing cumbersome arctic gloves and other gear.","It is another object of the present invention to be transportable by truck and manually installed.","It is another object of the invention to be transportable on an erection truck, trailer, or skid module using the transporter to place the liner and other components.","It is another object of the invention to be removably attached to a drilling rig, thereby being transported as part of a drilling rig or platform.","It is another object of the invention that the berm confines the spread of liquids or slurries.","Panels or planks are cut from sheet stock, generally \u00bc to \u00bd inch aluminum flat stock. Z or jogged plates are attached near the panel ends forming hooks to co-operate with hooking clips for joining panels. In the central portion of the panels the hooks are arranged in pairs forming a track or key-way slots to accept triangular load supporting gusset brackets having pads for supporting weight and having wings which slide into the key-ways.","The panel end hooks accept hooking clips which are either flat for joining plates in-line or corners bent to form dihedral angles to form bin corners. Clips designed for in-line joining are essentially flat and co-operate with the jogged plates to clip into the end hooks to hold the panels end to end forming long berm or bin walls. The clips for joining panels end to end also carry key-way slots similar to the key-way slots on the panels. Support brackets attach to the joining clips in the same manner as used to attach directly to the panels.","The corner clips are bent an appropriate amount to turn the bin wall. This is usually 90 degrees, but may be any amount. Other preferred turning is 135 degrees internal angle for octagon berms and 157.5 degrees internal angle for 16 sided, approximately circular berms. Others may be bent as required, or a hinged corner piece may be used. No support gussets are required at the corners.","Panels may be in several lengths, widths (height), and thicknesses, the preferred panel lengths being 4, 6, and 8 feet in length. The preferred panel width is 12 to 24 inches. The preferred panel thickness is \u00bc to \u00bd inch.","Rows of panels are stack able using gusset brackets which are large enough to span more than one row. The gussets then act as tie studs between the stacked panels. The larger gussets capable of spanning two or more stacked rows are automatically scaled to support the larger loads expected when the berm or bin becomes filled.","Sections can be removed easily to permit passage of vehicles bringing in supplies or removing equipment then easily replaced by workmen of the skill levels and tools commonly found around drilling operations. Similarly, accidentally damaged sections can be quickly and inexpensively replaced, thus avoiding fines and other complications from possible violation of environmental protection laws.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0076"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0002","num":"0077"},"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0003","num":"0078"},"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0004","num":"0079"},"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0005","num":"0080"},"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0006","num":"0081"},"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0007","num":"0082"},"b":"7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0008","num":"0083"},"b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0009","num":"0084"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0010","num":"0085"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0011","num":"0086"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0012","num":"0087"},"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0013","num":"0088"},"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0014","num":"0089"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0015","num":"0090"},"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0016","num":"0091"},"b":"17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0017","num":"0092"},"b":"18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0018","num":"0093"},"b":"19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0019","num":"0094"},"b":"20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0020","num":"0095"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0021","num":"0096"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0022","num":"0097"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0023","num":"0098"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0024","num":"0099"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0025","num":"0100"},"b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0026","num":"0101"},"b":"27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0027","num":"0102"},"b":"28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0028","num":"0103"},"b":"29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0029","num":"0104"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0030","num":"0105"},"b":"31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0031","num":"0106"},"b":"32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0032","num":"0107"},"b":"33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0033","num":"0108"},"b":"34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0034","num":"0109"},"b":"35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0035","num":"0110"},"b":"36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0036","num":"0111"},"b":"37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0037","num":"0112"},"b":"38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0038","num":"0113"},"b":"39"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0039","num":"0114"},"b":"40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0040","num":"0115"},"b":"40","i":"a, b, c, d, e"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0041","num":"0116"},"b":"41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0042","num":"0117"},"b":"42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0043","num":"0118"},"b":"43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0044","num":"0119"},"b":"44"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0045","num":"0120"},"b":"45"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0046","num":"0121"},"b":"46"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0047","num":"0122"},"b":"47"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0048","num":"0123"},"b":"48"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0049","num":"0124"},"b":"49"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0050","num":"0125"},"b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0051","num":"0126"},"b":"51"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0052","num":"0127"},"b":"52"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0053","num":"0128"},"b":"53"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0054","num":"0129"},"b":"54"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0055","num":"0130"},"b":"55"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0056","num":"0131"},"b":"56"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0057","num":"0132"},"b":"57"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0058","num":"0133"},"b":"58"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0059","num":"0134"},"b":"59"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0060","num":"0135"},"b":"60"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0061","num":"0136"},"b":"61"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0062","num":"0137"},"b":"62"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0063","num":"0138"},"b":"63"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0064","num":"0139"},"b":"64"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0065","num":"0140"},"b":"65"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0066","num":"0141"},"b":"66"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0067","num":"0142"},"b":"67"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0068","num":"0143"},"b":"68"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0069","num":"0144"},"b":"69"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0070","num":"0145"},"b":"70"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0071","num":"0146"},"b":"71"}]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0147"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","7","2","3","4","5","8","2","6","21","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0148"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 and 3","b":["4","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0149"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1"],"b":["12","14","15","16","17","4","12","13"]},"When the joining clip is used to connect two panels, the two clip-plate slots  straddle the jogs of the joining hooks  of adjacent panel ends as shown in . This locks the adjacent panels in position, preventing the two panels from either separating or moving together in an overlap, while permitting a modest amount of angling between adjacent berm panel. The clip base plate  may be jogged at slots  to provide a closer fit against the plank panel . The slots  may also be tilted inward or outward to permit adjacent panels to be angled vertically. Alternatively, the joining clip can be fitted with a pivot for accommodating vertical angling.","Corner clips  are similar to the in-line joining clips of  except that corner clips do not have the gusset bracket hooks  and are bent as illustrated in . The most common corner bracket is bent 90 degrees. However other angles, in particular 135 and 157.5 degrees interior angle are particularly useful. Clips of 135 degrees makes a 45 degree turn in the berm wall, and 157.5 degree clips make a 22.5 degree turn. Of course, custom bending or hinged corner pieces may be utilized to turn a corner for specific purposes. Of particular use are corner pieces angled appropriately to form regular polygons such as 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 32 sides. Polygons having six or more sides approach a circular shape.

At least one hand hold  at the center of each panel assembly is desired for carrying the panel. Aluminum panels are sufficiently light that only one centrally located hand hold is required for all except the longest models.

Refer to  for a free body diagram illustrating the points of action and directions the primary forces encountered in use. The small force vectors represent the incremental forces of small portions of the fluid being retained. These forces are summed (mathematically integrated using calculus) and combined into one equivalent force, Wh. Calculus also determines that the equivalent force acts on one point \u2153 up from the bottom of the fluid. Since all forces, in all linear and torsional axes, must sum to zero, the reaction forces can be calculated. For the configuration shown in ; Rh=Wh, FTOE=FSPIKE, FTOE*M=WH*D\/3. These calculations do not take into account the aiding forces provided by hydraulic pressure in the vicinity of the bottom corner of the liner.","Tables I and II set forth most of the basic principles and equations according to which calculations of the physical size and strength are made. These principals are universal and apply to vertical, sloped, and composite berm walls.","The equations of Table I indicate that the longer the foot, the smaller are the vertical forces on the foot.","For vertical walls, the toe force is upward, preventing the toe from sinking into the soil, and the heel force is downward and supplied by pinning to the ground. However an outward slope of only 10 degrees (80 from horizontal) takes advantage of the weight of the contents to provide a counter to the overturning moment. An offset of 20 degrees (70 from horizontal) will offset all overturning moments and not require any spiking tie-down whatsoever.","The horizontal restraint at the base is required to prevent the bracket from slipping along the ground or warehouse floor. It is resisted by side forces distributed among the pinning nails. The amount of force on each pin is incalculable, but is generally expected to be roughly equal.","The interior of the berm bin is lined with an unbroken sheet of appropriate material . The liner is usually an impervious sheet of material chemically compatible with the expected contents and other environmental conditions. A suitable liner for use around an oil well is \u201cHYTREL\u2122\u201d polyester elastomer by Dupont.

This portion would be driven into the ground and present a significant vertical face under the soil to prevent horizontal sliding.","Similarly, the rear spikes resist both horizontal forces and provide the hold down forces to required prevent the inner end (heel) from rising. The rear spikes can be replaced by an extension on the T rib. When driven into the ground, the extension would provide pinning function and also tend press backwards against the ground and tend to lift a quantity of earth. Both of these can provide significant resistance to overturning.","In applications where the overturning moment is not severe, such as when retaining light materials, the support gusset bracket can be replaced by posts having An L, T, H, or V section driven into the earth.  shows two embodiments of a post. One is a simple V and the other has wings. In use, the edges of the V or the wings are slid into slots  or  in the same manner as the triangular gusset bracket.","While the figures illustrate depth of only one panel, the panels may be stacked to form 2 or 3 layer berms. Stacked panels use enlarged gusset brackets that support and vertically join the panels. An H-section bar or equivalent (not shown) can be used between stacked rows to add alignment and horizontal stiffening.","While the preferred method of forming a corner is to use a bent corner clip, it is within the optional configurations of the invention to bend the panel itself, thereby eliminating the corner clip entirely. Panels may also be bent into arcs for making curved bin walls.","The illustrations depict a bin or berm with vertical sides. Sloping berms can be installed by simply changing the angle of slots  to point inward at the open end, and constructing the gussets with an appropriate slope at the wings. The preferred berm wall slope is with the upper edge outward.  show force diagrams for outward-sloping sided embodiments. The appropriate angles can be easily determined by simple trigonometry, scale drawings, or simple models.","Sloping makes a larger volume, but more importantly, the overturning moment is partly offset by the downward weight of the contents, and the bracket feet support the weight more evenly distributed over their entire area.  is the force diagram for a sloped wall. An outward slope of only 10 degrees (80 from horizontal) reduces the need for spiking hold-down at the heel to a few pounds. An outward slope of 20 degrees (70 from horizontal) will offset all overturning moments and not require any spiking tie-down whatsoever. Lengthening the foot pad on the gussets also reduces the amount of any heel lift to be restrained. The lift is never zero with vertical walls, and horizontal forces remain for all configurations.","There is nothing inherently limiting the angle of slope, but practical considerations suggest that 45 degrees is a maximum useful slope for a retaining bin wall. Larger slopes are practical when the bin wall is part of a materials handling feature such as a slope for aiding in loading or unloading the bin.","The figures also show two other optional embodiments to overcome the overturning moments.  shows a chamfered wall. The inward turn presents a horizontal projection of a surface upon which the weight of the berm contents acts. This geometry causes the center of pressure to move inward relative to a total sloping wall. The net effect is to use the sloping portion more effectively to offset the overturning moment. The overturning moment for all configurations relies only on the horizontal component of pressure on the face of the wall. The gravity derived moment resisting overturning relies only on the vertical component of pressure on any horizontal projection of sloped face.","The chamfer may be a whole panel, or an inwardly bent section of a panel at the bottom. When the horizontal projection of the sloping portion is small relative to the berm height, the preferred angle is from 0 (horizontal) to 45 degrees. Larger sloping portions can utilize larger angles. The more the sloping portion protrudes into the bin, the more effective it is in resisting overturning.","Another embodiment is shown in .  shows an extension of the gusset foot under the berm liner. The weight of the material directly over the extension, which may be splayed into a paddle shape , provides considerable resisting moment to the overturning moment. Mathematically, there is no difference between the paddle and a horizontal extension of the panel.","The spring clip shown in  is unbroken over its length. An optional feature is to cut series of slots a few inches apart. The cuts would be from the open edge to just below the beginning of the over-top curve. Such slots add flexibility and permit the clip to bend slightly and to conform to any panel curvature or to accommodate changing thickness in the liner due to folding, rivet heads, or other obstructions protruding from the panel surface.","The panel sections are easily handled by one or two workmen, but the liner for even a moderately size berm installation is heavy and awkward to handle. There is always a possibility that a forklift, which is seldom available, would damage the sheet. A specialized handling system to dispense the liner can be installed on a truck. Such a dispenser would be either a reel upon which a partly folded sheet is wound or a large flat storage\/dispensing bin containing the liner folded zigzag into a pad, and is dispensed in the manner utilized by fire trucks to lay canvas fire hose.","Referring to , , and , which illustrate an embodiment with the panel hooks, , turned 180 degrees, that is, facing inward toward the center of the panel. It is obvious that the disclosed invention works equally well with the panel hooks turned either outward toward the ends, or inward toward the center.","The joining clip of  is merely the clip of  with the central panel segment removed. The joining clip of  is a staple-like shape constructed of a bent rectangular bar or round rod. The joining clip of  hooks over the ends of the panel hooks thereby occupying the space between the hook and the panel in the same manner as the clips of  and . The clip of C requires some means to prevent the clip from sliding through the panel clips and falling off. Pins through holes, tabs across the gap at the top of the C clip or tabs across the bottom gap of the panel hooks, , are illustrative of typical means to hold the C clip in place.","It is also obvious that the connection assemblies comprising the panel hooks and the joining clips may be located on the interior side of the bin walls without diminishing their ability to form a material retaining berm as described.","It is also equally obvious that the hook may be closed as shown in . The joining clips of , A, B and the prior clip  illustrated in  will cooperate with the attachment pocket \u201chook\u201d of . It is also obvious that the hat section forming the channel  is a modification of the open hook . It is also obvious that the a tube of rectangular or round cross section attached to the panel face will perform the same function as the hat section illustrated.","It is also obvious that an elongated clip  will function both as a panel and joiner. It is also equally obvious that instead of elongating a clip, thus having two styles of panels, the regular panes can be fitted with one end having hooks  or  of .","While only the straight-joining embodiments are illustrated, a bend in the center of the joining clip as shown in  adapts the joining clip or equivalent for use as a corner joining element. Similarly, other embodiments of panel joining methods are illustrated as overlapping panels, corner pieces are either short panels with a dihedral bend near the center, or are long panels with a bend somewhere along the length. The preferred method is to employ short panels adapted for corner use.","Referring to , , and .

These two are slid into the corresponding notches to latch two panels together.","While the drawings and the above paragraph describe an embodiment of the U hook utilizing the material freed up by cutting the notches, it is obvious that the U hooks can be made from separate pieces attached to the panel by welding, bolting, riveting, or any other suitable fastening means. It is also obvious that the hooks may be attached to the sides of the slots instead of the bottoms of the slots with minor adaptation in fabrication technique. Remarks: The inclusion of hook attachment by welding, etc instead of being formed from parent material is readily anticipated by anyone skilled in the art. Therefore, such alternative embodiments for the hook attachment is implicit in the original specification and drawings.
