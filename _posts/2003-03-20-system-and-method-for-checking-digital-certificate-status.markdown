title: System and method for checking digital certificate status
abstract: A method and system for handling digital certificate status checks are provided. Digital certificate status request data transmitted from a client system is received at a proxy system. The proxy system generates query data for the digital certificate status in response to receiving the digital certificate status request data. The query data is transmitted to a status provider system, and status data from the status provider system in response to the query data is received at the proxy system. Digital certificate status data based on the status data received is generated by the proxy system and transmitted to the client system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/365,518, filed Mar. 20, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Technical Field","This invention relates generally to the field of secure electronic messaging and in particular to checking the status of digital certificates.","2. Description of the State of the Art","Known secure messaging clients including, for example, e-mail software applications operating on desktop computer systems, maintain a data store, or at least a dedicated data storage area, for secure messaging information such as digital certificates. A digital certificate normally includes the public key of an entity as well as identity information that is bound to the public key with one or more digital signatures. In Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S\/MIME) messaging, for example, a public key is used to verify a digital signature on a received secure message and to encrypt a session key that was used to encrypt a message to be sent. In other secure messaging schemes, public keys may be used to encrypt data or messages. If a public key is not available at the messaging client when required for encryption or digital signature verification, then the digital certificate is loaded onto the messaging client before these operations can be performed.","Normally, a digital certificate is checked against a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) to determine if the digital certificate has been revoked by its issuer. This check is typically performed when a digital certificate is first received and periodically thereafter, for example, when a new CRL is received. However, CRLs tend to be relatively bulky, so that transfer of CRLs to messaging clients consumes considerable communication resources, and storage of CRLs at a messaging client occupies significant memory space. CRL-based revocation status checks are also processor-intensive and time consuming. These effects can be particularly pronounced in messaging clients operating on wireless mobile communication devices, which operate within bandwidth-limited wireless communication networks and may have limited processing and memory resources. In addition, revocation status is updated in CRL-based systems only when a new CRL is distributed.","One alternative scheme for digital certificate revocation status checking involves querying remote systems that maintain digital certificate revocation status information. This type of scheme requires transfer of less information, reduces the complexity of operations that are performed at a messaging client to check the revocation status of a digital certificate, and may also provide more timely digital certificate revocation status information relative to CRL-based schemes. The Online Certification Status Protocol (OCSP) is an illustrative example of such a scheme. However, wireless communication system bandwidth limitations and latency render these known schemes inappropriate for secure messaging clients operating on wireless mobile communication devices.","According to an aspect of the invention, a system for determining a status of a digital certificate from status data stored in a status-provider system comprises a client system comprising a client module, the client module operable to generate and provide status request data corresponding to a status request for the digital certificate for transmission from the client system, and to receive digital certificate status data for the digital certificate in response to the status request, and a proxy system comprising a proxy module, the proxy module operable to receive the status request data transmitted from the client system and, in response thereto, generate query data for the digital certificate status and provide the query data for transmission from the proxy system to the status provider system, and further operable to receive the status data from the status provider system, generate the digital certificate status data based on the status data received, and provide the digital certificate status data for transmission to the client system.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a system for handling digital certificate status check services for a client system comprises a proxy system comprising a proxy module operable to receive from the client system first digital certificate status check service request data for a digital certificate and, in response thereto, to generate second digital certificate status check service request data and to provide the second digital certificate status check service request data for transmission to a digital certificate status check service provider system, and further operable to receive first digital certificate status check service data from the digital certificate status check service provider system, to generate second digital certificate status check service data based on the first digital certificate status check service data received, and to provide the second digital certificate status check service data for transmission to the client system, wherein the second digital certificate status check service data comprises a subset of the first digital certificate status check service data received from the service provider system.","A system for handling digital certificate status check services for a digital certificate, the digital certificate status check services provided by a digital certificate status check service provider system operable to receive query data for a digital certificate status check service request, in another embodiment of the invention, comprises a client system comprising a client module operable to prepare and provide for transmission first digital certificate status check service request data corresponding to a digital certificate status check service for a digital certificate, and to receive first digital certificate status check service data in response to the first digital certificate status check service request data, wherein the first digital certificate status check service request data comprises a subset of the query data for a digital certificate status check service request.","A method for handling digital certificate status check services for. a digital certificate, the digital certificate status check services provided by a digital certificate status check service provider system operable to receive query data for a digital certificate status check service request, according to a further aspect of the invention comprises the steps of receiving a data item, determining whether the data item comprises a digital certificate, generating digital certificate status check service request data comprising a subset of the query data where the data item comprises a digital certificate, providing the digital certificate status check service request data for transmission to a proxy system, and receiving digital certificate status check service data from the proxy system in response to the digital certificate status check service request data.","In a still further embodiment of the invention, a method for handling digital certificate status requests between a client system and a proxy system comprises the steps of receiving at the proxy system digital certificate status request data transmitted from the client system, generating query data for the digital certificate status in response to receiving the digital certificate status request data, transmitting the query data to a status provider system, receiving at the proxy system status data from the status provider system in response to the query data, generating digital certificate status data based on the status data received, and transmitting the digital certificate status data to the client system.","A secure message is a message that has been processed by a message sender, or possibly an intermediate system between a message sender and a message receiver, to ensure one or more of data confidentiality, data integrity and user authentication. Common techniques for secure messaging include signing a message with a digital signature and\/or encrypting a message. For example, a secure message may be a message that has been signed, encrypted, encrypted and then signed, or signed and then encrypted, according to variants of Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S\/MIME).","A messaging client allows a system on which it operates to receive and possibly also send messages. Messaging clients may operate on a computer system, a handheld device, or any other system or device with communications capabilities. Many messaging clients also have additional non-messaging functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","16","20","22"]},"An exemplary mobile device  is the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,278,442, entitled \u201cHAND-HELD ELECTRONIC DEVICE WITH A KEYBOARD OPTIMIZED FOR USE WITH THE THUMBS,\u201d the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The computer system  is a desktop or laptop PC, which is configured to communicate to the WAN . WAN  may be a large network, such as the Internet, for example. PCs, such as computer system , normally access the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), Application Service Provider (ASP), or the like.","The corporate LAN  is illustratively a network-based messaging client, located behind a security firewall . Within the corporate LAN , a message server , operating on a computer behind the firewall , functions as the primary interface for the corporation to exchange messages both within the LAN , and with other external messaging clients via the WAN . Two exemplary message servers  are Microsoft\u2122 Exchange Server and Lotus Domino\u2122. These servers are often used in conjunction with Internet mail routers to route and deliver mail. The message server  may also provide additional functionality, such as dynamic database storage for data related to calendars, to-do lists, task lists, e-mail and documentation.","The message server  provides messaging capabilities to networked computer systems  coupled to the LAN . A typical LAN  includes multiple computer systems , each of which implements a messaging client, such as Microsoft Outlook\u2122, Lotus Notes\u2122, etc. Within the LAN , messages are received by the message server , distributed to the appropriate mailboxes for user accounts addressed in the received messages, and are then accessed by a user through a messaging client operating on a computer system .","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface to a Wireless network , through which messages are exchanged with the mobile device . The mobile device  may, for example, comprise a data communication device, a voice communication device, a dual-mode communication device such as a mobile telephone having both data and voice communications functionality, a personal digital assistant (PDA) enabled for wireless communications, or a wireless modem operating in conjunction with a laptop or desktop computer system or some other device. An exemplary mobile device  is previously described, and as described further with reference to .","Such functions as addressing of the mobile device , encoding or otherwise transforming messages for wireless transmission, and any other required interface functions may be performed by the wireless network gateway . The wireless network gateway  may be configured to operate with more than one wireless network , in which case the wireless network gateway  also determines a most likely network for locating a given mobile device user and possibly tracks mobile devices as users roam between countries or networks.","Any computer system with access to the WAN  may exchange messages with the mobile device  through the wireless network gateway . Alternatively, private wireless network gateways such as wireless Virtual Private Network (VPN) routers could also be implemented to provide a private interface to a wireless network. For example, a wireless VPN implemented in the LAN  may provide a private interface from the LAN  to one or more wireless mobile devices such as  through the wireless network . Such a private interface to wireless mobile devices via the wireless network gateway  and\/or the wireless network  is effectively extended to entities outside the LAN  by providing a message forwarding or redirection system that operates with the message server . In this type of system, incoming messages received by the message server  and addressed to a mailbox or data store associated with a user of a mobile device such as  are sent through the wireless network interface, either a wireless VPN router, the wireless network gateway , or another interface, for example, to the wireless network  and to the users mobile device . Another exemplary redirector system operating on the message server  may be of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,219,694, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PUSHING INFORMATION FROM A HOST SYSTEM TO A MOBILE DATA COMMUNICATION DEVICE HAVING A SHARED ELECTRONIC ADDRESS,\u201d the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Another alternate interface to a user's mailbox on a message server  is a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway. Through a WAP gateway, a list of messages in a user's mailbox on the message server , and possibly each message or a portion of each message, may be sent to the mobile device .","A wireless network normally delivers messages to and from mobile devices via RF transmissions between base stations in the wireless network and the mobile devices. The wireless network  may, for example, be a data-centric wireless network, a voice-centric wireless network, or a dual-mode network that can support both voice and data communications over the same infrastructure. Illustrative wireless networks include the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, the Groupe Special Mobile or the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and third-generation (3G) networks such as the Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS). GPRS is a data-centric that is a data overlay on top of the existing GSM wireless network.","Some older examples of data-centric network include, but are not limited to: the Mobitex\u2122 Radio Network (\u201cMobitex\u201d), and the DataTAC\u2122 Radio Network (\u201cDataTAC\u201d). Examples of voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like CDMA, GSM, and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems that have been available for several years.","Perhaps the most common type of messaging currently in use is e-mail. In a standard e-mail system, an e-mail message is sent by an e-mail sender, possibly through a message server and\/or a service provider system, and typically routed through the Internet to one or more message receivers. E-mail messages are normally sent in the clear and use traditional Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), RFC822 headers and MIME body parts to define the format of the e-mail message.","In recent years, secure messaging techniques have evolved to protect both the content and integrity of messages such as e-mail messages. S\/MIME and Pretty Good Privacy\u2122 (PGP\u2122) are two public key secure e-mail messaging protocols that provide for both encryption and signing, which protects the integrity of a message and provides for sender authentication by a message receiver. Secure messages may also be encoded, compressed or otherwise processed in addition to being encrypted and\/or signed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","32","34","32","36","38","36","37","39","32"]},"The e-mail sender  is a PC, such as the system  in , a network-connected computer, such as the computer system  or , or another mobile device on which an e-mail message A is composed and sent. The WAN , the wireless gateway , the wireless network , and the mobile device  are substantially the same as similarly labelled components in .","According to secure messaging schemes such as S\/MIME and PGP, a message is encrypted using a one-time session key chosen by the e-mail sender . The session key is used to encrypt the message body and is then itself encrypted using the public key of each addressed message receiver to which the message is to be sent. As shown at , a message encrypted in this way includes an encrypted message body  and an encrypted session key . In this type of message encryption scheme, a message sender such as the e-mail sender  must have access to the public key of each entity to which an encrypted message is to be sent.","According to one known digital signature scheme, the secure e-mail sender  signs a message by taking a digest of the message and signing the digest using the sender's private key. A digest may, for example, be generated by performing a check-sum, Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) or some other preferably non-reversible operation such as a hash on the message. This digest is then signed by the sender using the sender's private key. The private key may be used to perform an encryption or other transformation operation on the digest to generate the digest signature. A digital signature including the digest and the digest signature is then appended to the outgoing message. In addition, a digital certificate of the sender , which includes the sender's public key and sender identity information that is bound to the public key with one or more digital signatures, and possibly any chained digital certificates and CRLs associated with the sender's digital certificate and any chained digital certificates, may also be attached to a secure message.","The secure e-mail message  sent by the e-mail sender  includes the digital signature , as well as the encrypted message body  and the encrypted session key , both of which are signed. The sender's digital certificate, any chained digital certificates, and one or more CRLs may also be included in the message . In the S\/MIME secure messaging technique, digital certificates, CRLs and digital signatures are normally placed at the beginning of a message, and the message body is included in a file attachment. Messages generated by other secure messaging schemes may place message components in a different order than shown or include additional and\/or different components. For example, a secure message  may include addressing information, such as \u201cTo:\u201d and \u201cFrom:\u201d e-mail addresses, and other header information.","When the secure e-mail message  is sent from the e-mail sender , it is routed through the WAN  and the wireless gateway  to the wireless network  and the mobile device . The transmission path between the e-mail sender  and the mobile device  may also include additional or different components than those shown in . For example, the secure e-mail message  may be addressed to a mailbox or data store associated with a message server or data server which has been wirelessly enabled to forward or send received messages and data to the mobile device . Further intermediate systems may also store and\/or route the secure message to the mobile device . The exemplary redirection system as previously described and as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,219,694 is an example of one such system.","In addition, the message may be routed or forwarded to the mobile device  through other transport mechanisms than the wireless gateway . For example, routing to the wireless network  may be accomplished using a wireless VPN router associated with the e-mail sender , or, in the case of a message being received at an intermediate computer system or server and then forwarded to the mobile device , with the intermediate computer system or server.","Regardless of whether a signed message is sent directly to the mobile device  or redirected to the mobile device , when a signed message is received, the mobile device  may verify the digital signature  by generating a digest of the message body  and encrypted session key , extracting the digest from the digital signature , comparing the generated digest with the digest extracted from the digital signature , and verifying the digest signature in the digital signature . The digest algorithm used by a secure message receiver is the same as the algorithm used by the message sender, and may be specified, for example, in a message header or possibly in the digital signature . One commonly used digest algorithm is the so-called Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA1), although other digest algorithms such as Message-Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) may also be used.","In order to verify the digest signature , a message receiver retrieves the sender's public key and verifies the signature on the digest in the digital signature  by performing a reverse transformation on the digest signature. For example, if the message sender generated the digest signature by encrypting the digest using the sender's private key, then a receiver uses the sender's public key to decrypt the digest signature to recover the original digest. If a secure message includes the sender's digital certificate or the sender's digital certificate has already been stored in a data store at the mobile device , then the sender's public key is extracted from the received or stored digital certificate. The sender's public key may instead be retrieved from a local store if the public key was extracted from an earlier message from the sender and stored in a key store in the receiver's local store. Alternatively, the sender's digital certificate may be requested from a Public Key Server (PKS). A PKS is a server that is normally associated with a Certificate Authority (CA) from which a digital certificate for an entity, including the entity's public key, is available. A PKS might reside within a corporate LAN such as  (), or anywhere on the WAN , Internet or other network or system through which message receivers may establish communications with the PKS. A sender's digital certificate may also possibly be loaded onto a mobile device  from a PC or other computer system.","A digest algorithm is preferably a non-reversible function that produces a unique output for every unique input. Therefore, if an original message is changed or corrupted, then the digest generated by the receiver will be different from the digest extracted from the digital signature, and signature verification therefore fails. Because digest algorithms are publicly known, however, it is possible that an entity may alter a secure message, generate a new digest of the altered message, and forward the altered message to any addressed message receivers. In this case, the digest generated at the receiver on the basis of the altered message will match the new digest that was added by the entity that altered the message. The digest signature check is intended to prevent verification of a digital signature in such a situation. Even though the generated and new digests will match, since a sender signs the original digest using its own private key, the entity that altered the message cannot generate a new digest signature that can be verified with the sender's public key. Therefore, although the digests in the altered message match, the digital signature will not be verified since the digest signature verification will fail.","These mathematical operations do not prevent anyone from seeing the contents of the secure message, but do ensure the message has not been tampered with since it was signed by the sender, and that the message was signed by the person as indicated on the \u2018From\u2019 field of the message.","It should also be appreciated that other digital signature generation and verification algorithms may instead be used. The digest and reverse transform scheme described above is one example of a digital signature scheme. The present invention is in no way limited thereto.","When the digital signature  has been verified, or sometimes even if digital signature verification fails, the encrypted message body  is then decrypted before it is displayed or further processed by a receiving messaging client operating on the mobile device  in . A receiving messaging client uses its private key to decrypt the encrypted session key  and then uses the decrypted session key to decrypt the encrypted message body  and thereby recover the original message.","An encrypted message that is addressed to more than one receiver includes an encrypted version of the session key, for each receiver, that is encrypted using the public key of the receiver. Each receiver performs the same digital signature verification operations, but decrypts a different one of the encrypted session keys using its own private key.","Therefore, in a secure messaging system, a sending messaging client must have access to the public key of any receiver to which an encrypted message is to be sent. A receiving messaging client must be able to retrieve the sender's public key, which may be available to a messaging client through various mechanisms, in order to verify a digital signature in a signed message. Although the mobile device  is a receiver of the secure message , the mobile device  may be enabled for two-way communications, and may therefore require public keys for both message sending and message receiving operations.","Public keys are commonly provided in digital certificates. As described above, a digital certificate for any particular entity typically includes the entity's public key and identification information that is bound to the public key with a digital signature. Several types of digital certificates are currently in widespread use, including, for example, X.509 digital certificates, which are typically used in S\/MIME. PGP uses digital certificates with a slightly different format. The systems and methods as disclosed herein may be used with any of these types of digital certificates, as well as other types of digital certificates, both currently known types as well as others that are developed in the future.","The digital signature in a digital certificate is generated by the issuer of the digital certificate, and can be checked by a message receiver. A digital certificate sometimes includes an expiry time or validity period from which a messaging client determines if the digital certificate has expired. Verification of the validity of a digital certificate may also involve tracing a certification path through a digital certificate chain, which includes a user's digital certificate as well as possibly other digital certificates to verify that the user's digital certificate is authentic.","A digital certificate may also be checked to ensure that it has not been revoked. As described above, digital certificate revocation status may be checked by consulting a CRL or by requesting digital certificate status information from a digital certificate revocation status information source. In the system of , a user of the mobile device  may submit a revocation status request for any digital certificate stored at the mobile device  to the revocation status information provider . The provider  then returns revocation status information for that digital certificate to the mobile device .","OCSP is one scheme that provides for determination of digital certificate revocation status without requiring CRLs. Versions of OCSP have been defined, for example, in RFC 2560 and in the Internet-Draft \u201cOnline Digital Certificate Status Protocol, version 2\u201d, both available from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). OCSP is one of the most widely used digital certificate revocation status check protocols and is therefore used herein as an illustrative example of such schemes. The systems and methods described herein, however, are also applicable to other types of digital certificate revocation status checking schemes involving retrieval of revocation status information from remote sources.","According to OCSP, a request is submitted to a status information provider, generally referred to as an OCSP responder. Upon receipt of a properly formatted request, an OCSP responder returns a response to the requestor. An OCSP request includes at least an OCSP protocol version number, a service request, and an identification of a target digital certificate to which the request is related.","The version number identifies the version of OCSP with which the request complies. The service request specifies the type of service being requested. For OCSP version 2, Online Revocation Status (ORS), Delegated Path Validation (DPV) and Delegated Path Discovery (DPD) services have been defined. Through the ORS service, a messaging client obtains revocation status information for digital certificates. The DPV and DPD services effectively delegate digital certificate validation path-related processing to a remote system.","Normally, a target digital certificate is identified in an OCSP request using a hash of the distinguished name (DN) of the issuer of the digital certificate, as well as the serial number of the digital certificate. However, since multiple digital certificate issuers may use the same DN, further identification information, in the form of a hash of the issuer's public key, is also included in the request. Therefore, target digital certificate information in an OCSP request includes a hash algorithm identifier, a hash of the DN of the digital certificate issuer generated using the hash algorithm, a hash of the issuer's public key, also generated using the hash algorithm, and the serial number of the target digital certificate.","The request may or may not be signed by a requestor. Further optional information may also be included in a request and processed by an OCSP responder.","When a messaging client is operating on a mobile device , OCSP may be desirable in that it reduces the processing and memory resources necessary to check revocation status of a digital certificate relative to CRL-based revocation status checking. However, OCSP requests can be relatively long and thereby consume the typically limited wireless communication resources and power available on a mobile device. The proxy system , in conjunction with an appropriately enabled mobile device , is used to optimize OCSP and similar protocols involving remote systems for mobile devices, as described in further detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["38","52","60","62","64","66","52","54","56","58","38","56","58","52","38","52"]},"The memory  is illustratively a writeable store such as a RAM into which other device components may write data. The digital certificate store  is a storage area dedicated to storage of digital certificates on the mobile device . Digital certificates may be stored in the digital certificate store  in the format in which they are received, or may alternatively be parsed or otherwise translated into a storage format before being written to the store .","The messaging system  is connected to the wireless transceiver  and is thus enabled for communications via the wireless network . The messaging system , in most implementations, is a messaging client embodied in a software application.","The proxy system client module , which is also preferably implemented as a software application or component, is coupled to the messaging system , the wireless transceiver , the digital certificate store , and the UI . Revocation status for any of the digital certificates stored in the digital certificate store , as well as digital. certificates received by the messaging system  but not yet stored in the digital certificate store , may be checked using the proxy system client module , as described in detail below.","The UI  may include such UI components as a keyboard or keypad, a display, or other components which accept inputs from or provide outputs to a user of the mobile device . Although shown as a single block in , a mobile device typically includes more than one UI, and the UI  therefore represents one or more user interfaces.","The wireless network , wireless gateway , WAN  and revocation status information provider  are the same as similarly-labelled components in .","The proxy system  includes a proxy system service module  and a status provider client module . The proxy system  illustratively comprises one or more computers connected to the WAN  and operable to receive an encryption item status request from mobile device , or some other client system, and perform the status request and attendant processing steps on behalf of the mobile device . In one embodiment, the proxy system  is an intermediate computer that performs the status request on behalf of the mobile device . The intermediate computer may be further operable to provide the address of the mobile device with the status request. In another embodiment, the proxy system  comprises a proxy server that is also operable to perform proxy server functions, such as providing security, administrative control, and caching, in addition to performing the status request on behalf of the mobile device .","The proxy system service module  is configured to exchange information with the proxy system client module , and the status provider client module  is adapted to exchange information with the revocation status provider . Each of these components, the status provider client module  and the proxy system service module  is preferably a software application or module operating at the proxy system . These software applications may be embodied in a single computer program, or may alternatively be separate programs executed independently.","In operation, the messaging system  on the mobile device  receives and possibly sends secure messages via the wireless network  as described above. When a signature on a received secure message is to be verified or a message is to be sent with an encrypted session key, the messaging system  may retrieve a public key for an entity (i.e., a sender of a received message or a recipient of a message to be sent) from a digital certificate. Before the public key is used, however, the messaging system  or a user thereof may wish to check that the digital certificate containing the public key is valid and has not been revoked.","Digital certificate verification operations may be performed automatically, when a digital certificate is received with a secure message, or at predetermined or user-configurable intervals, for example, or when invoked by a user through a UI .","Different types of digital certificate checking operations may also be dependent upon different controls. For example, the validity and revocation status of a digital certificate may be checked automatically when the digital certificate is first loaded onto the mobile device . If the digital certificate is valid and not revoked, then it may be assumed to be valid until an expiry time or during a validity period specified in the digital certificate, whereas its revocation status may thereafter be checked once every week to ensure that it is not revoked before it expires.","As described above, digital certificate status information requests to a remote information provider such as  may be relatively long and are therefore not optimal for implementation in a mobile device  or other bandwidth-limited communication systems. The proxy system client and service modules  and  are adapted to reduce the amount of information that is sent from the mobile device  to request status information for a digital certificate.","When a user of the mobile device  wishes to check the revocation status of a digital certificate, the proxy system client module , or possibly a software application which operates in conjunction with the proxy system client module , is invoked by entering an appropriate command on a UI , such as a keyboard, for example. The user also specifies the particular digital certificate to be checked, for instance using the serial number or subject name of the digital certificate. Alternatively, the proxy system client module  accesses the digital certificate store  to display to the user a list of currently stored digital certificates, from which the user selects one or more digital certificates to be checked.","The proxy system client module  then preferably either extracts from the selected digital certificate(s) or-obtains from the user through a UI  any information required by the proxy system service module  for a digital certificate revocation status check. Since the proxy system  provides an interface between the mobile device  and the status information provider , requests and responses between the proxy system client module  and proxy system service module  need not conform to the protocol used between the status provider client module  and the status information provider . Therefore, although the status provider  and status provider client module  may support OCSP or a similar protocol, the proxy system service module  and proxy system client module  preferably support a more wireless-friendly protocol involving less data exchange, such as smaller requests.","The particular information extracted or obtained by the proxy system client module  is dependent upon the communication protocol implemented between the proxy system client module  and the proxy system service module . The proxy system client module  preferably extracts a digital certificate subject name, serial number, issuer name, and other digital certificate information from a digital certificate stored in the digital certificate store . If digital certificates are first parsed so that parsed data is stored in the digital certificate store , then such information is extracted from the parsed data in the digital certificate store  by the proxy system client module . If further information is required, a user is prompted to enter the information.","When all required information has been extracted or otherwise obtained by the proxy system client module , a request is formatted and sent to the proxy system service module . The content of this request is also dependent upon the communication protocol used between the proxy system service module  and client module . If more than one type of service is supported, then the request may specify which type of service is requested. In some implementations, only a single service may be supported, such that no service type need be specified.","Information received by the proxy system service module  is preferably passed to the status provider client module . This information is then used by the status provider client module  to format a request for the status information provider . If the revocation status information provider  and status provider client module  support OCSP, for example, information provided by the proxy system service module , as well as any further required information, are formatted into an OCSP request. In some cases, the information provided by the proxy system service module  includes all required information, whereas in other cases, further information is extracted from other sources. For example, where the proxy system  is configured to store a mapping table or like element which maintains a correspondence between digital certificate issuers and serial numbers and\/or subject names, then the status provider client module  may format a status request for the correct revocation status information provider  based on only a serial number or subject name received by the proxy system service module  from the proxy system client module .","In , it is assumed that the revocation status information provider  supports an ORS or like service. Upon receiving a request, the revocation status information provider , which is an OCSP responder when the provider  and the client module  support OCSP, checks the request to ensure that it is formatted properly, that the requested service is a service that it is configured to provide, and that the request includes all of the information required for the requested service. If these conditions are not met, then the provider  returns an error message to the client module . The client module  then performs error processing to provide any missing required information and possibly to request missing information from the mobile device  through the proxy system service module , or returns an error message to the proxy system service module , which then formats and sends an error message to the proxy system client module  as a response to its initial service request. Other conditions, such as when a provider  receives an unsigned request but is configured to expect signed requests, or when a provider service is unable to respond, may also result in an error message being returned to the provider client module .","If the request meets required conditions, then a definitive response is returned to the provider client module . A definitive response may include one of a plurality of status indications, such as a \u201cvalid\u201d or like indication when a target digital certificate has not been revoked, a \u201crevoked\u201d indication when the target digital certificate has been revoked, or an \u201cunknown\u201d indication if the status provider  has no record or knowledge of the target digital certificate.","Furthermore, the proxy system client module  may also be operable to classify the digital certificate as \u201cpending\u201d when awaiting the status of the digital certificate after sending a request. The status of the digital certificate is then changed from pending to one of valid, revoked, or unknown after the proxy system client module  receives the corresponding status indication from the proxy system . The proxy system client module  may also be configured to prompt a user via an I\/O device on the mobile device  to confirm an action to be executed on a data item if the data item includes a digital signature with a status of pending, revoked, or unknown.","A response returned to the status provider client module  by the status information provider  is passed to the proxy system service module , which prepares and sends a response to the proxy system client module . When the response from the provider  is signed and the proxy system client module  or another component on the mobile device  is configured to verify status response signatures, then the entire response from the status provider , or possibly the signed portions thereof, are preferably forwarded to the proxy system client module  substantially unchanged. However, if the proxy system service module  or the status provider client module  checks status response signatures on behalf of the mobile device , then only certain parts of the response, for example, the status indication and the digital certificate serial number or subject name, are preferably extracted by the proxy system service module  and formatted into a response that is then sent to the proxy system client module . The response from the proxy system service module  is then processed by the proxy system client module  to determine whether the digital certificate has been revoked.","The presence of a proxy system client module  preferably does not preclude digital certificate validity and revocation status checks according to known techniques. Thus, digital certificate status checks involving remote systems such as the status information provider  are complementary to other status check operations for which the mobile device  are enabled.","While the embodiment of  depicts the wireless gateway , the proxy system , and the revocation status provider  as separate systems communication over the WAN , these systems may be combined. For example, in an alternative embodiment, a software application comprising the proxy system service module  and the status provider client module  is stored and executed on the wireless gateway .","In yet another embodiment, the software application comprising the proxy system service module  and the status provider client module  is stored and executed on the revocation status provider .

Of course, other configurations and communication paths for computer systems distributed throughout one or more networks that enable the functionality of the client\/proxy digital certificate status system as disclosed herein may also be used.","In another alternative embodiment, the wireless gateway  is operable to determine if a data item, such as an S\/MIME message to be transmitted to the mobile device , is signed with a digital signature or includes a digital certificate. If so, then the wireless gateway  pre-emptively queries the revocation status provider  to obtain the digital certificate status for the signer of the S\/MIME message.","The digital certificate status is preferably obtained before the S\/MIME message is transmitted to the mobile device , in which case the S\/MIME message is stored at the wireless gateway . The wireless gateway  may be further operable to discard the S\/MIME message if the digital certificate is not valid or expired, or alternatively may transmit the S\/MIME message to the mobile device  with a notification that the digital certificate status is not valid or is expired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["80","82","84","86"]},"If the request does not satisfy these conditions, then an error message is returned to the proxy system at step .

The transceiver  includes transmit and receive antennas , , a receiver (Rx) , a transmitter (Tx) , one or more local oscillators (LOs) , and a digital signal processor (DSP) . Within the Flash memory , the mobile device  includes a plurality of software modules A-N that can be executed by the microprocessor  (and\/or the DSP ), including a voice communication module A, a data communication module B, and a plurality of other operational modules N for carrying out a plurality of other functions.","The mobile device  is preferably a two-way communication device having voice and data communication capabilities. Thus, for example, the mobile device  may communicate over a voice network, such as any of the analog or digital cellular networks, and may also communicate over a data network. The voice and data networks are depicted in  by the communication tower . These voice and data networks may be separate communication networks using separate infrastructure, such as base stations, network controllers, etc., or they may be integrated into a single wireless network. References to the network  should therefore be interpreted as encompassing both a single voice and data network and separate networks.","The communication subsystem  is used to communicate with the network . The DSP  is used to send and receive communication signals to and from the transmitter  and receiver , and may also exchange control information with the transmitter  and receiver . If the voice and data communications occur at a single frequency, or closely-spaced set of frequencies, then a single LO  may be used in conjunction with the transmitter  and receiver . Alternatively, if different frequencies are utilized for voice communications versus data communications, then a plurality of LOs  can be used to generate a plurality of frequencies corresponding to the network . Although two antennas ,  are depicted in , the mobile device  could be used with a single antenna structure. Information, which includes both voice and data information, is communicated to and from the communication module  via a link between the DSP  and the microprocessor .","The detailed design of the communication subsystem , such as frequency band, component selection, power level, etc., will be dependent upon the communication network  in which the mobile device  is intended to operate. For example, a mobile device  intended to operate in a North American market may include a communication subsystem  designed to operate with the Mobitex or DataTAC mobile data communication networks and also designed to operated with any of a variety of voice communication networks, such as AMPS, TDMA, CDMA, PCS, etc., whereas a mobile device  intended for use in Europe may be configured to operate with the GPRS data communication network and the GSM voice communication network. Other types of data and voice networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized with the mobile device .","Depending upon the type of network , the access requirements for the mobile device  may also vary. For example, in the Mobitex and DataTAC data networks, mobile devices are registered on the network using a unique identification number associated with each device. In GPRS data networks, however, network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device . A GPRS device typically requires a subscriber identity module (\u201cSIM\u201d), which is required in order to operate the mobile device  on a GPRS network. Local or non-network communication functions (if any) may be operable, without the SIM, but the mobile device  will be unable to carry out any functions involving communications over the network , other than any legally required operations, such as \u2018911\u2019 emergency calling.","After any required network registration or activation procedures have been completed, the mobile device  may send and receive communication signals, preferably including both voice and data signals, over the network . Signals received by the antenna  from the communication network  are routed to the receiver , which provides for such operations as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog to digital conversion. Analog to digital conversion of the received signal allows more complex communication functions, such as digital demodulation and decoding to be performed using the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network  are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP  and are then provided to the transmitter  for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network  via the antenna . Although a single transceiver  is shown in  for both voice and data communications, it is possible that the mobile device  may include two distinct transceivers, a first transceiver for transmitting and receiving voice signals, and a second transceiver for transmitting and receiving data signals. Multiple transceiver may also be provided in a mobile device adapted to operate within more than one communication network or multiple frequency bands.","In addition to processing the communication signals, the DSP  also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gain levels applied to communication signals in the receiver  and transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP . Other transceiver control algorithms could also be implemented in the DSP  in order to provide more sophisticated control of the transceiver .","The microprocessor  preferably manages and controls the overall operation of the mobile device ; Many types of microprocessors or microcontrollers could be used here, or, alternatively, a single DSP  could be used to carry out the functions of the microprocessor . Low-level communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through the DSP  in the transceiver . Other, high-level communication applications, such as a voice communication application A, and a data communication application B are stored in the Flash memory  for execution by the microprocessor . For example, the voice communication module A may provide a high-level user interface operable to transmit and receive voice calls between the mobile device  and a plurality of other voice devices via the network . Similarly, the data communication module B may provide a high-level user interface operable for sending and receiving data, such as e-mail messages, files, organizer information, short text messages, etc., between the mobile device  and a plurality of other data devices via the network . On the mobile device , a secure messaging software application, incorporating software modules corresponding to the messaging system  and the proxy system client module  or client modules  and , for example, may operate in conjunction with the data communication module B in order to implement the techniques described above.","The microprocessor  also interacts with other device subsystems, such as the display , the Flash memory , the RAM , the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , the serial port , the keyboard , the speaker , the microphone , the short-range communications subsystem , and any of the other device subsystems generally designated as . For example, the modules A-N are executed by the microprocessor  and may provide a high-level interface between a user and the mobile device . This interface typically includes a graphical component provided through the display , and an input\/output component provided through the auxiliary VO , the keyboard , the speaker , or the microphone . Such interfaces are designated generally as UI  in .","Some of the subsystems- shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. Notably, some subsystems, such as the keyboard  and the display  are used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a data communication network, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list or other PDA type functions.","Operating system software used by the microprocessor  is preferably stored in a non-volatile store such as Flash memory . In addition to the operating system and communication modules A-N, the Flash memory  may also include a file system for storing data. A storage area is also preferably provided in the Flash memory  to store digital certificates, address book entries and possibly other information required for messaging, shown as data stores ,  and  in . The operating system, specific device applications or modules, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as RAM  for faster operation. Moreover, received communication signals may also be temporarily stored to RAM , before permanently writing them to a file system located in the Flash memory .","An exemplary application module N that may be loaded onto the mobile device  is a personal information manager (PIM) application providing PDA functionality, such as calendar events, appointments, and task items. This module N may also interact with the voice communication module A for managing phone calls, voice mails, etc., and may also interact with the data communication module B for managing e-mail communications and other data transmissions. Alternatively, all of the functionality of the voice communication module A and the data communication module B may be integrated into the PIM module.","The Flash memory  preferably provides a file system to facilitate storage of PIM data items on the device. The PIM application preferably includes the ability to send and receive data items, either by itself, or in conjunction with the voice and data communication modules A, B, via the wireless network . The PIM data items are preferably seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated, via the wireless network , with a corresponding set of data items stored or associated with a host computer system, thereby creating a mirrored system for data items associated with a particular user.","Although shown as a Flash memory , those skilled in the art will appreciate that other types of non-volatile store, such as a battery backed-up RAM, for example, could be used in addition to or instead of the Flash memory .","The mobile device  may also be manually synchronized with a computer system by placing the mobile device  in an interface cradle, which couples the serial port  of the mobile device  to the serial port of the computer system. The serial port  may also be used to enable a user to set preferences through an external device or software application, to download other application modules N for installation, and possibly to load digital certificates onto a mobile device. This wired download path may further be used to load an encryption key onto the device, which is a more secure method than exchanging encryption information via the wireless network .","Additional application modules N may be loaded onto the mobile device  through the network , through an auxiliary I\/O subsystem , through the serial port , through the short-range communications subsystem , or through any other suitable subsystem , and installed by a user in the Flash memory  or RAM . Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","When the mobile device  is operating in a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or a web page download, is processed by the transceiver  and provided to the microprocessor , which preferably further processes the received signal for output to the display , or, alternatively, to an auxiliary I\/O device . A digital certificate received by the transceiver , in response to a request to a PKS or attached to a secure message, for example, may be added to a digital certificate store in the Flash memory  if it has not already been stored. Validity and\/or revocation status of such a digital certificate may also be checked as described above. A user of mobile device  may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using the keyboard , which is preferably a complete alphanumeric keyboard laid out in the QWERTY style, although other styles of complete alphanumeric keyboards such as the known DVORAK style may also be used. User input to the mobile device  is further enhanced with a plurality of auxiliary I\/O devices , which may include a thumbwheel input device, a touchpad, a variety of switches, a rocker input switch, etc. The composed data items input by the user may then be transmitted over the communication network  via the transceiver .","When the mobile device  is operating in a voice communication mode, the overall operation of the mobile device  is substantially similar to the data mode, except that received signals are preferably output to the speaker  and voice signals for transmission are generated by a microphone . In addition, the secure messaging techniques described above might not necessarily be applied to voice communications. Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is preferably accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. For example, the microprocessor , in conjunction with the voice communication module A and the operating system software, may detect the caller identification information of an incoming voice call and display it on the display .","The short-range communications subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a short-range wireless communication module such as a Bluetooth\u2122 module or an 802.11 module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.

For example, if one digital certificate in a chain of digital certificates is found to be invalid by the status provider program , then the proxy system program  may select only an invalid status indicator to be transmitted to the client system. Alternatively, the proxy system program  may select an invalid status indicator to be transmitted to the client system and also data to specify which digital certificate in a digital certificate chain is invalid.

The wireless connector system  may instead employ a \u201cpull\u201d technique, in which items stored in a mailbox  are sent to a mobile device  or  responsive to a request or access operation made using the mobile device, or some combination of both techniques.","The use of a wireless connector  thereby-enables a messaging system including a message server  to be extended so that each user's mobile device ,  has access to stored messages of the message server . Although the systems and methods described herein are not restricted solely to a push-based technique, a more detailed description of push-based messaging may be found in the United States Patent and incorporated by reference above. This push technique uses a wireless friendly encoding, compression and encryption technique to deliver all information to a mobile device, thus effectively extending the company firewall  to include the mobile devices  and .","As shown in , there are several paths for exchanging information with a mobile device ,  from the corporate LAN . One possible information transfer path is through the physical connection  such as a serial port, using an interface or connector . This path is useful for example for bulk information updates often performed at initialization of a mobile device ,  or periodically when a user of a mobile device ,  is working at a computer system in the LAN , such as the computer system . For example, as described above, PIM data is commonly exchanged over a such a connection as a serial port connected to a cradle in or upon which a mobile device ,  may be placed. The physical connection  may also be used to transfer other information from a desktop computer system  to a mobile device , , including private security keys (\u201cprivate keys\u201d) such as private encryption or digital signature keys associated with the desktop computer system , or other relatively bulky information such as digital certificates and CRLs.","Private key exchange using the physical connection  and the connector or interface  allows a user's desktop computer system  and mobile device  or  to share at least one identity for accessing all encrypted and\/or signed mail. The user's desktop computer system  and mobile device  or  can also thereby share private keys so that either the host system  or the mobile device  or  can process secure messages addressed to the user's mailbox or account on the message server . The transfer of digital certificates and CRLs over such a physical connection is desirable in that they represent a large amount of the data that is required for S\/MIME, PGP and other public key security methods. A user's own digital certificate, a chain of digital certificates used to verify the user's digital certificate, and a CRL, as well as digital certificates, digital certificate chains and CRLs for other users, may be loaded onto a mobile device ,  from the user's desktop computer system . This loading of other user's digital certificates and CRLs onto a mobile device ,  allows a mobile device user to select other entities or users with whom they might be exchanging secure messages, and to pre-load the bulky information onto the mobile device through a physical connection instead of over the air, thus saving time and wireless bandwidth when a secure message is received from or to be sent to such other users, or when the status of a digital certificate is to be determined based on one or more CRLs. CRL-based status checks can also be avoided where the systems and methods described herein are employed.","In known \u201csynchronization\u201d type wireless messaging systems, a physical path has also been used to transfer messages from mailboxes  associated with a message server  to mobile devices  and .","Another method for data exchange with the mobile devices  and  is over-the-air, through the wireless connector system.  and using the wireless networks  and . As shown in , this could involve a Wireless VPN router , if available in the network , or, alternatively, a traditional WAN connection to wireless infrastructure  that provides an interface to one or more wireless networks such as . The Wireless VPN router  provides for creation of a VPN connection directly through a specific wireless network  to a wireless device . Such a Wireless VPN router  may be used in conjunction with a static addressing scheme. For example, if the wireless network  is an IP-based wireless network, then IPV6 would provide enough IP addresses to dedicate an IP address to every mobile device  configured to operate within the network  and thus make it possible to push information to a mobile device  at any time. A primary advantage of using a wireless VPN router  is that it could be an off-the-shelf VPN component which would not require wireless infrastructure . A VPN connection may use a TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP connection to deliver messages directly to and from a mobile device .","If a wireless VPN router  is not available, then a link to a WAN , normally the Internet, is a commonly used connection mechanism that may be employed by the wireless connector system . To handle the addressing of the mobile device  and any other required interface functions, wireless infrastructure  is preferably used. The wireless infrastructure  may also determine a most likely wireless network for locating a given user and track users as they roam between countries or networks. In wireless networks such as  and , messages are normally delivered to and from mobile devices via RF transmissions between base stations and the mobile devices.","A plurality of connections to wireless networks  and  may be provided, including, for example, ISDN, Frame Relay or T1 connections using the TCP\/IP protocol used throughout the Internet. The wireless networks  and  could represent distinct, unique and unrelated networks, or they could represent the same network in different countries, and may be any of different types of networks, including but not limited to, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same or similar infrastructure, such as any of those described above.","In some implementations, more than one over-the-air information exchange mechanism may be provided in the corporate LAN . In  for example, the mobile devices  and  associated with users having mailboxes  associated with user accounts on the message server  are configured to operate on different wireless networks  and . If the wireless network  supports IPv6 addressing, then the wireless VPN router  may be used by the wireless connector system  to exchange data with any mobile device  operating within the wireless network . The wireless network  may be a different type of wireless network, however, such as the Mobitex network, in which case information is instead exchanged with the mobile device  operating within the wireless network  via a connection to the WAN- and the wireless infrastructure .","Operation of the system in  will now be described using an example of an e-mail message  sent from the computer system  and addressed to at least one recipient having both an account and mailbox  or like data store associated with the message server  and a mobile device  or . However, the e-mail message  is intended for illustrative purposes only. The exchange of other types of information between the corporate LAN  is preferably also enabled by the wireless connector system .","The e-mail message , sent from the computer system  via the WAN , may be fully in the clear, or signed with a digital signature and\/or encrypted, depending upon the particular messaging scheme used. For example, if the computer system  is enabled for secure messaging using S\/MIME, then the e-mail message  may be signed, encrypted, or both.","E-mail messages such as  normally use traditional SMTP, RFC822 headers and MIME body parts to define the format of the e-mail message. These techniques are all well known to one in the art. The e-mail message  arrives at the message server , which determines into which mailboxes  the e-mail message  should be stored. As described above, a message such as the e-mail message  may include a user name, a user account, a mailbox identifier, or other type of identifier that is mapped to a particular account or associated mailbox  by the message server . For an e-mail message , recipients are typically identified using e-mail addresses corresponding to a user account and thus a mailbox .","The wireless connector system  sends or mirrors, via the wireless network  or , certain user-selected data items or parts of data items from the corporate LAN  to the user's mobile device  or , preferably upon detecting that one or more triggering events has occurred. A triggering event includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: screen saver activation at a user's networked computer system , disconnection of the user's mobile device  or  from the interface , or receipt of a command sent from a mobile device  or  to the host system to start sending one or more messages stored at the host system. Thus, the wireless connector system  may detect triggering events associated with the message server , such as receipt of a command, or with one or more networked computer systems , including the screen saver and disconnection events described above. When wireless access to corporate data for a mobile device  or  has been activated at the LAN , for example when the wireless connector system  detects the occurrence of a triggering event for a mobile device user, data items selected by the user are preferably sent to the user's mobile device. In the example of the e-mail message , assuming that a triggering event has been detected, the arrival of the message  at the message server  is detected by the wireless connector system . This may be accomplished, for example, by monitoring or querying mailboxes  associated with the message server , or, if the message server  is a Microsoft Exchange server, then the wireless connector system  may register for advise syncs provided by the Microsoft Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) to thereby receive notifications when a new message is stored to a mailbox .","When a data item such as the e-mail message  is to be sent to a mobile device  or , the wireless connector system  preferably repackages the data item in a manner that is transparent to the mobile device  or , so that information sent to and received by the mobile device  or  appears similar to the information as stored on and accessible at the host system, LAN  in . One preferred repackaging method includes wrapping received messages to be sent via a wireless network  or  in an electronic envelope that corresponds to the wireless network address of the mobile device  or  to which the message is to be sent. Alternatively, other repackaging methods could be used, such as special-purpose TCP\/IP wrapping techniques. Such repackaging preferably also results in e-mail messages sent from a mobile device  or  appearing to come from a corresponding host system account or mailbox  even though they are composed and sent from a mobile device. A user of a mobile device  or  may thereby effectively share a single e-mail address between a host system account or mailbox  and the mobile device.","Repackaging of the e-mail message  is indicated at  and . Repackaging techniques may be similar for any available transfer paths or may be dependent upon the particular transfer path, either the wireless infrastructure  or the wireless VPN router . For example, the e-mail message  is preferably compressed and encrypted, either before or after being repackaged at , to thereby provide for secure transfer to the mobile device . Compression reduces the bandwidth required to send the message, whereas encryption ensures confidentiality of any messages or other information sent to the mobile devices  and . In contrast, messages transferred via a VPN router  might only be compressed and not encrypted, since a VPN connection established by the VPN router  is inherently secure. Messages are thereby securely sent, via either encryption at the wireless connector system , which may be considered a non-standard VPN tunnel or a VPN-like connection, for example, or the VPN router , to mobile devices  and . Accessing messages using a mobile device  or  is thus no less secure than accessing mailboxes at the LAN  using the desktop computer system .","When a repackaged message  or  arrives at a mobile device  or , via the wireless infrastructure , or via the wireless VPN router , the mobile device  or  removes the outer electronic envelope from the repackaged message  or , and performs any required decompression and decryption operations. Messages sent from a mobile device  or  and addressed to one or more recipients are preferably similarly repackaged, and possibly compressed and encrypted, and sent to a host system such as the LAN . The host system may then remove the electronic envelope from the repackaged message, decrypt and decompress the message if desired, and route the message to the addressed recipients.","Another goal of using an outer envelope is to maintain at least some of the addressing information in the original e-mail message . Although the outer envelope used to route information to mobile devices ,  is addressed using a network address of one or more mobile devices, the outer envelope preferably encapsulates the entire original e-mail message , including at least one address field, possibly in compressed and\/or encrypted form. This allows original \u201cTo\u201d, \u201cFrom\u201d and \u201cCC\u201d addresses of the e-mail message  to be displayed when the outer envelope is removed and the message is displayed on a mobile device  or . The repackaging also allows reply messages to be delivered to addressed recipients, with the \u201cFrom\u201d field reflecting an address of the mobile device user's account or mailbox on the host system, when the outer envelope of a repackaged outgoing message sent from a mobile device is removed by the wireless connector system . Using the user's account or mailbox address from the mobile device  or  allows a message sent from a mobile device to appear as though the message originated from the user's mailbox  or account at the host system rather than the mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["802","804","807","808","840","811","813","815","802","804","808","820","817","819","835","835","840","840","807","813","815","842","852","811","807","842","852","846","856","848","858","844","854","842","852"]},"The wireless connector systems  and  are similar to the wireless connector system  described above, in that they enable data items, such as e-mail messages and other items that are stored in mailboxes , and possibly data items stored in a local or network data store, to be sent from the LAN  to one or more of the mobile devices  and . In  however, the network operator infrastructure  provides an interface between the mobile devices  and  and the LAN . As above, operation of the system shown in  is described below in the context of an e-mail message as an illustrative example of a data item that may be sent to a mobile device  or .","When an e-mail message , addressed to one or more recipients having an account on the message server , is received by the message server , the message, or possibly a pointer to a single copy of the message stored in a central mailbox or data store, is stored in the mailbox  of each such recipient. Once the e-mail message  or pointer has been stored to a mailbox , it may preferably be accessed using a mobile device  or . In the example shown in , the e-mail message  has been addressed to the mailboxes  associated with both desktop computer systems  and  and thus both mobile devices  and .","As those skilled in the art will appreciate, communication network protocols commonly used in wired networks such as the LAN  and\/or the WAN  are not suitable or compatible with wireless network communication protocols used within wireless networks such as . For example, communication bandwidth, protocol overhead, and network latency, which are primary concerns in wireless network communications, are less significant in wired networks, which typically have much higher capacity and speed than wireless networks. Therefore, mobile devices  and  cannot normally access the data store  directly. The network operator infrastructure  provides a bridge between the wireless network  and the LAN .","The network operator infrastructure  enables a mobile device  or  to establish a connection to the LAN  through the WAN , and may, for example, be operated by an operator of the wireless network  or a service provider that provides wireless communication service for mobile devices  and . In a pull-based system, a mobile device  or  establishes a communication session with the network operator infrastructure  using a wireless network compatible communication scheme, preferably a secure scheme such as Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) when information should remain confidential, and a wireless web browser such as a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) browser. A user then requests, through manual selection or pre-selected defaults in the software residing in the mobile device, any or all information, or just new information, for example, stored in a mailbox  in the data store  at the LAN . The network operator infrastructure  establishes a connection or session with a wireless connector system , , using Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), for example, if no session has already been established. As above, a session between the network operator infrastructure  and a wireless connector system  or  may be made via a typical WAN connection or through the VPN router  if available. When time delays between receiving a request from a mobile device  or  and delivering requested information back to the device are to be minimized, the network operator infrastructure  and the wireless connector systems  and  may be configured so that a communication connection remains open once established.","In the system of , requests originating from mobile device A  and B  would be sent to the wireless connector systems  and , respectively. Upon receiving a request for information from the network operator infrastructure , a wireless connector system  or  retrieves requested information from a data store. For the e-mail message , the wireless connector system  or  retrieves the e-mail message  from the appropriate mailbox , typically through a messaging client operating in conjunction with the computer system  or , which may access a mailbox  either via the message server  or directly. Alternatively, a wireless connector system  or  may be configured to access mailboxes  itself, directly or through the message server . Also, other data stores, both network data stores similar to the data store  and local data stores associated with each computer system  and , may be accessible to a wireless connector system  or , and thus to a mobile device  or .","If the e-mail message  is addressed to the message server accounts or mailboxes  associated with both computer systems  and  and devices  and , then the e-mail message  is sent to the network operator infrastructure  as shown at  and , which then sends a copy of the e-mail message to each mobile device  and , as indicated at  and .

When the network operator infrastructure  communicates with the wireless connector systems  and  and the mobile devices  and  via different protocols, translation operations may be performed by the network operator infrastructure . Repackaging techniques may also be used between the wireless connector systems  and  and the network operator infrastructure , and between each mobile device  and  and the network operator infrastructure .","Messages or other information to be sent from a mobile device  or  may be processed in a similar manner, with such information first being transferred from a mobile device  or  to the network operator infrastructure .
