The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to broadcast systems. More particularly, the present invention provides methods and apparatus for accessing data that is periodically transmitted by a broadcaster.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a conventional broadcasting system, a broadcaster transmits information in the form of audio, video, data, etc. over a medium such as air, cable, phone line (DSL, for example) that can be received by any number of receivers. For example, transmitted radio waves can be received with a radio receiver tuned to a particular transmission channel. Conventional broadcast communication is typically a one way communication since the receiver does not having control over the content of nor the time of the broadcast transmission.","To facilitate discussion,  illustrates a T.V broadcast system  that includes a T.V broadcaster  and a T.V receiver . The T.V receiver  can be an analog or a digital T.V receiver suitable for reception of voice, video, and data transmitted by the T.V broadcaster . In a broadcast system, data can be transmitted in a cyclical manner conceptualized in the art as a \u201cdata carousel\u201d . As used herein, a data carousel refers to a mechanism for cyclic transmission of data modules, for example, as defined by MPEG-2 Digital Storage Medium Command and control (DSM-CC of ISO\/IEC 138118-6) User-to-Network Download Protocol. To elaborate, the carrousel  illustrates cyclical transmission of data in the broadcast system . Data on the carrousel  can include data segments A, B, C, and D. Each data segment, such as data segment A, can consist of individual data files X, X, X, and X. During a typical broadcast session, the carrousel  can be visualized as rotating clockwise such that data on the carrousel  is transmitted when it reaches a transmission point . In this manner data portions A, B, C, and D are sequentially transmitted as the carrousel  rotates clockwise in such a manner that a particular data file is re-transmitted when carrousel  completes its rotation with respect to an associated point of transmission. For example, the data file X will be re-transmitted every time the associated reference point  undergoes a full rotation. In this way, each of the data files on the carrousel  is cyclically re-transmitted every T seconds, where T is the time it takes for carrousel  to make a complete rotation with respect to the point of transmission , also referred to as the carousel's period.","Unfortunately, however, due to the cyclical nature of the carrousel type broadcasting system, the T.V broadcast system  has an inherent delay associated with the re-transmission of data. To elaborate, at a time t when a vertical bar  is aligned with the point of transmission , the T.V broadcaster  will start transmitting the data file X. The transmission of data file X will complete at a subsequent time t when transmission of data file X is initiated. If the T.V receiver  requires data file X some time after transmission of data file X, the T.V receiver  must wait until file X is retransmitted which could be at most at a time T later. For example, it data file X is required by the receiver  at a time t (which for this example happens to be shortly after transmission of file X has completed) a potentially long delay will be encountered before file X is re-transmitted. This delay can be almost as long as the time T required to complete a full transmission cycle.","Thus, cyclical retransmission of data can result in long delays between the time data is requested (or needed) and the time data is received and accessed. With carrousels typically having hundreds of megabytes of data, the periodic nature of the data carrousel arrangement could potentially result in delays of up to several seconds in accessing required data. This potential delay is exacerbated in those situations where the broadcast medium include low bandwidth links, such as the Internet. Even though this delay may not be very significant in non-interactive situations, it can be especially problematic for interactive applications such as interactive T.V, such as WEB TV\u2122, where it is highly desirable to provide a user with requested information on demand.","In view of foregoing, there is a need for improved methods and apparatus to for accessing data in a real time basis in broadcast systems.","Broadly speaking, the invention relates to methods and apparatus for accessing data that is periodically transmitted by a broadcaster. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a receiver capable of reducing the delay conventionally encountered in accessing periodically transmitted data in a broadcasting system is disclosed. In one embodiment, the receiver includes a file accessing system capable of providing access to a storage medium arranged to selectively store data that is periodically transmitted by the broadcaster. In this way, because the selected periodically transmitted data is saved in the storage medium it can be accessed quickly by the receiver.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a receiver including a data accessing system and a data storage medium is disclosed. Data transmitted by the broadcasters can be stored in the data storage medium. In this way, data is readily available for access by the data accessing system, thereby reducing the delay associated with accessing periodically broadcast data in a broadcast system.","In another embodiment, the receiver includes a viewing portion suitable for displaying images such as a T.V monitor, a computer monitor, and the like. A user may interact with the receiver. For example, while watching the broadcast of a sporting event, a viewer may request specific information relating to the sporting event as it is being displayed in the viewing portion.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a data accessing system including a data access requester and a data accessor, is disclosed. In one embodiment, multiple requests to store data are processed independently by a data saver using multiple processing threads. In this manner, requests to store data can quickly be made by a data access requester and efficiently processed by a data saver. A request to store data can be dispatched as soon as the need for data is perceived, e.g. a user has activated an interactive button to request information. Alternatively, the data access requester can dispatch requests to the data saver, in anticipation of future need, e.g., when it is anticipated that a particular data file will be required for access.","A method of accessing data in a broadcast system, in accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention. A new class can be defined to represent a periodically transmitted file in a broadcast system, e.g., a carrousel file class. An instance of the new class is instantiated. Next, an instance of a data accessing object for the new class is created. In one embodiment, creating an instance of a data accessing object is achieved by instancing pre-defined data accessing operations, e.g., file input output (I\/O) operations. Thus, pre-existing data accessing operations, e.g., for accessing conventional files can be re-defined and re-used to access a new file class, e.g., a carrousel file class. Prior to accessing data, a request is made to acquire data. This request initiates a new independent process, e.g., another threat of execution, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.","The invention has numerous advantages. One advantage is that the delay time for accessing data in a broadcasting system is significantly reduced. Another advantage is that data access can be provided without requiring a receiver to know the exact location of data. Yet another advantage is that data version updates can be provided to a receiver efficiently. Still another advantage is that cost effective and simple solutions can be implemented by using familiar file access facilities.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a computer system, an apparatus, and a method. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.","The invention relates to methods, apparatus, and data structures suitable for accessing data in a broadcast system. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a receiver capable of storing periodically transmitted data is disclosed. By storing the data locally, the receiver reduces the delay conventionally encountered in accessing periodically transmitted data in a broadcasting system. In one embodiment, the receiver includes a file accessing system capable of providing access to a storage medium containing data transmitted by the broadcaster. Selected portions of the periodically transmitted data are saved in the storage medium thereby providing quick access by the receiver in those situations, such as interactive TV, where fast response is essential.","Referring now to  illustrating a receiver  suitable for accessing data transmitted by a broadcaster in a broadcasting system, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The receiver  includes a data accessing system  and a data storage medium . It should be noted that the receiver  can be any device suitable for reception of broadcast data, e.g., a digital T.V, set-top box, analog T.V, a computer including a lap top computer, etc. For example, the receiver can be a digital TV or a set up box running an interactive program. The receiver can be implemented as a virtual machine supporting an open interface, e.g., Java, Java T.V, etc. Data transmitted by the broadcaster can be stored in the data storage medium . In this way, data is readily available for access by the data accessing system  thereby reducing the delay associated with accessing the periodically broadcast data. In one implementation, the storage medium  is a hard disk type device capable of storing hundreds of megabytes of data, however, it should be noted that the storage medium  can be any storage device suitable for storing data such as magnetic tape, Random Access Memory (RAM), Compact Disk (CD), floppy disk, and the like.","Although the data storage medium  is depicted as a part of the receiver , it should be noted that data storage medium  can reside outside of the receiver  without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Alternatively, data storage medium  can be implemented as a part of data accessing system . It should also be noted that the data storage medium  can be implemented as a buffer or other suitable mechanisms to pass data to data accessing system .","Referring now to , illustrating a system  that includes the receiver  coupled to the data accessing system , the data storage medium , and a display  in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The display  is any device suitable for displaying images such as a T.V monitor, a computer monitor, and the like. The displayed images can include graphics, text, video, etc. Images can be displayed in one or more viewing portions , , and  that can take the form of graphical user interface (GUI) elements useful in providing control and data inputs as well as displaying output data. In the described embodiment, various audio signals can be generated by an audio outputting device . In addition, a user may interact with the receiver  using the various GUI elements included in the viewing portions \u2013. For example, while watching the broadcast of a sporting event, a viewer may request specific information relating to the sporting event as it is being displayed in the display  by clicking, or in some cases, unclicking, various ones of the GUI elements.","More particularly, a user may interact with the receiver  through an interactive portion  by activating one of GUI elements \u2013 that are located on the interactive portion . For example, by activating a particular GUI element such as GUI element , the user may request current statistics for a particular player in the sporting event. Typically, the requested information is maintained in a data file, e.g., data file X that is periodically transmitted by the broadcaster.","As discussed in the background, in a conventional broadcast system that periodically broadcasts data, there is a delay between re-transmissions of a particular data file, e.g., data file X. However, with the inventive receiver , the substantial delays associated with conventionally configured receivers are effectively eliminated since required data is stored locally. In this way, when the GUI element , for example, is clicked, corresponding data stored in the storage medium  is made immediately available thereby providing a highly interactive environment for the user.","Advantageously, receiver  can access data stored in a data storage medium . Thus, desired data, e.g., a particular file X is readily available and can be accessed by the data accessing system  as soon data is required, such as when a user has requested data. It should be noted as well there can implemented a variety of different techniques well known by those skilled in the art for selectively storing data in storage medium . As another example, once a request for a particular data file has been made, the data file can be kept in storage medium  for future use.","In one embodiment, data accessing system  dispatches requests for data to be stored in the storage medium . Multiple requests to store data, e.g., data file X, X, X can be dispatched by data accessing system . In addition, in a multi-threaded environment, multiple requests to store data can be processed independently using, for example, independent threats of execution. In this way, a request to store data can be dispatched as soon as a need to access data is perceived by the receiver . Alternatively, a request maybe dispatched in anticipation of requiring access to data at a later time. In this manner, delays normally encountered in accessing broadcast data are significantly reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["202","202","402","404","404","405","202","405","1","405","202","200","402","405","406","406","402","407"]},"Using the data locator , the data access requester  dispatches a request to store the desired data in the storage medium . This request can be sent to and processed independently by a data saver . Advantageously, this frees the data access requester  for more processing, e.g., to dispatch more requests to store data. Data saver  can use the data locator information provided by data access requestor  to obtain the requested data. Data maybe obtained directly by data saver  from the broadcaster, or in the alternative, the requested data can be provided to the data saver . Once the requested data is obtained, the data saver  can store it in storage medium , if so desired.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, multiple requests to store data are processed independently by data saver , using multiple processing threads. In this manner, requests to store data can quickly be made by data access requester  and efficiently processed by the data saver . A request to store data can be dispatched as soon as the need for data is perceived, e.g. a user has activated an interactive button to request information. Alternatively, data access requester  can dispatch requests to data saver , in anticipation of future need, e.g., when it is anticipated that a particular data file will be required for access.","In one embodiment, data access requestor  also outputs the data locator  to data assessor . Using the data locator , data assessor access the desired data from storage medium . In one embodiment, data assessor  is notified as soon as data is stored by data saver . It should be noted that this notification can be send by data saver  or by any other appropriate mechanism substantially simultaneously with the data assessor  accessing data from the storage medium . In this way, data such as data file X can be retrieved while the data saver  is processing additional data requests for more data, such as the data files X, X, X, or X. Additionally, the data saver  can store data files in the storage medium  as they become available.","Data accessing system  can optionally send a request to be notified of changes to data such changes include version changes to a particular data file that maybe stored in the storage medium . This request can be sent to a data updater . The broadcaster can signal when data has been updated by, for example, setting a flag in the transmitted file to indicate an updated version of a particular data file. When an updated version of the data is transmitted by the broadcaster, the data updater  notifies the data access system . Data updater  can then store the updated version of the data into storage medium . Alternatively, upon reception of a version change notification, data access requester  can dispatch another request to the data saver  to store the updated version. In this manner, data accessing system  can be notified of version changes to a particular data file without having to constantly poll data files. Given inherent delays associated with re-transmission of data files in a broadcasting system, polling maybe an inefficient mechanism for providing data updates. Thus, the present invention allows for efficient ways of providing notification of data changes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","502"]},"In accordance with a particular embodiment of the invention, a new class can be defined to represent a periodically transmitted file in a broadcast system, e.g., a carrousel file class. A carrousel file class can have properties similar to those properties defined for a file class in any object oriented language such as C++, Java, etc. In addition, the carrousel file class can have properties that are specifically defined for periodically transmitted file.","Next, in operation , an instance of the new class is instantiated. In one embodiment, a carrousel file class is instantiated. The carrousel file class can be instantiated using the acquired file locator of operation . However, it should be noted that a carousel file can be instantiated without requiring a file locator. For example, a carrousel file object can be created using a specified file name in a specified file directory.","An instance of a data-accessing object for the new class is created, in operation . For example, this instance can be created using a carousel file object of operation . In one embodiment, creating an instance of a data accessing object is achieved by instancing pre-defined data accessing operations, e.g., file input output (I\/O) operations. Thus, pre-existing data accessing operations, e.g., for accessing conventional files can be re-defined and re-used to access a new file class, e.g., a carrousel file class. For example, in a particular embodiment, pre-existing file accessing operations such as JAVA.io.fileinput stream, JAVA.io.filereader, JAVA.io.randomaccess, etc. are used to provide access to carrousel files. In this manner, an instance of a data accessing operation can be created in operation .","Prior to accessing data, a request is made to acquire data in operation . The request can be made using the acquired file locator of operation . Operation  initiates a new independent process, e.g., another threat of execution, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The process initiated in operation  is represented by dotted lines that extend from operation  to a operation  where data is acquired, e.g., stored in a storage. The initial process, (threat of execution) proceeds from operation  to operation  where data access is initiated. Next, in decision , a determination is made as to whether data is available, e.g. can the desired data be located in the storage. If the desired data is not available, (cannot be located in the storage) data access is suspended as indicated by operation . Data access can be initiated when data is made available (data is acquired in operation ). If data is available (can be located in the storage when decision  is made) data can be acquired, as indicated by operation . Data can be accessed by using one of data access mechanisms created in operation .","In operation , a subscription is made to receive notification of any version changes to the data, e.g., carousel file that was accessed in operation . In one embodiment, an operation is defined for the class carrousel file to subscribe an interested listener to receive notification of version changes to a desired carousel file, e.g., addlistener. A notification receiver can cancel its subscription by performing an operation such as removelistener. Finally, in operation  a notification of a change to data, e.g., the carousel file is received.","Method  can be implemented in an application program or applet running on an operating system. The application program or applet can initiate multiple threads of execution that are executed independently by the operating system. In one embodiment, the application program or applet uses a Java TV Application Programming Interface (API) to interface a Virtual Machine running a Real-Time Operating System. The Java TV API provides access to DSM-CC object and data carousels via use of data access mechanisms defined in the JAVA.IO package. The JAVA TV API is an extension of the JAVA platform developed by Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif.","In this manner, given an instance of a carousel file an application may use available file accessing classes such as JAVA.IO package to access data from the carousel object. Reliance on familiar APIs facilities ease of use for applications developers and permits reuse of application code. Use of a high-level access mode also facilitates ease of use and permits implementation flexibility across receivers of different manufactures. This invention can be utilized in numerous application e.g., enhanced television, video on demand, electronic programming guides interactive multi camera angles for sporting event, etc.","Although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. By way of example, although method  has been set forth in terms of a particular sequential order for the purposes of this explanation, it should be apparent that in many cases the ordering is not critical. For example, subscribing to version change notification shown as operation  can be done prior to accessing the file denoted as operation . Some operations may be combined or eliminated and others may be parsed into multiple operations. For example, operation  can be implemented as a series of multiple operations or may be eliminated since in some cases acquisition of file locator may not be required. The same functionality can also be obtained using different operations as well.","The invention has numerous advantages. One advantage is that the delay time for accessing data in a broadcasting system is significantly reduced. Another advantage is that data access can be provided without requiring a receiver to know the exact location of data. Yet another advantage is that data version updates can be provided to a receiver efficiently. Still another advantage is that cost effective and simple solutions can be implemented by using familiar file access facilities.","The many features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the written description, and thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation as illustrated and described.
