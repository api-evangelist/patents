{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates generally to automatic postage systems and the like. In one embodiment, an online postage system may verify unique printed postal indicia on mail pieces.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a system and method for an online postage system that may authorize the printing of an as needed postal indicium (e.g., an on-line postage stamp), receive and\/or store data on the postal indicium, and verify that the postal indicium actually appearing on a mail piece is what a mailer of the mail piece claims was applied to the mail piece, is not a duplicate, or is not otherwise suspect fraudulent, as will be described herein, is provided. Specifically, the system and method may verify whether the information actually printed in the indicium appearing on the mail piece is correct, accurate, unaltered, not a duplicate, and\/or is not otherwise suspected of being a fraudulent postal indicium; and, if necessary, send information for automatic revenue protection processing to make adjustments to a balance in an account associated with the mailer in real-time. \u201cReal-time\u201d as used herein applies to the general time frame associated with the initial processing of a mail piece in a first mail processing facility in which it is received. This processing may include the mail piece being scanned by a mail imaging\/sorting system, moving the mail piece along the sorting part of the system, and discharging the mail piece into a sorted location based on the destination, all of which may take from approximately 3 to 14 seconds. However, if a confirmation that the indicium is valid is not received before being discharged into the sorted location, the mail piece may be shunted off to a \u201cre-sorting\u201d location from which a mail facility employee may physically take the mail piece and return it to a mail sorting system to be run through again. The mail sorting system at the re-sorting location may be different that the mail imaging\/sorting system and may not be capable of taking an image of the mail piece, or it may be the same imaging\/sorting system configured to recognize that the mail piece has already been imaged and re-sort the mail piece without taking another image of the mail piece. The re-sorting may take place within 1, 5, 10 or more minutes from being shunted off to the re-sorting location. Alternatively, the mail piece may be sent on to the sorted destination location even without the indicium being validated for later revenue protection processing. Throughout the sorting process, the mail piece may be tracked using methods, such as applying information to the mail piece, as is well known in the art. Therefore, the scanning and verification of the indicium, as well as the notification back to the mail imaging\/sorting system, in general, occurs in real-time if all are completed before the mail piece is sent to the sorted destination location by the mail imaging\/sorting system.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, verifying that the information on the mail piece is correct, accurate, unaltered, not a duplicate, and\/or otherwise suspect fraudulent may be performed in a system with an infrastructure designed to provide a \u201cclosed-loop\u201d of information flow between the source of the indicium; one or more points of automation (\u201cPOA\u201d), which may provide a centralized source and control for authorizing the printing of postal indicia, and, for example, may be located at a Postal Service facility, at a mailer's facility, or at a third party facility; and a mail processing facility. While more than one POA may be used, for ease of illustration and explanation only one POA may be described herein, it should be clearly understood that the embodiments described also may include more than one POA. A closed-loop of information may be formed by making the information that the source of the indicium (i.e., the mailer) claims to have printed in the indicium available to the POA that authorized the printing and a revenue protection system. So in other words, the closed-loop exists between the source of the indicium and the POA, for example, in response to an authorization to print a postal indicium (e.g., a \u201cstamp\u201d) sent from the POA, the source of the postal indicium may, optionally, send a message back to the point of automation with data on what was actually printed in the postal indicium, depending on how the system may be implemented. For example, if the POA sends an authorization to print a $0.37 postal indicium, the authorization is received, and the source of the indicium (e.g., the mailer) actually prints a $0.37 postal indicium, the message sent back to the point of automation may include that data.","For example, the closed-loop of information may include the source of the indicium sending data on the indicium that is actually printed to the POA to be stored; the mail processing facility receiving a mail piece with the indicium affixed from the source of the indicium, scanning the indicium on the mail piece, and sending information scanned from the indicium to the POA for verification of the indicium; and the POA sending instructions to the mail processing facility on how to continue processing the mail piece. The closed-loop may also include revenue protection information flowing to a point, for example, a reporting system, which may result in revenue protection actions such as adjustments to the mailer's account, fines or other penalties.","Although the information in the indicium to be verified may appear in several forms, for example, a meter mark, a permit mark, a PC-postage indicium, a human-readable mark, and\/or a barcode, reading the information from the indicium with automated equipment is simplified when the indicium is presented at least in the form of a barcode. For example, the barcode may be printed both with and without human-readable information, and any human-readable information printed with the barcode may also be coded in the barcode. Regardless, the entire indicium may be read (e.g., a bit-mapped image of the human-readable portion may be made and the image may be converted to actual digital character values; and the barcode may be scanned and the pattern converted to represent digital character values of information encoded in the barcode). To convert the bit-mapped image to actual digital character values may require an optical character recognition (\u201cOCR\u201d) program be run that may determine the value of each character of the human-readable portion and save it as such. In general, the entire indicium may be read (e.g., scanned) at the mail processing facility in the single scan of a mail piece on which the indicium is affixed, scanned, and deciphered and the deciphered indicium information sent to the POA for verification that the indicium is correct, accurate, unaltered, and not a duplicate. Alternatively, the scanned indicium information may be sent directly to the POA without being deciphered. In yet another alternative, the scanned indicium information may be deciphered and verified locally at the mail processing facility using locally stored data on the indicium and the POA may be subsequently updated with the information and results of the verification. Alternatively, the entire indicium may be read at the mail processing facility in the single scan of a mail piece on which the indicium is affixed, scanned, and deciphered and the deciphered indicium information sent to the POA for verification that the indicium is correct, accurate, unaltered, and not a duplicate using data on the indicium received from another POA that authorized the printing of the indicium.","Revenue protection features may include validation of the data contained in the barcode to ensure that it was read properly, not falsified, and matches the services that were requested and purchased at the time of printing. In addition, the system can calculate a required tariff for the mail piece and\/or ensure that a minimum tariff for the mail piece is paid using a tariff table. For example, if the indicium contains the amount paid, but does not contain data on the class of service, the class of service may be calculated using the amount paid, the type of the mail piece, and a tariff table in which a tariff (e.g., a rate) for each class of service for each type of mail piece is listed. The revenue protection features may also include verifying a \u201cpost-by\u201d date of the indicium to ensure that the indicium was used within a pre-determined time of it being printed, and verifying that the indicium was only used once to prevent against the unauthorized duplication of the indicium.","In general, the revenue protection features are implemented in a closed-loop system, for example, a post-by date on the indicium may be statically enforced so that the indicium must be used by a certain date or else it expires. In a closed-loop system, post-by dates may be dynamic and have any desired expiration rules applied in real time. Likewise, for mail pieces with a unique identifier, the identifier may be used to electronically \u201ccancel\u201d the indicium in the stored data at the point of automation once the indicium is scanned in the mail system, for example, at a mail processing facility. As a result, any duplicate occurrences of the canceled indicium may be considered as a possibly fraudulent indicium. Similarly, mail pieces with digital validations such as embedded signatures, encrypted codes, etc. the validation marks also may be authenticated in real-time.","Specific service information, for example, mail class, mail value, or special services information such as signed-for delivery, return-receipt requested, etc., may be verified against what was actually sold (i.e., authorized) by the POA. For example, if a mail piece is labeled as \u201cFirst Class,\u201d but the payment made by the mailer for the mail piece is insufficient for that class of service, the mail piece may be identified as possibly being fraudulent. In addition, once the indicium on the mail piece has been verified, the mailer's account may be automatically audited to compare the mailer's records against specific mail pieces or collections of mail pieces, as they are detected. Likewise, data collected through the revenue protection process may be used for informational reports, such as, breakdowns of the mail streams by type, date, point of mailing, class of service, etc.","In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the system and method may be used with postal indicia that are printed by third-party systems. In general, in the these embodiments a separate POA in the third-party system may be considered to be the source of the indicium, since the data necessary to verify any third-party system postal indicia will be sent from the separate POA to the POA of the present invention. Upon receipt of the data from the separate POA, the information loop between the POA and the source of the indicium is closed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","102","104","102","110","120","130","140","150","160","104","104","100"]},"In general, postal indicium  of  may include several versions, for example, a mail piece independent indicium and a mail piece dependent indicium. Mail piece independent indicia are indicia that would be printed without a postcode, that is, without a DPC for a specific addressee. As such, a mail piece independent indicium may be put on any mail piece, which means that the customer may pre-print a sheet having one or multiple indicia and apply them to any mail piece or pre-print one or more blank envelopes and\/or cards. For example, customer system  may print out a sheet of 20, 30, or more $0.37 First Class Postage indicia, $0.23 Postcard indicia, etc., depending on the size of the sheet and the indicia being printed. As such, the bar-coded information on each indicium would include the individual serial number assigned to that indicium; the value of the indicium, e.g., the price or tariff paid; the class of postage, etc. However, since address-independent indicium will not contain the postcode of the destination address of the envelope on which they are printed or placed, the mail system will have to determine the postcode from the scanned destination address block (\u201cDAB\u201d) information from the mail piece.","Mail piece dependent indicia are indicia that would be printed with a postcode, e.g., a DPC for the destination of the mail piece to which the indicium is to be affixed. In general, rather than being printed on a separate label, mail piece dependent indicia may be printed directly onto the envelopes with which they are associated. This may help to avoid placing a mail piece dependent indicium printed on a label on the wrong envelope, which should result in the indicium being identified as being invalid and the mail piece being removed from the mail system. In addition, at the same time that the customer prints the indicium on the envelope the DAB may also be printed on the front of the envelope with, for example, a DPC barcode such as a POSTNET barcode printed on near the bottom of the DAB. In addition, a flag that identifies the status of the DPC can be set and printed in the barcode. For example, if the DPC can be validated before being printed, the flag may be set and printed in the barcode to reflect that the indicium contains a validated DPC; if not and a DPC is printed, the flag would reflect that the indicium contains an un-validated DPC; and if not and a DPC is not printed, the flag would reflect that the indicium does not contain a DPC. As a result, using a mail piece dependent indicium will enable rapid and accurate determination of the destination address.","Alternatively, in another embodiment of the present invention, for letterhead that will appear through a clear window in the envelope, the DAB and the DPC barcode may be printed directly onto the letterhead in a position that will be visible through the window when the letterhead is correctly placed in the envelope.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["120","140","125","170"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","210","212","220","210","214","220","210","220","215","210","220","220","210","230","232","233","234","235","236","237","210","232","233","234","215","210","232","233","234","220","232","233","234","215"]},"In addition, in , customer system  and group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities  also may have a physical communication path (shown by the dashed line) that provides for the delivery of a mail piece from a customer using customer system  to one facility in group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities . Group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities  also may be associated with a mail recipient , as shown by the dashed line, which indicates that, in general, the only communication between mail recipient  is via another physical communication path to deliver the mail piece from the customer. However, it is also possible that mail recipient  may have a customer system like customer system , which would permit two-way electronic communication between mail recipient  and POA system  and group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities .","In , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, POA  may include an online postage (\u201cOLP\u201d) system that may be implemented using standard software programming techniques as a centralized server. POA  may permit a customer to use customer system  (for example, an OLP client) to set up and fund an account to print the as needed postal indicia upon request. For example, customer system  may be implemented using a browser that may interact with POA  through a web portal that may act as a front-end to POA . The web portal may include application server and data server functionality, which may be implemented in a single server or in separate servers (for example, an OLP application server and an OLP data server). Regardless of how implemented, the server(s) may contain all of the business logic and data of the OLP system, including:\n\n","In general, the POA  will have the ability to validate addresses provided to the POA  from customer system , either provided individually or in a customer mailing list. This will enable the POA  to embed a DPC in data sent with an authorization to customer system  where it may be printed in the indicium, for example, as described above in relation to barcode portion  of postal indicium  in .","Returning to , system  may include some automatic revenue protection (\u201cARP\u201d) measures to handle indicia suspected of being fraudulent, for example, indicia that are unreadable, expired, undervalued, forged, duplicated, and\/or altered. An unreadable indicium is considered to be fraudulent for revenue protection purposes and, in general, will result in the mail piece to which the fraudulent indicium is affixed being removed from system . However, this is the least suspicious type of fraudulent indicium, since the indicium could be unreadable due to a smudge, a cancelled indicium, a bad camera or a failure in trying to determine the applicable postcode. In each of these cases, in general, no fraud has actually taken place, just an error in or with the indicium. Similarly, expired indicia are indicia that were place in the mail system and posted after the post-by date specified in the indicium. When a post-by date is used, the indicium must be posted within a configurable number of days before and after the post-by date or system , for example POA , will consider the indicium to be out-of-date and may cause the mail piece to be removed.","Continuing with the ARP measures, underpayment relates to, paying for and applying an indicium with an insufficient value to a mail piece (e.g., a letter), either by accident or intentionally. For example, this may occur when a customer requests, pays for and prints a $0.23 address independent indicium for a post card but puts the indicium on a regular First Class letter, which requires a $0.37 First Class indicium. After the letter is scanned, system , for example POA , may compare the information contained in the indicium and the actual type of letter to which the indicium is affixed with a rate\/tariff table to determine whether the correct postage has been paid. If the correct postage has been paid, the letter may continue through system  and be sorted for delivery. If the correct postage has not been paid, the letter may be removed from system  and appropriate ARP measures may be initiated. In addition to being one of the most serious types of suspected fraud, underpayment also may be the most likely to occur in practice.","The next ARP measure involves forged indicia, which also is a serious type of suspected fraud, since it is an overt attempt to defraud the postal system. Unfortunately, modern graphics tools and printers and copiers have made it relatively easy to create a picture that looks like a valid indicium, but, in reality, is totally fictitious. Fortunately, protection from this type of fraud may be enabled by encrypting the data bytes in a datamatrix using a \u201csecret key\u201d to produce a security code that is specific to and printed in the indicium. System , for example POA , may include the security code and the identification of the secret key in the datamatrix. Accordingly, during the initial processing when at least the indicium is read from the datamatrix, system , for example POA , may obtain the security code, key identification, mail class, mail value, date of printing of the indicium, etc. The process that was used to encrypt the data bytes in the datamatrix using the secret key may be repeated using the information obtained from the datamatrix and the secret key, and the resulting security code may be compared against the original security code. If the new security code does not match the security code from the indicium's datamatrix, the mail piece may be considered to be fraudulent and removed from system . If the new security code does match, the mail piece may continue through system  and continue to be sorted for delivery.","Another ARP measure involves duplicate detection, which includes verification that valid indicia are only used once and not, for example, photo-copied onto and\/or used on multiple different mail pieces. Duplicating indicia is another serious type of suspected fraud, since it is relatively easy to do and is also an affirmative attempt to defraud the postal system. In general, POA , may be enabled to detect duplicate indicia when it receives information scanned from each indicium already affixed to different mail pieces. POA  may detect a duplicate indicium by checking the received information against a master database in which is stored data on all indicia authorized to be and identified as being printed. The first time scanned indicium information is received, a flag in the database may be set to identify the indicium as having been cancelled, e.g., already used on a mail piece. Therefore, when subsequent scanned information on the same indicium is presented to the main database, it may be identified as a duplicate and the mail piece to which the indicium is attached may be considered to be fraudulent and removed from system . In addition, POA  may also notify each of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  with information on the duplicate indicium.","The last ARP measure, detecting altered indicia, involves checking the indicium to verify that what the indicium \u201csays\u201d is the proper postage and\/or class of service is what was actually purchased. This can occur when the customer alters the indicium to obtain a service that he did not purchase, for example, the customer may have changed the indicium value from $0.23 to $0.37 or more, or altered the branding mark to reflect a higher class of service than was actually paid. In general, protection against altered indicia occurs at POA  after it receives the scanned information from, for example, one of multiple regional mail facilities , , . Specifically, POA  may compare the scanned information against the data stored in database  that shows what services for which the customer actually paid. If the two do not match, POA  may send an \u201cinvalid indicium\u201d flag and\/or not sent a \u201cvalid indicium\u201d flag with instructions on how to handle the mail piece to which the invalid indicium is affixed back to the regional mail facility that sent the scanned indicium information. Alternatively, this protection also may be implemented at each of multiple regional mail facilities , , .","Additionally, in , POA  and\/or the regional mail facility having the mail piece also may compare the human-readable information with the machine-readable information on the mail piece to verify the indicium on the mail piece is correct, accurate and unaltered. To do this the human-readable portion of the indicium, generally, may be processed using OCR or some other image recognition techniques to convert the image of the human-readable portion to usable digital representations of each character. For example, processing the part of an image taken from the indicium of  containing \u201c$0.37\u201d, would result in a digital value of 0.37 being created that may or may not also be formatted as currency. After the human-readable portion of the indicium is processed the results may be compared with the machine-readable portion of the indicium to identify any differences. If differences are identified, the mail piece may be considered to have a fraudulent indicium and the mail piece may be removed from the mail system. In addition, if differences are identified, the information may be sent to a reporting system, for example, an ARP system (not shown), for revenue protection action(s) such as adjustments to the customer's account for insufficient and\/or excess postage, fines and\/or other penalties for printing and using fraudulent indicia, and\/or service fees.","Likewise, in , specific human-readable service information (e.g., mail class, mail value, or special services requested such as signed-for delivery, return-receipt requested, etc.) may be verified against what was actually sold, as reported in the machine-readable portion of the indicium (i.e., the barcode). For example, if a mail piece is labeled with a human-readable indicator for \u201cFirst Class\u201d but the barcode for the mail piece indicates that the mail piece is \u201cSecond Class,\u201d the mail piece may be identified as possibly being fraudulent. Alternatively, the mail piece may be considered to be fraudulent, if the mail piece appears in the mail system as \u201cFirst Class\u201d as indicated in the human-readable portion of the indicium, but the payment made by the customer (e.g., the sender of the mail piece) as indicated in the barcode in the indicium for the mail piece is insufficient for that class of service.","In , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, after setting up and funding the account, POA  may receive a request from customer system  to authorize the customer system  to print an as needed amount of postage. POA  may check the account specified in the request to determine if it is a valid account and if there is enough credit in the account to pay for the requested, as needed amount of postage. If the account is valid and there is enough credit, POA  may send an authorization to customer system  to print the requested amount of postage and debit the customers account for the requested amount.","In , upon receiving the authorization to print the requested amount of postage, customer system  may immediately print an indicium, for example, an OLP postal indicium, in the requested amount. Customer system  may print the indicium directly on a mail piece or on another medium, for example, a label, that may be subsequently affixed to the mail piece. Customer system  may send data to POA  that details exactly what was printed in the indicium and POA  may store the data on what was actually printed in the indicium for later use to verify the indicium when it is in the mail system. The customer at customer system  may place the mail piece with the indicium affixed thereto into the mail system, which will ultimately result in one of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  receiving the mail piece. In general, while this one regional mail facility will be the one that is the closest to the customer, it can be any of the regional mail facilities. A connection between customer system  and multiple regional mail facilities , ,  may be effected via network  to enable two-way electronic communication between the two is possible, since elements of POA  maybe implemented in multiple regional mail facilities , , . For example, some or all of the functionality of POA  may be implemented in one or all of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  with which customer system  may need to communicate.","In , POA  and one of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  may communicate when the mail piece with the printed indicium is received and scanned at one of multiple regional mail facilities , , , for example, a first regional mail facility . Specifically, first regional mail facility  may send the scanned indicium information to POA  for verification and validation of the indicium information. The scanned indicium information may or may not be deciphered, that is, translated into a digitally usable format, before it is sent to POA  from first regional mail facility . Regardless, POA  may decipher the indicium information, if necessary, and compare the scanned indicium information with the data on what was actually printed in the indicium that is stored at POA  to verify and validate the indicium. POA  may send instructions to first regional mail facility  that specify how to deal with the mail piece. For example, the instructions may tell first regional mail facility  to send the mail piece on to the next stage of processing in the mail system, if everything is verified and validated; add postage to the mail piece and then send the mail piece on to the next stage of processing in the mail system, if the postage was incorrect; and\/or cull the mail piece from the mail system, if the indicium can not be verified and validated. First regional mail facility  may save information received from POA  on the validation of the postage directly in first total tag database , as well as the other local tag databases ,  for subsequent use by regional mail facilities , ,  to determine whether the indicium may be fraudulent and to save a processing history of the mail piece. In addition, POA  may send information to a reporting system to perform additional automatic revenue protection processing.","Alternatively, in , first regional mail facility  may validate the postage contained in the indicium and save information on the validation of the postage directly in the tag database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","210","310","220","315","220","310","320","220","330","220","320","220","210","330","320","340","330","350","340","330"]},"Alternatively, in , the method may include providing () instructions on how to deal with the mail piece on which the indicium is printed, if it is determined () that the information read from the postal indicium on the mail piece in a mail system does not match the data stored () about the postal indicium or is otherwise determined to be invalid or suspect fraudulent, as described above.

Conversely, excess postage may be credited to the customer's account and an instruction to \u201csubtract\u201d the excess postage may or may not be sent to the mail facility, if POA  detects an excess amount of postage on the mail piece. POA  may also automatically charge service and\/or other fees to the customer's account as well as fines that may be associated with indicia that are determined by the mail system as being fraudulent or as being suspected of being fraudulent.","In accordance with another embodiment of the method of the present invention, in , the mail facility may store a copy of the stored data from POA  and the mail facility may determine that the scanned information matches the stored data at the mail facility. Similar to the method in , in this embodiment, rather than POA  doing all of the deciphering of the scanned information, the mail facility may decipher the scanned information and compare the deciphered information with the stored data to determine that the scanned information matches the stored data at the mail facility. Therefore, the mail facility may supply for its own use, the necessary instructions on how to handle the mail piece with the indicium, similar to that described above.","In , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the method may be implemented using machine-readable (e.g., computer) instructions stored on several different machine-readable medium. For example, the machine-readable instructions may be implemented in separate software programs that may be separately executed by POA , customer system , and each of regional mail facilities , ,  to perform the overall method.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["220","505","210","220","510","210","220","515","210","220","520","220","525","210","220"]},"In , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the method may be implemented using machine-readable (e.g., computer) instructions stored on a machine-readable medium.

In addition, at OLP system  the amount the postage authorized to be printed may be deducted from a client account maintained at OLP system  and associated with client system . At client system  an indicium may be printed to represent the as-needed amount of postage, the indicium may be affixed to the mail piece, a message containing data describing the content (e.g., value, class of service, etc.) may be sent to OLP system , and the mail piece may be deposited in the mail system (e.g., mailed by a client from customer system ).","In , after the mail piece enters the mail system, it may be received at an initial mail processing facility (e.g., a regional mail processing facility) where a single-pass image of the information (e.g., indicium, destination address block, return address, etc.) on the mail piece may be taken using an initial mail processing system . At the initial mail processing facility the indicium affixed to the mail piece may be validated and canceled either by mail processing system  or by being sent to OLP system  from initial mail processing system , and the scanned indicium and other mail piece information may be saved at one or more of tag database server(s) . In addition to the initial processing the mail piece may, generally, undergo at least one level of sorting by initial mail processing system  and be forwarded on for subsequent sorting and\/or delivery confirmation. The subsequent sorting may be performed by initial mail processing system  or by another mail processing system . If the subsequent sorting is performed by another mail processing system , the mail piece first must be transferred to another mail processing system . Regardless of where the subsequent sorts and\/or delivery confirmation may occur, the indicium on the mail piece may be detected, whether the indicium has been noted as cancelled in the database(s) may be determined, the processing that occurs to the mail piece may be saved in the database(s), instructions on how to handle the mail piece may be received, and the mail piece may be handled according to the received instructions (e.g., deliver the mail piece to an addressee in the destination address block, cull (i.e., remove) the mail piece from the mail system if the indicium is suspected of being fraudulent, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 2","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","210","210","210","220","210"]},"In , POA  may be coupled to tag database , which may store data received on postal indicia printed by customer  and POA  may be implemented as a computer software program and be connected to customer system  to enable two-way communication between the two. Similarly, customer system  may be implemented as a computer software program OLP client system. POA  also may be connected to group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities , which may include multiple regional mail facilities , , . The connection between POA  and each of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  may be via dedicated and\/or undedicated communication line(s). POA  also may be connected to each of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  via the dedicated and\/or undedicated communication line(s) to enable two-way communication with each. Likewise, customer system  may be connected to each of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  to enable two-way communication through similar communication line(s) to those described above.","In addition, as in , in , customer system  and group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities  may also have a physical communication path (not shown) that provides for the delivery of a mail piece from a customer using customer system  to an initial one of group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities . Group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities  is also shown to be associated with a mail recipient  by a dashed line to indicate that, in general, the only communication between mail recipient  is via another physical communication path to deliver the mail piece from the customer. However, it is also possible that mail recipient  may have a customer system like customer system , which would permit two-way electronic communication between mail recipient  and POA system  and group of regional mail sorting\/handling facilities . In reality, customer system  may only be in communication with only a single one of multiple regional mail facilities , ,  and, in general, the one regional facility that is the closest facility to customer system .","In , in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, POA  may include the OLP system and POA  may permit a customer to use customer system  (for example, an OLP client) to set up and fund an account to be used to pay for printing the as-needed postal indicia upon request. For example, customer system  may interact with POA  using a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) or some other user interface. POA  may provide application server and data server functionality and may be implemented in a single server or in separate servers (for example, an OLP application server and an OLP data server).
