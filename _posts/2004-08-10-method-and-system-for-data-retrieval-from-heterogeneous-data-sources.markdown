title: Method and system for data retrieval from heterogeneous data sources
abstract: A system and a method for specifying and configuring, together with categorising and classifying, heterogeneous types of multiple data sources is disclosed. The system and method also retrieve search results in accordance with search requests and conditions from at least one of the multiple data sources, for example a relational database management system (RDBMS), a light-weight directory access protocol (LDAP), an extensible mark-up language database (XMLDB), extensible mark-up language (XML) files, hypertext mark-up language (HTML) files, or TEXT files, through an application programming interface (API), or a web service interface such as a simple object access protocol (SOAP).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention generally relates to data retrieval from heterogeneous data sources, and more particularly, to specifying and configuring multiple types of data sources, for information searching and retrieval from the different types of data sources through a network interface.","Data storage of data and information and search and retrieval of the stored information through a network interface are significant tasks performed by computer systems. These tasks are complicated by the number of different types of data storage sources or stores that are available and by the number of different types of applications that are available to access and search the data sources. Often, some of the data sources are incompatible with the search or access application, which makes the search and retrieval of the data and information stored on the incompatible data sources impossible. To access incompatible data sources, the application must incorporate the accessing and searching logic and codes of each data source type desired. Writing such code is usually more complex and requires more effort to program than other types of programming code. Each data source typically has a set of query languages or a search engine to perform information retrieval or searching. The languages or search engine are usually unique to each data source.","Additionally, searches performed on the Internet, such as a web-wide search, span millions of web pages. Another type of search is an enterprise-type search, which typically indexes a much smaller, but much more varied set of content types. The web-wide type searches are less specific than enterprises-type searches, and users or requesters performing enterprise-type searches typically require access to different types of data sources.","Attempts have been made to provide systems to retrieve or search information resident in multiple data sources. U.S. Pat. No. 5,634,053 issued 27 May 1997 to Noble et al. describes a federated information management (FIM) system and method for integrating data from multiple databases to provide users with access to a virtual database. The FIM system provides a uniform user interface, however, the multiple databases mentioned are of a similar type, specifically, database management system (DBMS).","International Patent Publication No. WO-A-00\/75,849 published 14 Dec. 2000 to Lackey et al. discloses a middleware system that provides access to disparate data sources, such as relational and non-relational databases, multidimensional databases, objects and extensible mark-up language (XML) files. The system of WO-A-00\/75,849 provides access to different types of data sources, but only configures the properties of the data source, which enables the application to create a connection for the data source without configuring the search and returnable attributes required for searching. In essence the system of WO-A-00\/75,849 provides flexible connectivity to a single data source, but does not provide such flexible and configurable data retrieval from heterogeneous data sources.","Attempts also have been made to provide systems for querying heterogeneous data sources distributed over a network using context interchange. U.S. Pat. No. 5,953,716 issued 14 Sep. 1999 to Madnick et al. describes a system for querying disparate, heterogeneous data sources over a network that includes a request translator and a data translator. The request translator translates a request having an associated data context declared by the requester into a query having a second data context associated with it. The second context is also associated with the query and is declared by, at least one of the disparate data sources. This system also includes a data translator, which translates received data from the data context declared by the data source queried into the data context associated with the request. A related method for querying disparate data sources over a network is also described. The method includes the steps of translating a request having an associated data context into a query having a second data context. The second data context is associated with one of the disparate data sources to be queried. The method further includes translating data received from the data sources, from the data contexts associated with the data sources, into the data context associated with the request.","The above systems are unable to support different types of data sources and dynamically identify applicable types of data sources, or dynamically define the scope of a search.","Thus, a need exists for a method or a system to address the problems discussed above for data access, search, or retrieval from multiple heterogeneous data sources.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for searching and retrieving data from heterogeneous data sources through a network interface. The system comprises: a plurality of heterogeneous data sources; a configure element for communicating with each data source and for configuring and selecting the data sources from which to retrieve data; a search element for communicating with the configure element and each selected data source, for retrieving data in accordance with a task request; and a search translator for each data source, to communicate with both the configure element and the search element.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for searching and retrieving of data from heterogeneous data sources, through a network interface. The method comprises: in a configure element in communication to each data source, configuring and selecting data sources from which to retrieve data, from a plurality of heterogeneous data sources; and retrieving data in accordance with a task request, using a search element in communication with the configure element and each selected data source; wherein communication between the data sources and the configure element and the search element is via search translators.","A system and method are disclosed for specifying or configuring, together with categorising or classifying, various types of multiple data sources. The system and method retrieve search results from the various types of data sources via a network interface. Examples of the various type of data sources may include, for example, a relational database management system (RDBMS), a light-weight directory access protocol (LDAP), an extensible mark-up language database (XMLDB), extensible mark-up language (XML) files, hypertext mark-up language (HTML) files, TEXT files, and the like. Pre-configuration and pre-categorisation of search categories may be performed during deployment before actual search (information retrieval) takes place. Both the configuration and the categorisation of various types of multiple data sources may be implemented via an application programming interface (API) or a web service, such as a simple object access protocol (SOAP), calls or invocations with the help of a data source configurator element.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","2","14","12","10","4","20","16","18","30","18","30","4","2","6","8","14","16","10","22","12","20","12","20","30","18","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","14","32","34","36","30","38","26","38","16","26","30","26"]},"The retrieval task and information on the data sources to be included are sent to the search manager . The search manager , in turn, formulates a task request, such as a search request, for the relevant selected type or category of data sources, and forwards the formulated search request to the appropriate search translators  that correspond to the specified type or category of data sources  to be searched. The search translators  for the relevant data sources  issue their respective search requests to the corresponding data sources . The search translators  verify that the search request syntax is appropriate to its corresponding data source type. The search translators  use the respective search requests to retrieve the search results from their corresponding data sources . Searches are carried out in accordance with the retrieval task on the selected pre-configured different types of multiple data sources . Search results from each of the pre-configured data sources  are returned by the search manager  back to the requester .","Pre-configured data sources as mentioned above may be those data sources  that are configured and categorised during the data source configuration and categorisation operation as shown in . The data source owner  may configure which of the data source(s)  can be searched. The data source owner  may also specify the types of the data sources (RDBMS, XMLDB, LDAP, XML, HTML, TEXT files, etc.) and the generic search categorisation(s) or classification(s)  of the data sources (NEWS, USERS, GROUPS, TRANSACTIONS, etc.), under which the data sources  fall.","In this embodiment, the data source owner  specifies or configures, and verifies the various types of data sources  required by the requester . For example, the data source owner  specifies or configures the information or properties of the required data sources, searchable attributes, returnable attributes, and the like under generic categories into the search master index meta-file . The search manager  classifies and executes different kinds of searches with the help of the search filter engine  and the search translators  on those pre-configured data sources  based on any one of: data source type, data source category  and the data source owner  who configured the data source(s). The search filter engine  is configured to receive search information, the data source type or category, and information of the data source owner that configured the data source.","Search translators  such as SQL, X-QUERY, XPATH, Netscape Directory SDK 4.0 for Java, and the like, retrieve search results from the various data sources  respectively, based on the search information and the data source type or category  or the data source owner  that configured the search forwarded by the search filter engine . The search manager  formulates a particular search request using the search information passed on by the search filter engine and formulates the appropriate syntax information specific to its corresponding data source type. The search translators  use the respective search requests to retrieve the search results from their corresponding different types of multiple data sources .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["42","24","30","24","30","30","42","24","30","26","42","24","30"],"sub":["1","X","1","M","1","N"]},"During the configuration and categorisation operation as shown in  and with reference to , an embodiment of a method S comprises the data source owner specifying or configuring S which of the data source(s)  are to be searched along with their respective data source types and generic search categorisation(s) or classification(s) that those data source(s) fall under.

flexibility to specify and configure different types of data source(s) under various generic categories and classifications for information or properties like searchable attributes, returnable attributes, and the like. For example, as shown in , the requester  may add a data source , delete a data source , or view a data source . Based on the configuration completed by the requester , the selected data sources  are searched . Additionally the system has the ability to handle and execute searches on different types or categories of data source(s)  (global as well as user-configured), for example RDBMS, LDAP, XMLDB, XML files, HTML files, TEXT files and the like. The System also facilitates information search execution and retrieval from a variety of pre-configured data source(s) belonging to different types or categories at any point of time and returns the search or retrieval results. Embodiments may use different types of data sources that are pre-configured and may be categorised or classified accordingly. Information search and retrieval from different types of multiple data source(s) (global and user-configured) may be realised. The search results from multiple pre-configured data source(s) of different types are returned back to the requester .","The system and method may be implemented on a computer, for example by way of software, connected to one or more networks, such as the internet or proprietary internal networks, for example, to specify and configure different types of data source(s) information that are accessible through such networks. It is understood that the computer may receive input from a user via a user interface, store various types of data on a data storage medium, display information, and output information to the user. Additionally, the system may indicate, organise, and maintain the searchable and returnable attributes for the pre-specified or pre-configured types of data source(s). Common or generic search categories (such as NEWS, GROUPS, TRANSACTIONS, USERS, LOGS, etc.) may be established for the pre-specified or pre-configured types of data source(s). Different kinds of searches may be performed on various pre-configured and pre-categorised data source types, for example, RDBMS, LDAP, XMLDB, XML, HTML, TEXT format of multiple data source(s), while complex search conditions may be represented.","In the foregoing manner a system and a method for data retrieval from heterogeneous data sources is disclosed. Only several embodiments are described. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art in view of this disclosure that numerous changes and\/or modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features, objects and advantages of embodiments of the invention will be better understood and readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the following written description, in conjunction with drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
