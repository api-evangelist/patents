Field of the Invention","This invention relates in general to the field of electronic transportation systems, and more specifically, to a system of monitoring and controlling motorized passenger carts.","2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98","Large amusement and retail spaces offer a diversity of options to customers, but often feature large distances. There is a strong correlation between the amount of retail sales and the level of foot traffic that these spaces can drive. The longer a patron stays and shops, the more money a proprietor can make. However, patrons with young children are often limited by the amount of time they can spend shopping because their children become bored or get tired of walking around.","Limitations of strollers, shopping carts, and bikes. Moving sidewalks can help shorten long spans, but do enable a patron to move around freely. Segways, golf carts, and personalized tram services may be too large to operate in multi-level environments like a shopping mall. Moreover, mixing vehicles with pedestrians can create an unsafe environment that may be disruptive.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a system and method of safely transporting individuals within an enclosed area is provided which substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages associated with previous systems or methods.","In accordance with one embodiment, a system is provided for safely conveying passengers indoors using a steerable motorized passenger cart, the maximum speed of which is limited based on its location within the interior space. In particular embodiments, the present invention further includes an interchangeable vehicle skin affixed to the motorized passenger cart. In other embodiments, the cart's location may be used to deliver targeted advertising or to augment customer experiences by delivering supplemental media to the rider based on his location.","In accordance with another embodiment, a method is provided for remotely towing a motorized passenger cart, comprising the steps: forming a wireless bond between a motorized passenger cart and a tow; determining the speed, bearing, and distance from the tow; and automatically adjusting the speed and the heading of the cart so as to keep the distance within a preconfigured range. In particular embodiments, the tow may be a guardian or another motorized passenger cart.","One advantage of the features described herein is that a disparate and individualized indoor transportation system is made possible by introducing monitoring and safety mechanisms that protect both passengers and other patrons and bystanders. Another advantage is that patronage at large retail or amusement spaces, whether indoors or outdoors, can be improved by maximizing the amount of time patrons can spend at shops or attractions by decreasing travel times. Patronage can be further improved by offering location-based advertising and by providing business intelligence from collected traffic data.","In the following detailed description, various embodiments demonstrate features of a motorized cart system that yield some of the above-mentioned advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","200","220","202","230","232","202","202","204","232","222","200","218","214","218","206","260","210","212","212","212","220","212","222","216"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["250","236","236","236","252","234","244","222","236","236","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2E","b":["240","204","240","240","240","206"]},"The electronic display  may be located elsewhere on the motorized passenger cart without departing from the essence of the invention. For example, in other embodiments, the display  may be affixed above the frame seat . The electronic display  is accessible to a rider via a transparent layer or an opening in the ornamental shell (not depicted).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","304","300","306","302","306","306","300","306","336","338","304"]},"A cart  connects to the communication network wirelessly. A guardian  is indirectly connected to the system  via ad hoc communication with the cart . The ad hoc communication may implemented using Bluetooth, WiFi, or any other power efficient networking technology. The ad hoc communication network is also used to establish a mobile operating area  centered around a supervising guardian . As will be discussed in more detail below, some embodiments may feature child safety systems that slow associated carts (, ) or sound an alarm if the carts (, ) leave the mobile operating area .","Operators  monitor the operation of the various connected carts. If the carts are rented on an hourly basis, the system  might display a list of rented carts and how much rental time is remaining. An operator  can also communicate with guardians by relaying a message to a cart or sending the message to a guardian's smart device if connected to the communication network. If a cart  goes missing or is stolen, a transponder  relays the location of the missing cart  to an operator  via cellular communications  with cell network  and relayed over a wired or wireless communication backbone  to the system's central logic . Once the missing cart  is outside the operating area, it may determine its location using GPS triangulation  with satellites , or it may rely on cellphone triangulation by communicating with various towers  of a cellular network.","In another embodiment, the indoor positioning system can be used to serve fine-grained location based advertising to a motorized passenger cart or its associated guardian via her smart device. For example, if the motorized passenger cart is within a preconfigured proximity of an ice cream parlor, the system's logic  can determine whether the proprietor has paid for any advertising, and if so, the system  transmits the advertisement (which may be comprised of text, images, video, audio, or some combination) to the cart or associated guardian. The advertising may be triggered when a cart enters a geofenced area, or it may be triggered based on the time of day or some other factor that may drive traffic to the advertiser's store.","In yet another embodiment, the logic  of the monitoring and control system  in communication with the indoor positioning system and various carts, can enable location based gaming or location rich services. For example, a zoo employing some of the features of the present invention might offer a guided tour of its various exhibits by communicating with the cart's rider via an interactive display in the cart and with the associated guardian's smart device. As the rider approaches a particular exhibit, the cart can provide the rider with additional information and interactive content to augment the guest's experience at the zoo. The system  might also provide navigation information via the cart's display to assist guests in finding certain exhibits within the zoo. Furthermore, a zoo, or other retail establishment, might encourage traffic throughout the zoo by offering virtual points for visiting a certain number of exhibits. This might be packaged as a collect-the-animals game. An animal is collected so-to-speak when the cart's rider penetrates a geofenced exhibit area. The game's points may translate to discounts at the zoo's gift shop or tied to virtual merit badges that promote subsequent return trips to the zoo or other retail establishment.","In still another embodiment, the system may store cart positioning and timestamp data in order to enable subsequent analysis of cart traffic patterns and guardian behavior. Such data may be valuable to retail establishments or amusement parks to help optimize traffic flow or to help determine efficacy of advertising and store location. For example, the length of time someone spends at an exhibit or within a shop might be determined by identifying when a cart is stationary for several minutes outside of a shop or identifying a cart whose rider and guardian left the cart together (determined via relative proximity to smart bands) without triggering an alarm condition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","406","402","402","404","406","410","406","404","412","406","402","406","402","406","402","406","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","506","504","506","504","502","506","504","502","506","504","504","504","504","540","540","504"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","600","604","602","604","602","600","602","612","606","602","608","602","602","600","614"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","710","708","706","702","704","300","702","702"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","804","802","804","802","808","810"]},"In some embodiments, the master unit may be hitched to a trailer or non-motorized shopping cart that is used to transport the personal effects or shopping items of the rider or guardian.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","902","902","904","906","908","904","904","902","908","906","912"]},"The system of the present invention can be implemented on a networked computing device platform that is capable of local or remote access by a user.

In state , the cart's maximum speed is reduced to a preconfigured top speed. A low speed zone may correspond to certain high-traffic areas in a retail space or around dangerous areas like an escalator. This could also be used at a zoo or outdoor location where a cart might be allowed higher speeds between exhibits and require lower speeds in a high traffic zone (i.e. food court). While the cart remains in the low speed zone, the rider can alter the speed of the cart (including halting the cart) but cannot accelerate above the preconfigured top speed. The cart leaves the low speed zone state  when the rider steers the cart out of the zone, triggering an event , or if the guardian transmits a custom throttle setting in event . A guardian uses a remote control to set a custom throttle setting for an associated motorized passenger cart. The remote control may be a touch-screen device such as a smart phone or tablet. Or, the guardian's smart band may double as a controller and be configured with a slow-speed switch or a variable throttle. Most systems  will be configured such that the custom throttle setting cannot exceed the maximum speed limit associated with a low speed zone. The cart returns to a normal operating state  when the guardian removes the throttle restrictions in event .","In the event  that the cart strays too far from the associated guardian, the cart will enter an out-of-range state where the maximum speed of the cart is reduced proportional to the cart's distance from the guardian. In other words, the cart is slowed the farther it travels from the guardian. If the guardian closes the distance, the cart's maximum speed is increased until the cart transitions back to its normal operating state . When the cart leaves the operating area in event , the cart will enter out-of-operating-area state , disable itself, and enable GPS tracking if it is not already enabled.","In the event  that the cart detects its proximity to a restricted area, the cart will enter a near-restricted-area state  where its maximum speed will be limited. In the event  that the cart is steered away from the restricted area, the cart will return to its normal operating state . On the other hand, in the event  the cart continues into a restricted area, the cart's maximum speed will be reduced to zero in its restricted state . The cart will remain in a restricted state  until the cart is removed from the restricted area  and transitions to a normal operating state .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1202","1204","1206","1220","1208","1210","1212","1214","1216","1220","1204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1302","1304","1306"]},"The cart will also alert the operator, at step , that the cart has left the operating area. The notification may be actively relayed using a wireless radio or cellular device when the cart leaves the operating area, or the departure may be inferred by the absence of in-operating-area-heartbeat. In other words, if the cart does not verify that it is still in the operating area within a designated window, a monitoring server will notify the operator that the cart has gone missing. The notification may be any form of electronic message such as an entry in a database, an email, a text, an on screen pop-up, or any mechanism suitable for alerting a user. A similar notification may be dispatched to a guardian associated with the cart at step . A notification may be displayed on a computing device such as a smart phone, smart watch, laptop, tablet, or wearable device. At step , an alarm on the cart is activated. The alarm may be any auditory or visual emission that is suitably loud or bright enough to attract the attention of passersby. The alarm and theft deterrent steps  through  persist until a cart operator resets the device at step . To restore primary cart functionality, a method such as a software unlock key must be provided by an authorized cart operator or manufacturer to restore the cart to normal operation. The battery  may be encased in a tamper proof enclosure that is designed to trigger the lockdown of the cart before power can be cut. Once the cart operator completes the necessary unlocking protocol, the cart resumes its normal operating mode at step .","The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.
