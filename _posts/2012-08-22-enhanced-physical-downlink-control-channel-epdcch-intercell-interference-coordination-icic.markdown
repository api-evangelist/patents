{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/612,188, filed Mar. 16, 2012.","Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node (e.g., a transmission station) and a wireless device (e.g., a mobile device). Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) in a downlink (DL) transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in an uplink (UL) transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), and the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.","In 3GPP radio access network (RAN) LTE systems, the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) Node Bs (also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs, enhanced Node Bs, eNodeBs, or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs), which communicates with the wireless device, known as a user equipment (UE). The downlink (DL) transmission can be a communication from the node (or eNodeB) to the wireless device (or UE), and the uplink (UL) transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.","In LTE, data can be transmitted from the eNode B to the UE via a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). A physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) can be used to transfer downlink control information (DCI) that informs the UE about resource allocations or scheduling related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH, uplink resource grants, and uplink power control commands. The PDCCH can be transmitted prior the PDSCH in each subframe transmitted from the eNode B to the UE.","The PDCCH signal can be designed to be demodulated at the UE based on a cell specific reference signal (CRS). However, the use of a CRS does not take into account the increased complexities of advanced LTE systems. For instance, in heterogeneous networks, multiple nodes can simultaneously transmit within a single cell. The use of the cell specific reference signal can limit advanced techniques to increase cell capacity.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.","Example Embodiments","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The communication of data on the PDSCH can be controlled via a control channel, referred to as a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). The PDCCH can be used for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) resource assignments, transmit power commands, and paging indicators. The PDSCH scheduling grant can be designated to a particular wireless device (e.g., UE) for dedicated PDSCH resource allocation to carry UE-specific traffic, or it can be designated to all wireless devices in the cell for common PDSCH resource allocation to carry broadcast control information such as system information or paging.","In one example, the PDCCH and PDSCH can represent elements of a radio frame structure transmitted on the physical (PHY) layer in a downlink transmission between a node (e.g., eNodeB) and the wireless device (e.g., UE) using a generic long term evolution (LTE) frame structure, as illustrated in FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","100","110","120","120","0","120","160","166","1","120"],"sub":["f","slot"],"i":["i ","a ","b","a ","b "]},"Each slot for a component carrier (CC) used by the node and the wireless device can include multiple resource blocks (RBs) , , , , and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. The CC can have a carrier frequency having a bandwidth and center frequency. Each subframe of the CC can include downlink control information (DCI) found in the legacy PDCCH. The legacy PDCCH in the control region can include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or RB, when a legacy PDCCH is used. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols (or 14 OFDM symbols, when legacy PDCCH is not used) in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data (for short or normal cyclic prefix).","Each RB (physical RB or PRB) can include 12-15 kHz subcarriers  (on the frequency axis) and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols  (on the time axis) per slot. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements (REs) using short or normal cyclic prefixing, or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs (not shown) using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol  by one subcarrier (i.e., 15 kHz) .","Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Other types of modulation may be used, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE, or bi-phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits (a single bit) in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE, or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.","Each wireless device may use at least one signal bandwidth, carrier bandwidth, or component carrier (CC), as illustrated in . For example, the LTE CC bandwidths can include: 1.4 MHz , 3 MHz , 5 MHz , 10 MHz , 15 MHz , and 20 MHz . The 1.4 MHz CC can include 6 RBs comprising 72 subcarriers. The 3 MHz CC can include 15 RBs comprising 180 subcarriers. The 5 MHz CC can include 25 RBs comprising 300 subcarriers. The 10 MHz CC can include 50 RBs comprising 600 subcarriers. The 15 MHz CC can include 75 RBs comprising 900 subcarriers. The 20 MHz CC can include 100 RBs comprising 1200 subcarriers.","The data carried on the PDCCH can be referred to as downlink control information (DCI). Multiple wireless devices can be scheduled in one subframe of a radio frame. Therefore, multiple DCI messages can be sent using multiple PDCCHs. The DCI information in a PDCCH can be transmitted using one or more control channel elements (CCE). A CCE can be comprised of a group of resource element groups (REGs). A legacy CCE can include up to nine REGs. Each REG can be comprised of four resource elements (REs). Each resource element can include two bits of information when quadrature modulation is used. Therefore, a legacy CCE can include up to 72 bits of information. When more than 72 bits of information are needed to convey the DCI message, multiple CCEs can be employed. The use of multiple CCEs can be referred to as an aggregation level. In one example, the aggregation levels can be defined as 1, 2, 4 or 8 consecutive CCEs allocated to one PDCCH.","The legacy PDCCH can create limitations to advances made in other areas of wireless communication. For example, mapping of CCEs to subframes in OFDM symbols is typically spread over the control region to provide spatial diversity. However, no beam forming diversity may be possible with the current mapping procedures. In addition, interference coordination with neighboring cells may not be possible using current mapping procedures since orthogonality cannot be guaranteed among neighboring cells, thereby resulting in potential subcarrier collisions occurring.","Moreover, the capacity of the legacy PDCCH may not be sufficient for advanced control signaling. For instance, networks may be configured as heterogeneous networks (HetNets) can include a number of different kinds of nodes in a single macro cell serving area. More wireless devices can be served simultaneously by macro and pico cells in the HetNet. The PDCCH can be designed to demodulate based on cell-specific reference signals (CRS), which can make fully exploring cell splitting gain difficult. The legacy PDCCH may not be adequate to convey the information needed to allow a wireless device to take advantage of the multiple transmission nodes in the HetNet to increase bandwidth and decrease battery usage at the wireless device.","In addition, the use of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO), machine to machine communication (M2M), PDSCH transmission in a multicast\\broadcast single-frequency network, and cross carrier scheduling in carrier aggregation can require increased capacity for the PDCCH. The use of UE specific reference signals (UERS) in PDCCH demodulation at the wireless device can allow the use of multiple nodes in the HetNet. Rather than relying on a single common reference symbol (e.g., CRS) for an entire cell, each reference symbol can be UE specific (e.g., UERS).","To overcome the limitations of the legacy PDCCH, an enhanced PDCCH (ePDCCH) can use the REs in an entire PRB or PRB pair (where a PRB pair is two contiguous PRBs using the same subcarrier's subframe), instead of just the first one to three columns of OFDM symbols in a first slot PRB in a subframe as in the legacy PDCCH. Accordingly, the ePDCCH can be configured with increased capacity to allow advances in the design of cellular networks and to minimize currently known challenges.","The ePDCCH can be used to support frequency domain inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC). In an example, ICIC can be used to decrease interference between neighboring cells or nodes (e.g., coordination nodes or cooperation nodes) by lowering the power of a part of the subchannels in the frequency domain which then can be received close to the node. The subchannels do not interfere with the same subchannels used in neighboring cells and thus, data can be sent to mobile devices with less interference on the subchannels close to the cell.","Another ICIC technique is enhanced ICIC (eICIC) used in the time domain for heterogeneous networks (HetNets), where a high power macro cell can be complemented with low power nodes such as pico cells (hotspots in shopping centers or at airports) or femto cells (hotspots in small areas such as homes or businesses). The low power nodes can exist inside a macro cell coverage area. The macro cell can transmit long range high power signals, and the low power nodes can transmit low power signals over short distances. In an example to mitigate interference between the macro cell and the several low power nodes located within the macro cell coverage area, eICIC can coordinate the blanking of subframes in the time domain in the macro cell. As used herein, a cell can refer to the node (e.g., eNB) configured to communicate with wireless devices within a geographic region that is referred to as a cell coverage area.","Unlike the legacy PDCCH, the ePDCCH can be mapped to the same REs or region in a PRB as the PDSCH, but in different PRBs. In an example, the PDSCH and the ePDCCH may not be multiplexed within a same PRB (or a same PRB pair). Thus if one PRB (or one PRB pair) contains an ePDCCH, the unused REs in the PRB (or PRB pair) may be blanked, since the REs may not be used for the PDSCH.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["182","184","186","188","128","1","162","170","172","174","1","2","172","174","3","4"]},"The PRB or PRB pair can be used to support both localized ePDCCH and distributed ePDCCH transmissions.  illustrate localized ePDCCH and distributed ePDCCH in a slot or a subframe. In a localized ePDCCH -, the entire CCE -may be within a PRB and (or PRB pair) within a subband and , as illustrated in . In an example, the REGs (or REs) of the localized CCE can be contiguous to each other, which may be followed by a subsequent CCE. In a distributed ePDCCH -, the REGs -, -, -, -, -, -, -, and -of the CCE -can be distributed over multiple PRBs and (or PRB pairs). The REG(s) in one PRB and the REG(s) in another PRB can form the CCE for the DCI or the distributed ePDCCH. In distributed ePDCCH, the REGs for a CCE can be distributed over two or more PRBs (or two or more PRB pairs). In an example, the REGs of the CCEs used in the distributed ePDCCH can be distributed over different subbands and ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},"A localized ePDCCH  having aggregation level (AGL) one can be mapped to a single CCE, which can be mapped to a single RB, as shown in . Similarly, a localized ePDCCH  with an aggregation level of two may be mapped to two contiguous CCEs in a RB. For a distributed ePDCCH  and , the CCE(s) (e.g. CCE  and CCE N) can mapped to a plurality of REGs in different RBs in different frequency carriers and subcarriers. For example, the REGs for the CCE N can be distributed in frequency. The frequency separation of the REGs can provide a frequency diversity gain. In an example, each REG in a CCE may be mapped to a separate RB, although more than one REG may be mapped to a same RB as another REG. A greater frequency diversity gain that can occur with widely distributed the REGs. The REGs in CCE  and CCE N may have the same distribution (shown) or different distribution (not shown) amongst RBs in a subframe. While the REGs illustrated in the distributed ePDCCH  and  are each shown to be in the same time position within a RB, for each respective CCE, a same time position within a RB for the distributed ePDCCH is not required. The distributed REGs in CCE  and CCE N may be in a different temporal location within a resource block. Each CCE in a subframe may have a same number of REGs or a different number of REGs. The distributed ePDCCH can have an aggregation level of one. The aggregation level of one implies that the DCI information can be mapped to a single CCE.","The distribution of the REGs in a CCE over frequency to different resource blocks in a subframe can provide an increase in frequency diversity gain. To achieve good frequency diversity, a frequency diversity order of 3 or 4 can be used.  illustrates a distributed ePDCCH  and  transmission a high frequency diversity order and low aggregation level.","Frequency diversity for a cell can be achieved by applying wideband scheduling with wideband channel state information (CSI) feedback. For example, an ePDCCH configuration can be configured with four PRB pairs in each cell to achieve a frequency diversity order four using distributed ePDCCH transmission.","Since the legacy frequency domain ICIC schemes may only support PRB pair level ICIC, if a frequency domain ICIC scheme for ePDCCH ICIC is used, more PRB pairs may be muted in the neighboring cells (e.g., coordination cells) for PDSCH transmission.  gives an example of ePDCCH configurations with three cells (e.g., cells A, B, and C) where each cell is configured with four PRBs for ePDCCH. To achieve a frequency diversity order of four and a frequency reuse factor of three in frequency domain ICIC, each cell allocates 12 PRBs in total that are used exclusively for ePDCCH and the cell's ICIC.  illustrates PRB bundling or resource block grouping for a system bandwidth of 10 MHz (e.g., 50 PRBs -; see  of ) with 12 PRBs (or 4 resource block groups (RBG) , and ) allocated for ePDCCH and the cells' ICIC and the remaining 38 PRBs (or 13 RBG ----, and -) allocated to PDSCH. Each RBG can be allocated to a subset , , or  (-). In an example, each subset can represent a cell (e.g., cell A, B, or C).","In , the 50 PRBs can be represented by PRB - (for PRBs from PRB  to PRB  ) and PRB - (for PRBs from PRB  to PRB  ). Since ePDCCH can be allocated based on a PRB basis (or PRB pair basis, each cell can include a dedicated ePDCCH -, and four dedicated ePDCCH for a frequency diversity order of four. The unused PRBs used for coordination cell ePDCCH (cell B and C ePDCCH for cell A transmissions) can be blanked, which may not be an efficient use of resources. In the example with a frequency diversity order of four and a frequency reuse factor of three in frequency domain ICIC, 8 PRBs of the 50 PRBs for a 10 MHz system bandwidth may be blanked, which cannot be used for PDSCH transmissions.","To achieve both high frequency diversity order and meaningful frequency reuse factor for frequency domain ICIC at the same time, an ePDCCH with a finer granularity than one PRB (or one PRB pair) can be used for greater resource utilization, which can be used for frequency domain ICIC. For example the frequency domain granularity for ePDCCH ICIC can be as fine as one localized CCE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["192","194","196","198"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["230","220","12"],"i":["e","h "]},"In order to enable intra-PRB (or intra-PRB pair) ICIC for ePDCCH, the localized CCE to RE mapping pattern may be cell common. Thus no cell-specific random mapping may be defined for the localized CCE. Intra-PRB (or intra-PRB pair) ICIC for ePDCCH can refer to a plurality of localized CCE in one PRB (or PRB pair) being used for different cells.","Distributed CCEs (not shown) can also be used where the REGs (or REs) of the CCEs are distributed over multiple PRBs (or PRB pairs). When mapping one distributed CCE to REs from multiple PRBs (or PRB pairs), REs belonging to the same localized CCE can be mapped to each PRB (or PRB pair). For example in , each PRB pair contains four localized CCE , , , and  () and each cell is configured with four PRB pairs -() for ePDCCH. Mapping a distributed CCE to a same localized CCE in each of the PRB pairs (in the four PRB pairs) allows the distributed CCE to achieve the same CCE granularity ICIC gain as a localized CCE.","To support frequency domain ICIC with a finer granularity than one PRB pair, a relative narrowband transmitter (Tx) power (RNTP) report in X2 application protocol can be extended. For example, a relative narrowband transmitter power (RNTP) per enhanced CCE (E-CCE) in ePDCCH information element (IE) can be added to the RNTP report to support CCE granularity ICIC for ePDCCH. The E-CCE can include a localized CCE for ePDCCH. The RNTP per E-CCE in ePDCCH IE can include an IE\/group name (RNTP per E-CCE in ePDCCH), a presence, a range, an IE type and reference, a semantics description, a criticality, and an assigned criticality. The presence for the RNTP per E-CCE in ePDCCH IE can include a mandatory (M) presence. The RNTP per E-CCE in ePDCCH IE can include an bit string (1 . . . 4, . . . ) IE type, where (semantics description) each position in the bitmap represents a E-CCE index nvalue, for which a bit value represents RNTP (n), where an index is associated with a set of E-CCE, numbered from 0 to N\u22121, Nis a total number of E-CCE for a subframe k, and RNTP ( ) is a function of the E-CCE index n. A value 0 can indicate \u201cTx not exceeding RNTP threshold\u201d, and a value 1 can indicate \u201cno promise on the Tx power is given\u201d.","In an example, if the RNTP per E-CCE in ePDCCH IE only contains 4 bits, then the eNB can apply the same power strategy for the same E-CCE for all ePDCCH in the PRB pair. More flexibility can be allowed if the RNTP per E-CCE in ePDCCH IE contains more than 4 bits. For example, a total of 4*N_ePDCCH_PRBs bits may be used, if the eNB is allowed to apply a different power control strategy for each individual E-CCE in each PRB pair, where N_ePDCCH_PRBs represents a total number of PRB (or PRB pairs) used for ePDCCH.","In one example embodiment, a node (e.g., eNB) can receive a relative narrowband transmitter power (RNTP) indication RNTP(n) defined as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"RNTP","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["n","SRB"]}}},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","A"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["n","SRB"]}}},"msubsup":{"mi":"E","mrow":[{"mi":["ma","x","_","norm"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}]}}},"mo":"\u2264","msub":{"mi":["RNTP","threshold"]}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mrow":{"mi":["if","no","promise","about","the","upper","limit","of","is","made"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","A"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["n","SRB"]}}},"msubsup":{"mi":"E","mrow":[{"mi":["ma","x","_","norm"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}]}}}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":["A","SRB","SRB ","SRB","RB","SRB","threshold ","threshold"],"sup":"DL"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":"E","mrow":[{"mi":["ma","x","_","nom"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":"P","mrow":[{"mi":["ma","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}]},"mo":"\u00b7","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","f"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},{"msubsup":[{"mi":["N","RB","DL"]},{"mi":["N","SC","RB"]}],"mo":"\u00b7"}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["max","RB","SC","SC","SRB ","SRB"],"sup":["(p) ","DL ","RB","RB "]},"An E-CCE RNTP (e.g., RNTP per E-CCE in ePDCCH IE) and\/or ePDCCH PRB allocations and configurations can be included in X2 signaling.

The IEs described can be transmitted between coordination nodes (e.g., the serving node and other coordination nodes). The information from the described IEs can be transmitted or forwarded from a serving node (e.g., eNB) to the serving wireless devices (e.g., UEs) served by the serving node using radio resource control (RRC) signaling.","The wireless device (e.g., UE) can use the ePDCCH PRB allocations and ePDCCH configuration information in an advanced receiver. An advanced receiver can include a minimum mean square error with interference rejection combining (MMSE-IRC) receiver to measure interference on the UERS and use an averaging of the interference for each individual data RE. For example, typically when an ePDCCH is transmitted in one cell, a neighboring cell (e.g., coordination cell) can be transmitting PDSCH in the same PRB pair. When doing interference averaging for the PDSCH, the wireless device may not use the interference averaging of the UERS REs because the interference covariance matrix observed in each UERS REs may overlap with a different E-CCE.","If the wireless device receives ePDCCH configuration information, such as a map of the CCE in the ePDCCH for ICIC, that the neighboring cell is transmitting ePDCCH in a PRB pair and knows the ePDCCH configurations for the neighboring cell, the wireless device can average the interference E-CCE by E-CCE (i.e., per E-CCE) in an advanced receiver.","The granularity of a localized CCE allocated an ePDCCH can provide greater resource utilization than a PRB (or PRB pair) for an ePDCCH in some applications, such as frequency domain ICIC.
