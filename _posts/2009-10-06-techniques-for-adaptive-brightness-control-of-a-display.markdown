{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A mobile computing device such as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone or smart phone generally may provide voice and data communication functionality as well as computing and processing capabilities. Mobile computing devices typically include some form of electronic display with a backlight designed to emit light and therefore offer varying levels of brightness. In many cases, brightness levels for the display may be modified based on different ambient light situations to provide a more comfortable viewing experience. For instance, ambient light levels may be dynamic, changing over time or as the display is moved to a different location. Variations in ambient light affect a perceived brightness of the electronic display, causing the display to look too dim in a bright area and too bright in a dark area. Brightness levels for a display of a mobile computing device may be increased or decreased to accommodate dynamic changes in ambient light conditions to provide a consistent level of brightness. Enhanced techniques to manage brightness levels for a display in response to changes in ambient light conditions may therefore provide an enhanced viewing experience. It is with respect to these and other advantages that the present improvements are made.","Various embodiments are generally directed to adaptive brightness control techniques for electronic displays of a mobile computing device, such as a smart phone. Some embodiments are particularly directed to automatically and continuously modifying brightness levels for an electronic display based on ambient light levels and changes in pupil size of a human eye.","To enhance viewing experience, various embodiments implement an adaptive brightness control technique that calculates new brightness levels and varies a timed ramp between brightness levels in accordance with changes in pupil size for a human eye. A pupil generally changes in size according to various intensities of ambient light. This phenomenon is referred to as the pupillary light reflex. The pupillary light reflex causes pupil size to increase as ambient light levels decrease to allow more light to enter the eye. Conversely, the pupillary light reflex causes pupil size to decrease as ambient light levels increase to allow less light to enter the eye to prevent aberrations of light rays and thus attain its expected acuity. The rate of change in pupil size differs depending on whether there is an increase or decrease in ambient light levels. In general, pupil size changes faster in response to increases in brightness than to decreases in brightness. Various adaptive brightness control techniques may utilize a novel conversion algorithm that generates target brightness levels and a timed ramp based on one or more pupil size response curves. In this manner, a mobile computing device may reduce eyestrain from glare and reflection and provide a more consistent viewing experience. Furthermore, a mobile computing device may improve power conservation by saving power for a battery in lower lighting areas, extending a useful life for an electronic display and its components (e.g., a backlight) by extending mean time between failure, and other advantages as well.","Various embodiments include physical or logical structures arranged to perform certain operations, functions or services.

To assist a viewer in reading displayed information, the display  may have a backlight mechanism arranged to emit light of varying levels of brightness or luminance. The amount of brightness may vary for any number of reasons. For instance, a viewer may use one or both of the applications ,  to automatically manage brightness levels based on any number of user defined settings. For instance, a user may define a setting to control a length of time a backlight for the display  remains active whenever an I\/O device  has not received any user input. This may be desirable to conserve power provided by the battery , for example. A viewer may also manually adjust brightness levels to accommodate different types of displayed information or ambient light conditions.","The mobile computing device  may control the display  using the display control module . The display control module  may generally control operations for the display . As the display  consumes a relatively large amount of power relative to other components of the mobile computing device , the display control module  is designed to coordinate with the power management module  in order to implement various power conservation techniques. Further, the display control module  may send control directives to the power management module  to increase or decrease power supplied to the display  to increase or decrease brightness levels for the display .","The display control module  may be arranged to automatically modify brightness levels for the display  based on ambient light level measurements. The display  includes a backlight designed to emit light and therefore offer varying levels of brightness. The display control module  automatically changes brightness levels for the display  based on different ambient light situations to provide a more comfortable viewing experience.

The display control module  may increase or decrease brightness levels for the display  to accommodate dynamic changes in ambient light conditions to provide a consistent level of brightness for the display . By automatically managing brightness levels for the display  in response to changes in ambient light conditions, the display control module  and the mobile computing device  provides several advantages such as improving power conservation by saving power for the battery  in lower lighting areas, extending a useful life for the display  and its components (e.g., a backlight) by extending mean time between failure, providing an enhanced viewing experience for a user by reducing eyestrain from glare and reflection, and other advantages as well.

The display control module  may be particularly arranged to modify brightness levels for the display  based on ambient light level measurements and changes in pupil size of a human eye. By modifying brightness levels to accommodate changes in pupil size of a human eye as a reaction to changes in ambient light levels, a user may have a more comfortable viewing experience. For instance, the display control module  may gradually adjust brightness at a rate that matches a rate of change in pupil size of a user to provide a more consistent perceived brightness for the user of the display .","One or more ambient light sensors  may be used to measure ambient light levels around the mobile computing device . The one or more ambient light sensors  may measure ambient light levels for one or more defined fields proximate to the mobile computing device. Each ambient light sensor  may measure (or sample) ambient light levels on a continuous, periodic, aperiodic, continuous or on-demand basis. Any suitable ambient light sensor capable of detecting changes in visible light may be used, such as an array of PiN diodes implemented on a substrate, for example. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","Each ambient light sensor  may be positioned somewhere on the mobile computing device  to measure ambient light levels that might affect a user viewing content exposed on the display . In one embodiment, for example, a single ambient light sensor  may be placed on a front side of the mobile computing device  having the display . This allows the ambient light sensor  to measure ambient light levels from light sources behind a viewer, such as a sun or overhead light. In one embodiment, for example, a first ambient light sensor  may be placed on the front side and a second ambient light sensor  may be placed on a back side of the mobile computing device . This configuration may allow the first and second ambient light sensors  to measure ambient light levels from light sources behind a viewer and in front of a viewer. The latter configuration may be desirable, for example, when the mobile computing device  is operating in a camera mode using the display  as a viewfinder on the front side of the mobile computing device , and a camera lens on the back side of the mobile computing device . The exact number and placement of ambient light sensors  may be a design consideration and may vary for a given implementation.","The luminance module  may be generally arranged to convert ambient light level measurements to display brightness control values for the display  of the mobile computing device . For instance, the luminance module  may receive ambient light level measurements from the various ambient light sensors , combine them using a weighted average or other statistical average, convert the received ambient light level measurements to control directives in the form of display brightness control values, and output the display brightness control values to the power management module  and\/or the display . The power management module  may then increase or decrease an amount of power provided to the display  by the battery  and\/or the charger  via the PMIC  to cause a corresponding increase or decrease in brightness levels for the display  based on the brightness control values.","When a difference between a current brightness level and a target brightness level for the display  is above a defined threshold, a timed ramp may be used to move from the current brightness level to the target brightness level to allow a smoother transition for a viewer, thereby avoiding an abrupt change in brightness levels. The timed ramp is usually a linear ramp. More complex implementations may use a varying slope ramp that increases from zero at a beginning time to some maximum rate and then back to zero at an ending time. However, these approaches do not account for reaction of human eyes to changes in ambient light levels and\/or brightness levels.","In various embodiments, display brightness control values may be derived using one or more aspects of a human eye, such as a rate of change in pupil size in response to ambient light. In one embodiment, for example, the luminance module  may convert ambient light level measurements to brightness control values using at least one pupil size response curve --. The pupil size response curves --represent different changes in pupil size over time in response to changes in ambient light levels. The pupil size response curves --may be stored using a data structure such as a look-up table (LUT) in memory , with a LUT associating one or more ambient light level measurements with one or more pupil sizes. Additionally or alternatively, the pupil size response curves --may be dynamically computed using a mathematical formula. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","To enhance viewing experience the luminance module  may use a conversion algorithm that varies a timed ramp in accordance with changes in pupil size for a human eye. A pupil changes in size according to various intensities of ambient light. This phenomenon is referred to as the pupillary light reflex. The pupillary light reflex causes pupil size to increase as ambient light levels decrease to allow more light to enter the eye. Conversely, the pupillary light reflex causes pupil size to decrease as ambient light levels increase to allow less light to enter the eye to prevent aberrations of light rays and thus attain its expected acuity. The rate of change in pupil size differs depending on whether there is an increase or decrease in ambient light levels. In general, pupil size changes faster in response to increases in brightness than to decreases in brightness. The luminance module  may utilize a conversion algorithm that generates target brightness levels and a timed ramp based on one or more of the pupil size response curves --","In one embodiment, for example, the luminance module  may implement a conversion algorithm to determine a first target pupil size based on the ambient light level measurements received from the ambient light sensor , compare the target pupil size with a current pupil size, select a pupil size response curve --based on the comparison, determine a second target pupil size from the selected pupil size response curve, and convert the second target pupil size to one or more display brightness control values for the display  using the selected pupil size response curve.
