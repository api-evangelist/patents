title: Unified and best messaging systems for communication devices
abstract: A unified messaging system which can provide messaging services for a plurality of different “message types” is disclosed. The unified messaging system can serve as a single interface to a number of messaging services provided by various messaging components which use different message types (e.g., mail server). A unified message type is implemented and presented to a user as an abstract message. In addition, the unified messaging system can automatically determine, based on a first selected feature, if one or more message types should be used. A particular message type can also be automatically selected as a “best message type” based on one or more selected options.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","APPENDIX A"],"p":["This application takes priority of the U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/525,564, filed on Nov. 26, 2003, entitled \u201cBest Messaging,\u201d which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","The present invention relates to communication systems, and more particularly, to a messaging system used for exchanging information between various communication environments.","Modern communication systems facilitate communication of information in many forms and between various communication devices (e.g., computers, wireless terminals or devices, cellular telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants, etc.). Given the popularity of modern communication systems, extensive efforts have been made by a number of entities to provide users with increasingly better communication devices. These devices, among other things, provide a messaging system that allows users to exchange information. The messaging system can serve as an interface to a messaging services provided by a particular messaging provider or messaging server.","Typically, handheld communication devices have a relatively small amount of display space available in comparison to desktop devices (e.g., a personal desktop computer). Hence, the same solutions used to solve problems encountered in the desktop environment, may not be as effective for the handheld communication devices.","Moreover, the large number of different \u201cmessage types\u201d used today has introduced new challenges. A \u201cmessage type\u201d may, for example, pertain to a particular messaging protocol (e.g., SMS\/EMS, WAP 275\/276, imode mail, SMTP, POP3) and\/or message formats (e.g., text, slideshow). This means that many message types can be formed, for example, when a particular message format is used with a particular messaging protocol. By way of example, considering only two message protocols SMS and MMS, many message types can be appropriately used (e.g., SMS-Text, SMS-Rich (EMS), MMS-slideshow (SMIL), MMS-multipart (inline)). Each message type has its own technical capabilities, limitations, and other particular attributes (e.g., message size limit, cost). Moreover, some message protocols may not support a particular format. These complexities have negatively affected the experience of the users of modern messaging systems. Typically, these users have to learn about various messaging interfaces (e.g., SMSC, MMSC, I-mode server, SMTP server, POP server). As a result, some users of messaging systems had to learn the technical capabilities and limitations of various message protocols, formats, and other technical details in order to exchange messages. Other users have often been frustrated and\/or confused when a feature (or option) that is inappropriate and\/or not desired has been selected.","Accordingly, there is a need for alternative messaging system.","Broadly speaking, the invention relates to a messaging system in a computing environment that may include a plurality of different \u201cmessage types\u201d. A \u201cmessage type\u201d may, for example, pertain to a particular messaging protocol and\/or message format. In general, a message type has one or more distinguishable characteristics which may be entirely based on form or conventions used to process the message.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a unified messaging system can provide messaging services in a computing environment that may include a plurality of different \u201cmessage types\u201d. As will be appreciated, the unified messaging system can serve as a single interface to a number of messaging services provided by various messaging components which use different message types (e.g., mail server).","In one embodiment, the unified message system generates a unified message type which can be implemented and presented to a user as an abstract message that does not pertain to a particular message type. In addition, the unified messaging system can provide the user with a set of abstract features (or options) that the user can select without having to know or identify a particular message type. The abstract features can, for example, include a set of abstract operations that can be performed on a abstract message (e.g., send, receive, attach, slideshow, acknowledge receipt, phone), as well as other components which may be useful in a messaging environment, and possibly combined with one or more abstract operations (e.g., \u201csend bob, \u201csend bob acknowledgment receipt,\u201d send bob slideshow\u201d). Moreover, the unified messaging system can automatically determine, based on a first selected feature, if one or more message types should be used. Message types that should not be used are automatically eliminated and the user can be presented only with a set of options that are still viable based on what has already been selected. In addition, a particular message type is automatically selected as a \u201cbest message type\u201d based on one or more abstract selected options. The unified message can then be transformed to a particular message type (i.e., best message type) and transmitted. It should be noted that a particular message type may also be transformed to an abstract message which is presented to the user. In any case, a user can use a single messaging interface to services provided by various messaging servers. In addition, the user may use the services without having to know or select a particular message type as an appropriate message type can be automatically selected for the user. It should also be noted that only viable features (or options) can be displayed for the user in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As a result, the user of the messaging system is not confronted with many potentially inappropriate features (or options). Hence, the user's experience is significantly improved and user will be free form learning the technical limitations and capabilities associated with various message types.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a method, an apparatus, and computer readable media. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.","The invention pertains to a messaging system in a computing environment that may include a plurality of different \u201cmessage types\u201d. A \u201cmessage type\u201d may, for example, pertain to a particular messaging protocol and\/or message format. In general, a message type has one or more distinguishable characteristics which may be entirely based on form or conventions used to process the message.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a unified messaging system can provide messaging services in a computing environment that may include a plurality of different \u201cmessage types\u201d. As will be appreciated, the unified messaging system can serve as a single interface to a number of messaging services provided by various messaging components which use different message types (e.g., mail server).","In one embodiment, the unified message system generates a unified message type which can be implemented and presented to a user as an abstract message that does not pertain to a particular message type. In addition, the unified messaging system can provide the user with a set of abstract features (or options) that the user can select without having to know or identify a particular message type. The abstract features can, for example, include a set of abstract operations that can be performed on a abstract message (e.g., send, receive, attach, slideshow, acknowledge receipt, phone), as well as other components which may be useful in a messaging environment and possibly combined with one or more abstract operations (e.g., \u201csend bob,\u201d \u201csend bob acknowledge receipt,\u201d \u201csend bob slideshow\u201d). Moreover, the unified messaging system can automatically determine, based on a first selected feature, if one or more message types should be used. Message types that should not be used are automatically eliminated and the user can be presented only with a set of options that are still viable based on what has already been selected. In addition, a particular message type is automatically selected as a \u201cbest message type\u201d based on one or more abstract selected options. The unified message can then be transformed to a particular message type (i.e., best message type) and transmitted. It should be noted that a particular message type may also be transformed to an abstract message which is presented to the user. In any case, a user can use a single messaging interface to services provided by various messaging servers. In addition, the user may use the services without having to know or select a particular message type as an appropriate message type can be automatically selected for the user. It should also be noted that only viable features (or options) can be displayed for the user in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As a result, the user of the messaging system is not confronted with many potentially inappropriate features (or options). Hence, the user's experience is significantly improved and user will be free form learning the technical limitations and capabilities associated with various message types.","Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference to . However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","102","103","103","103","102","100","104","106","108"]},"For ease of illustration, the enhanced communication device  is depicted in  as providing a unified messaging system . However, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the operations related to unified messaging system  can entirely or partially be performed at the server . Alternatively, the unified messaging system  can be implemented as a part of the hardware and\/or software in the enhanced communication device . In any case, the unified messaging system  provides a unified messaging environment where various protocols and message types may be integrated. Moreover, in the integrated environment provided by the unified messaging system , the user does not have to learn about the capabilities and limitations of various protocols and\/or message types that can be used to exchange messages partly because a unified messaging system is provided. In addition, the unified messaging system  provides many other features which further enhance the user's experience. These features include a unified inbox for storing various types of messages, and a \u201cbest messaging\u201d feature that, among other things, displays a selected set of viable options for the user based on the options that the user has already selected. Furthermore, the \u201cbest messaging\u201d feature can automatically select the appropriate mechanism (e.g., protocol, message type) to perform a desired option (delivering a message, viewing a message, etc.). \u201cBest messaging\u201d is further described below.","To further illustrate,  depicts a unified messaging system  in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As shown in , several architectural levels that may be used to implement the unified messaging system . These architectural levels include: unified messenger , application programming interface (API) , device software  and device hardware . The unified messenger  uses the API  as an interface to device software  which in turn interacts with a device hardware . Thus, the unified messenger  can perform various messaging tasks (e.g., send, receive messages) via the device hardware . Moreover, the unified messenger  can perform messaging tasks using a variety of protocols (e.g., SMS\/EMS, WAP275\/276, imode mail, SMTP, POP). In other words, a single messaging application, namely, the unified messenger  may be used to interact with various protocols and message types. Hence, a user may be presented with a single unified messenger  to perform various messaging tasks using different messaging protocols and\/or messaging types. In addition, a unified inbox  can be provided for the user. The unified inbox  can be used to store various message types despite the protocols used to transmit them. It should be noted that the unified messaging system  can behave as a client and use various protocols to interact with various messaging servers.","As shown in , the messaging system  also provides an abstract message  and a message encoder\/decoder . The abstract message  can be a conceptual representation of a generic message that may ultimately be mapped to a particular protocol and\/or message form (\u201ca message type\u201d). The message encoder\/decoder  can facilitate the mapping of the abstract message to a particular message type, and vice versa.","Referring now to , the abstract message  is depicted in connection with the message encoder\/decoder . In addition, a set of features  are depicted. The set of features  represents a set of options that may be initially displayed for a user (e.g., send, compose, read, etc.). It should be noted that these set of features  can represent a set of abstract options that are available. In other words, the set of features  do not necessarily pertain to a particular message type. Also, selection of an initial particular feature (e.g. F1) results in storing one or more states (e.g., state 1) in the abstract message . When a state is added to the abstract message , the message encoder\/decoder  determines based on the states currently in the abstract message whether a particular message type can be used. In addition, an updated feature set  may be presented based on this determination. In other words, one or more options may be eliminated based on the states stored in the abstract message . As a result, the user can be provided only with a set of viable options. Moreover, the user does not need to select a particular message type. An appropriate message type can be selected and automatically generated by the message encoder\/decoder . Hence, the user can interact with a set of abstract features without knowing about the specific message types. Options that may not be viable or preferred after a selection of another option can be automatically eliminated and a message type (message protocol and\/or format) can automatically be selected for the user.","It should be noted that the states I-N may be organized, for example, in various categories: composition layout (e.g., attachment, image inlining, slides), formatting (e.g., text, character set), preferences (e.g., priority, recipient acknowledgment), rules (e.g., use MMS if more than two (2) SMS messages have been sent), addressing message (e.g., to alias \u201cBob\u201d): In general, any messaging attribute may be presented with one or more states which may be used to provide the user with a set of viable options. In addition, one or more states of the abstract message can be used to select a particular message type that is ultimately generated for the user.","As shown in , when a feature F1 (\u201cadd slideshow\u201d) is selected, a composition state \u201cadd slideshow\u201d can be added to the abstract message . This can, for example, result in selection of the \u201cmms\/slideshow\u201d message type. It should also be noted that abstract features may also be presented to the user. Referring to , an abstract \u201csend\u201d feature  can be presented to the user. The user then may select another abstract feature (or option), for example \u201cBob\u201d  which can be an email alias. In this example, \u201cBob\u201d is known only as an email address. As a result, the abstract message  will include a state \u201cemail\u201d. Hence, email is automatically selected () to send the message.","As another example, adding a slide would add a new slide layout to the contents of the message. The MMS protocol would understand this new layout and allow it, so MMS remains as a viable option along with all the features of MMS. However, the SMS protocol would not understand this new layout and would reject it, so SMS would not remain a viable option. As another example, on a different message, adding a email address is allowed because SMTP & MMS both enable that feature. Once the email address is added the MMS & SMTP protocol would understand the address type and allow it, so MMS remains as a viable option along with all the features of MMS. The SMS protocol would not understand the address type and would reject it, so SMS would not remain a viable option.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304"]},"In any case, when it is determined () that an abstract feature has been selected , it is determined, based on at least one selected abstract feature, which message type should be used (()) and\/or it is determined whether a set of other abstract features should be displayed (()) for the user. Based on at least one selected feature, it is determined whether one or more features should be displayed. Accordingly, an updated set of features can be displayed () for the user. Thereafter, it can be determined whether another abstract feature has been selected . When it is determined  that no more features should be displayed (i.e., the message should be sent), the abstract message is transformed () to a particular message type so that it can be transmitted () using an appropriate message protocol and message format. The unified messaging method  ends following the transmission  of the message.","To further illustrate,  depicts a message transmission method  for generating and transmitting a message in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, other messaging operations (e.g., receiving and displaying a message) can be implemented in accordance with principles illustrated herein.","Initially, an abstract message is generated (). Next, one or more abstract features (or options) are displayed  for the user selection. When an abstract feature is selected (), one or more states are stored () for the abstract message. Typically, the one or more states have been pre-defined for the selected feature. However, these states may also be dynamically defined at runtime.","In any case, after the one or more states have been stored () in the abstract message, it is determined () whether the abstract message is compatible with a particular message type. Next, it is determined () whether the message type should be eliminated from further consideration. Accordingly, if it is determined () the abstract message type is not compatible with the message type that particular message type is eliminated () from further consideration. Thereafter, it is determined () whether the message should be transmitted. If it is determined () that the message should be transmitted, one or more features that can be selected are determined () and displayed  for the user. It should be noted that these features are determined () based on the remaining viable message types. In other words, message types that have been eliminated () are not considered when it is determined () what options should be displayed. When it is determined () that the message should be transmitted, it is determined () whether one or more message types can be used to transmit the message. If one or more message types may be used to transmit the message, a preferred message type is selected (). The preferred message type can, for example, be selected based on user preferences, or one or more rules which may have been predefined. In any case, the abstract message is transformed () into a particular message type (protocol and\/or format). The message is transmitted () in accordance with a particular message protocol and\/or message format. The message transmission method  ends following the transmission  of the message.","Appendix A provides additional examples that further illustrate best messaging.","The advantages of the invention are numerous. Different embodiments or implementations may have one or more of the following advantages. One advantage of the invention is that users can exchange messages on handheld devices without having to understand numerous message types and protocols. Another advantage of the invention is that less input is required from the user as undesirable options are eliminated. Yet another advantage is that the invention can be implemented to enforce rules or preferences for exchanging messages. Still another advantage of the invention is users may be provided with abstract features and a message type and a protocol can be automatically selected for the user.","The many features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the written description, and thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation as illustrated and described. Hence, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to as falling within the scope of the invention.","Assuming two message protocols of SMS & MMS, four (4) exemplary message types: [T1] SMS-Text, [T2] SMS-Rich (EMS), [T3] MMS-Slideshow (SMIL), and [T4] MMS-Multipart (Inline) may be constructed and listed in order of priority. Where Message type T1 represents a particular format (i.e., text) using a particular protocol (e.g., the SMS protocol), and so forth.","Further assuming a set of features for these exemplary message types: [F1] Add-text, [F2] Add-Slide, [F3] Add-EMS-Image, [F4] Add-JPG-Image [F5] Send-to-Email, [F6] Send-to-Phone#, the features that each of the Message types can support can, for example, be as follows:","F1 (T1, T2, T3, T4),","F2 (T3),","F3 (T2),","F4 (T3, T4),","F5 (T3, T4),","F6 (T1, T2, T3)","It should be noted that a Feature (e.g., Add-text [F1]) can be used with one or more message types (e.g., T1, T2, T3, and T4).","It should also be noted that the feature set can be much larger and not simply limited to types of content added, but could also include formatting text or position messaging elements. In any case, each of these message types has a set of features that the user is able to choose from while composing.","Following are some examples that demonstrate best messaging. However, actual determination rules may vary between implementations.","Case A\u2014User Starts Free Form Composing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Available Features to the user","Message would"]},{"entry":["User actions","(and feature owner)","be sent as"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Start Composing","F1 (T1, T2, T3, T4),","T1 (the highest"]},{"entry":[{},"F2 (T3),","priority)"]},{"entry":[{},"F3 (T2),"]},{"entry":[{},"F4 (T3, T4),"]},{"entry":[{},"F5 (T3)"]},{"entry":[{},"F6 (T1, T2, T3)"]},{"entry":["User adds a JPG","F1 (T1, T2, T3, T4),","T3 (the highest"]},{"entry":["Image (F4)","F2 (T3),","priority)"]},{"entry":[{},"F4 (T3, T4)"]},{"entry":[{},"F5 (T3)"]},{"entry":[{},"F6 (T1, T2, T3)"]},{"entry":["User chooses","Can only add email addresses (F5)","T3"]},{"entry":"Address"},{"entry":"Send"},{"entry":["Sent",{},"T3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In case A, when a user selects \u201cadds a JPG image\u201d (F4) in compose mode, corresponding message types T3 and T4 are recognized.
