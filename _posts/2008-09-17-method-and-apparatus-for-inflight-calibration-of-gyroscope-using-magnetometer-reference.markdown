{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. HR0011-05-C-0577. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention is generally related to guidance systems, and more particularly, is related to a method and apparatus for in-flight calibration of gyroscope using magnetometer reference.","Munitions guidance is typically implemented with proportional navigation. Assuming that both the target and guided system are moving in straight lines with constant velocity, the two systems will collide if the angle between the guided system velocity vector and the vector pointing to the target remains constant with time. Of course, neither the target nor the guided system remains at a constant velocity or direction. This is why the guidance solution is a closed loop control with continuous updates to impact.","Munitions generally derive the majority of their lift from the angle of attack of the body. The canards or wings on munitions generate the force that rotates the munitions about its center of gravity (CG) in opposition to the restoring force of the tail in order to generate angle of attack. The wings are generally too small to generate significant lift themselves. It is the angle of attack of the body that generates the majority of the maneuver acceleration. A small munitions with little surface area must generate large angles of attack in order to maneuver.","In a strap down seeker, the vector projection of the boresight is not coincident with the vector direction of travel due to the angle of attack required for maneuver. A round traveling at \u02dc150 m\/sec with a miss distance of 100 meters at a range of 1000 meters will have a line of sight rate on the order of 0.002 degree\/second given a 20 Hz sample rate on the target location. Precise sensing of the body motion is required in order to eliminate the dominant component of body motion, which is perhaps three orders of magnitude greater in the sensed target line of sight rates.","Gyroscopes area key expense in precision-guided weapons. Devices meeting the scale factor and bias requirements of typical guidance systems cost thousands of dollars. Less expensive devices are known in the industry, but these devices have temperature sensitive scale factor and bias. In addition, the bias has been shown to be unpredictable over time and testing has shown the biases to be sensitive to shock associated with the launch of precision-guided weapons.","Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to provide a relatively inexpensive gyroscope capable of reliable performance on precision guided weapons.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for calibrating a gyroscope in motion aboard a mobile vessel. Briefly described, in architecture, one embodiment of the system, among others, can be implemented as follows. The system includes a mobile vessel having a body axis and a steering mechanism. A three-axis gyroscope is mounted within the vessel. A three-axis magnetometer is mounted within the vessel. A seeker is mounted within the vessel. A programmable device communicates with the three-axis gyroscope, the three-axis magnetometer, the seeker, and the steering mechanism.","The present invention can also be viewed as providing methods for calibrating a gyroscope in motion. In this regard, one embodiment of such a method, among others, can be broadly summarized by the following steps: launching a mobile vessel having a body axis; calibrating a three-axis gyroscope mounted within the mobile vessel using a three-axis magnetometer and a programmable device mounted within the vessel; and altering a direction of the mobile vessel using a steering mechanism based on transformations measured by the gyroscope.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the present invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","12","10","14","16","18","12","14","20","14","34","22","12","20","34","18"]},"The mobile vessel  is initially conceived to be an airborne projectile, more specifically, a missile. The mobile vessel  may also be a torpedo or other water-based projectile. These mobile vessels  may suffer from significant G-forces at launch that would necessitate recalibration of inexpensive gyroscopes. Other mobile vessels that could make use of this calibration system  may include unmanned air, land, or water-based vehicles, although presently these types of vessels use more expensive gyroscopes that are resistant to calibration disturbances. The body axis  generally runs back-to-front (or front-to-back) along the mobile vessel .","The steering mechanism  will vary with the selection of a mobile vessel . Airborne projectiles generally utilize movable fins to provide steering capability. However, the steering mechanism  could be any device capable of influencing the direction of the mobile vessel .","The seeker  is used to sense the target and is generally placed to provide a forward view. The seeker  may consist of a simple sensor that determines direction based on a laser designation, the seeker  can be radar-based or it can use an imaging system to detect and track the target. The programmable device  uses angle measurements from the seeker  in combination with precise measurements of body rates from the gyroscopes  to generate commands to the steering mechanism  in order to intercept the target. Seekers are known to those having ordinary skill in the art and all seekers known in the art are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.","The in-flight calibration disclosed herein allows the use of inexpensive gyroscopes  for guidance applications. The system  calibrates the gyroscopes  in flight using magnetometers  as a truth reference. Magnetometer  measurements by themselves cannot uniquely determine a transformation from one Cartesian system to another for direct application in the guidance solution. However the magnetometer  measurements can be uniquely related to the gyroscope  measurements. The magnetometer  can then be used as a reference to calibrate gyroscopes , which are then used to measure the transformations required for the guidance solution.","In order to describe the calibration approach, two Cartesian coordinate systems are defined. One Cartesian coordinate system is assumed to be a fixed inertial-referenced system  substantially invariant over at least the geographic range of the munitions. This inertial-referenced system is defined as fixed in inertial space with its z-axis aligned to the earth's local magnetic vector . The second Cartesian coordinate system is defined in a body-referenced coordinate system A with the x-axis aligning with the body axis  directed out the nose of the mobile vessel , the y-axis out the left side of the mobile vessel , and the z-axis out of the bottom of the mobile vessel . These reference systems are not limiting, other reference systems may be applied with appropriate conversions in mathematical derivation relating the body fixed and inertial fixed reference systems. The body-referenced coordinate system A varies with respect to the fixed inertial-referenced system over time as the munitions maneuvers. A vector can be transformed from inertial-referenced space to the body-reference space using a direction cosine matrix as defined in Equation 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"T","mrow":{"mi":"B","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03c8","cos","\u03b8"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mi":["sin","\u03c8","cos","\u03b8"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"sin"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03b8"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03c8","sin","\u03b8sin\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},"mo":"-"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["sin","\u03c8cos","\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}]}},{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["sin","\u03c8","sin","\u03b8sin\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},"mo":"-"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03c8cos","\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03b8sin","\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}]},{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03c8","sin","\u03b8cos\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},"mo":"+"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["sin","\u03c8sin","\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}]}},{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["sin","\u03c8","sin","\u03b8cos\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},"mo":"-"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03c8sin","\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03b8","cos","\u03d5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}]}]}}},{"mi":["\u03b8","pitch"],"mo":"="},{"mi":["\u03c8","yaw"],"mo":"="},{"mi":["\u03d5","roll"],"mo":"="}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"The guided munition carries a three-axis gyroscope  preferably mounted to measure the rotation about the body-referenced x-, y- and z-axis.

timeline. For instance a ballistic projectiles seeker cannot observe the target for guidance until post apogee. In this case, during the ascent prior to apogee, the vehicle can be maneuvered into orientations that isolate states and perform dedicated maneuvers to support scale factor calibration. Another key advantage is that the individual estimators are less sensitive to misalignment between the gyroscopes and magnetometers, allowing additional flexibility in system design.","The munition has the capability of rolling to orient the magnetic field relative to the y and z-axis and therefore controlling the roll angle, \u03c6. Rolling the munitions to set \u03c6 to ninety degrees, Equation 13 may become:\n\n\u2212{dot over (\u03b8)}=\u2003\u2003(20)\n","In order to support scale factor calibration, the munition can perform a controlled body referenced yaw maneuver in order to measure the r gyroscope R scale factor and bias. In this orientation, the yaw maneuver generates a disturbance on the r gyroscope R while maintaining near zero disturbance on the q gyroscope Q. The roll orientation is maintained such that cos \u03c6 is near zero. The measurement of {dot over (\u03b8)} is made using magnetometer measurements through Equation 6 and calculating the difference divided by the sample time. The scale factor and bias is computed using an estimator based on Equation 20, gyroscope 12 measurements, and the rates derived from the magnetometer .","The system  next orients \u03c6 to zero in order to null the measurement from the r gyroscope R. In this orientation, Equation 12 can be approximated as:\n\n{dot over (\u03c6)}=tan \u03b8\u2003\u2003(21)\n\nThe r gyroscope R bias and scale factor has been previously calibrated so a corrected measurement of the r body rate is available for the calibration of the p gyroscope P. The system  performs a maneuver with the vessel  about the roll axis in order to calibrate the p gyroscope P scale and bias using an estimator based on Equation 21.\n","Also, in this orientation, Equation 13 can be approximated as:\n\n{dot over (\u03b8)}=\u2003\u2003(22)\n\nThe vessel  next executes a body-referenced pitch maneuver to support the calibration of the bias and scale factor of the q gyroscope Q using an estimator based on Equation 22.\n","The mobile vessel  may include a significant ferrous body encompassing an explosive. The ferrous material carries a system dependent magnetic field. The location of the magnetometer  may be forward of the ferrous body and close to the body axis . The lines of flux at this location are primarily coincident with, the x-axis of the mobile vessel . The ferrous body may also be subjected to high levels of shock, for example, that may cause a change in the magnetic characteristics of the ferrous body. Given that the bias subsequent to launch is unknown, the system may use knowledge of the local earth magnetic field or incorporate an estimator to determine the magnetic bias due to the body. Following launch, the bias introduced by the body can be determined from knowledge of the total field amplitude and the measurements made by the on-board magnetometer .","The gyroscope  may include three single axis gyroscopes P, Q, R mounted independently in the mobile vessel  and separated from the magnetometer . This arrangement may impede potential calibration accuracy due to tolerance build up between the magnetometers and the gyroscopes. One preferred implementation would place these devices within close proximity to each other. Performance improvements and simplification in the calibration approach may be achieved if the single axis gyroscopes P, Q, R and the magnetometer  can be mounted in closer proximity in order to maintain orthogonal and known angular relationships relative to each other, for instance mounted on a common stiff structure. In order to counter issues related to the location tolerancing, the system  may calibrate each axis individually, as previously described.","The programmable device  may be arranged to receive at least one output from the three-axis gyroscope  and at least one output from the three-axis magnetometer  and transmit at least one signal to the steering mechanism . More specifically, the programmable device  may receive data from the gyroscope  and the magnetometer  and perform the calculations discussed herein. Further, the programmable device  may track a position and\/or vector of a target and control the steering mechanism  to cause the mobile vessel  to adopt or maintain an intercept course. In this regard, operating a steering mechanism  with a programmable device  based on data from a calibrated gyroscope  is known to one of ordinary skill in the art and, for this reason, is not discussed further.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"200"},"As is shown by block , a mobile vessel  having a body axis  is launched. A three-axis gyroscope  mounted within the mobile vessel  is calibrated using a three-axis magnetometer  and a programmable device  mounted within the vessel (block ). A direction of the mobile vessel  is altered using a steering mechanism  based on transformations measured by the gyroscope  (block ).","The method of calibrating the gyroscope  may also include altering a direction of the mobile vessel  to calibrate at least one axis of the gyroscope . Each axis of the gyroscope  may be calibrated with a single maneuver, such that calibrating all three axes may require three maneuvers. These maneuvers may require five seconds or more. Guided munitions fired from, mortars may have an ascent of approximately five seconds and a decent of approximately five seconds. The significant G-forces of this type of guided munitions are realized immediately. Thereafter, the mobile vessel  may perform maneuvers on ascent such that it is calibrated approximately at the time descent begins, which may also be when steering is most critical. The calibration time and the flight time of this particular vessel  limit the gyroscope  to a single in-flight calibration.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present invention, particularly, any \u201cpreferred\u201d embodiments, are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the invention.
