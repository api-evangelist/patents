title: Air turbine starter and method for venting without loss of oil
abstract: A clutch assembly includes a shaft, vent plug and oil guide sleeve. The shaft includes an internal cavity, first passages for allowing oil to lubricate clutch components, and second passages for allowing excess oil to drain from the internal cavity. The vent plug has a radial passage in communication with the internal cavity for venting the cavity with an external source of air. The oil guide sleeve directs oil into the internal cavity. A method for lubricating and venting an air turbine starter includes delivering lubricating oil to an internal cavity of a clutch via an oil guide sleeve. The oil guide sleeve prevents oil from exiting the cavity through excess oil drainage passages before it lubricates the clutch components. The method also includes draining excess oil from the cavity through excess oil drainage passages so that excess oil does not substantially impede air flow through a vent plug passage.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00019-06-C-0081 awarded by the United States Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Air-start systems are power sources used to provide the initial rotation to start large diesel and gas turbine engines. Air turbine starters are one example of an air-start system used on aircraft having a gas turbine engine. Gas turbine engines typically have at least one spool that includes a compressor and a turbine. When a gas turbine engine is burning fuel and operating, the spool rotates at a high speed without further assistance. However, when a gas turbine engine is initially started, the spool typically needs assistance to begin rotation. Various starters have been devised to initiate rotation of the spool.","In some gas turbine engines (for both aircraft and ground-based operations), an air turbine starter is used to start spool rotation. An air turbine starter typically includes a radial inward flow turbine, or axial flow turbine, which is connected to the high pressure compressor spool of the gas turbine engine through an accessory gearbox, in addition to various piping, valves and gears. Compressed air is blown over the turbine of the air turbine starter, which in turn causes the spool to rotate and start the gas turbine engine. Compressed air is provided to the air turbine starter by bleed air from an aircraft's auxiliary power unit (APU) or another engine on the aircraft or from an air compressor on the ground. Once the air turbine starter provides initial rotation to the high pressure compressor of the gas turbine engine, the gas turbine engine can be started and run on fuel. In addition to providing initial rotation for a gas turbine engine, air turbine starters can also be used for maintenance operations (engine washing, circulating oil during oil fill, etc.).","Gas turbine engines typically include various components, such as gears, shafts and bearings, which benefit from lubrication and cooling. An oil supply system supplies oil, or another lubricating liquid, to and from the components to lubricate and cool the components.","A clutch assembly includes a shaft, a vent plug and an oil guide sleeve. The shaft includes an internal cavity, first passages in the shaft for allowing oil to exit the internal cavity to lubricate clutch components and a second passage in the shaft for allowing excess oil to drain from the internal cavity. The vent plug has a radial passage in communication with the internal cavity of the shaft for venting the internal cavity with a source of air external to the internal cavity. The oil guide sleeve directs oil into the internal cavity.","An air turbine starter includes a clutch, an oil nozzle, a vent plug, an output shaft assembly engaged with the clutch and an oil guide sleeve. The clutch includes a shaft, bearings, an internal cavity disposed within the shaft, first passages in the shaft for allowing oil to exit the internal cavity to lubricate air turbine starter components and second passages in the shaft for allowing excess oil to drain from the internal cavity of the clutch. The oil nozzle is in communication with the internal cavity. The vent plug has a radial passage. The output shaft assembly includes an output shaft and a vent outlet. The vent outlet is in communication with the vent plug for venting the internal cavity of the clutch with a source of air external to the internal cavity. The oil guide sleeve directs oil delivered by the oil nozzle to the clutch shaft.","A method for lubricating and venting an air turbine starter includes delivering lubricating oil to an internal cavity of a clutch via an oil guide sleeve to lubricate clutch components. The oil guide sleeve prevents oil from exiting the internal cavity through excess oil drainage passages before it lubricates the clutch components. The method also includes draining excess oil from the internal cavity through the excess oil drainage passages so that excess oil does not substantially impede air flow through a vent plug passage. The excess oil drainage passages are positioned so that at least a portion of each passage is radially outward of a radial passage of the vent plug.","The present invention provides an air turbine starter and a method for lubricating and venting the air turbine starter without loss of oil. Excess oil drainage passages in a clutch shaft and an oil guide sleeve prevent build up of excessive amounts of oil within an internal cavity of the air turbine starter, reducing or eliminating the chance that the excess oil prevents proper venting and causes oil to leak from the air turbine starter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","26","28","30","32","12","16","34","18","36","34","18","12","16"]},"Air turbine starter  is connected to gas turbine engine  through gearbox . Output shaft  connects air turbine starter  to gearbox . Clutch  is connected to output shaft  via gearing. Accessory gearbox  is connected to high pressure spool  by shaft . Clutch  selectively engages and disengages with output shaft . In operation, air turbine starter  receives a compressed fluid, such as bleed air, from an air source, such as main compressor section , auxiliary power unit (APU) , or ground air cart or compressor . Air flows through air turbine starter gas flow path  to rotate air turbine starter , and consequently, rotate output shaft . When clutch  is engaged, air turbine starter  rotates output shaft , and consequently, rotates high pressure spool . Gas turbine engine  can, therefore, be started by using air turbine starter  to rotate high pressure spool  to a suitable speed before adding fuel to begin combustion in main combustor section . Once gas turbine engine  is operating normally, clutch  can be disengaged. Valves  can also be closed to reduce flow of air through air turbine starter gas flow path  and air turbine starter . As shown schematically in , air turbine starter  includes rotor , gear train , clutch  and output section .","Several components of air turbine starters  require lubrication to operate efficiently and effectively. These components include clutches, output shafts and bearings. In some air turbine starters , a predetermined amount of oil is added to the internal cavities of the starter. This predetermined amount of oil is meant to provide lubrication for the air turbine starter for a set number of flights, missions or operations or for the useful life of the air turbine starter. Depending on the size and components of the air turbine starter, different volumes of oil can be used. For example, one embodiment of an air turbine starter generally requires between about 250 mL and about 500 mL of oil to provide adequate lubrication of air turbine starter components.","Internal cavities within the air turbine starter are typically vented to prevent pressure build up or vacuum formation within the air turbine starter. Pressure build up and vacuums within the internal cavities of the air turbine starter can reduce the effectiveness or prevent air turbine starter from operating properly. The internal cavities of the air turbine starter are generally vented to an external air source. For example, in an air turbine starter on aircraft, the internal cavities are vented to an air turbine starter pad cavity, which communicates with overboard air. Venting the internal cavities of an air turbine starter can be difficult when lubricating oil is present in the cavities. First, oil present in the internal cavities can interfere with proper venting if the oil prevents the flow of air through venting passages. In certain situations, oil can block air flow into and out of the internal cavities of the air turbine starter. In these situations, components in the air turbine starter may be exposed to pressures beyond normal operating ranges. Second, oil that may find its way into the venting passages can be undesirably removed from the internal cavities by the flow of air. Removing lubricating oil from inside the air turbine starter reduces the amount of oil available for lubricating air turbine starter components. This can result in both oil leaking out of the air turbine starter and too little oil remaining within the air turbine starter to facilitate adequate lubrication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["62","40","40","62","40","64","66","68","64","44","70","72","74","64","70","76","78","80","82","76","78","82","80","76","78","70","82","80","82","80","82","80","82","76","78"]},"Bearings  allow clutch shaft  to rotate within air turbine starter . In exemplary embodiments, clutch assembly  is a sprag (freewheel) clutch and bearings  allow disengagement of clutch shaft  from the driveshaft\/gear train  of air turbine starter . In alternate embodiments, bearings  are rolling-element bearings such as roller bearings or ball bearings. Clutch oil supply (first) passage  is located on clutch shaft  and allows communication between internal cavity  and bearings  and other components of clutch assembly . Internal cavity  is disposed within clutch shaft  and bounded by the inner surfaces of clutch shaft . During operation, lubricating oil present in internal cavity  can flow from internal cavity  through clutch oil supply passages  to provide lubricating oil to bearings  and other clutch assembly and air turbine starter components outside of clutch shaft . Centrifugal forces resulting from the rotation of clutch shaft  encourage lubricating oil to flow away from internal cavity  and through clutch oil supply passages .","Output shaft assembly  includes output shaft , vent outlet  and a mounting flange for mounting output shaft assembly  to gearbox . Output shaft  mates with clutch shaft . In the embodiment shown in , external spline  on output shaft  interacts with internal spline  on clutch shaft  to form spline joint . Alternatively, output shaft  and clutch shaft  can be joined together using other mating configurations. Vent outlet  extends through output shaft  and connects vent plug  to air turbine starter pad cavity . Air turbine starter pad cavity  is an axial space between air turbine starter  and the gearbox to which it is mounted. Air turbine starter pad cavity  is an enclosed cavity between seals of air turbine starter  and the gearbox. Air turbine starter pad cavity  contains vents to communicate with air outside of cavity . Through vent plug , vent outlet  and air turbine starter pad cavity , the pressure inside internal cavity  stays near atmospheric levels by venting to outside air.","Vent plug  is a fitting connected to output shaft  that communicates with internal cavity  and vent outlet . In the embodiment shown in , vent plug  is a T-shaped fitting having radial passage  and axial passage . Radial passage  opens into internal cavity . Axial passage  is connected to vent outlet  within output shaft . Radial passage  and axial passage  connect within vent plug , thereby forming a fluid pathway between internal cavity  and air turbine starter pad cavity . In exemplary embodiments, vent plug  is connected to output shaft  by threads or another fastener. Alternatively, vent plug  can be interference fit with output shaft . In exemplary embodiments, vent plug  includes two or more radial passages  that open into internal cavity .","Various pumps, valves and conduits can be used to deliver lubricating oil throughout air turbine starter . Lubricating oil is introduced into internal cavity  through oil nozzle . Oil nozzle  is positioned aft of rearward portion  of clutch shaft . Lubricating oil is propelled or directed from oil nozzle  into internal cavity  where it lubricates clutch shaft  and spline joint  and passes through clutch oil supply passage  to lubricate bearings  and other components of clutch assembly .","For the purposes of illustration,  shows a view of a cross-section of output section  of air turbine starter  in which oil is interfering with the venting of internal cavity . Lubricating oil inside internal cavity  has the potential to interfere with the venting of air turbine starter  in certain circumstances. For example, when operation of air turbine starter  is initiated in a cold climate (e.g., \u221240\u00b0 C.), oil present within internal cavity  can be viscous or even solid due to the low temperature of the oil. At air turbine starter  start-up, the rotation speed of clutch shaft  and output shaft  can be fairly low (e.g., about 3,000 rpm). Under these conditions, lubricating oil in internal cavity  migrates fore and aft, but does not readily flow through clutch oil supply passage  as the centrifugal forces generated by shaft rotation are not of sufficient magnitude to overcome the viscosity of the oil. The increased viscosity of the oil discourages oil flow through clutch oil supply passage . As a result, lubricating oil forms an oil annulus (indicated by reference numeral ) along the inner surface of clutch shaft . As additional oil accumulates in internal cavity , the depth of oil annulus  increases (i.e. oil annulus  expands farther towards the center of internal cavity ). Eventually, the expanding oil annulus reaches radial passage  of vent plug . As the fluids (i.e. air and oil) in internal cavity  increase in temperature, further expanding oil annulus , pressure within internal cavity  increases. Due to the pressure increase, lubricating oil in oil annulus  near radial passage  is driven into radial passage  during venting and from there into axial passage , vent outlet  and air turbine starter pad cavity . This oil can both interfere with proper venting of internal cavity  as well as cause oil to leak from air turbine starter  into air turbine starter pad cavity  and to the external environment. This also reduces the amount of oil remaining in air turbine starter , limiting the number of operations or missions between maintenance intervals.","To prevent or reduce the potential of oil entering radial passage  of vent plug , one or more excess oil drainage (second) passages  and oil guide sleeve  are employed.  illustrates a cross-section view of output section  of air turbine starter  having excess oil drainage passages  and oil guide sleeve . Excess oil drainage passages  and oil guide sleeve  work cooperatively to prevent oil within internal cavity  from interfering with the venting function of vent plug  and exiting air turbine starter . Excess oil drainage passages  are located on clutch shaft  to provide outlets for excess oil within internal cavity . In exemplary embodiments, excess oil drainage passages  are located on radially extending portion . Excess oil drainage passages  are positioned on clutch shaft  so that at least a portion of each excess oil drainage passage  is radially outward of radial passage  of vent plug . As shown in , dillustrates the distance from the inner surface of clutch shaft  to a radially outward portion of excess oil drainage passage , and dillustrates the distance from the inner surface of clutch shaft  to radial passage . Distance dis smaller than distance dallowing oil to drain through excess oil drainage passages  so that excess oil is prevented from reaching radial passage . By positioning excess oil drainage passages  radially outward of radial passage , excess oil drains from internal cavity  through excess oil drainage passages  so that oil annulus  does not expand to a depth (d) that would cover radial passage  and interfere with venting. During rotation, oil within internal cavity  forms an oil annulus having a generally uniform thickness along the inner surface of clutch shaft  due to the centrifugal forces generated by rotation. Oil annulus  is generally distributed circumferentially in internal cavity  while clutch shaft  is rotating. Oil having a depth greater than distance dreaches excess oil drainage passages  and exits internal cavity  so that excess oil is prevented from reaching radial passage .","As shown in , excess oil drainage passages  can be located on radially extending portion  of clutch shaft . By locating excess oil drainage passages  on radially extending portion , excess oil drainage passages  can be positioned radially outward of radial passage . Excess oil drainage passages  can be angled relative to axis of rotation . In exemplary embodiments, excess oil drainage passages  have angle between about 30\u00b0 and about 60\u00b0 relative to axis of rotation . In one embodiment, excess oil drainage passages  have angle of about 45\u00b0 relative to axis of rotation . Between two and about eight excess oil drainage passages  are located along the circumference of clutch shaft . Exemplary embodiments contain between about six and about eight excess oil drainage passages .","Lubricating oil passes through oil guide sleeve  in order to enter internal cavity . Oil guide sleeve  is positioned near rearward portion  of clutch shaft . Forward portion  of oil guide sleeve  extends forward from rearward portion  into internal cavity . Oil guide sleeve  prevents oil introduced into internal cavity  from exiting through excess oil drainage passages  before the oil has the opportunity to provide lubrication to clutch shaft , spline joint  or other components requiring lubrication. Without oil guide sleeve , a substantial quantity of oil introduced by oil nozzle  would simply exit internal cavity  through excess oil drainage passages  without providing significant lubrication. Forward portion  of oil guide sleeve  extends forward beyond excess oil drainage passages  (in a direction towards vent plug ). By positioning forward portion  axially forward of excess oil drainage passages , oil distributed by oil nozzle  will contact the inner surface of clutch shaft  and provide some measure of lubrication before migrating and reaching excess oil drainage passages .","In one exemplary embodiment, oil guide sleeve  is interference fit with rearward portion  of clutch shaft . In another exemplary embodiment, oil guide sleeve  is swaged into position within rearward portion  of clutch shaft . In alternative embodiments, other fastening means are used to position and set oil guide sleeve  within rearward portion  of clutch shaft  including brazing, welding, thread, adhesives and combinations thereof.","Oil passing through excess oil drainage passages  enters other cavities of air turbine starter . This removed oil can be used to lubricate other components directly or be collected and redistributed by oil nozzle  or other lubrication systems within air turbine starter . In exemplary embodiments, air turbine starter  includes oil redistribution system, represented in  by reference numeral . Oil that exits internal cavity  through excess oil drainage passages  is collected by oil redistribution system  and repurposed within air turbine starter . Oil redistribution system  can contain various pumps, valves, conduits and collection vessels for collecting and redistributing lubricating oil throughout air turbine starter , including redirecting collected oil through oil nozzle .","The present invention also provides a method for lubricating and venting an air turbine starter.  illustrates a simplified flow diagram of a method for lubricating and venting an air turbine starter. Method  includes delivering lubricating oil to an internal cavity of a clutch via an oil guide sleeve to lubricate clutch components (step ). Oil guide sleeve  prevents oil from immediately exiting internal cavity  through excess oil drainage passages , thereby lowering or eliminating the lubrication of clutch components. Method  also includes draining excess oil from the internal cavity through the excess oil drainage passages so that excess oil does not substantially impede air flow through a vent plug passage (step ). Excess oil drainage passages  are positioned so that at least a portion of each passage  is radially outward of radial passage  of vent plug .","While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
