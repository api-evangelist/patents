title: Techniques for identity-enabled interface deployment
abstract: Techniques for providing identity-enabled interfaces for deployment are presented. Specifically, an agent of an enterprise infrastructure authenticates and acquires an agent identity for interacting with a cloud processing environment. Once the agent is deployed in the cloud processing environment, enterprise policy can be enforced within the cloud processing environment on actions occurring within the cloud. The agent acts as an Application Programming Interface between the enterprise and the cloud processing environment. The reverse is also achievable, where a cloud deploys an agent to the enterprise to deploy a cloud interface within the enterprise for policy enforcement.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure is: a non-provisional filing of, is co-pending with, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/364,632, filed on Jul. 15, 2010, entitled: \u201cIdentity-Enabled Management Interface,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein and below in its entirety.","The Internet is rapidly evolving to include an operational mode called Cloud Computing and Cloud Storage. The intent of these new modes is the reduction of enterprise data centers and the excess capacity contained in such. In order to provide services to customers, the enterprise is often compelled to host high levels of excess capacity (sometimes over 80%) to take care of unanticipated traffic (e.g., a national emergency such as Sep. 11, 2001 (planes hitting the Twin-Towers in New York City, N.Y.) and anticipated traffic (e.g., the Christmas consumer buying season). The cloud operational characteristics allow an enterprise to quickly utilize computing and storage capacity in the cloud when increases in traffic or some other increase in the need for computing and storage resources is needed. However, this capability must be supported by an appropriate API by cloud providers, which heretofore is unavailable.","In various embodiments, techniques for identity-enabled interface deployment are presented. More specifically, and in an embodiment, a method for interface deployment is provided.","Particularly, a cloud agent is configured for deployment within a target cloud environment. The cloud agent is configured within an enterprise environment. The cloud agent is authenticated and a cloud agent identity is obtained. Next, an expiration condition is assigned to the cloud agent identity that when satisfied renders the cloud agent identity invalid and the cloud agent is deployed to the target cloud environment for enforcement of enterprise policy within the target cloud environment, via the cloud agent.","A \u201cresource\u201d includes a user, service, system, device, directory, data store, groups of users, combinations of these things, etc. A \u201cprincipal\u201d is a specific type of resource, such as an automated service or user that acquires an identity. A designation as to what is a resource and what is a principal can change depending upon the context of any given network transaction. Thus, if one resource attempts to access another resource, the actor of the transaction may be viewed as a principal.","An \u201cidentity\u201d is something that is formulated from one or more identifiers and secrets that provide a statement of roles and\/or permissions that the identity has in relation to resources. An \u201cidentifier\u201d is information, which may be private and permits an identity to be formed, and some portions of an identifier may be public information, such as a user identifier, name, etc. Some examples of identifiers include social security number (SSN), user identifier and password pair, account number, retina scan, fingerprint, face scan, etc.","A \u201cprocessing environment\u201d defines a set of cooperating computing resources, such as machines, storage, software libraries, software systems, etc. that form a logical computing infrastructure. A \u201clogical computing infrastructure\u201d means that computing resources can be geographically distributed across a network, such as the Internet. So, one computing resource at network site X can be logically combined with another computing resource at network site Y to form a logical processing environment.","The phrases \u201cprocessing environment,\u201d \u201ccloud processing environment,\u201d and the term \u201ccloud\u201d may be used interchangeably and synonymously herein.","Moreover, it is noted that a \u201ccloud\u201d refers to a logical and\/or physical processing environment as discussed above.","The phrase \u201ccloud network\u201d refers to a network of cloud processing environments logically being managed as a single collective network.","The embodiments herein provide techniques so that a Cloud Management Application Programming Interface (API) can be used by an enterprise to provide identity, role, and other such mechanisms via the API so that workloads in the cloud can be positively identified and the appropriate policies applied within the cloud.","Various embodiments of this invention can be implemented in existing network architectures. For example, in some embodiments, the techniques presented herein are implemented in whole or in part in the Novell\u00ae network and proxy server products, operating system products, cloud-based products or services, directory-based products and other products and\/or services distributed by Novell\u00ae, Inc., of Waltham, Mass.","Also, the techniques presented herein are implemented in machines, such as processor or processor-enabled devices. These machines are configured to specifically perform the processing of the methods and systems presented herein. Moreover, the methods and systems are implemented and reside within a non-transitory and computer-readable or processor-readable storage media and processed on the machines (processing devices) configured to perform the methods.","Of course, the embodiments of the invention can be implemented in a variety of architectural platforms, devices, operating and server systems, and\/or applications. Any particular architectural layout or implementation presented herein is provided for purposes of illustration and comprehension only and is not intended to limit aspects of the invention.","It is within this context that embodiments of the invention are now discussed within the context of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Again, embodiments and components of the architecture are implemented, programmed, and reside in a non-transitory computer-readable medium that executes on one or more processors that are specifically configured to process the components described herein and below.","The  shows an embodiment in terms of the architecture diagram contained in the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) Cloud Management Architecture white paper (DSP-IS01021.0.0). All 400-level diagram elements are provided and integrated in a novel manner by the embodiments presented herein to enhance and improve on the DMTF teachings.","An administrator  or Configuration mechanism  provides information to the Agent Console  concerning Agents  that are to interact with the various cloud providers via a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Interface . The CSP interface includes a service manager , a service catalog , a template catalogue , an administrative interface , and a security manager . The Cloud Provider also having a Cloud Provider Infrastructure , a Cloud Provider Billing\/Compliance Event Store , a Cloud Provider Policy Store  (managed via a Policy Manager ), and a Cloud Provider Identity\/Key Store  (managed via an ID\/Key Manager ). The Cloud Provider Infrastructure  having interfaced components for a Deploy Manager  having access to the Cloud Provider Service Store  and an Access Resolve component  having access to the Cloud Provider Policy Store  (which the Policy Manager  has access to), and the Access Resolve component  interfaced to the Cloud Provider Identity\/Key Store , which is accessed by the ID\/Key Manager .","In an embodiment, the Agent Console  authenticates with the Identity Provider of Identity Service (IDP)  via  with credentials provided by the administrator  or Configuration mechanism . The authentication causes the crafting of an identity (e.g., SAML assertion) that contains the rights, permissions, roles, etc. that the Agent Console  is allowed to operate with. The Configuration mechanism  accessible to by the Agent Console  and the Agent Console  interfaced to the Agent  over link . The IDP  establishes trust with other IDPs  via  and .","Implicit in, but not shown in, the  is the presence of a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that evaluates each action in terms of the identity and the rights, permissions, roles, etc. contained within the identity.","The Agent Console , using information provided by the administrator  or Configuration mechanism  starts, stops, clones, etc. Agent  and provides operational events via Configuration mechanism  such that the Agent  is able to interact with a Cloud Provider as detailed below. The Agent Console  also communicates with Event Timer  via  and the Agent  communicates with the CSP Interface  or the Security Manager  directly via  and , respectively.","The Agent  communicates with the IDP  and authenticates via credentials obtained via Configuration mechanism . The IDP  has access to a Consumer Identity\/Key Store . Successful authentication provides the Agent  with an identity (e.g., SAML assertion) that contains rights, permissions, roles, etc. that the Agent  is allowed to operate with. Also contained within the identity is a TTL (Time-To-Live setting) or some other expiration specification. If the Agent  is expected to operate longer than the expiration specification, an event is sent to Event Timer  via  that serves to allow Event Timer  to provide an event to Agent  and\/or Agent Console  and\/or Network Operations Center (NOC) Situation Display  that results in credentials being provided to Agent  so that a new authentication can be affected via , which extends the expiration specification.","In an embodiment, the NOC Situation Display  receives events via  and , which are displayed in the NOC operational display to allow NOC personnel to perform the appropriate activities (e.g., provide new credentials to Agent , etc.).","The Agent  communicates securely (e.g., via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL))) with the Security Manager  within the CSP Interface  via the mechanism specified by the cloud provider (e.g., (Representational State Transfer (RESTful), REST-like, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Remote Procedure Call (RPC), etc.) requesting authentication of Agent  and does so by providing the identity obtained via . The identity is verified by Security Manager  by validating the identity (e.g., (Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertion) via the IDP , which has a trust relationship previously established with the IDP . The trust relationship details the trust level that the cloud provider has with the enterprise so that the validity of the identity can be ascertained (e.g., verify the SAML assertion's digital signature) as well as validating the rights, permissions, roles, etc. that the Agent  is requesting to act under. The Security Manger  returns to the Agent  a token that is specific to the cloud provider's infrastructure and that is used with other requests from Agent  to the CSP Interface .","In an embodiment, The Security Manager  within the CSP Interface  communicates securely (e.g., via SSL) with the Agent  via the mechanism specified by the cloud provider (e.g., RESTful, REST-like, SOAP, RPC, etc.) requesting authentication of Security Manager  within the CSP Interface  and does so by providing an identity obtained from IDP  by the Security Manager . The identity is verified by Agent  by validating the identity (e.g., SAML assertion) via the IDP , which has a trust relationship previously established with the IDP . The trust relationship details the trust level the cloud provider has with the enterprise so that the validity of the identity can be ascertained (e.g., verify the SAML assertion's digital signature) as well as validating the rights, permissions, roles, etc. that the Security Manager  within the CSP Interface  is requesting to act under. The Agent  returns to the Security Manager  within the CSP Interface  a token that is specific to the enterprise infrastructure and that is used with other requests from Security Manager  within the CSP Interface  to the Agent .","If both of the previous processing scenarios are used then a bidirectional mechanism is established so that requests from the enterprise to the cloud provider and from the cloud provider to the enterprise can be processed while applying policy (via the PDP) to all requests. In either case (one way or two ways) all requests can be evaluated according to identity (rights, permissions, roles, etc.).","The token supplied as specified above may be a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) or a more complex structure, which is provided with subsequent requests. Receiving processes can validate the request by establishing the relationship between the token and trust relationship (perhaps by a table look up or request to the IDP to verify). The intent is to replace the heavy-weight identity (e.g., SAML) process with something much easier and quicker to implement\/process. The token may or may not be encrypted. If it is encrypted, the token can be encrypted via a symmetric key since the processing load of a symmetric key cryptogram is much less than that of an asymmetric cryptogram. Although if desired, the token in other embodiments can also be encrypted using asymmetric mechanisms as well.","Note that the token may have an expiration specification that is different from the identity expiration specification. This particular expiration specification is handled internal to the Agent  or Security Manager  within the CSP Interface  because the renewal of the token is based on the already established identity. However, if the identity expiration specification is to expire before the next token expiration, the mechanism specified above for obtaining a new identity is performed followed by the steps to obtain a new token.","With the invention, a secure and identity-enabled processing environment can be established between an enterprise and a cloud provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["2200","2200"]},"At , the cloud interface deployment manager configures a cloud agent for deployment to a target cloud environment. The cloud agent is configured to process on the processors of the target cloud environment and to use interfaces that the target cloud environment uses.","At , the cloud interface deployment manager authenticates the cloud agent and obtains a cloud agent identity. This can occur in a variety of manners and through a variety of interactions as discussed above with reference to the .","For example, at , the cloud interface deployment manager interacts with a third-party identity service. Credentials are supplied for the cloud agent. In one case, the credentials are supplied to the identity service via an administrator that uses an agent console (as discussed and presented above with reference to the ).","At , the cloud interface deployment manager assigns an expiration condition to the cloud agent identity. When the expiration condition is satisfied, the cloud agent identity becomes invalid or unusable.","According to an embodiment, at , the cloud interface deployment manager receives an event from a cloud agent that it will extend beyond the expiration condition. In response to this event, the cloud interface deployment manager re-authenticates the cloud agent to obtain a new and updated expiration condition that lasts for a length of time that the cloud agent anticipates to extend processing for.","In another case, at , the cloud interface deployment manager assigns the expiration condition as a time-to-live (TTL) attribute to the cloud agent identity.","At , the cloud interface deployment manager deploys the cloud agent to the target cloud environment for enforcement of enterprise policy within the target cloud environment. According to an embodiment at , the cloud interface deployment manager uses the cloud agent identity to authenticate to the target cloud environment and to enforce the Enterprise Policy within the target cloud environment.","In an embodiment, at , the cloud interface deployment manager requests, via the deployed cloud agent, a security token from a security manager of the target cloud environment. The security token is unique to the target cloud environment.","Continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the cloud interface deployment manager uses, via the deployed cloud agent, the security token with each request issued within the target cloud environment to validate each request and to enforce the enterprise policy with each request.","Continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the cloud interface deployment manager receives, via the deployed cloud agent, a token expiration condition with the security token. The security token becomes invalid for use within the target cloud environment when the token expiration condition is met.","Continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the cloud interface deployment manager identifies, via the deployed cloud agent, the token expiration condition as being different from the expiration condition of the cloud agent identity.","Still continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the cloud interface deployment manager recognizes, via the deployed cloud agent, the security token as a globally unique identifier for the target cloud environment.","Again continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the cloud interface deployment manager uses, via the deployed cloud agent, a cloud provider interface dictated by the target cloud environment to interact with the security manager of the target cloud environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["3300","3300"]},"The cloud interface deployment manager represented by the method  of the  is presented from the perspective of an enterprise deploying an interface for policy enforcement in a cloud environment.
