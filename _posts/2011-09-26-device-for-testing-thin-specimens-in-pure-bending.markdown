title: Device for testing thin specimens in pure bending
abstract: An improved test fixture to evaluate thin composite laminates commonly used in deployable space structures. The fixture is designed to impart a pure moment into the coupon, a necessary improvement to prior test methods where results are obtained by fitting material properties in a nonlinear structural analysis of the test. Fixture mechanics allow for direct calculation of the coupon flexural modulus and allowable flexural strain based on two key measurements, fixture displacement and applied load.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The conditions under which this invention was made are such as to entitle the Government of the United States under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force, to the entire right, title and interest therein, including foreign rights.","The invention relates generally to testing of flexure specimens to determine strain and elastic modulus, and in particular to a device designed to allow testing under pure bending conditions of thin composite laminates used as flexural elements.","Thin composite laminates are commonly used in deployable space structures. In application, the laminates are elastically folded to allow a structure to be compactly stowed during launch and subsequently deployed to an operational state once in orbit. This basic technology enables operational systems containing structures such as solar arrays, reflectors, antennas, and booms to be efficiently packaged and launched within the payload envelope of conventional launch vehicle fairings or within tightly allocated volume constraints common to compartmentalized payloads such as CubeSats.","While the use of composite laminates in deployable structures is widely acceptable, in operation they are subjected to strain levels and deformations outside of traditional composite structural applications. As such, their behavior is poorly understood, making deployable structure design and analysis extremely difficult. Currently, standardized ASTM test methods are used to determine composite material strengths and linear-elastic stiffnesses under traditional loading applications such as axial and transverse tension, compression, and shear. Data from these tests yield accurate, basic properties that are useful for laminate design, but they fail to characterize the nonlinear constitutive behavior over the full strain range common to deployable structures.","Studies have shown that flexural loading will result in higher compressive and tensile strengths than are determined from traditional tensile and compressive coupon tests. Single fiber tests further support this behavior, showing significantly higher flexural strengths as compared to tensile strength data. Attempts at analytically quantifying these increased strengths have largely been ineffective or are not applicable to the thin laminates used in deployable structures. For example, the commonly used Weibull statistical model under predicts flexural strength, while single fiber data does not consider structural stabilization or the role of the laminate matrix. Furthermore, the extrapolation of classical bending theory, which assumes linear-elastic behavior, is of little value due to nonlinear composite stiffening and softening with increasing and decreasing strains respectively. Finally, the matter is further complicated by laminate thickness concerns for composites in bending. Thinner specimens have been found to have higher compressive strengths due to the steep stress gradient through the specimen thickness because of the close proximity of fibers under tension and compression.","The current method for such testing is demonstrated in  in which two parallel platens ,  are pressed together with the specimen  between them. The applied force F measured by the load cell  and the platen separation data d are used to calculate the applied moment and specimen curvature by using the rather complex Euler elastic analytical model. This test method does not generate a pure stress state in the specimen and does not allow a direct measurement of curvature, bending moment, or strain.","The device is designed for testing under pure bending conditions thin composite laminate specimens used as flexural elements in deployable structures used in space applications. While the use of composite laminates in deployable structures has become widely acceptable, they are subjected to large deformations with strain levels well beyond what classical theories predict. This test device was designed to be used in an ordinary test frame. The test specimen is clamped between two carts with rotating bearings located on two parallel tracks allowing horizontal movement. Each cart has a near vertical arm with a third rotating bearing at the upper end. Cross members apply force to the vertical arms causing the carts to move and stressing the specimen into an arc of up to 180 degrees.","The relationship between bending moment and specimen curvature allows calculation of strain and elastic modulus. The moment and curvature in the specimen can be calculated from the fixture geometry of the device and two direct measurements: applied axial load and cross member displacement.","An improved test fixture has been designed that allows pure moment to be imparted into the composite test coupon (thin composite laminate specimen). As shown in , the test fixture is used to clamp a coupon  between two rotating carts  that are driven downward by the cross members  pushing downward upon the bearings  at the end of the near vertical arms of the carts. As the cross members  move downward, the carts rotate about the axes of the lower bearings , thus apply the bending moment on the coupon . The carts are very stiff compared with the coupon and are considered perfectly rigid. As the coupon deforms, the carts translate along tracks  until they reach the extreme position that corresponds to a coupon arc angle of 180\u00b0 or until the coupon fails. Load (F) and cross member displacement are measured to calculate the applied moment and curvature. The load cell  placed between the cross member and the test frame is used to measure the applied load F. Laser displacement sensors , placed at each end of the tracks, are used to measure cross member displacement by reflecting off the targets  attached to the cross members. In addition to moment and curvature calculation, data from the two sensors can be used to verify the two carts are rotating in concert, which indicates the load is applied uniformly between the carts.  is a side view of the test fixture. Three stages of a test sequence is shown in . Initially () the cross members are just in contact with the upper bearings of the two carts and there is no stress on the coupon. shows an intermediate step in the test sequence in which the upper bearings are pressed downward by the cross members and the coupon is bent in an arc. shows the maximum downward displacement of the cross members causing a 180 degree arc in the coupon, assuming it had not earlier broken.","Non-contact displacement sensors were chosen to avoid additional contribution (pollution) to the force registered by the load cell. Micro-Epsilon laser displacement sensors, with a measurement range of 100 mm, were selected for this application. Although not as precise, the test frame crosshead displacement data can be used to verify the data from the laser position sensors.","Three ball bearings ,  provide low-friction rotation and minimal cart-to-track contact for each of the two carts. Standard electric motor type bearings with C-3 radial clearance were found to have sufficiently low breaking and rotational friction. The bearings are double shielded to prevent composite debris and other contaminates from stalling the bearing mechanism. To prevent degradation of the fixture corrosion, all parts, including the ball bearings, are made out of 17-4PH stainless steel. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that careful fixture alignment of carts, coupon, and cross members is required for successful test results.","The moment and curvature in the coupon are calculated from the fixture geometry and the two direct measurements: applied axial load and cross member displacement. Based on the test setup and the cart's free body diagram, shown in  and , the moment in the coupon, M, can be found from the applied load, F. As the cross members translate downward and apply load, the carts will begin to rotate, creating the pure moment found in Eq. (1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["M","o"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"F","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"l"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"The kinematic variables and constants of motion during testing are shown in .
