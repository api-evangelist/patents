The copyright owner has no objection to the photocopy reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure in exactly the form it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Gaming machines which provide players awards in primary or base games are well known. Gaming machines generally require the player to place or make a wager to activate a primary or base game. Certain known gaming machines enable a player to wager on and play a plurality of primary or base games simultaneously or concurrently. In many of these gaming machines, the award for each played primary game is based on the player obtaining a winning symbol or symbol combination and on the amount of the wager placed on that primary game (e.g., the higher the wager, the higher the award). Generally, symbols or symbol combinations which are less likely to occur usually provide higher awards.","Gaming machine accounting systems are also well known. Certain gaming machine accounting systems include one or more servers, controllers or remote hosts which are in secure communication with a plurality of gaming machines. These gaming machine accounting systems are configured to automate various metering and\/or event reporting required of the play of the plurality of gaming machines. That is, various gaming machine accounting systems monitor, track, measure, record, store, and\/or access various data associated with the gaming machines and\/or the players playing the gaming machines. Such data typically includes statistical and\/or financial information, such as coin-in statistics, coin-out statistics, coin drop statistics, win\/loss statistics, jackpot statistics, cancelled credits statistics, paytable statistics, denomination statistics, and\/or games played statistics. The monitoring of this statistical and\/or financial information enables a gaming establishment operator to analyze the performance of the various gaming machines located at a gaming establishment and to analyze the individual games and paytables installed on such gaming machines.","While various known gaming machine accounting systems provide numerous reporting and analytical benefits for gaming establishment operators, certain known gaming machine accounting systems are configured to account for each gaming machine only playing one game at a time. That is, certain known gaming machine accounting systems are not configured to support a player at a gaming machine placing a plurality of wagers on a plurality of simultaneous or concurrent plays of a plurality of primary or base games and specifically placing a plurality of wagers on a plurality of concurrent plays of a plurality of different primary or base games. Specifically, certain known gaming machine accounting systems track gaming machines meters and also game change events. Such known gaming machine accounting systems post-process the data to determine the play on each paytable. To report concurrent plays of a plurality of different primary games, such gaming machines first need to report which primary game is currently being played and then allow sufficient time for the gaming machine accounting system to register a changed game play before reporting any plays of that game. However, due to the time differences between such reporting and such game change events (i.e., one known gaming machine accounting system may poll the gaming machines every two-hundred milliseconds while certain know gaming machines require 1.5 seconds to register a game change event), known gaming machine accounting systems often fall behind on such reporting and the post-processing of data and are thus not configured to account for a gaming machine playing a plurality of games at a time. Therefore, the gaming machines in communication with these known gaming machine accounting systems are unable to enable a player to wager on and play a plurality of primary or base games simultaneously. Accordingly, gaming establishment operators using these gaming machine accounting systems are unable to offer simultaneous game play features to players (compared to gaming establishment operators using gaming machine accounting systems that enable simultaneous game play) and are at a disadvantage to other gaming establishment operators using different gaming machine accounting systems.","Additionally, certain known gaming servers, gaming controllers or gaming remote hosts provide for various non-gaming machine initiated features or requests for the plurality of gaming machines. That is, certain gaming servers, gaming controllers or gaming remote hosts are configured to initiate one or more events, such as a request for information and\/or a reconfiguration of a paytable, at one or more of the plurality of gaming machines in communication with these gaming servers, gaming controllers or gaming remote hosts. While these gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host initiated features or requests have certain advantages (such as an increased volatility for certain players that enjoy more volatile gaming experiences), these gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host initiated features or requests also have certain disadvantages (such as an increased volatility for certain other players that dislike more volatile gaming experiences). Additionally, certain of these gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host initiated features or requests interrupt a player's gaming experience, such as by causing the reels to spin for an extended period of time as requested information or data is being communicated back to the gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host. Moreover, these gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host initiated features or requests are difficult for gaming machine designers to account for when configuring gaming machines.","Accordingly, there is a continuing need to provide new and different gaming machines and gaming systems which operate with existing gaming machine accounting systems. There is also a continuing need to provide new and different gaming machines and gaming systems which minimize the affects of certain gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host initiated features or requests.","The present disclosure relates generally to gaming systems, gaming devices, and methods for enabling a player to simultaneously, concurrently or overlappingly play a plurality of games at a gaming device regardless or independent of whether the gaming device accounting system in communication with the gaming device is capable of supporting such simultaneous or concurrent game play.","In various embodiments, the gaming system, gaming device and method disclosed herein enables a player to wager on and simultaneously, concurrently or overlappingly play a plurality of primary or base games. Following the completion of the play of these plurality of simultaneously played games, the gaming system reports the plays of these simultaneously games to the gaming device accounting system as a plurality of sequentially played games. That is, following the completion of each of the plurality of simultaneously played games (i.e., following the generation of an outcome for each game and the providing to a player of any award associated with the generated outcome for each game), the gaming system sequentially reports to a distinct gaming device accounting system the statistical and\/or financial information related to each play of each of these simultaneously played games. Thus, the gaming system provides for the simultaneous play of a plurality of games to be presented to the gaming device accounting system (which is a separate and distinct system from the gaming system) as the sequential play of a plurality of games. For example, a gaming system enables a player to wager on and simultaneously or concurrently play four primary games. In this example, after the player has completed their play of all four wagered on primary games, the gaming system reports the results of these games as a first primary game played at a first point in time, followed by a second primary game played at a second, subsequent point in time, followed by a third primary game played at a third, subsequent point in time and finally followed by a fourth primary game played at a fourth, subsequent point in time. As illustrated by this example, such a configuration enables certain gaming device accounting systems (which are not configured to support a player placing a plurality of wagers on a plurality of simultaneous or concurrent plays of a plurality of primary games) to support a player placing a plurality of wagers on a plurality of simultaneous or concurrent plays of a plurality of primary games. Accordingly, gaming establishment operators using these types of gaming device accounting systems are enabled to offer similar simultaneous game play features to players and are thus not at any disadvantage to other gaming establishment operators using different gaming device accounting systems.","More specifically, in one embodiment, the gaming system disclosed herein enables a player to wager on a plurality of overlapping game plays. For each of the simultaneous or overlapping game plays, the gaming system generates an outcome, displays the generated outcome, provides the player any award associated with the generated outcome, and escrows accounting data associated with the simultaneously displayed game. In this embodiment, after escrowing accounting data associated with each of the overlapping game plays, for each of the overlapping game plays, the gaming system sequentially communicates the escrowed accounting data to a remote host, wherein the escrowed accounting data is communicated as if the plurality of overlapping game plays were a plurality of sequential or non-overlapping game plays.","The present disclosure additionally or alternatively relates generally to gaming systems, gaming devices, and methods which enable a player to simultaneously play a plurality of games wherein certain of the games are eligible to operate with a remote host and certain of the games are ineligible to operate with the remote host.","In various other embodiments, the gaming system, gaming device and method disclosed herein enables a player to wager on and simultaneously, concurrently or overlappingly play a plurality of primary or base games. In this embodiment, the gaming system causes one or more of the simultaneously played games to be associated with at least one central server, central controller or remote host initiated feature or request and causes one or more of the simultaneously played games to not be associated with any central server, central controller or remote host initiated features or requests. Put differently, the gaming system displays a plurality of simultaneously played games wherein at least one of the simultaneously played games enables at least one central server, central controller or remote host initiated feature to modify or otherwise alter one or more aspects of the play of that game and at least one of the simultaneously played games prohibits any central server, central controller or remote host initiated features from modifying or otherwise altering any aspects the play of that game. Such a configuration moderates the affects of gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host initiated features or requests and provides gaming device designers more predictability when configuring these gaming devices.","More specifically, in one embodiment, the gaming system disclosed herein enables a player to wager on a plurality of overlapping game plays, wherein one of the overlapping game plays is enabled to accept at least one feature initiated from a remote host and at least one of the overlapping game plays is disabled from accepting any features initiated from any remote hosts. The gaming system of this embodiment determines if the remote host initiated a feature in association with the plurality of overlapping game plays. If the remote host initiated the feature in association with the plurality of overlapping game plays, for each of the overlapping game plays enabled to accept the feature initiated from the remote host, the gaming system modifies a parameter of the played game, the modification based on the remote host initiated feature, generates an outcome, displays the generated outcome, determines any awards associated with the generated outcome, and displays any determined awards, wherein at least one of the generated outcome, the display of the generated outcome, any determined award and the display of any determined award is based, at least in part, on the modified parameter of the played game. Additionally, if the remote host initiated the feature in association with the plurality of overlapping game plays, for each of the at least one of the overlapping game plays disabled from accepting the feature initiated from the remote host, the gaming system does not modify any parameters of the played game based on the remote host initiated feature, generates an outcome, displays the generated outcome, determines any awards associated with the generated outcome, and displays any determined awards.","Accordingly, the gaming system disclosed herein provides additional functionality to certain gaming device accounting systems by enabling such gaming device accounting systems to support a plurality of simultaneous or concurrent plays of a plurality of primary games. The gaming system disclosed herein additionally or alternatively provides increased predictability to gaming device designers by minimizing one or more gaming server, gaming controller or gaming remote host initiated features or requests which increases the chances that a player's gaming device experience will mirror how the gaming device designer intended the player to experience the gaming device.","Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.","The present disclosure may be implemented in various configurations for gaming machines, gaming devices, or gaming systems, including but not limited to: (1) a dedicated gaming machine, gaming device, or gaming system wherein the computerized instructions for controlling any games (which are provided by the gaming machine or gaming device) are provided with the gaming machine or gaming device prior to delivery to a gaming establishment; and (2) a changeable gaming machine, gaming device, or gaming system wherein the computerized instructions for controlling any games (which are provided by the gaming machine or gaming device) are downloadable to the gaming machine or gaming device through a data network after the gaming machine or gaming device is in a gaming establishment.

That is, different primary wagering games, such as video poker games, video blackjack games, video keno, video bingo or any other suitable primary or base game may be implemented. In one embodiment, the disclosed multi-dimensional cascading symbol game is implemented as a base or primary game.","In one embodiment, as illustrated in , a base or primary game may be a slot game with one or more paylines . In this embodiment, the gaming device includes at least one and preferably a plurality of reels , such as three to five reels , in either electromechanical form with mechanical rotating reels or video form with simulated reels and movement thereof. In one embodiment, an electromechanical slot machine includes a plurality of adjacent, rotatable reels which may be combined and operably coupled with an electronic display of any suitable type. In another embodiment, if the reels  are in video form, one or more of the display devices, as described above, displays the plurality of simulated video reels . Each reel  displays a plurality of indicia or symbols, such as bells, hearts, fruits, numbers, letters, bars, or other images which preferably correspond to a theme associated with the gaming device. In another embodiment, one or more of the reels are independent reels or unisymbol reels. In this embodiment, each independent or unisymbol reel generates and displays one symbol to the player.","In one embodiment, one or more of the paylines may be horizontal, vertical, circular, diagonal, angled or any combination thereof. In another embodiment, one or more of the paylines each include a plurality of adjacent symbol display positions on a requisite number of adjacent reels. In one such embodiment, one or more paylines are formed between at least two symbol display positions which are adjacent to each other by either sharing a common side or sharing a common corner (i.e., such paylines are connected paylines). In these embodiments, the gaming device enables a player to wager on one or more of such paylines to activate such wagered on paylines.","In another embodiment wherein one or more paylines are formed between at least two symbol display positions which are adjacent to each other, the gaming device enables a player to wager on and thus activate a plurality of symbol display positions. In this embodiment, one or more paylines which are formed from a plurality of adjacent active symbol display positions on a requisite number of adjacent reels are activated.","In one embodiment, the gaming device awards prizes after the reels of the primary game stop spinning if specified types and\/or configurations of indicia or symbols occur on an active payline or otherwise occur in a winning pattern, occur on the requisite number of adjacent reels and\/or occur in a scatter pay arrangement.","In an alternative embodiment, rather than determining any outcome to provide to the player by analyzing the symbols generated on any wagered upon paylines as described above, the gaming device determines any outcome to provide to the player based on the number of associated symbols which are generated in active symbol display positions on the requisite number of adjacent reels (i.e., not on paylines passing through any displayed winning symbol combinations). In this embodiment, if a winning symbol combination is generated on the reels, the gaming device provides the player one award for that occurrence of the generated winning symbol combination. For example, if one winning symbol combination is generated on the reels, the gaming device will provide a single award to the player for that winning symbol combination (i.e., not based on the number of paylines that would have passed through that winning symbol combination). It should be appreciated that because a gaming device that enables wagering on ways to win provides the player one award for a single occurrence of a winning symbol combination and a gaming device with paylines may provide the player more than one award for the same occurrence of a single winning symbol combination (i.e., if a plurality of paylines each pass through the same winning symbol combination), it is possible to provide a player at a ways to win gaming device with more ways to win for an equivalent bet or wager on a traditional slot gaming device with paylines.","In one embodiment, the total number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions on a first reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions on a second reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions on a third reel and so on for each reel of the gaming device with at least one symbol generated in an active symbol display position. For example, a three reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol display positions on each reel includes 27 ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel\u00d73 symbols on the second reel\u00d73 symbols on the third reel). A four reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol display positions on each reel includes 81 ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel\u00d73 symbols on the second reel\u00d73 symbols on the third reel\u00d73 symbols on the fourth reel). A five reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol display positions on each reel includes 243 ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel\u00d73 symbols on the second reel\u00d73 symbols on the third reel\u00d73 symbols on the fourth reel\u00d73 symbols on the fifth reel). It should be appreciated that modifying the number of generated symbols by either modifying the number of reels or modifying the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions by one or more of the reels modifies the number of ways to win.","In another embodiment, the gaming device enables a player to wager on and thus activate symbol display positions. In one such embodiment, the symbol display positions are on the reels. In this embodiment, if based on the player's wager, a reel is activated, then each of the symbol display positions of that reel will be activated and each of the active symbol display positions will be part of one or more of the ways to win. In one embodiment, if based on the player's wager, a reel is not activated, then a designated number of default symbol display positions, such as a single symbol display position of the middle row of the reel, will be activated and the default symbol display position(s) will be part of one or more of the ways to win. This type of gaming machine enables a player to wager on one, more than one or all of the reels and the processor of the gaming device uses the number of wagered on reels to determine the active symbol display positions and the number of possible ways to win. In alternative embodiments, (1) no symbols are displayed as generated at any of the inactive symbol display positions, or (2) any symbols generated at any inactive symbol display positions may be displayed to the player but suitably shaded or otherwise designated as inactive.","In one embodiment wherein a player wagers on one or more reels, a player's wager of one credit may activate each of the three symbol display positions on a first reel, wherein one default symbol display position is activated on each of the remaining four reels. In this example, as described above, the gaming device provides the player three ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel\u00d71 symbol on the second reel\u00d71 symbol on the third reel\u00d71 symbol on the fourth reel\u00d71 symbol on the fifth reel). In another example, a player's wager of nine credits may activate each of the three symbol display positions on a first reel, each of the three symbol display positions on a second reel and each of the three symbol display positions on a third reel wherein one default symbol display position is activated on each of the remaining two reels. In this example, as described above, the gaming device provides the player twenty-seven ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel\u00d73 symbols on the second reel\u00d73 symbols on the third reel\u00d71 symbol on the fourth reel\u00d71 symbol on the fifth reel).","In one embodiment, to determine any award(s) to provide to the player based on the generated symbols, the gaming device individually determines if a symbol generated in an active symbol display position on a first reel forms part of a winning symbol combination with or is otherwise suitably related to a symbol generated in an active symbol display position on a second reel. In this embodiment, the gaming device classifies each pair of symbols which form part of a winning symbol combination (i.e., each pair of related symbols) as a string of related symbols. For example, if active symbol display positions include a first cherry symbol generated in the top row of a first reel and a second cherry symbol generated in the bottom row of a second reel, the gaming device classifies the two cherry symbols as a string of related symbols because the two cherry symbols form part of a winning symbol combination.","After determining if any strings of related symbols are formed between the symbols on the first reel and the symbols on the second reel, the gaming device determines if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel should be added to any of the formed strings of related symbols. In this embodiment, for a first of the classified strings of related symbols, the gaming device determines if any of the symbols generated by the next adjacent reel form part of a winning symbol combination or are otherwise related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols. If the gaming device determines that a symbol generated on the next adjacent reel is related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols, that symbol is subsequently added to the first string of related symbols. For example, if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and a related cherry symbol is generated in the middle row of the third reel, the gaming device adds the related cherry symbol generated on the third reel to the previously classified string of cherry symbols.","On the other hand, if the gaming device determines that no symbols generated on the next adjacent reel are related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols, the gaming device marks or flags such string of related symbols as complete. For example, if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and none of the symbols of the third reel are related to the cherry symbols of the previously classified string of cherry symbols, the gaming device marks or flags the string of two cherry symbols as complete.","After either adding a related symbol to the first string of related symbols or marking the first string of related symbols as complete, the gaming device proceeds as described above for each of the remaining classified strings of related symbols which were previously classified or formed from related symbols on the first and second reels.","After analyzing each of the remaining strings of related symbols, the gaming device determines, for each remaining pending or incomplete string of related symbols, if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel, if any, should be added to any of the previously classified strings of related symbols. This process continues until either each string of related symbols is complete or there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze. In this embodiment, where there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze, the gaming device marks each of the remaining pending strings of related symbols as complete.","When each of the strings of related symbols is marked complete, the gaming device compares each of the strings of related symbols to an appropriate paytable and provides the player any award associated with each of the completed strings of symbols. It should be appreciated that the player is provided one award, if any, for each string of related symbols generated in active symbol display positions (i.e., as opposed to a quantity of awards being based on how many paylines that would have passed through each of the strings of related symbols in active symbol display positions).","In one embodiment, a base or primary game may be a poker game wherein the gaming device enables the player to play a conventional game of video draw poker and initially deals five cards all face up from a virtual deck of fifty-two cards. Cards may be dealt as in a traditional game of cards or in the case of the gaming device, the cards may be randomly selected from a predetermined number of cards. If the player wishes to draw, the player selects the cards to hold via one or more input devices, such as by pressing related hold buttons or via the touch screen. The player then presses the deal button and the unwanted or discarded cards are removed from the display and the gaming machine deals the replacement cards from the remaining cards in the deck. This results in a final five-card hand. The gaming device compares the final five-card hand to a payout table which utilizes conventional poker hand rankings to determine the winning hands. The gaming device provides the player with an award based on a winning hand and the number of credits the player wagered.","In another embodiment, the base or primary game may be a multi-hand version of video poker. In this embodiment, the gaming device deals the player at least two hands of cards. In one such embodiment, the cards are the same cards. In one embodiment each hand of cards is associated with its own deck of cards. The player chooses the cards to hold in a primary hand. The held cards in the primary hand are also held in the other hands of cards. The remaining non-held cards are removed from each hand displayed and for each hand replacement cards are randomly dealt into that hand. Since the replacement cards are randomly dealt independently for each hand, the replacement cards for each hand will usually be different. The poker hand rankings are then determined hand by hand against a payout table and awards are provided to the player.","In one embodiment, a base or primary game may be a keno game wherein the gaming device displays a plurality of selectable indicia or numbers on at least one of the display devices. In this embodiment, the player selects at least one bit potentially a plurality of the selectable indicia or numbers via an input device such as a touch screen. The gaming device then displays a series of drawn numbers and determine an amount of matches, if any, between the player's selected numbers and the gaming device's drawn numbers. The player is provided an award based on the amount of matches, if any, based on the amount of determined matches and the number of numbers drawn.","In one embodiment, in addition to winning credits or other awards in a base or primary game, the gaming device may also give players the opportunity to win credits in a bonus or secondary game or in a bonus or secondary round. In one embodiment, the disclosed multi-dimensional cascading symbol game is implemented as a bonus or secondary game. The bonus or secondary game enables the player to obtain a prize or payout in addition to the prize or payout, if any, obtained from the base or primary game. In general, a bonus or secondary game produces a significantly higher level of player excitement than the base or primary game because it provides a greater expectation of winning than the base or primary game, and is accompanied with more attractive or unusual features than the base or primary game. In one embodiment, the bonus or secondary game may be any type of suitable game, either similar to or completely different from the base or primary game.","In one embodiment, the triggering event or qualifying condition may be a selected outcome in the primary game or a particular arrangement of one or more indicia on a display device in the primary game, such as the number seven appearing on three adjacent reels along a payline in the primary slot game embodiment seen in . In other embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition occurs based on exceeding a certain amount of game play (such as number of games, number of credits, amount of time), or reaching a specified number of points earned during game play.","In another embodiment, the gaming device processor  or central controller  randomly provides the player one or more plays of one or more secondary games. In one such embodiment, the gaming device does not provide any apparent reason to the player for qualifying to play a secondary or bonus game. In this embodiment, qualifying for a bonus game is not triggered by an event in or based specifically on any of the plays of any primary game. That is, the gaming device may simply qualify a player to play a secondary game without any explanation or alternatively with simple explanations. In another embodiment, the gaming device (or central server) qualifies a player for a secondary game at least partially based on a game triggered or symbol triggered event, such as at least partially based on the play of a primary game.","In one embodiment, the gaming device includes a program which will automatically begin a bonus round after the player has achieved a triggering event or qualifying condition in the base or primary game. In another embodiment, after a player has qualified for a bonus game, the player may subsequently enhance his\/her bonus game participation through continued play on the base or primary game. Thus, for each bonus qualifying event, such as a bonus symbol, that the player obtains, a given number of bonus game wagering points or credits may be accumulated in a \u201cbonus meter\u201d programmed to accrue the bonus wagering credits or entries toward eventual participation in a bonus game. The occurrence of multiple such bonus qualifying events in the primary game may result in an arithmetic or exponential increase in the number of bonus wagering credits awarded. In one embodiment, the player may redeem extra bonus wagering credits during the bonus game to extend play of the bonus game.","In one embodiment, no separate entry fee or buy-in for a bonus game is needed. That is, a player may not purchase entry into a bonus game; rather they must win or earn entry through play of the primary game, thus encouraging play of the primary game. In another embodiment, qualification of the bonus or secondary game is accomplished through a simple \u201cbuy-in\u201d by the player\u2014for example, if the player has been unsuccessful at qualifying through other specified activities. In another embodiment, the player must make a separate side-wager on the bonus game or wager a designated amount in the primary game to qualify for the secondary game. In this embodiment, the secondary game triggering event must occur and the side-wager (or designated primary game wager amount) must have been placed to trigger the secondary game.","In one embodiment, as illustrated in , one or more of the gaming devices  are in communication with each other and\/or at least one central controller  through a data network or remote communication link .

In another embodiment, the gaming system initiates two or more of the plurality of games simultaneously or substantially simultaneously and initiates (but does not complete) two of more of the plurality of games sequentially or substantially sequentially. In another embodiment, the gaming system initiates (but does not complete) each of the plurality of games sequentially. For example, as seen in , the gaming system initiates a first game (i.e., Game ) at a first point in time (i.e., point-in-time A ), initiates a second game (i.e., Game ) at a second, subsequent point in time (i.e., point-in-time C ), initiates a third game (i.e., Game ) at a third, subsequent point in time (i.e., point-in-time E ) and initiates a fourth game (i.e., Game ) at a fourth, subsequent point in time (i.e., point-in-time F ). It should be appreciated that regardless of if the gaming system initiates a plurality or each of the games at one time or at different times, the plays of the plurality of games overlap such that the gaming system provides the player a plurality of simultaneously played games. For example, as illustrated in , despite the first game (i.e., Game ), the second game (i.e., Game ), the third game (i.e., Game ) and the fourth game (i.e., Game ) all being initiated at different points in time, for a designated duration or period of time (i.e., between point in time F of the initiation of the fourth game and point in time B of the conclusion of the first game), each of the plurality of plays are simultaneously played by the player. That is, as seen in , at least a portion of each of the games are simultaneously displayed to the player.","As described above, for each initiated game, the gaming system generates and displays an outcome for the play of that game. The gaming system also determines, displays and provides any award associated with the generated outcome for each initiated game. Moreover, as described above, if any secondary or bonus games are triggered in association with the play of one or more of the initiated games, for that initiated game, the gaming system determines an outcome for the triggered secondary game and provides the player any award associated with the determined outcome of the triggered secondary game. In this embodiment, upon the gaming system providing the player any awards associated with the outcome generated in the initiated game and any outcomes generated in any triggered secondary games, the gaming system determines that that initiated game is complete. That is, each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are complete after the gaming system generates an outcome for each initiated game, provides any awards associated with the generated outcome for each initiated game, triggers any bonus or secondary games in association with each initiated game, generates any outcomes in any triggered bonus or secondary games and provides any awards associated with any generated outcomes in any triggered bonus or secondary games. In other words, each initiated game is considered complete when no additional outcome determinations or award determinations remain to be made in association with each play of each initiated game (or any secondary games triggered from these initiated games) and the results of such games are ready to be reported to a gaming device accounting system.","After initiating each of the plurality of games, for each simultaneously played game completed, the gaming system escrows the results of that game and does not automatically report the results of that game to the gaming device accounting system as indicated in block . That is, unlike certain known gaming systems which automatically report the results of each completed game to the gaming device accounting system, the gaming system disclosed herein holds off on reporting the results of each completed game until a subsequent point in time. In one such embodiment, the gaming system maintains a record for each completed game. In this embodiment, each record is associated with data or information including, but not limited to, a type of game played, a time the game started, a time the game completed, an amount of the wager placed on the game, an outcome generated in the game, any award provided to the player for the game.","Following the escrowing of the results of each completed game, the gaming system determines if each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are complete as indicated in diamond .","In one embodiment, the gaming system concludes or completes each of the plurality of games simultaneously or substantially simultaneously. In another embodiment, the gaming system concludes or completes two or more of the plurality of games simultaneously or substantially simultaneously and concludes or completes two of more of the plurality of games sequentially or substantially sequentially. In another embodiment, the gaming system concludes or completes each of the plurality of games sequentially. For example, as seen in , the gaming system completes the first game (i.e., Game ) at a fifth point in time (i.e., point-in-time B ), completes the second game (i.e., Game ) at a sixth, different point in time (i.e., point-in-time D ), completes the third game (i.e., Game ) at a seventh, different point in time (i.e., point-in-time F ) and completes the fourth game (i.e., Game ) at a eighth, different point in time (i.e., point-in-time G ).","If each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are not complete, the gaming system returns to diamond  and again determines if each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are complete. That is, if at least one of the simultaneously played games (or a secondary game triggered in association with any of the wagered on primary games) is still being played, the gaming system continues with the play of that game as described above. For example, as seen in , at any point in time prior to the completion of the second game (i.e., Game ), at least the second game is being played and thus each of the plurality of games are not complete.","On the other hand, if each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are complete, the gaming system sequentially reports the escrowed results of these simultaneously played games to the gaming device accounting system as indicated in block . That is, the gaming system stores the game play and\/or accounting data or information for a plurality of played game in one or more memory devices of the gaming system and then plays such game play and\/or accounting data or information back to a gaming device accounting system (which is a separate and distinct system from the gaming system) as if these played games were played sequentially (instead of how such games were actually simultaneously played). Put differently, at the completion of the plurality of simultaneously played games, the gaming system serializes the plays of these games and presents such games to the gaming device accounting system as if they were played sequentially with an applicable game switch between each played game. Thus, despite the plurality of games actually being played simultaneously, the gaming system transfers data or information to the gaming device accounting system such that the gaming device accounting system determines (or at least perceives to determine) that these simultaneously played games were played sequentially.","For example, as seen in , when reporting the results of the four simultaneously played games of  to the gaming device accounting system, amongst other statistical information reported to the gaming device accounting system, the gaming system reports that:\n\n","In another embodiment, the gaming system waits until all previously started overlappingly played games are complete before any game start or game end messaging is communicated to the gaming device accounting system. In another embodiment, the gaming system enables one or more games to be initiated before all of the previously initiated overlappingly played game are complete. In one such embodiment, the gaming system is configured to report the results of each game in the order such games are initiated. For example, if game  is initiated, game  is initiated, game  is initiated, game  completes, game  is initiated, and game  completes. In this example, at this point, the gaming system reports the results of games  and  to the gaming device accounting system, even though games  and  are still in play. In another such embodiment, the gaming system is configured to report the results of each game as such games are completed. For example, if game  is initiated, game  is initiated, game  is initiated, and game  completes. In this example, at this point, the gaming system reports the results of game  to the gaming device accounting system even though games  and  are still in play. In another embodiment, the gaming system accounts for timing issues, such as the need to report which game is currently being played and allow sufficient time for the gaming system to register that change before reporting any plays of that game.","In another embodiment, the gaming system enables one or more \u201cmid-game\u201d wagers or bets to be placed in association with one or more games played. Such \u201cmid-game\u201d wagers or bets are wagers which are made in addition to the wager which initiated the play of the game (e.g., a wager to split cards in a blackjack game or a wager to double-down in a blackjack game). In this embodiment, the gaming system delays the reporting of any game starts until the final outcome for the play of the started game is determined. This causes the game start messaging and the game end messaging to be communicated to the gaming device accounting system as back-to-back messages. It should be appreciated that in this embodiment, even if the game start and game end messaging are communicated as back-to-back messages for any individual game played, when a plurality of such games are overlappingly played, the gaming system reports the results of such overlappingly played games as a plurality of sequentially played game.","Accordingly, as illustrated in these examples, to accommodate certain gaming device accounting systems that are not configured to support a player simultaneously or concurrently playing a plurality of games, the gaming system disclosed herein reports the results of such simultaneously, overlappingly or concurrently played games as the results of a plurality of sequentially played games. That is, despite any time differences between a gaming device accounting system's polling rate and the time it takes for a gaming device to report a game change event, the gaming system disclosed herein enables bulk reporting of games played after any game change events. Such a configuration thus enables certain gaming device accounting systems (which are not configured to support a player placing a plurality of wagers on a plurality of simultaneous or concurrent plays of a plurality of primary games) to support a player placing a plurality of wagers on a plurality of simultaneous or concurrent plays of a plurality of primary games. By overcoming this limitation associated with certain known gaming device accounting systems, the gaming establishment operators using these gaming device accounting systems are enabled to offer similar simultaneous game play features to players and are thus not at any disadvantage to other gaming establishment operators using different gaming device accounting systems.","Referring now to , a flowchart of an additional or alternative example embodiment of a process for operating a gaming system, a gaming server or a gaming device disclosed herein is illustrated. In one embodiment, this process is embodied in one or more software programs stored in one or more memories and executed by one or more processors or one or more servers. Although this process is described with reference to the flowchart illustrated in , it should be appreciated that many other methods of performing the acts associated with this process may be used. For example, the order of certain steps described may be changed, or certain steps described may be optional.","In various embodiments, the gaming system enables a player to place a plurality of wagers on a plurality of simultaneously played games as indicated in block . In these embodiments, as also indicated in block , the gaming system: enables at least one of the simultaneously played games for at least one central server, central controller or remote host initiated feature, command or request and disables at least one of the simultaneously played games from any central server, central controller or remote host initiated features or requests. For example, as seen in , the gaming system enables a player to wager on and simultaneously play four distinct games (i.e., Game  , Game  , Game  and Game  ). In this example: (i) one of the games (i.e., Game  ) is enabled to accept or operate in conjunction with one or more remote host initiated features or requests, and (ii) three of the games (i.e., Game  , Game  and Game  ) are each disabled (i.e., currently incapable of) from accepting or operating in conjunction with any remote host initiated features or requests.","In one embodiment, a remote host initiated feature, remote host command or request includes a feature or request which modifies one or more game play aspects or parameters of at least one of the plays of at least one of the games being played, such as a feature which reconfigures a paytable utilized for a play of a game. In one such embodiment, if a game is being actively played, then any modification of one or more game play aspects or parameters are held or saved until the game is no longer being actively played (e.g., when the game is idle or inactive for a designated period of time). In another such embodiment, if a game is being actively played, then the gaming system determines whether to implement or hold such a modification based on if the modification benefits the player (e.g., increases the average expected payback percentage of the paytable utilized) or does not benefit the player (e.g., decreases the average expected payback percentage of the paytable being used). In this embodiment, if such a modification does not provide a benefit to the player, then such a modification occurs between played games (i.e., not to any previously wagered on games) or between played gaming sessions (i.e., not while a game is active). On the other hand, if such a modification provides a benefit to the player, then such a modification may occur between played games, between gaming sessions or in association with one or more currently wagered on games.","In another embodiment, a remote host initiated feature, remote host command or remote host request includes a feature or request which maintains one or more game play aspects or parameters of at least one of the plays of at least one of the games being played, but otherwise requests the gaming device to execute or perform a task, such as a request for information or data regarding one or more events which occurred during a designated period of time. It should be appreciated such tasks are either unrelated to the player or authorized by the player.","After the player wagers on each of the plurality of simultaneously played games, the gaming system determines if a remote host has initiated any features in association with the play of the games as indicated in diamond  of . That is, the gaming system determines if the remote host has communicated any commands to the individual gaming device regarding the simultaneously played games.","If the remote host has initiated at least one feature in association with play of the plurality of simultaneously played games, for each of the played games that is enabled to accept a remote host initiated feature, the gaming system executes or otherwise implements the initiated remote host feature as indicated in block . In a first example, if Game  of  is a slot game that is enabled to accept a remote host initiated feature or request and the remote host initiated feature or request is a reconfiguration of the paytable utilized for one play of a game, the gaming system executes or implements this remote host initiated feature or request by reconfiguring the paytable of Game . In a second example, if Game  of  is a slot game that is enabled to accept a remote host initiated feature or request and the remote host initiated feature or request is a request for data or information from the gaming device, the gaming system executes or implements this remote host initiated feature or request by providing the requested data or information to the remote host. It should be appreciated that in this example, the providing of the requested data or information may cause the reels of the slot game to spin for a longer duration which alters or otherwise interferes with the play of this slot game.","Moreover, if the remote host has initiated at least one feature in association with play of the plurality of simultaneously played game, for each of the played games that is disabled from accepting a remote host initiated feature, the gaming system does not execute or otherwise implement the initiated remote host feature as indicated in block  of . That is, to moderate the affect that remote host initiated features have on a player's gaming experience, the gaming system is configured to ignore or otherwise disregard the remote host initiated features for one or more of the simultaneously played games. Building on the first example described above, if Game  of  is a slot game that is disabled from accepting a remote host initiated feature or request and the remote host initiated feature or request is a reconfiguration of the paytable utilized for one play of a game, the gaming system ignores this remote host initiated feature or request and does not reconfigure the paytable of Game . Building on the second example described above, if Game  of  is a slot game that is disabled from accepting a remote host initiated feature or request and the remote host initiated feature or request is a request for data or information from the gaming device, the gaming system ignores this remote host initiated feature or request. It should be appreciated that in this second example, the gaming system's disregard of the requested data or information does not alter the duration which the reels of the slot game will spin and thus does not alter or otherwise interfere with the play of this slot game.","After: (i) executing the initiated remote host feature for certain of the simultaneously played games and not executing the initiated remote host feature for certain other of the simultaneously played games, or (ii) if no remote host feature is initiated, the gaming system generates and displays an outcome for each of the plurality of simultaneously played games as indicated in blocks  and  of . The gaming system then determines any award associated with the generated outcome for each of the plurality of simultaneously played games and provides the player any determined award associated with the generated outcome for each of the plurality of simultaneously played games as indicated in block  and . Following the providing of any determined awards, the gaming system returns to block  and again enables the player to place a plurality of wagers on a plurality of simultaneously played displayed games.","It should be appreciated that when generating the outcome for each of the plays of the simultaneously played games, the gaming system accounts for any remote host initiated features that modify any determinations associated with the play of that game. That is, if a remote host initiates a feature in association with a plurality of simultaneous plays of a plurality of games and the initiated remote host feature is associated with a modification of the play of such games, for each of the simultaneously played games that is configured to respond to the initiated remote host feature, the play of that game is modified based on the initiated remote host feature. For example, if Game  of  is a slot game that is enabled to accept a remote host initiated feature or request, the remote host initiated feature or request is a modifier of 2\u00d7 to any awards associated with any generated outcomes and the gaming system generates a symbol combination of cherry-cherry-cherry associated with an award of $10 for the play of this game, the gaming system applies the modifier of 2\u00d7(from the remote host initiated feature) to this award of $10 to provide the player an award of $20.","In one embodiment, each of the simultaneously played games are associated with an application programming interface. In this embodiment, the application programming interface enables both the simultaneously played games that are enabled to accept a remote host initiated feature and the simultaneously played games that are disabled from accepting any remote host initiated features to synchronize with each other.","As described above, in one embodiment, a remote host initiated feature or request includes the modification or reconfiguration of one or more parameters or aspects of a player's play of a game. In different such embodiments, the remote host initiated feature or request includes, but is not limited to:\n\n","As described above, in another embodiment, a remote host initiated feature or request includes a feature or request which maintains one or more game play parameters or aspects of at least one of the plays of at least one of the games being played, but otherwise requests the gaming device to execute or perform a task. In different such embodiments, the remote host initiated feature or request includes, but is not limited to:\n\n","In one embodiment, each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are the same type of game. In another embodiment, each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are different types of games. In another embodiment, at least two of the plurality of simultaneously played games are the same type of game and at least two of the plurality of simultaneously played games are different types of games. In different embodiments, one or more of the simultaneously played games include, but are not limited to: any suitable slot game, any suitable free spins or free activations game, any suitable wheel game, any suitable card game, any suitable keno game, any suitable bingo game, any suitable die or dice game, any suitable virtual horse racing game; any suitable offer and acceptance game, any suitable award ladder game, any suitable puzzle-type game, any suitable persistence game, any suitable selection game, any suitable cascading symbols game, any suitable ways to win game, any suitable scatter pay game, any suitable elimination game, any suitable group or community cooperation game, any suitable group or community competition game, or any other suitable type of game.","In one embodiment, the gaming system utilizes a single display device, such as central display device  or upper display device , to display each of the plurality of simultaneously played games. In another embodiment, utilizes a plurality of display devices, such as central display device  and upper display device , to display the plurality of simultaneously played games. In another embodiment, the gaming system utilizes one or more service windows, media displays, or player user interface windows, such as the service windows described in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007\/0243934, U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007\/0243928, U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2008\/0009344, U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2009\/0104954, and\/or U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2009\/0233705, to display one or more of the plurality of simultaneously played games.","It should be appreciated that in different embodiments, one or more of:\n\n","It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
