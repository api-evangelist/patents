{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","RVSP Client Application","DEFINITIONS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/447,664, filed on Feb. 28, 2011, and entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Real-Time Video Communications\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to video communication services. More particularly, the present invention relates to electronic devices, computer program products, and methods with which multiple participants can simultaneously create and share video in real-time.","Demand for Real-Time Video","Explosive growth in consumer and business demand for real-time video on mobile and Internet devices has created exciting new commercial opportunities and major new technical challenges. As they pursue the integration of new real-time video capabilities () for mobile\/Internet communication, business collaboration, entertainment, and social networking, device manufacturers, network infrastructure providers, and service provides are struggling to meet customer expectations for higher quality real-time video across a wider range of devices and networks.","Limitations of Broadcast Video Solutions","Today's standard video processing and distribution technologies have been developed to efficiently support one-way video broadcast, not the two-way and multi-party video sharing required for real-time mobile and Internet user interaction. Traditional broadcast industry solutions have proven to be too computationally complex and bandwidth hungry to deliver the device, infrastructure, or bandwidth requirements for commercially scalable real-time mobile\/Internet video services.","Device, Network, and Video Fluctuations","Furthermore, the available computational resources on many devices, as well as the delay, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth congestion over user networks cannot be guaranteed to remain constant during a real-time video\/audio communication session. In the absence of any adaptation strategy, both device and network loading can lead to significant degradation in the user experience. An adaptation strategy designed to address network fluctuations but not device loading fluctuations is ineffective, since it is often difficult to distinguish between these two contributors to apparent \u201clost packets\u201d and other performance degradations. Adaptation to frame-to-frame fluctuations in inherent video characteristics can provide additional performance benefits.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise an all-software Real-time Video Service Platform (RVSP). The RVSP is an end-to-end system solution that enables high-quality real-time two-way and multi-party video communications within the real-world constraints of mobile networks and public Internet connections. The RVSP includes both Client and Server software applications, both of which leverage low-complexity, low-bandwidth, and network-adaptive video processing and communications methods.","The RVSP Client () integrates all: video and audio encode, decode, and synchronization functions; real-time device and network adaptation; and network signaling, transport, and control protocols, into a single all-software application compatible with smartphone and PC operating systems. The RVSP client application has been designed to accommodate fluctuations in: the internal loading of client devices; external impairments on a variety of different user networks; and inherent video characteristics such as frame-to-frame compressibility and degree of motion.","The RVSP Server () integrates multiparty connectivity, transcoding, and automated video editing into a single all-software application. The all-software architecture of the RVSP supports flexible deployment across a wide range of network infrastructure, including existing mobile application\/media server infrastructure, standard utility server hardware, or in a cloud computing infrastructure. For both peer-to-peer and server-based real-time 2-way video share services and multi-party video conferencing, the RVSP platform reduces both the up-front capital expenditures (CapEx) and on-going operational expenditures (OpEx) compared to existing video platforms that utilize significantly higher bandwidths and require additional specialized video hardware in both the user devices and the network infrastructure.","In order to meet customer expectations for higher quality video across a wider range of devices and networks, mobile operators and other communication service providers worldwide have made significant new investments in IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network infrastructure. By reducing bandwidth consumption and supporting higher concurrent user loading capabilities for a given infrastructure investment and bandwidth allotment in an IMS deployment (), the RVSP provides significant CapEx and OpEx reductions over competing real-time video platforms that require additional specialized video hardware in both the user devices and the network infrastructure.","The RVSP also delivers similar CapEx and OpEx benefits for \u201cover the top\u201d (OTT) and direct-to-subscriber deployments of real-time video services () using standard utility server hardware or in a cloud computing infrastructure. In these cases, mobile devices communicating via public Internet or corporate networking infrastructure typically do not have access to video quality-of-service (QoS) enhancements in the mobile operator's IMS core. The real-time network adaptation features of the RVSP disclosed here then become critical to delivering a compelling user experience within the real-world constraints of mobile networks and consumer Internet connections.","Video conferencing systems are evolving to enable a more life-like \u201cTelepresence\u201d user experience, in which the quality of the real-time video and audio communications and the physical layout of the meeting rooms are enhanced so that multiple remote parties can experience the look, sound, and feel of all meeting around at the same table. As shown in , multi-user video conferencing systems typically require specially designed meeting rooms with dedicated video cameras, large size video displays, arrays of audio microphones and speakers, and specialized processing equipment for digitizing, compressing, and distributing the multiple video and audio streams over dedicated high-speed data network connections.","For many consumer and business applications, there is a need to extend higher quality multi-party video communications to participants using a wider variety of less-specialized video-enabled electronic devices, including mobile communications devices, laptop computers, PCs, and standard TVs. There is also a need to extend immersive business communications to support a wider range of consumer and professional collaboration and social networking activities.","When it comes to multi-party video communications, users of these less-specialized electronic devices encounter a number of drawbacks in the devices and in the user experience. For example, these devices may have a wide range of video processing capabilities, video display sizes, available connection bandwidths, and available connection quality-of-service (QoS). Furthermore, without the benefit of specially designed meeting rooms, creating a \u201cperceptually pleasant\u201d meeting experience is challenging. Many video conferencing systems rely on a static screen layout in which all participants are presented within an array of equal-sized video \u201ctiles\u201d, even though several participants may be passive listeners throughout much of the meeting and hence contribute very little. These \u201cstatic\u201d multi-party video default display layouts have many drawbacks, including:\n\n","When deployed together, the RVSP Client and Server applications enable multiple participants to simultaneously create and share high-quality video with each other in real-time, with many key aspects of a face-to-face user experience.","As illustrated in , the RVSP Client integrates all: video and audio encode, decode, and synchronization functions; real-time device and network adaptation; and network signaling, transport, and control protocols, into a single all-software application compatible with leading smartphone and PC operating systems. The highly modular and open API architecture of the RVSP Client supports rapid and flexible device and service customization. Key components of the RVSP Client application include the Digital Technology Media Engine (DTME), Application Layer, and Device Abstraction, OS Abstraction, and Network Abstraction modules. The RVSP Client can include more or less components than specifically mentioned herein.","Application Layer","The Application Layer provides the primary user interface (UI), and can be rapidly customized to support a wide range of real-time video applications and services with customer-specified User Experience Design (UxD) requirements.

The RTA sub-system adapts to the measured fluctuations in device loading via corresponding\n\n","Network Impairments: The RTA sub-system analyzes the audio and video RTP media packets and corresponding RTCP control packets being generated within, and transmitted between, RVSP-enabled client devices, in order to measure\/predict and adapt to fluctuations in the network. The RTA sub-system adapts to the measured fluctuations in network performance via corresponding modifications to\n\n","Inherent Video Characteristics: The DTV-X video encoder analyzes frame-to-frame variations in the inherent compressibility of uncompressed video frame sequences being delivered from the camera module, and communicates this information to the RTA sub-system. The RTA sub-system utilizes this information to prevent the RVSP client from attempting to drive target bits\/frame or frames\/second to unnecessarily high or unattainably low levels during a call session. The inherent compressibility will vary with the relative degree of luma and chroma detail and\/or the relative degree of motion in a sequence of video frames.","Successful real-time adaptation within the RVSP Client application requires that the above analysis and feedback be implemented as a set of collaborating processes within and between the RTA sub-system, the DTV-X video codec, the RTP\/RTCP module, and the Session Control module. During a real-time video session, the RTA sub-system first determines device and network limitations during call setup and capabilities exchange between the participating devices. Once a real-time video has been established, the RTA sub-system continues to analyze and adapt to fluctuations in device and network impairments and video parameters.","Determining Device\/Network Limitations during Call Setup: During call setup and capabilities exchange, the RVSP client application determines the media bandwidth appropriate to the targeted user experience that can be supported by the device(s) and network(s) participating in the video call session. For each video call session, this bits\/second target is then utilized by the RVSP client application(s) to establish\n\n","The initial bits\/second, frames\/second, bits\/frame, and bytes\/packet targets should likely not be chosen to correspond to the maximum rates that are expected to be supported by the device(s) and network(s) participating in the video call session. Instead, the initial targets should be chosen so as to guarantee a high probability that they will actually be met, in order to avoid prolonged periods at call startup where the RTA sub-system is \u201cout of target\u201d and delivering a degraded user experience.","Analyzing Device\/Network Impairments and Video Parameters During Call:","The following RTA-related parameters are measured during each video call:","Device Impairments","i. Camera Speed Degradation","Measured input is the difference between the uncompressed video frame rate requested from the camera and the actual uncompressed video frame rate that is delivered to the RVSP application for processing by the DTV-X video encoder.","Used to determine the maximum video frame rate that can be requested.","ii. Device Loading on Send Channel","Measured input is the fraction of the uncompressed video frames delivered by the camera that arrive within a time window suitable to be further processed by the DTV-X encoder.","Used to determine the maximum video frame rate that can actually be encoded and sent.","iii. Device Loading on Receive Channel","Measured input is the fraction of the compressed video packets successfully received and re-assembled into complete video frames by the RVSP application within a time window suitable to be further processed by the DTV-X decoder.","Used to determine the maximum video frame rate that can actually be decoded and displayed.","Network Impairments","iv. Network Congestion","Measured inputs are the RTCP reports and internal video and audio packet output status utilized by each device to determine the number of packets that the device itself has already sent but are still in transit to the target receiving device.","Used to estimate available network bandwidth in order to update target bit rate in bits\/sec and packet size in bytes\/packet. Our own measurements have revealed that correlation between the transmission of audio and video packets on mobile network is poor (). Packet tracing added to the DTME to report the number of Audio and Video packets in transit at any given time under multiple controlled and uncontrolled network conditions has shown that the fractional in-transit Audio and Video packet counts are not well correlated, and that both show a significant dependence on packet size for any given level of network congestion. At higher levels of network congestion, smaller video packet sizes result in improved overall video throughput. At lower levels of network congestion, efficient video throughput can be maintained with larger packet sizes.","Good correlation between Audio and Video packets in transit can be used as an indication that network congestion is low and that the Video packet size is small enough to ensure efficient video throughput at the current level of network congestion.","Poor correlation between Audio and Video packets in transit can be used as an indication that network congestion is high and that the Video packet size is not small enough to ensure efficient video throughput at the current level of network congestion.","v. Uplink and Downlink Network Packet Loss","Measured inputs are the RTCP reports indicating the fraction of packets lost.","Used as an additional input to gauge the network congestion and the corresponding effective real-time network bandwidth. Also used to modify \u201caggressiveness\u201d of progressive refresh and PN frame ratio.","vi. Uplink and Downlink Network Jitter","Measured input is the difference between arrival-time intervals (between successive packets, observed as they arrive on the receiver device) and capture-time intervals (between successive packets, as indicated by timestamps written by the sender device). These difference measurements are processed using a rolling average filter to calculate a \u201crecently observed jitter\u201d.","Used to adapt the depth of the RVSP jitter buffer in order to support packet re-ordering.","vii. Roundtrip, Uplink, and Downlink Network Delays","Measured via NTP-based time values provided in RTCP sender report\u2014RFC 1889 section 6.3.1 (also see : Example for round-trip time computation). Let SSRC_r denote the receiver issuing this report. Source SSRC_n can compute the round-trip propagation delay to SSRC_r by recording the time A when this reception report block is received. It calculates the total round-trip time A-LSR using the last SR timestamp (LSR in the RTCP Sender report) field, and then subtracting the delay since the last SR was sent (DLSR in the RTCP Sender report field). The round-trip propagation delay is then given as (A-LSR-DLSR).","May be used to estimate signaling delay that must be accounted for if\/when an I-Frame resend request is made from one device to another.","Inherent Video Characteristics","viii. Video Frame Compressibility","Measured via the internal compression parameters (quantization levels, prediction mode decisions, and others) and the resulting actual compressed frame size generated by the DTV-X encoder. The inherent compressibility will vary with the relative degree of luma detail, chroma detail, brightness, contrast, and\/or the relative degree of motion in a sequence of video frame.","Used to alter the trade-off between bits\/frame and frames\/second targets during extended sequences of \u201chighly compressible\u201d frames. When frames are highly compressible, it may be advantageous to allocate fewer bits to each compressed image and choose a higher frame rate for smoother motion, within the given overall bit rate target. Conversely, when frames are difficult to compress well, it may be advantageous to reduce the frame rate and allocate more bits to each compressed frame.","ix. Relative Degree of Luma and Chroma Detail","Measured from the quantization levels and resulting compressed size in different wavelet transform subbands for current video frame input to DTV-X encoder.","Used to determine minimum bits\/frame required to provide good image fidelity.","x. Relative Degree of Motion in Video Frame Sequence","Measured from motion channel in saliency map for current video frame input to DTV-X encoder.","Used to determine the minimum frame rate required to provide good motion fidelity, and to support lower frame rates and higher bits\/frame targets during extended sequences of \u201clow motion\u201d frames. The motion channel of the saliency map generation compares a filtered version of the current frame's luma against the same version of the previous frame or frames, estimating motion based on the magnitude of differences in the comparison.","Adaptation to Device\/Network\/Video Fluctuations during Call: The RVSP RTA sub-system processes the above inputs from the camera module, DTV-X codec, RTP\/RTCP module, and RVSP packet\/frame buffers in order to update its estimates of parameters (i)-(x) above.","Adapting the Bit Rate Target: Based on the updated estimates of (i)-(v), the RTA sub-system then either maintains or updates the bit rate target for the next video frame to be encoded. The RTA sub-system must resolve an updated bit rate target into the appropriate combination of fps and bits\/frame that will maintain the best possible user experience in the presence of fluctuating device and network characteristics. In more advanced scenarios that exploit DTV-X codec feedback on video frame compressibility (viii) and degree of motion (ix), the RTA sub-system may choose to maintain the bit rate target but modify the underlying combination of fps and bits\/frame.","Adapting the Jitter Buffer Depth: Based on the updated estimate of (vi), the RTA sub-system then either maintains or updates the RVSP packet\/frame jitter buffer depth(s). If excessive jitter bursts are detected, and these cannot be accommodated by packet re-ordering in the jitter buffer set to its maximum depth, then the corresponding packets must be treated by the RVSP client as if they were lost. The RTA sub-system may send a request to the other user to send a new I-frame in order to reset the decode process at the receiver impacted by the burst. The roundtrip network delay estimate (vii) provides the device with a lower limit on how long it must expect to wait for the requested I-frame to be delivered, and thus how long it must rely on alternative mechanisms (saliency\/progressive refresh\/V-frames) to deal with the high packet loss.","Adapting to Video Frame Compressibility and Degree of Motion: Based on the updated estimates of (viii)-(x) above, the RTA sub-system then either maintains or updates the bits\/frame and frames\/sec targets. In order to deliver the best user experience using the least device and network resources, the RTA sub-system can maintain lower bits\/frame targets during extended sequences of \u201chighly compressible\u201d frames (low relative degree of Luma and Chroma detail), and\/or lower frames\/sec targets during extended sequences of \u201clow motion\u201d frames.","RTA Sub-System Implementation","Key Modules","As shown in , the RTA subsystem includes the following modules:\n\n","Automatic Bit Rate Adjustment (ABA): The ABA evaluates two measurements of the network performance to determine the target bit rate for video transmission:\n\n","The ABA compares this bit rate target against the peer's computation to ensure this unit does not consume a disproportionate amount of the available network bandwidth. The ABA unit periodically notifies it's peer with its determined target bit rate for video transmission. The peer compares its own target to this value and when its value is significantly larger, the peer lowers its own target correspondingly.","Rate Function: The Rate Function converts the target bit rate into a corresponding combination of frame rate and bytes\/frame for the encoder output. As shown in Frame , the rate function incorporates the following parameters:\n\n","Frame Rate Regulator: Because the output frame rate from the camera modules on many smartphones and tablets is often irregular, the Frame Rate Regulator provides intermediate frame buffering\/processing in order to ensure that the DTV-X video encoder receives video frames at the fps rate targeted by the Rate Function.","Compression Regulator: The Compression Regulator monitors the encoder output and modulates the frames\/sec and bytes\/frame targets based on the recent frame compressibility history provided by the video encoder. The goal is to deliver the best user experience using the least device and network resources. For example, the RTA sub-system can maintain lower bits\/frame and higher frames\/second targets during extended sequences of \u201chighly compressible\u201d frames (low relative degree of Luma and Chroma detail), and\/or lower frames\/sec and higher bits\/frame targets during extended sequences of \u201clow motion\u201d frames. Additionally, the Compression Regulator monitors and compares the actual uncompressed video frame rate delivered by the Camera and the actual compressed video frame rate delivered by the Encoder, and adjusts the bytes\/frame target to achieve the target bit rate. The Compression Regulator can thus modify the Rate Function described above.","Jitter Buffer Control: The Jitter Buffer Control measures the difference between arrival-time intervals (between successive packets, observed as they arrive on the receiver device) and capture-time intervals (between successive packets, as indicated by timestamps written by the sender device). These difference measurements are processed using a rolling average filter to calculate a \u201crecently observed jitter\u201d. If the recently observed jitter increases, the temporal depth of the RVSP jitter buffer in the RTP\/RTCP module is increased in order to support packet re-ordering over a larger number of packets. If the recently observed jitter decreases, the temporal depth of the RVSP jitter buffer in the RTP\/RTCP module is decreased correspondingly.","Packet Size Control: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest packet size that can be transmitted over a network. Occasionally, the size of the video frame exceeds this maximum and the frame is split across several packets. The number of packets is first determined and then the frame is split evenly across that number of packets. Packet size can also be reduced\/increased to enable more efficient video transmission as network impairments increase\/decrease.","Codec Control: The DTV-X video codec encoder accepts video frames (images) in sequence and produces compressed representations of them for transmission to the DTV-X video codec decoder. It has various control inputs and information outputs, in addition to the input and output of video frames, as can be seen in .","With each frame to be compressed, the encoder accepts a frame type request that can be \u201cI-Frame\u201d, \u201cP-Frame\u201d, or (in some embodiments) \u201cV-Frame\u201d. These designate options in the encoding process and the format of the resulting compressed frame. The encoder will produce an I-frame when requested. It may produce an I frame when a P-frame was requested, if the compression process produces a better result as an I-frame; for example, in the case of a sudden scene change or cut. V-frames are reduced representations that should be used only in between I-frames or P-frames; in some embodiments, the encoder may produce a V-frame when a P-frame was requested.","With each frame to be compressed, the encoder accepts a target for the compressed size of the frame. This target may not be met exactly; if the video is changing in compressibility character, the actual compressed size may differ from the target by a significant factor.","The encoder accepts an input indication of the desired strength of Progressive Refresh, which is the fraction of each P-frame that should be compressed without reference to prior frames or encoding state. The reason for this is that if a frame is lost or cannot be decoded for any reason, the decoder will not have available the necessary state reference for correctly decoding frames that follow the missing frame. Progressive refresh allows the reference state to be refreshed partially in every P-frame, so that it is not necessary to send I-frames periodically. This makes the frame size and transmission bit rate more uniform, and adds robustness against lost packets.","With each compressed frame that it produces as output, the encoder delivers an indication of the frame type actually used for this frame, whether I-Frame, P-Frame, or V-Frame.","With each compressed frame that it produces as output, the encoder delivers an indication of the actual size to which the frame was compressed. This may be compared with the size target that was given as input, and used in a rate control tracking loop to keep actual rate within tighter long-term bounds than the codec's single frame size targeting ability.","With each compressed frame that it produces as output, the encoder delivers an estimate of the compressibility of the frame. This can be used in deciding how to balance frames-per-second against bits-per-frame in the rate control process.","With each compressed frame that it produces as output, the encoder delivers an estimate of the motion activity of the frame, and of the detail levels in the frame. These can be used in deciding how to balance frames-per-second against bits-per-frame in the rate control process.","RTA Bit Rate Adjustment Algorithm Description","The presentation quality of real-time video is impacted by packet delay\/jitter and packet loss during transmission over the network.

A standard off-the-shelf Linux based computer is used to implement the Network Impairment Router. Network impairment is realized using Traffic Control, a standard utility on Linux. Traffic Control is a command line based utility. MasterShaper is a network traffic shaper that leverage Traffic Control and other Linux utilities to provide a Web Interface for Quality of Service (QoS) functions.","Two devices are used to conduct real-time Peer-to-Peer Video Call tests. Each device connects to a separate access point, forcing the video call path to go thru the Network Impairment Router. Shell scripts leveraging Traffic Control\/MasterShaper commands are used to control the Peer-to-Peer Video Call path. MasterShaper allows predetermined values and fluctuations of the bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss to be set for the Video Call path.","IPerl is installed on both clients and used to validate the IFPW bandwidth. One iPerf client is setup as the server and the other as the client. iPerf performs a test to measure the effective bandwidth over the network connection between the client and the server.","Bandwidth Adaptation Testing","Bandwidth adaption test cases demonstrate the RVSP Client's capability to maintain high quality video under varying network bandwidth availability. The network bandwidth is first set to a target (constant) level, and a real-time video call session is initiated to demonstrate how the RTA sub-system allows the Client to adapt to the initial network capacity (). Next, the network bandwidth is varied during the video call session to demonstrate how the RTA sub-system allows the Client to track and adapt to variations in the network capacity ().","Jitter Adaptation Testing","Network jitter presents a particular challenge for video. In this test case we induce a jitter of up to 50 ms, and show how the Client continues to deliver high quality video. Qualitative results are produced by the Client, and can be observed using eclipse's logging facility (by connecting the device under test to an eclipse enabled PC). The Client reports the number of total audio and video packets that were found out of order, and the degree to which it was successful sorting the out-of-order packets. For qualitative results, the video can be observed during the call while jitter is introduced. Video is never frozen. Further, the Client's saliency capability is used to only refresh salient parts of the video when packets are lost. Additionally, by turning jitter on and off, the relative delay on Handset B is adjusted automatically. Hence the Client does not rely on a fixed buffer that introduce needless delay.","Packet Loss Adaptation Testing","All networks are prone to packet loss. This is a particular problem for wireless networks, or use cases where the packets must traverse multiple network boundaries to reach the target destination. In this test case, we implement packet loss rates up to 5% on the video communication path, and observe the resulting video quality. Since reducing the bandwidth can also cause the packet loss rate to vary, the Client bandwidth adaptation capability (ABA) is turned off for these tests. We turn off adaption by selecting the menu button during a video call, and clicking on \u201cABA Off\u201d button. The result of this test is qualitative only. Similar to the jitter test case, the video never freezes, and in event of a packet loss, only salient parts of the video are refreshed, resulting in a more acceptable user acceptable experience.","Video Conferencing User Features","When deployed together, the RVSP Client and Server applications enable multiple participants to simultaneously create and share high-quality video with each other in real-time, with many key aspects of a face-to-face user experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0241"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0242"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0243"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},"While several embodiments have been shown and described herein, it should be understood that changes and modifications can be made to the invention without departing from the invention in its broader aspects.
