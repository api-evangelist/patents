Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the diagnosis of disorders or dysfunctions characterized by autoimmune responses to the enzyme class of transglutaminases. The present invention provides a novel open structure of the transglutaminases in a stabilized form which renders new epitopes accessible for antibody-binding.","2. Description of the Relevant Art","Transglutaminases (TG) are enzymes that exist in higher vertebrates including the human body as a family of nine members, including the inactive structural protein band 4.2. They fulfil a large variety of physiological functions e.g. in coagulation, inflammation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and wound healing. In the presence of Ca transglutaminases may develop their catalytic activity, the formation of inter- and intra-molecular \u03b3-glutamyl-\u03b5-lysine bonds, also called iso-peptide bonds, between the side chains of peptidic glutamine and lysine. In general the results of this activity are high-molecular weight protein aggregates. Transglutaminases 1, 3 and 5 are mainly involved in skin-formation, factor XIII (plasma-transglutaminase) is active in blood coagulation and wound healing, transglutaminase 6 has mainly been found in neuronal tissues and transglutaminase 4 in semen fluid. Transglutaminase 2 (tissue transglutaminase, TG2) is ubiquitously present in various tissues. Besides its cross-linking activity TG2 may also deamidate the carboxyamide group of peptidic glutamine, especially under slightly acidic conditions as well as in the absence of lysine or other primary amines. As the deamidation product is a carboxyl group, a negative charge is introduced into the peptide which results in a significant change of peptide properties. Further TG2 has GTP-hydrolysing activity and functions as a G-Protein. Even kinase activity is described. TG2 plays a role in several diseases like celiac disease, fibrosis, cancer, and neurological disorders.","In celiac disease, a chronic inflammation of the small intestine and an autoimmune disease, TG2 plays a multifunctional role. Digestion of proteins present in our food is performed by proteolytical cleavage to amino acids and small peptides, which can be resorbed by the intestinal mucosa. Cereal proteins like gluten show a high content of the amino acid proline. But the enzymes responsible for protein degradation in the digestive tract are not able to hydrolyse proline-rich proteins into amino acids and small peptides. Consequently rather long peptides, like gliadin peptides are present in the mucosa. Due to their size they cannot be resorbed, but they are still able to pass the epithelium and to reach the so called lamina propria, a connecting tissue between epithelium and muscular tissue. In the lamina propria extracellular TG2 is present. Now an essential step in celiac disease pathophysiology takes place: TG2 deamidates gliadin peptides. In their deamidated form gliadin peptides are recognized by the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 receptors of immune cells. This recognition leads to the triggering of the inflammatory response which in the final stage of the disease manifests in a complete villous atrophy of the intestinal mucosa. TG2 not only catalyses gliadin deamidation, it serves also as autoantigen in celiac disease. Patients who suffer from celiac disease develop autoantibodies against TG2. If patients successfully follow a strict gluten free diet anti-TG2-autoantibody titers decrease. Therefore TG2 is not only used as antigen for autoantibody-detection in the diagnosis of celiac disease, but also in the follow up and control of the gluten free diet. TG2-autoantibodies are also found in other diseases like diabetes type 1 or psoriasis and may therefore be used in non-celiac disease diagnostics too.","Interestingly in other indications developing along or in consequence to celiac disease further autoantibodies against transglutaminases can be found: Dermatitis herpetiformis, a gluten sensitive skin disorder is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) whereas in glutensensitive ataxia autoantibodies against neuronal transglutaminase (TG6) have been found.","Objective of the present invention is to provide a more sensitive method for detecting autoimmune diseases characterized by the presence of transglutaminase specific autoantibodies.","The objective of the present invention is solved by the teaching of the independent claims. Further advantageous features, aspects and details of the invention are evident from the dependent claims, the description, the figures and the examples of the present application.","The present invention surprisingly found, that the use of the open form transglutaminase for detection of autoantibodies leads to higher titers compared to the closed form of the transglutaminase and reveals positive titers in patients with titers against the closed TG form below the cut-off. This invention is of immense impact on diagnosis, antibody isolation and immune cell characterization.","The transglutaminases change their tertiary structure upon substrate binding. Inactive non-substrate binding TG shows a closed form which upon substrate binding changes to an open form. Both forms the closed form without substrate and the open form with substrate are recognized by autoantibodies. It is assumed that autoantibodies for the closed form as well as for the open form exist.","However it was most surprisingly found that the open form of the TG can be used to detect autoantibodies in much higher sensitivity in comparison to the closed form. Consequently, much more sensitive and precise methods for detecting autoantibodies against the open form of the TG were developed and are subject of the present invention in order to much more precisely detect and diagnose diseases associated with the presence of autoantibodies for the open form transglutaminase.","Thus the present invention relates to a method for the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder or an intestinal disorder or a skin disorder or a neurological disorder or other diseases, wherein the open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase are used for the detection of the presence of autoantibodies specific for the open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase.","The open form of the transglutaminase or a fragment of the open form of a transglutaminase which has comparable activity to the open form transglutaminase, thus an antigenically active fragment of this open form transglutaminase is generated by reacting the transglutaminase or the antigenically active fragment of the transglutaminase with an inhibitor comprising a backbone, a peptide backbone or a peptidomimetic backbone and a thiol reactive group able to form a covalent bond to the thiol group of the cysteine in the active site of the TG. The inhibitor might also react with other cysteines which are not located in the active side of the TG but the inhibitor must be able to react with the cysteine in the active site of the respective TG. In order to make the inhibitor more regioselective, the thiol reactive group of the inhibitor is preferably attached to a backbone, a peptide backbone or peptidomimetic backbone or any synthetic backbone which has affinity to the active site in order to increase regioselectivity of the inhibitor molecule. In order to generate the open form of a TG it is important that the inhibitor attaches covalently to the thiol group of the cysteine within the active site of the TG. Consequently, inhibitors are preferred which have a backbone attached to a thiol reactive group which has certain similarity to the natural substrates of the TG. Such backbones are preferably peptide-like backbones, i.d. backbones which comprise amide bonds and at least one carbon chain attached to the carbonyl group of the amide bond or at least one optionally substituted carbon atom between two amide bonds.","The autoimmune disorder can be selected from the group comprising or consisting of Addisons's disease, alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphosholipid antibody syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune inner ear disease, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, balo disease, Behcet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, cardiomyopathy, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Cicatricial pemphigoid, cold agglutinin disease, CREST syndrome, Crohn's disease, Degos disease, dermatomyositis, dermatomyositis-juvenile, discoid lupus, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves disease, Guillain-Bar\u00e9, Hashimoto thyroiditis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, IgA nephropathy, insulin-dependent diabetes, juvneile arthritis, lichen planus, lupus, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, PANDAS, pemphigus vulgaris, pernicious anemia, polyarteritis nodosa, polychondritis, polyglandular syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, Raynaud phenomenon, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sclerosing cholangitis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, giant cell arteritis, ulcerative colitis, uveitis vasuclitis, vitiligo, Wegener's granulomatosis, neurological disorder, paraneoplastic neurological syndrome, cereal protein sensitivity disorder, gluten sensitive disorders, celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, Morbus Duhring, diabetes mellitus type 1, anxiety, depression, brainstem encephalitis, cerebral vasculitis, chorea, dementia, epilepsy, cerebral calcifications, headache with white matter abnormalities, neuromyotonia, myasthenia gravis, myopathy, neuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, progressive myoclonic encephalopathy, schizophreniform disorder, stiff-person syndrome, ataxia, ataxia with myoclonus, encephalitis, polymyositis, epilepsy with occipital cerebral calcifications, loss of sensation or muscle weakness, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus, cancer associated retinopathy, paraneoplastic stiff-man syndrome, paraneoplastic necrotizing myelopathy, a motor neuron syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, subacute motor neuronopathy, subacute sensory neuronopathy, brachial neuritis and neuromyotonia.","Preferably the autoimmune disorder can be selected from the group comprising or consisting of celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, Addisons disease; autoimmune hepatitis; chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; Hashimoto's thyroiditis; rheumatoid arthritis; multiple sclerosis; Polymyositis; ulcerative colitis; diabetes mellitus type 1; epilepsy; stiff-person syndrome and neuropathy, especially gluten sensitive neuropathy, gluten sensitive ataxia; idiopathic sporadic ataxia and gluten ataxia with enteropathy.","The present invention is most useful for the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder or autoimmune disease and especially of gluten sensitive disorders, celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten sensitive ataxia.","In other words the present invention relates to a method for the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder, wherein at least one open form transglutaminase or at least one antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase is used for the detection of the presence of autoantibodies specific for the open form transglutaminase or specific for the antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase. Further the at least one open form or inhibited transglutaminase or at least one antigenically active fragment of the open form or inhibited transglutaminase is used for the diagnosis of diseases or for the monitoring and assessment of the effectiveness of therapy, especially of autoimmune diseases. Further preferred is the use of open form TG, or an antigenically active fragment thereof, for detection of autoantibodies reacting with the open form TG in differential diagnosis of an autoimmune disease, preferably a cereal protein sensitivity disorder and in risk assessment for complications in individuals susceptible to cereal protein sensitivity disorder.","The transglutaminases or open form transglutaminases used within the inventive method are selected from the group comprising or consisting of TG1, TG2, TG3, TG4, TG5, TG6, TG7 or coagulation factor XIII.","Most proteins fold into unique 3-dimensional structures. The shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation. But proteins are not entirely rigid molecules. Proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their functions. In the context of these functional rearrangements, these tertiary or quaternary structures are usually referred to as \u201cconformations\u201d, and transitions between them are called conformational changes. Such changes may be induced by the binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme's active site, or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis.","The term \u201copen form transglutaminase\u201d as used herein refers to a transglutaminase which underwent a conformational change after binding a substrate or an inhibitor so that the term \u201copen form transglutaminase\u201d refers to a transglutaminase with a substrate or an inhibitor bound to the transglutaminase and where the conformation of the transglutaminase changes when binding the substrate or inhibitor. Preferably the term \u201copen form transglutaminase\u201d refers to an extended or elongated protein conformation of a transglutaminase present during the time of binding a substrate or substrate analogue or inhibitor to the TG in contrary to the more globular conformation without a substrate or inhibitor bound. This closed form may bind a GDP. It is preferred to obtain and stabilize the open form of a transglutaminase using an inhibitor as a substrate analogue. Therefore the open form TG may also be referred to as substrate or inhibitor bound transglutaminase which undergoes a conformational change when binding the inhibitor. The change in conformation will last as long as the substrate or inhibitor is bound and will reversibly change back to the original closed conformation when the substrate or the reversible inhibitor is released. Thus, the \u201copen form transglutaminases\u201d of the present invention are these transglutaminases which underwent a change in conformation upon binding a substrate and preferably an irreversible inhibitor in order to stabilize this conformationally changed form.","The antigenically active fragments of the transglutaminases or of the open form transglutaminases are selected from the group comprising or consisting of antigenically active fragments of TG1, TG2, TG3, TG4, TG5, TG6, TG7 or coagulation factor XIII.","The term \u201cantigenically active fragment\u201d as used herein refers to a protein fragment that is able to elicit an antibody response and is able to be bound by an antibody. In regard to a TG or analogously to the open form of a TG, an \u201cantigenically active fragment\u201d can be further defined as an arrangement of amino acid residues forming part of the surface of the TG or open form TG, in particular the surfaces exposed upon enzyme activation, either in the form of a continuous peptide sequence or amino acids held together by an artificial backbone that mimics their arrangement in the native protein. An \u201cantigenically active fragment\u201d can also be a portion of a TG with proteins or derived peptides bound to its active site, which constitute common T cell epitopes. Examples for such proteins are proteins of the extracellular matrix like collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, osteonectin or villamentin or plasma proteins like \u03b12-antiplasmin, fibrin and fibrinogen or food-proteins like gliadin. An example for a gliadin derived peptide is the alpha-gliadin derived 33-mer LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF [accession number AJ133612 (amino acids 57-89)]. Preferably the antigenically active fragment of an open from transglutaminase is a synthetic peptide.","Antigenically active fragments can be produced by several techniques. A convenient method is the production of truncated variants of the respective transglutaminase, by deleting N-terminal, C-terminal or internal amino acids or peptides at one or more positions with respect to the primary sequence. The resulting truncated transglutaminase can then be inhibited in order to convert it into its open conformation. In case that the truncated transglutaminase shows no enzymatic activity any more, a strong SH-reactive inhibitor may be used in order to convert the protein in its open conformation. A further method for the generation of antigenically active fragments is the usage of a synthetic peptide which covers the sequence around the active site cystein where an inhibitor is added by chemical methods to the active site cystein. Finally the open conformation transglutaminase may be treated with proteases in order to create antigenically active fragments, which can be separated by chromatographical methods known to people skilled in the art.","The methods of the present invention can also be performed using more than one open form or inhibited transglutaminase and\/or more than one antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase at the same time within the method. Thus, mixtures of transglutaminases (TGs) can be used within the inventive methods. Furthermore the detection of, for example, transglutaminase 2 autoantibodies or transglutaminase 3 autoantibodies or transglutaminase 6 autoantibodies can be combined with the detection of autoantibodies to one or more further transglutaminase isoforms such as TG1, TG3, TG4, TG5, TG6, TG7 or coagulation factor XIII.","In the following the invention is described in detail in regard to transglutaminase 2 (TG2) while the invention can be performed with all other TGs in a similar manner. However TG2, TG3 and TG6 are the preferred transglutaminases. Thus, the present invention is not limited to the use of TG2. TG2 is only used as representative example of all TGs for disclosing the present invention in detail.","The transglutaminase 2 changes its tertiary structure upon substrate binding. Whereas inactive non-substrate bound TG2 shows a closed more ball-shaped form, the two \u03b2-domains turn upon substrate binding resulting in a more longitudinal form as shown in . This shift in tertiary structure is a common feature of all vertebrate transglutaminases. Thus novel epitopes, which have been covered or masked in the closed form, are now accessible.","For instance, the tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is the autoantigen in celiac disease. The disease is characterized by an elevated titer of autoantibodies against TG2 (IgA and IgG). Although suffering from celiac disease, some patients show very low or no antibody titers at all. In a group of patients the lacking IgA-titer can be explained by a general IgA-deficiency. But there remain celiac disease patients with a biopsy proven celiac disease (intestinal villous atrophy) and without IgA-deficiency, but a TG2-autoantibody negative or doubtful serology.","Thus, the diseases described herein can be detected more precisely and accurate by the use of the open form TG for the detection of autoantibodies against or specifically against said open TG form.","The open form of the transglutaminase is present at the time of binding a substrate to the TG. The TG is in a closed form when no substrate is bound. In order to obtain the TG in its open form a substrate or an inhibitor is added to the TG. Since it is advantageous to obtain a TG stabilized in its open form, inhibitors and preferably irreversible inhibitors are used which react with the TG. Accordingly, in order to obtain the antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase, the antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase is reacted with an inhibitor and preferably an irreversible inhibitor in order to stabilize the open form of the antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase.","As used herein, the term \u201cirreversible inhibitor\u201d refers to an inhibitor which covalently binds to the TG or which binds sufficiently tightly so that no equilibrium will exist. Irreversible inhibitors are most often inhibitors with at least one functional group which is able to form a covalent bond to the target such as a TG so that one inhibitor is required to inactivate one TG enzyme and consequently stabilize the open form of the TG.","Therefore the term \u201copen form transglutaminase\u201d or \u201cinhibited transglutaminase\u201d as used herein may also refer to transglutaminases with novel epitopes, which are only accessible for antibodies after binding of an inhibitor. The inventive method uses transglutaminases which allows detecting novel auto-antibodies which are not detected without the binding of an inhibitor. Therefore the inventive form of transglutaminases has newly accessible epitopes which allows for the detection of new auto-antibodies.","The terms \u201copen form transglutaminase\u201d and \u201copen transglutaminase\u201d and \u201cinhibited transglutaminase\u201d and \u201cconformationally changed transglutaminase\u201d is used herein as synonyms. These terms refer to a transglutaminase such as TG2, TG3, TG6 which change their conformation upon binding an inhibitor or a substrate so that two conformationally distinct transglutaminases exist which are recognized by two sorts of antibodies. The antibodies for the open form (or inhibited or conformationally changed form) do most probably not recognize the closed form. Both sorts of antibodies can be detected in order to diagnose autoimmune disorders characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the two different forms (open\/closed or respectively not inhibited\/inhibited or conformationally unchanged\/conformationally changed) of the respective transglutaminase.","The term \u201cconformationally changed\u201d refers to the changed conformation of the respective transglutaminase when a substrate or an inhibitor and especially one of the inhibitors disclosed herein is bound to the active site of the transglutaminase.","The closed form or not inhibited form or conformationally not changed form of the transglutaminase can be distinguished from the open form or inhibited form or conformationally changed form by the presence of another sort of autoantibodies directed to said open, inhibited or conformationally changed form. Therefore, presence of another sort of autoantibodies directed to one transglutaminase such as TG2 or TG3 or TG6 indicates that the open, inhibited or conformationally changed form of said transglutaminase exists.","Inhibitors based on proteins, e.g. proteins of the extracellular matrix, plasma-proteins or food-proteins, and dipeptidic or larger portions thereof as well as inhibitors comprising a peptide-like backbone, peptidomimetic backbone or any other backbone which has affinity to the active site of the TG or which has similarity with the backbone of the natural substrate in regard to length, number of atoms, tertiary structure, molecular weight, functional groups and\/or polarity can be used for the production of the open form of transglutaminase 1, transglutaminase 2, transglutaminase 3, transglutaminase 4, transglutaminase 5, transglutaminase 6, transglutaminase 7 or the coagulation factor XIII.","Suitable inhibitors which are able to form covalent bonds to the TGs are inhibitors with thiol-reactive groups. Thiol-reactive groups are preferably such groups which are electrophil and which are able to undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction with the thiol group (\u2014SH group) of cysteine such as acetylenes, electrophilic olefins, unsaturated aldimines, Michael acceptors, iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, parachloromercuribenzoic acid, alkyl isocyanates, 3,5-substituted-4,5-dihydroisoxazoles, oxiranes as described in U.S. Pat.

It is especially referred to pages 3 to 38 of WO 2008055488 A1.","Furthermore, the present invention describes the production of TG2 in a stabilized open form preferably by the use of the irreversible inhibitors disclosed above. TG2 was produced by recombinant DNA-technology in and purified to homogeneity. Subsequently it was brought to reaction for instance with Z-PIMen(OEt)-QPL-OMe which is the compound N-benzyloxycarbonyl-{[(E)-(L)-6-amino-hept-2-ene-dicarboxylic acid]-1-ethanoyl}-L-glutaminyl-L-prolinyl-L-leucine methyl ester (compound 2) synthesized in our labs according to the procedure described in WO 2008055488 A1 on page 68; compound 2). By a further purification step excess Z-PIMen(OEt)-QPL-OMe was separated. The resulting TG2-Z-PIMen(OEt)-QPL-OMe-adduct was crystallized.

Such an adduct of a TG and a gluten-derived peptide is again preferably prepared by reacting the TG with a reactive group such as a Michael acceptor moiety of the gluten-derived peptide. Such an adduct of a TG such as TG2 with a gluten-derived peptide is useful for the simultaneous detection of anti-gliadin antibodies and anti open form transglutaminase autoantibodies.","Consequently the present invention also relates to the use of a gluten-derived peptide with a thiol reactive residue or a Michael acceptor residue as an inhibitor for the production of the open form of a TG such as TG2, wherein the open form TG is useful for the simultaneous detection of anti-gliadin antibodies and anti open form TG2 autoantibodies.","A further aspect of the present invention is directed to immobilized open form TGs which are immobilized on, for instance, titer plates, microtiter plates or well plates. In addition the present invention relates to titer plates, microtiter plates or well plates with immobilized open form TGs and\/or immobilized antigenically active fragments of open form TGs on their surface and especially within the wells where the detection reaction is performed.","We found that the stabilized open form or inhibited TG2 can be used for coating of microtiter plates. Sera from blood donors and from celiac disease patients have been subsequently analysed for autoantibodies against the open form TG2 in comparison to commonly used closed form TG2. Surprisingly the sera revealed higher titers for open form TG2 which resulted in a more significant value. In addition some sera could be proofed positive for autoantibodies to open form TG2 which have been diagnosed negative using the closed form TG2 as antigen.","A further aspect of the present invention is directed to a kit for the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies reacting with at least one open form transglutaminase. Such a kit for diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder comprises at least one open form transglutaminase or at least one antigenically active fragment of an open form transglutaminase for the detection of the presence of autoantibodies specific for the open form transglutaminase or the antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase.","These kits can present the open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments thereof in a form suitable for use in, for example, the following methods: EIA\/ELISA, LiA, FiA, RIA, IRMA, IEMA\/EIA, ILMA, IFMA, immunodiffusion, Western-blot, Dot-blot, immunohistochemistry, protein chips or protein arrays.","Such kits may also comprise titer plates, microtiter plates or well plates with open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase immobilized on the surface of the plate.","One smart way to manufacture titer plates, microtiter plates or well plates with open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase immobilized on the surface of the plate is to use the interaction of biotin and biotin binding compounds, like avidin or strepavidin. Therefore biotinlyation of the open form transglutaminase or the antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase is achieved by enzymatic or chemical methods and the biotinylated products are bound to surfaces coated with biotin binding compounds. Another possibility is to bind a biotinylated inhibitor to the TG or antigenically active TG fragment in order to obtain open form TG containing the covalently bound biotinylated inhibitor. Said adduct can be immobilized on the surface of titer plates, microtiter plates or well plates by interacting with biotin binding compounds. Consequently another aspect of the present invention is related to the use of a biotinylated inhibitor for the production of open form transglutaminase for site specific immobilization to surfaces coated with biotin binding compounds.","The above-described kits may further comprise a biotinylated open form transglutaminase or a biotinylated antigenically active open form TG fragment for immobilizing the biotinylated open form transglutaminase or biotinylated antigenically active open form TG fragment to a surface coated with biotin binding compounds. Alternatively the above-described kits may further comprise an open form transglutaminase or an antigenically active fragment thereof reacted with a biotinylated inhibitor for immobilizing the open form transglutaminase biotinylated inhibitor product or the antigenically active fragment biotinylated inhibitor product to a surface coated with biotin binding compounds.","Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the production of open form transglutaminase using an inhibitor linked to one or more antigens specific for autoantibodies not against TG found in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. An example would be linking the autoantigen in Goodpasture's disease, (noncollagenous-1 (NC1) domain of type IV collagen via the inhibitor to the TG2. Such a construct would allow testing one patient sample for the presence of two or more autoantigenes against different proteins simultaneously.","The most important aspect of the present invention is that the present invention provides novel antigens for autoimmune diagnostics which yield higher and more significant titers resulting in a better diagnostic sensitivity. Furthermore, the present invention shows that the conformation has an impact on triggering the autoimmune disease and accordingly to detect early stage disease states.","Moreover the invention implicates that not tissue transglutaminase but the covalent adduct between transglutaminase and (irreversibly) bound substrate or inhibitor displays the disease state and correlates to inflammation and villous atrophy.","The open form or inhibited transglutaminase is used for the isolation of specific antibodies from patient-derived samples, including blood purification (apheresis).","Thus, the present invention also relates to a method for purifying blood, wherein the open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase are used for binding and removing autoantibodies specific for the open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase from the blood. Such a method uses the common dialysis process. The adsorber material used in the extracorporeal adsorber column contains immobilized open form transglutaminase or antigenically active fragments of the open form transglutaminase in order to bind the autoantibodies against the TG or the antigenically active fragment of the TG or the open form transglutaminase or against the antigenically active fragment of the open form transglutaminase thus removing these autoantibodies from the blood.","Consequently open-form specific antibodies are used for therapeutic approaches, where active and therefore open form transglutaminase shall be neutralized, whereas inactive and therefore closed form transglutaminase shall not be affected.","The open form transglutaminase or inhibited transglutaminase stabilized in its open form is used for the detection of open form specific autoantibodies in samples from body fluids, excretions or tissues. The open form transglutaminase or the antigenically active open form TG fragment is used for a more sensitive and more accurate detection of autoimmune diseases and autoimmune disorders.","Preferably the autoimmune disorder is a food protein sensitivity disorder.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to the use of open form TG2 for the detection of specific autoantibodies in celiac disease patients who have no or low antibody titers against closed form TG2.","In another embodiment of the present invention the open form TG2 is used for the detection of autoantibodies in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus type 1 and in a still further embodiment of the present invention the open form TG2 is used for the detection of specific autoantibodies in recent onset celiac disease patients which did not develop antibodies against closed form TG2 yet.","Preferably the open form TG3 is used for the detection auf autoantibodies in the sera of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against open form TG3. Moreover the open form TG3 is preferably used for the detection of autoantibodies in samples from patients suffering from dermatitis herpetiformis.","Preferably the open form TG6 is used for the detection auf autoantibodies in the sera of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against open form TG6.

Examples of such methods and devices include: EIA\/ELISA, LiA, FiA, RIA, IRMA, IEMA\/EIA, ILMA, IFMA, immunodiffusion, Western-blot, Dot-blot, immunohistochemistry, protein chips or protein arrays. Thus another aspect of the present invention is directed to protein chips and protein arrays containing at least one open form transglutaminase or at least one antigenically active open form TG fragment preferably in an immobilized form. Such chips and arrays may preferably contain more than one open form transglutaminase isoform selected from transglutaminase 1, transglutaminase 2, transglutaminase 3, transglutaminase 4, transglutaminase 5, transglutaminase 6, transglutaminase 7, or coagulation factor XIII, preferably in an immobilized form.","Another aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations and pharmaceutical compositions containing the open form of a TG together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, solvent and\/or diluents.","The preferred preparations and formulations are in administrable form which is suitable for oral application or injection. These administrable forms include pills, tablets, film tablets, coated tablets, capsules, solutions, dispersions and deposits.","For example, for oral administration in the form of tablets or capsules, the open form TG may be combined with any oral nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier, such as lactose, starch, sucrose, cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, talc, mannitol, ethyl alcohol (liquid forms) and the like.

Rhombic-shaped crystals appeared in 5 to 7 days (Space group: P422; Unit cell constants: a, b=71.0 \u212b, c=310.4 \u212b). The data set was collected with synchrotron radiation and yielded a resolution of 2.5 \u212b. Processing of the data allowed to determine the position of the inhibitor in the TG2 and confirmed the open conformation.","Open form or inhibited TG2 has been produced as described in example 1.

Then coating solution was removed and plates were washed intensively with TBS (20 mMTris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl) containing 0.01% Tween 20. Blocking was performed by the addition of 200 \u03bcl TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h.

For the detection of IgA-type autoantibodies against closed form TG2 ELISA-Kit E001 from Zedira GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany was used, whereas for IgG-type autoantibodies kit E002 from Zedira GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany was used.","For detection of IgA and IgG-type antibodies against open conformation TG2 the microtiter-plates as described in example 3 have been used. All other components necessary for performing the ELISAs have been taken from Zedira kits E001 and E002 respectively. Accordingly the protocols of E001 and E002 have been used: 10 \u03bcl of each serum have been diluted with 990 \u03bcl sample buffer, mixed thoroughly and centrifuged to sediment insoluble particles. Immediately prior to use, the solid phase was washed once with 350 \u03bcL wash buffer per well. After 10 seconds the wash butter was completely removed. 100 \u03bcL of the calibrators, the negative and positive control and the diluted samples have rapidly been dispensed into the micro plate wells. After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature the wells have been washed 4 times with 350 \u03bcl wash buffer. Using an 8-channel pipette 100 \u03bcl of conjugate have been dispensed per well subsequently and incubated for 30 min. After a further washing procedure 100 \u03bcl substrate solution have been dispensed into the wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Then 100 \u03bcl stop solution have been added. Finally the plates were agitated on an orbital shaker for about 10 seconds and the absorbance at 450 nm has been determined.","Results are given in Tab. 1-4. Surprisingly the standards (mixture of celiac disease patients sera) yielded significantly higher extinction values at 450 nm when the open form TG2 was used as antigen in the IgG-ELISAs (Tab. 1 and 2). This demonstrates a higher titer of antibodies to open form TG2 in the standards than to closed form TG2. Blood donor's serum 26, which is tested positive in the closed form ELISA is clearly negative in the open form ELISA. Therefore the open form TG2-ELISA provides less false positive results in autoimmune diagnostics (Tab. 2).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"anti-IgG-ELISAs using standard TG2 (closed form) and"},{"entry":"the novel open form TG2 on blood donors sera.

of autoantibodies of the IgG-type in patient's sera (Tab. 2) revealed lower mUnit-values in the majority of all sera which were tested negative, enlarging the distance to the cutoff. Sera 50, 51 and 67 have been positive in the closed and open form TG2, but the titers for the open form again have been proved higher for two sera. Whereas Serum 68 was positive in the closed form and negative in the open form ELISA, sera 69 and 79 could be proved positive with the open form ELISA.","In Summary use of open form TG2 as antigen in celiac disease IgG-diagnostics results in a higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity than closed form TG2.","The results of the IgA-type autoantibody-detection are presented in Tab. 3 (blood donor's sera). Whereas the closed form TG2-ELISA could detect 1 positive serum (26), open form TG2 detected 5 positive sera (4, 17, 25, 26, 27).","From 3 negative patients sera using closed form TG2, 1 could be detected positive using the open form TG2, thus increasing the diagnostic sensitivity (Tab. 4).","With two exceptions higher Unit-values have been measured in patient's sera using the open form TG2. Several patients' sera like 49, 71, 76 or 80 showed more than 100% higher titers in the open form assay. This shows that patients have autoantibodies specific to the open conformation of TG2. Especially when the titers are close to the cut off the open form TG2 yields more reliable diagnostic results (e.g. sera 61 and 70).","The analysis-results of further patients sera are described in the following:","The patient number A is a child, diagnosed for celiac disease by histology upon biopsy. While negative or doubtful results are obtained using standard diagnostics (2.0 U\/ml for IgG and 1.2 U\/ml for IgA, cut off=3 U\/ml), the novel antigen is able to detect early antibodies. (13 U\/ml for IgG and 45 U\/ml for IgA)","Patient number B and C presented to the doctor with severe symptoms of celiac disease confirmed by biopsy. However, only comparable low or doubtful titers against TG2 (2.9 or 3.5 U\/ml, cutoff=3 U\/ml) have been found. Indeed, the new antigen shows tremendously higher titers correlating with severity of the inflammation and villous atrophy (Patient B, Marsh II by biopsy: 19 U\/ml, Patient C, Marsh III by biopsy: 39 U\/ml).","Patient D was diagnosed with diabetes type one. While the standard ELISA displays no antibodies against TG2 the novel antigen could detect IgG (11 U\/ml) as well as IgA (46 U\/ml) antibodies.","Patient E was diagnosed for psoriasis. Whereas no TG2-autoantibodies could be detected with the standard ELISA, clearly positive values (IgA: 37 U\/ml, IgG: 21 U\/ml) have been obtained using the open form TG2 as antigen in the ELISA.","In conclusion we have shown the presence of autoantibodies of the IgA and the IgG-type which specifically recognize the open conformation TG2. Usage of open form TG2 increases diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the corresponding autoimmune diagnostics, e.g. celiac disease diagnostics.","Therefore with the newly developed open form TG2 we provide a novel diagnostic antigen which helps to improve TG2-based diagnostics. It may be used in all methods used for the detection of antibodies in samples of body fluids or tissue samples. Examples for such methods include: EIA\/ELISA, LiA, FiA, RIA, IRMA, IEMA\/EIA, ILMA, IFMA, immunodiffusion, Western-blot or Dot-blot. Any of these methods could be adapted for diagnostic purposes using the antigen described herein in detail by a person skilled in the art.","As transglutaminases are structurally related, the phenomenon surprisingly found for TG2 and described in detail in this application, will also be applicable to other transglutaminases like TG3 in the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis or TG6 in the diagnosis of gluten sensitive neurological disorders.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0123"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"anti-IgA-ELISAs using standard TG2 (closed form) and"},{"entry":"the novel open form TG2 on healthy donors sera.

F suffered from celiac disease and has been on gluten free diet for 8 years. According to biopsy and serology Patient F was on remission and showed no celiac disease symptoms any more. Patient F has been injected subcutaneously a solution containing open TG2, which has been produced according to example 1. Injections have been repeated weekly over a period of six months; the doses have been increased over this period in order to reach the maintenance dose. The application has then been repeated applying the maintenance dose once a month for 1.5 years. Patient F was kept on a strict gluten free diet for this whole hyposensitisation therapy period. Later-on the patient started to consume minor amounts (1 g per day) of gluten in addition to the gluten free diet. No celiac disease symptoms could be measured clinically or by biopsy or serology.","Example 5 demonstrates that the open form of a TG can be used for a hyposensitisation therapy for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases caused by a gluten intolerance.","Further Sera have been analyzed according to the protocol outlined in Example 4. Patients groups 1-5 are defined by a positive celiac disease diagnosis, but a low or negative titer for TG2 autoantibodies as measured by classical assays using closed TG2 as antigen.","Group 1 is defined by overt small bowel mucosal villous atrophy. 30 sera of this kind have been analyzed. In general the autoantibody titer measured with the open form TG2 was higher than that measured for the closed form TG2. 14 sera were slightly positive in the closed form TG2 IgA-ELISA, whereas in the open form TG2 IgA-ELISA 28 sera could be detected positive, as shown in . Thus 93% of patients could be detected serologically using the open form TG2 as antigen, whereas only 47% could be detected with the closed form TG2. Therefore the open form TG2 is able to detect the majority of celiac disease patients which is not the case for the closed form TG2. In the IgG ELISA no positive sera could be detected using the closed form TG2 as antigen, whereas 5 sera have been detected as positive using the open form TG2. This shows, that open form TG2 is also able to detect more IgG-type autoantibodies than closed form TG2 and thus is able to detect more celiac disease patients by ELISA-based serology.","Group 2 is defined by early stage celiac disease characterized by mild enteropathy. 14 sera have been analyzed. Again the titers are generally higher for the open form TG2. 6 sera (42%) have been positive for IgA-type autoantibodies against closed TG2 whereas 13 (93%) revealed to be positive using the open form TG2 as antigen (). Thus also in the group of early stage celiac disease the open form TG2 is able to detect the majority of celiac disease patients by serology which again is not the case for closed form TG2.","Group 3 is defined by unresponsive treated celiac disease. 16 patients have been analyzed. Again the titers are generally higher for the open form TG2. 3 (19%) sera have been positive for the closed form TG2-ELISA (IgA), whereas 9 (56%) have been positive using the open form TG2 as antigen (). Therefore the open form TG2 is able to detect about three times more celiac disease patients by serology in this group.","Group 4 is defined by overt small bowel mucosal villous atrophy and for one year on gluten free diet. Using the closed form TG2-ELISA all 21 patients did not show TG2-autoantibodies anymore. Testing the sera with the open form TG2-ELISA proved that in 5 patients (24%) TG2-autoantibodies are still present (). Therefore open TG2 is able to detect even minor amounts of TG2-autoantibodies and helps to detect celiac disease patients where gluten free diet is not completely successful.","Group 5 is defined by early stage CD-patients after one year on gluten free diet. The closed form showed successful diet for all of the 11 patients (no TG2-autoantibodies anymore), whereas the open form showed for 4 patients that TG2-autoantibodies are still present (), indicating that the diet has not been completely successful.","Group 6 is defined by patients where celiac disease has been suspected, but so far could not be diagnosed by the celiac disease diagnostic methods available. 4 out of the 25 sera tested where positive using the open form TG2 (). Thus these 4 patients could be detected as celiac disease patients.","Group 7 is a cohort of 150 non-selected celiac disease patients on gluten free diet. 52 sera (35%) revealed to be positive in the closed-form TG2-IgA-ELISA, whereas 71 (48%) have been positive in the open form IgA-ELISA.  shows the data of the most interesting cases close to the cut off, where most closed from TG2-ELISA results are negative. Therefore open TG2-based diagnostics revealed, that not one third, but half of the patients still have TG2-autoantibodies indicating that they did not follow a successful diet.","Open from TG2 has been prepared according to example 1 but using the following inhibitors:\n\n","A is a Michael-acceptor based inhibitor with a peptidic backbone. B also has a peptidic backbone, but diazo-5-oxonorleucin (or \u201cDON\u201d) as reactive group. C is a Michael-acceptor with a peptidomimetic backbone.

For this purpose a reaction solution of open form TG2 and CME-CDI; 1:1 (w\/w) at 4\u00b0 C.; in 0.1 M MES buffer (2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid) prepared at pH 4.75 and stirred for half an hour. The reaction solution is passed for 4 hours at room temperature on the surface of the aminated hollow fibers. The fibers are then washed with PBS buffer and water to neutrality.","A patient was treated with an apheresis system containing the above described absorber.","This patient had been removed blood twice before treatment, with positive values for antibodies against open form TG2 but not for TG2. After the apheresis the signal for open TG2 was reduced below the threshold.","2 \u03bcg of TG2, open TG2, TG3, dispase activated TG3, inhibited dispase activated TG3, TG6 and inhibited TG6 have been mixed with 3\u00d7 loading buffer (56 mM Tris-HCl ph6.8, 22.5% glycerol, 11% bromophenylblue) and loaded on a 4-20% gradient gel (BioRad). 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 122 mM glycin has been used as electrophoresis buffer. Native PAGE has been run for 75 min and 125 V at 4\u00b0 C. Coomassie-staining of the gel revealed, that TG2 migrates faster than open TG2, indicating a conformational change which leads to slower migration in the native PAGE and which has already been proven by crystal structure analysis. TG6 and inhibited TG6 showed comparable migration properties than TG2 and open TG2, indicating conformational changes of open TG6 comparable to open TG2.","Dispase activation cleaves TG3 in two polypeptides which do not dissociate. TG3 and dispase activated TG3 migrated both as a single band. Dispase activated TG3 migrates slower than non-activated TG3. Inhibited TG3 migrated in two bands. These results show that inhibition of TG3 enables dissociation of the two subunits, so that hidden or new epitopes become accessible.","Open TG6 prepared according to example 9 has been used to coat microtiterplates according to example 3. In addition half of the plates has been coated in with coating buffer lacking open TG6 (background control wells: BG-wells). The ELISA-protocol has been modified by measuring each sample twice in open TG6-coated wells and BG-wells. The median value of the BG-wells has been subtracted from the median value of the open TG6 coated wells before calculating the Units. Serum specific background due to non-specific binding to the wells could be eliminated.","The results are given in Tab. 10 and again prove that usage of the open conformation yields more positive titers than the closed conformation. In addition it reduces the number of false positive samples in the IgG-assay (sera GenA8 and GenA16).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0170"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 10"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Analysis of healthy donor's (N) and patient's sera for"},{"entry":"autoantibodies against TG6 and Open TG6 in an assay"},{"entry":"which eliminates non-specific background.
