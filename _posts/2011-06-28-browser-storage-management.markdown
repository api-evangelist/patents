For example, users may access websites to receive webpages, interact with social networks, photo sharing sites, send and receive messages, and so on. Consequently, even a casual user may interact with a significant amount of data.","Techniques were subsequently developed to aid users in this interaction by storing content locally on a computing device. In this way, users could quickly access the data and may even do so when \u201coffline.\u201d However, conventional techniques there were employed to manage this storage were often intrusive and therefore could hinder a user's interaction with the data or were not employed at all thereby exposing the computing device to malicious parties.","Browser storage management techniques are described. In one or more implementations, inputs are received at a computing device that specify maximum aggregate sizes of application and database caches, respectively, of browser storage to be used to locally store data at the computing device. For example, the inputs may be provided using a policy, by an administrator of the computing device, and so on. The maximum aggregate sizes are set of the application and database caches, respectively, of browser storage at the computing device to the sizes specified by the inputs.","In one or more implementations, a computing device detects that the maximum individual storage size of browser storage specified for a domain has been reached. In response to the detection, a prompt is output in the user interface by the computing device that includes an option to expand the maximum individual storage size of browser storage for the domain.","In one or more implementations, a determination is made of a maximum aggregate size that has been set for an application cache and a maximum aggregate size that has been set for a database cache of browser storage usable to locally store data at the computing device. The maximum aggregate sizes of the application and data caches being user configurable, respectively. The computing device detects that the maximum aggregate size of the application cache or the maximum aggregate size of the database cache has been exceeded. Responsive to the detection, a prompt is output in a user interface by the computing device that indicates that an amount of data to be stored in the application or database cache has reached the maximum aggregate size, respectively.","In one or more implementations, it is detected that an amount of data that has been stored in at least one of an application or database cache that is local to a computing device has reached a threshold. A garbage collection technique is initiated automatically and without user intervention by the computing device to determine if at least a portion of the data that has been stored in the at least one of the application or database caches is permitted to be removed according to one or more criteria and if so, at least the portion of the data is removed.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Browser storage is typically employed to store data associated with network access locally at the computing device, such as through database and application caches. However, traditional browser storage techniques do not provide a mechanism for end-users and IT professionals to control the amount of data that can be stored on the computing device. In addition, some conventional techniques involve a liberal use of user prompts that necessitate user intervention before data can be stored on the computing machine, which could lead to user frustration and confusion as a casual user may not understand the intricacies involved in this management. Furthermore, some conventional techniques were inflexible and therefore made it difficult for corporations that use complex internet or intranet applications from being able to configure their web application storage limits to avoid these prompts, securely, and in some cases work properly.","Techniques are described herein for browser storage management. In one or more implementations, these techniques allow users and administrators to define limits that may be employed to govern when a user is prompted to allow a website to store additional data in storage on a computing device. In addition, configurable defaults may be provided to govern an aggregate size of each of the local caches both individually and together. Further, individual configurable settings may be provided for local database and application caches, which may be configured using group policies, via administrator privileges, and so on. Thus, a balance may be achieved to allow a user to interact with a computing device without needlessly prompting the user. Further discussion of these and other techniques may be found in relation to the following figures.","In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that may employ the techniques described herein. Example procedures are then described which may be performed in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the example procedures is not the network limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example procedures.","Example Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 9 and 10"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","104","102","102"]},"The computing device  of  is also illustrated as including a browser , e.g., a web browser, which may be implemented using one or more modules as further described below. The browser  is representative of functionality that is configured to navigate via the network . Although the network  is illustrated as the Internet, the network may assume a wide variety of configurations. For example, the network  may include a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless network, a public telephone network, an intranet, and so on. Further, although a single network  is shown, the network  may be configured to include multiple networks.","The browser , for instance, may be configured to navigate via the network  to interact with content available from one or more web servers  as well as communicate data to the one or more web servers , e.g., perform downloads and uploads. The web servers  may be configured to provide one or more services that are accessible via the network . Examples of such services include email, web pages, photo sharing sites, social networks, content sharing services, media streaming services, and so on.","One or more of the applications  may also be configured to access the network , e.g., directly themselves and\/or through the browser . For example, one or more of the applications  may be configured to communicate messages, such as email, instant messages, and so on. In additional examples, an application , for instance, may be configured to access a social network, obtain weather updates, interact with a bookstore service implemented by one or more of the web servers , support word processing, provide spreadsheet functionality, support creation and output of presentations, and so on.","Thus, applications  may also be configured for a variety of functionality that may involve direct or indirect network  access. For instance, the applications  may include configuration settings and other data that may be leveraged locally by the application  as well as synchronized with applications that are executed on another computing device. In this way, these settings may be shared by the devices. A variety of other instances are also contemplated. Thus, the computing device  may interact with content in a variety of ways from a variety of different sources.","The browser  in the illustrated example is also shown as including a cache manager module . The cache manager module  is representative of functionality of the computing device  to manage browser storage  that is local to the computing device . The browser storage  may thus be used to maintain data locally at the computing device  that may involve network access. Although illustrated separately, the browser storage  may be implemented at least in part using computer readable storage media .","As illustrated in , the browser storage  includes an application cache  and a database cache . The application cache  is representative of one or more caches that may be used to store data obtained from websites, such as images, hypertext markup language (HTML) data, and so on that are involved in the generation and display of webpages. In one or more implementations, the application cache  may be accessed even when a source of corresponding data is unavailable, e.g., a web server  that provided the data is offline, lack of a network connection, and so on. In this way, the browser  may navigate through copies of webpages that are stored locally at the computing device  as if the webpages were obtained via the network connection, thereby providing a seamless user experience.","The database cache  is representative of storage for database, such as data that may be used to synchronize with one or more websites, such as to expose local storage through database like application programming interfaces (APIs), which may or may not be a cache of data for storage elsewhere on the computing device . For example, data in the database cache  may include contacts, configuration settings, and so on that may be utilized locally at the computing device  through normal usage, such as by a scheduling and email application. This data may also be leveraged as part of a website to share the data with other computing devices, such as to disseminate the configuration settings to other computing devices of the user. A variety of different techniques may be employed by the cache manager module  to manage browser storage , an example of which may be found beginning in relation to .","While various examples of cache management are described herein in the context of a browsing environment and a browser, it is to be appreciated that the cache manager module  and corresponding techniques can be employed in a variety of environments and with any suitable applications that make use of browser-side storage. By way of example, the cache manager module  can be implemented to manage browser storage  for one or more of the browser  as well as applications  and other functionality of the computing device .","Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), or a combination of these implementations. The terms \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201cfunctionality,\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation, the module, functionality, or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs). The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices. The features of the techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.","For example, the computing device  may also include an entity (e.g., software) that causes hardware of the computing device  to perform operations, e.g., processors, functional blocks, and so on. For example, the computing device  may include a computer-readable medium that may be configured to maintain instructions that cause the computing device, and more particularly hardware of the computing device  to perform operations. Thus, the instructions function to configure the hardware to perform the operations and in this way result in transformation of the hardware to perform functions. The instructions may be provided by the computer-readable medium to the computing device  through a variety of different configurations.","One such configuration of a computer-readable medium is signal bearing medium and thus is configured to transmit the instructions (e.g., as a carrier wave) to the hardware of the computing device, such as via a network. The computer-readable medium may also be configured as a computer-readable storage medium and thus is not a signal bearing medium. Examples of a computer-readable storage medium include a random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), an optical disc, flash memory, hard disk memory, and other memory devices that may use magnetic, optical, and other techniques to store instructions and other data.","Having described an example environment in which the techniques described herein may operate, consider now a discussion of some example embodiments that can utilize the cache manager module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["116","118","116","102","102","116","118"]},"For example, a group policy may be written and disseminated to a plurality of the computing devices  in an enterprise. The policy may provide a variety of inputs to specify how the cache manager module  is to perform as further described below. Likewise, a user may login to the computing device  as an administrator to order to access configuration settings of the cache manager module , e.g., using administrator privileges of the computing device . A variety of other examples are also contemplated.","Regardless of the technique used, the inputs may specify a variety of different configuration settings. For example, the inputs may specify a maximum individual storage  amount that is usable by websites in the application cache  and\/or database cache . As shown in , for instance, a website may be set to consume a maximum of fifty megabytes in an application cache  and five hundred megabytes of a database cache  without causing output of a user prompt. In this way, a website may be given a base amount of use without interfering with a user's interaction with the website, e.g., by outputting a prompt to determine if the website is trusted, to notify that a cache is consumed, and so on. Upon reaching the specified amount, a prompt may be output as further described below.","A threshold  may also be employed by the cache manager module  to determine when to employ one or more garbage collection techniques. For example, the threshold  may be set in a variety of ways, such as based on a maximum individual storage for a particular website, e.g., 80% of the maximum individual storage  is consumed, when a particular amount such as ten megabytes remains, in relation to a maximum aggregate storage , and so on.","When this threshold  is reached, the cache manager module  may automatically and without user intervention employ criteria to determine which data, if any, may be removed from the respective cache. For example, the cache manager module  may automatically delete data that has not been accessed by a user within a predefined amount of time, such as thirty days. A variety of other criteria are also contemplated, such as based on content type (e.g., delete images due to size), purpose (e.g., delete ads but have other content remain since ads may be frequently updated), and so forth. In this way, the cache manager module  may operate \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d before the maximum individual storage  amount is reached to determine if operations may be performed to alleviate this condition before interfering with the user's interaction with the computing device .","A maximum aggregate storage  may also be specified for use in managing the browser storage  by the cache manager module . The maximum aggregate storage  amount, for instance, may specify a total amount of storage space that is permitted to be used at the client device  for the application cache  and the database cache . For instance, the maximum aggregate storage  amount for the application cache  may be specified as one gigabyte and the maximum aggregate storage  amount for the database cache  may be specified as four gigabytes. Naturally, a variety of other amounts may also be specified. In this way, the cache manager module  may protect the computing device  from malicious parties, such as from a malicious party that may try to perform a denial of service attack, may cause data to be stored from a plurality of different websites, and so forth. As above, the cache manager module  may also employ a threshold to initiate one or more garbage collection techniques before reaching the maximum aggregate storage  amount. Upon reaching the maximum individual storage  and\/or maximum aggregate storage  amounts, the cache manager module  may output a variety of prompts to provide a variety of functionality, examples of which are described beginning in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["300","110","300","116","118"]},"The user interface  may include typical instrumentalities that are employed by browsers such as back and forward navigation buttons, an address bar, a search bar, and a tab band that can support multiple tabs, each of which are undesignated for the sake of brevity in the figure. The user interface  also includes a content rendering area  (designated by the cross hatching) in which content can be rendered.","In addition, user interface  includes a notification bar . In one or more embodiments, the notification bar  is designed to help users maintain focus on their browsing activities, while offering notifications in the form of prompts. Notifications presented via the notification bar can include prompts related to management of browser storage that are output or otherwise caused via operation of the cache manager module  to enable various techniques for cache management.","In at least some embodiments, the notification bar is presented at a location within the browsing field-of-view that is selected to reduce user distraction. For example, in the illustrated and described embodiment, the notification bar  is presented at or near the bottom of the user interface , here adjacent the bottom of or below content rendering area . The notification bar  is designed to be noticeable yet ignorable, thus enabling a user to continue with their browsing tasks in content rendering area , without being distracted by a modal dialog. Further, in at least some embodiments, the notification bar is presented in a manner which overlays content that is rendered by the web browser. The notification bar's location effectively prioritizes content that is rendered within content rendering area  over a particular notification that might appear in the notification bar .","Having considered an example user interface  that makes use of a notification bar in accordance with one or more embodiments, consider now some details regarding example browser storage management techniques that can be provided in accordance with one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","304","402","304","404"]},"This notification may be output responsive to meeting a maximum individual threshold for a website in either the application cache  and\/or database cache . Thus, a user is interrupted when the limit is reached in this example but is not interrupted beforehand.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["500","304","502","304","504"]},"Thus, this notification may be output responsive to meeting a maximum aggregate storage  for each of the websites in total in either the application cache  and\/or the database cache . Thus, in this instance also a user is interrupted when the limited is reached but is not interrupted beforehand. Selection of the command  for \u201copen\u201d may cause output of an option in which a user may manually specify which data is to be deleted from browser storage  to \u201cmake room,\u201d an example of which may be found in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","116","118"]},"The user interface , for instance, includes an option to \u201cenable website caches and databases\u201d using a checkbox. The user interface  also includes an option to specify when a prompt is to be output for an individual domain, i.e., to set the maximum individual storage  amount for a website. This is illustrated in  as \u201cAsk when a website's cache or database exceeds: 5 MB\u201d with the amount \u201c5\u201d being configurable by a user.","The user interface  also includes storage values that are separated by domain to inform users of the computing device  as to how much storage space each domain consumes. Each of the descriptions of the domains are selectable and stored data that is associated with the domains may be deleted by selecting the \u201cdelete\u201d command. In one or more implementations, selection of the domain causes associated data in both the application and database caches ,  to be deleted, thereby conserving space in both places. Thus, data from one cache may be deleted responsive to the \u201cfilling\u201d of another cache. In other words, data from the database cache  and the application cache  may be deleted responsive to reaching the maximum value of either one of the caches.","The user interface  further includes a notification message that \u201cFile Storage is full\u201d to indicate that the application cache  is full. Other notification messages may also be displayed, such as \u201cData Storage is Full\u201d to indicate that the database cache  is full, \u201cFile and Data Storage are both Full,\u201d and so on. Further description of these and other techniques that relate to browser storage may be found in relation to the following procedures.","Example Procedures","The following discussion describes browser storage management techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","102","120","122"]},"The maximum aggregates sizes of the application and database caches, respectively, of browser storage are set at the computing device as specified by the inputs (block ). Thus, the cache manager module  may then manage browser storage based on these sizes as well as other settings that may be user configurable.","For example, a threshold that is configured to cause the computing device to execute a garbage collection technique automatically and without user intervention may be set to determine if at least a portion of data stored in the application cache or database cache is to be deleted automatically and without user intervention, and if so, delete at least a point of the data (block ). The threshold, for instance, may be based on the maximum aggregate size as described above, such as at eighty percent, within a predefined amount of the maximum aggregate size (e.g., ten megabytes). The threshold may also be set to a predefined value, which may also be computed using a wide variety of other criteria.","Once the threshold is reached, the cache manager module  may initiate execution of one or more garbage collection techniques to remove data from the application and\/or database caches , . For instance, these techniques may employ criteria to determine what data, if any, may be removed from the caches. Examples of such criteria include updates to the data over time, assuming material frequently updated in the past is going to be re-written before use, number of accesses in a time period (e.g., assuming that more frequently accessed data is more valuable), tradeoffs between a number of accesses and size of the overall cache, percentage of the bytes accessed in a given amount of time, checking whether items in the cache have been added to the tracking protection list (e.g., possibly provided by a 3rd party, and so on. Additional examples of such criteria include an amount of time that has passed without a user interacting with the data (e.g., thirty days), types of the data (e.g., images, music files, text), purpose of the data (e.g., content versus advertisements on a webpage), and so forth. Thus, the threshold may be used to operate \u201cin the background\u201d without interfering with a user until the maximum aggregate size is reached as described below.","Responsive to a determination that the maximum aggregate size for the application or database cache has been reached, a prompt is output in a user interface that indicates that an amount of data to be stored in the application or database cache has reached the maximum aggregate size (block ). As shown in , for instance, the prompt may be output as part of a notification bar . Other configurations are also contemplated, such as \u201ctoast\u201d notifications, pop-up windows, and so forth.","A user may then select a command to cause output of an option to manually delete data associated with particular domains, e.g., particular websites. For example, selection of domains may be received from a user via interaction with a user interface (block ), such as the user interface  of . Data may be represented in a variety of ways, such as by manifest URL, by fully-qualified domain, by top-level domain, by user, by cache type (e.g., application cache  and\/or database cache ), by integrity level\/container, and so on.","Data from the application and database caches ,  may then be deleted that relates to the selected domains (block ). Thus, data from both caches may be deleted responsive to reaching a maximum aggregate size of either one of the caches. Other implementations are also contemplated, such as to manually select particular caches and data for deletion.","Although this example described use of maximum aggregate sizes for application or database caches, these techniques may also be leveraged to support maximum individual storage  sizes for individual domains. For example, the threshold for automatic garbage collection may be set for individual domains as described above. Likewise, the maximum individual storage  amount may also be user configurable for particular domains. In this way a domain may utilize a particular amount of storage in a cache \u201cwithout asking\u201d a user. Past that amount, the user may be prompted to indicate whether the domain is to be trusted to consume additional storage space, the amount of which may also be user configurable as further described in relation to the following figure. Naturally, a variety of other examples are also contemplated without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"],"b":["800","802","116","118","202"]},"Responsive to the detection, a prompt is output in the user interface by the computing device that includes an option to expand the maximum individual storage size of browser storage for the domain (block ). For example, the option may be selectable to automatically expand the size (e.g., double the size) responsive to a user selection. In another example, the option may be configured to accept a specific value from the user for the expansion, e.g., expand by five megabytes, defines a total size, and so on. Further, these techniques may be used to expand the application  or database caches  alone or together, e.g., specify different values for the different caches, a total overall value for both caches, and so on.
