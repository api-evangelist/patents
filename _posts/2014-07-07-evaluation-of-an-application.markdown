Hence, many applications consume network resources in a far from optimal way. This not only consumes excess resources for the user of the application, but also for other users, since cellular network resources are shared among many users. Moreover, the battery consumption is increased with inefficient network resource usage.","To design and develop applications that are efficient for the cellular network is a complex task that requires detailed knowledge in how cellular networks execute requests, deals with bursty traffic, handle idling users, and much more.","It is an object to provide a way for the developer to conveniently evaluate cellular network performance of an application.","According to a first aspect, it is presented a method for evaluating an application intended to be installed in a wireless terminal of a cellular network.

The quality of the wireless radio interface to each wireless terminal  can vary over time and depending on the position of the wireless terminal , due to effects such as fading, multipath propagation, interference, etc.","The radio network node  is also connected to the core network  for connectivity to central functions and a wide area network , such as the Internet.","There is also an application development device  connected to the wide area network . The application development device  provides an environment for a software developer to be able to develop an application  (also known as app) which is a software program which can be installed in the wireless terminal . The installation can occur by the application developer publishing the application using an application provider . The user of the wireless device  can then find the application using the application provider  and install the application  in the wireless device . The application provider can e.g. be an application repository such as Google Play or Apple App Store.","When the application  is executing in the wireless device, it will on occasion communicate with an application server , e.g. to retrieve data, store data, or request certain functionality from app server, etc. The wireless device  will then communicate uplink and downlink via the radio network node , core network and the wide area network  to reach the application server . Depending on how the application  has been developed, the cellular network  can be better or worse utilised. As is explained in further detail below, the application developer using the application development device  thus needs guidance as to how efficient the application  is when utilising the cellular network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["7","10","7","11","2","2","11","7"]},"The evaluator  can be included within the SDK  or it can be a separate software program.

In other words, large amount of execution data from cellular data sessions are beforehand recorded from real cellular networks, processed and stored as a database of application execution characteristics. The database is implemented and distributed as part of the SDK and\/or evaluator and can thus be used by developers to build and test new applications for smartphones, tablets, etc. The database can be static and updated only when a new in version of the SDK and\/or evaluator is released, or the database can be configured to update its data dynamically over the wide area network.","This data can e.g. comprise session time, number of state switches per session, total time spent in specific states per session, and total data sent in each direction in each state. The data is analysed and characterised to serve as the reference performance data for the application development.","The reference performance data base is thus created by using a large number of session samples from one or more cellular networks. Using these samples, the characteristics per sample are calculated, the results are binned based on session time, and the average values per bin are calculated. The results will then provide a good representation of the average characteristics per session based on the session time in the networks measured, and these characteristics can then be used for evaluating new applications to be developed.","The radio energy and the loadtime are calculated by the formula",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"i"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["Component","i"]},{"mi":["Weight","i"]}],"mo":"\u00b7"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["i ","i "]},"The unit loadtime is defined here due to the fact that in a W-CDMA system, the momentary air interface uplink load is not characterised by transmitted power, but by the load in terms of thermal noise rise, RoT (Rise over Thermal). Corresponding with the definition where energy equals power multiplied by time, loadtime is defined as load multiplied by time, to arrive at a measurement which is equivalent to energy but in the uplink.","It is to be noted that the graphs of  are only examples and are presented to better explain embodiments presented herein. Moreover, only a subset of possible parameters are illustrated in .","Looking now to , this is a schematic graph illustrating reference performance data in uplink. A solid line  represents uplink CP (Control Plane) cost (defined in more detail below). A long dashed line  represents uplink loadtime and a dotted line  represents data magnitude of uplink data transfer.","The values of uplink CP cost, uplink loadtime and data magnitude are all reference performance data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["25","24","23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"A solid line represents minimum downlink data and a short dashed line represents recommended downlink data.

A session for a first app has a first downlink data value and a first downlink CP cost value . The downlink data value is clearly above the minimum downlink data line , and almost at the recommended downlink data line . Moreover, the downlink CP cost is on the recommended downlink CP cost line . All in all, the first app appears to perform decently, with some improvement that can be done particularly in the downlink data value. The developer could address this by moving some time demanding processing which is performed during the cellular data session to instead be performed when the session is not active. This reduces the session time (shifting the plotted values -to the left), which would make the downlink data value approach or even surpass the recommended downlink data line ","A session for a second app has a second data value and a second downlink CP cost value . The plotted values for this app are on the recommended lines , , whereby it performs better relative to the first app.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-B","FIG. 1"],"b":"7"},"In an obtain performance data step , performance data associated with an execution of the application in a test wireless terminal is obtained. As explained above, the test wireless terminal can be part of a simulated cellular network (within the application development device) or a real cellular network (external to the application development device). The performance data is obtained for each cellular data session of the execution of the application, where each cellular data session is defined as a period when the test wireless terminal is in a cellular network connection state when data transfer is possible. For instance, in W-CDMA, the states when data transfer is possible consists of the following states: CELL_FACH, a state when a Forward Access Channel is available and CELL_DCH, a state when Dedicated Channel is available.","In one embodiment, the cellular network connection state when data transfer is possible consists of a single state of an RRC_CONNECTED (Radio Resource Control Connected) state.","For instance, the performance data can comprise a measurement of data transfer magnitude (e.g. downlink data and\/or uplink data), which has proven to be a good measurement of resource usage in a cellular network and which is also easily obtained. Alternatively or additionally, the performance data comprises one or more of the following: number of transferred uplink bytes, number of transferred downlink bytes, time spent in a specific cellular network connection state, number of transitions of cellular network connection states, downlink energy estimate, uplink energy estimate.","Hence, the application development device  gathers the performance data required to calculate the characteristics used for evaluation.","In an evaluate step , the performance data is evaluated by comparing the performance data with reference performance data. This comparison is based on the duration of each cellular data session.","In order to give guidance to the developer and encourage the smartphone community to in use the networks in an efficient way, recommended and acceptable levels for each characteristic involved can be added to the database (see ). These levels can be dynamic or adapted, or just the average levels multiplied by a constant value. These levels will then serve as a recommended target level for the developer. The levels do not need to be imposed or mandatory to reach before approval since that may lead to negative effects like additional data transmission just to reach a recommended level.","The reference performance data database and the analysis software functionality are then built and included in SDK, where it interacts with the application programming interface (API) of the SDK.","This step may comprise comparing the performance data with a strict subset (e.g. bins) of the reference performance data, the strict subset being defined by a range of durations of the cellular data sessions, for reference performance data, in which the duration of the cellular data session falls.","By using the reference performance data from cellular networks, the developer will get quick feedback of how the application performs in various traffic cases.","The method can use different performance data as a discriminating variable, for example the total time spent in connected state, and then evaluate the execution based on this. The statistical characteristics for other applications with the same discriminating variable value are used as comparison, which enables a straight forward yet accurate measure of how the application performs from a network perspective.","Distinction of application category can be included, but in order to get a general performance evaluation, this is not required. Also, such categorisation can be arbitrary in and to work well it requires well defined category definitions to avoid any erroneous categorisations.","Now, the method illustrated in  will be described. Only new or modified steps, compared to the method of , will be described here.","In a present step , a result of the evaluating of performance data is presented to the user of the application development device.","Optionally, this step comprises presenting recommendations indicating recommended performance data values (as shown in  and described above).","Also, the performance data can optionally be included when the application is presented by the application provider , whereby there is a greater incentive for the application developer to develop applications which are efficient in their usage of the cellular network.","An example will now be described for further illustration. The example explains how a reference database is created for application development, and then applying this reference database to get a performance evaluation measurement for the application under development. The example will for clarity only use a small set of data, but nothing prevents the method to be scaled up to more realistic data set volumes; i.e. thousands or millions of samples.","From a live network, samples of user data are captured. Each sample describes a session from the connection setup until the session is terminated. In a cellular network, the connection usually is kept as short as possible to preserve radio resources, leading to session termination after a short time of inactivity. Hence a session usually only consists of a burst of packets, all related to the same task e.g. watching a video clip or opening a web page.","The information collected per sample is: the time spent in active states (e.g. for WCDMA CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH states), the data sent in either direction and in either state, and the number of transitions between states. All this will describe the session from a utilisation perspective of the air interface resources, which is typically the most scarce resource in a cellular network.","A few samples of reference
