title: Sub-mailbox folder hierarchy to represent a separate physical mailbox to a user
abstract: Architecture that provides an abstraction of a mailbox store that allows clients to connect to multiple “alternate” mailboxes associated with a single user, exposing the same mechanism used to connect to a user's main mailbox. Beneath this abstraction, support for alternate mailboxes is implemented as a folder hierarchy contained within the user's own mailbox or another physical mailbox. The architecture uses a sub-mailbox folder hierarchy to virtualize a separate physical mailbox. On top of this basic infrastructure, other features can be built such as server-hosted e-mail archives and mailboxes mirrored from other e-mail and PIM data systems. In support thereof, a mechanism is provided for an abstraction layer to expose all or a subset of the alternate mailbox features, and to advertise which alternate mailbox features are supported per alternate mailbox.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["User devices can now provide multiple ways for users to communicate to one another. For example, cell phones and computers provide the principal means for communicating with other users, and each can be associated with message accounts. Moreover, users are now able to freely create message accounts such as for e-mail and text messaging via websites. Thus, users may have multiple accounts via which to send and receive information. However, having multiple accounts spread across various locations, websites, and clients, for example, introduces new problems with communications technologies that originally facilitate more efficient and effective communications.","Moreover, the capability to store substantially all messages can impose significant burden on client machines, thereby driving a need to store such messages off the client and on servers. However, again, storing different accounts and account messages across different locations is a suboptimal solution to an increasingly mobile society and to system resources.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some novel embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The disclosed architecture provides an abstraction of a mailbox store that allows clients to connect to multiple \u201calternate\u201d mailboxes associated with a single user, exposing the same mechanism used to connect to a user's primary (or \u201cmain\u201d) mailbox. Beneath this abstraction, support for alternate mailboxes is implemented as a folder hierarchy contained within the user's own physical mailbox or another physical mailbox. The physical mailbox is the server location where messages are stored until retrieved by a suitable client. The architecture uses a sub-mailbox folder hierarchy to virtualize a separate physical mailbox. In other words, a physical mailbox of the user stored at a different storage location can be relocated to the local storage system as a subfolder hierarchy to the local physical mailbox. On top of this basic infrastructure, other features can be built such as server-hosted e-mail archives and mailboxes mirrored from other e-mail and PIM data systems. In support thereof, a mechanism is provided for an abstraction layer to expose all or a subset of the alternate mailbox features, and to advertise which alternate mailbox features are supported per alternate mailbox.","Clients can be agnostic to this architecture, by enabling the clients to logon to alternate mailboxes using the same mechanism used to logon to the user's primary mailbox, as though the alternate mailboxes were actually separate mailboxes. The alternate mailboxes can support all or a subset of mailbox features, and a mechanism is provided for the alternate mailboxes to advertise the mailbox features supported.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be practiced and all aspects and equivalents thereof are intended to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The need to associate more than one physical store for a mailbox belonging to a user in an e-mail environment can manifest itself in several ways. One such way enables user-accessible archives of e-mail and PIM (personal information management) data to be stored on a server, which were previously stored on the client machine of the end user. An archive is associated with the user's main mailbox account, supports backward compatibility for alternate-mailbox-agnostic clients, and advertises the mailbox features it supports.","Another way allows users to mirror content from e-mail and PIM data accounts on other messaging and PIM systems to a centralized, hosted e-mail server. To avoid \u201cbleeding\u201d of personal e-mail data between personal e-mail and work e-mail, a separate mailbox can be provided on the e-mail centralized server for each remote account that is being mirrored. For purposes of backward compatibility, there is a strong desire to provide this functionality with minimal (if any) changes to the clients accessing the e-mail server.","The disclosed architecture provides an abstraction of a mailbox store that allows clients to connect to multiple \u201calternate\u201d mailboxes associated with a single user, exposing the same mechanism used to connect to a user's primary physical mailbox. Beneath this abstraction, support for alternate mailboxes is implemented as a hidden folder hierarchy contained within a hidden portion or location of the user's local physical mailbox or another physical mailbox.","Reference is now made to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident, however, that the novel embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof. The intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","102","108","110"],"sub":["1","N"]},"The account component  structures the alternate subaccounts  as hidden relative to the main account , which is visible. The alternate subaccounts  are mailboxes of e-mail accounts of the user of other user mailbox locations. The alternate subaccounts  can include archive subaccounts and mirror subaccounts. The alternate subaccounts  are accessed via the main account . Alternatively, the alternate subaccounts  are subordinate to a physical account other than the main account . The alternate subaccounts  include physical mailboxes of the different message accounts  that are structured as hidden subaccounts in a hidden location of the main account . The system  can further comprise an abstraction component  for providing access to message data of the main account  and alternate subaccounts .","The storage component  can be a middle-tier (mid-tier) storage system, for example. The abstraction component  provides direct access by the user to one or more of the alternate subaccounts , and facilitates client agnostic access to the message data of the main account  as well as the alternate accounts . In other words, the client can be one of many different types of clients such as e-mail clients, PIM clients, etc., yet still access the message data in the accounts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","104","108","104","102","104"]},"The alternate accounts  can comprise mirrored accounts of the different message accounts  associated with correspondingly different e-mail systems. The alternate accounts  can also include archives of the different message accounts , as desired. The mirror component  can be configured to periodically reach out (access) to each of the different message accounts  and pull the associated messaging data into the mirrored accounts in the storage component .","As before, the abstraction component  facilitates access to the alternate accounts  via the main account  (mailbox). Each of the alternate accounts  can advertise all or a subset of account features in response to access to the corresponding alternate account. Additionally, the storage component  can include a user object of the main account  that is extended to include a list of the associated alternate accounts .","Put another way, the computer-implemented message system  includes the storage component  centrally located for storing representations of the different message accounts  of a user, the account component  of the storage component  for structuring the representations as the alternate subaccounts  to the main account , the mirror component  for mirroring content from the different message accounts  to the main account  and alternate subaccounts , and the abstraction component  for providing access to the message data of the main account  and alternate subaccounts .","The account component  structures the alternate subaccounts  as subordinate and hidden relative to the main account , which main account  is visible and via which access to the alternate subaccounts  is provided. The alternate subaccounts  are hidden accounts that include message data and PIM data of archive subaccounts and mirror subaccounts of the different message accounts . The main account  includes a list of the alternate subaccounts , and the alternate subaccounts  are accessed via the main account  based on the list.","The archive accounts store archives of the e-mail data and PIM data of the main account . In an alternative embodiment, the archive accounts can store archives for the mirrored accounts as well. The alternate accounts  advertise all or a subset of account features that the alternate (mailbox) accounts  support. The account features can be enabled or disabled based on capabilities flags. The alternate accounts  are accessible via the same session interface employed to access the main account .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","304","304"]},"Here, the hierarchy  shows the main mailbox  as the root with three sub-mailboxes in the hidden subtree of the main mailbox . In this example, the visible part of the main mailbox  is the content that appears under a node labeled \u201cMAIN-SUBTREE\u201d. The user's three physical mailboxes (from the different message accounts  of ) appear as alternate mailbox subaccounts under an ALTERNATE MAILBOXES node, also referred to as the alternate mailbox subaccounts , which is in the hidden subtree of the main mailbox . A first alternate mailbox (denoted USER-PERSONAL) of the \u201cvirtualized\u201d mailboxes is shown expanded, with a set of e-mail folders (e.g., Calendar, Contacts, Deleted Items, Drafts, Inbox, Journal, Junk Mail, Notes, Outbox, etc.) in its subtree. The second and third alternate mailbox (denoted USER-PERSONAL and USER-PERSONAL) of the virtualized mailboxes are shown collapsed, but can be web-mail accounts or archives, for example.","Note that while this example shows the hierarchy of the alternate mailbox subaccounts  contained within a hidden part of the user's own main mailbox, a sub-mailbox folder hierarchy of some other physical mailbox on the system can be used for the same purpose.","Because the user's main mailbox and virtualized alternate mailboxes can reside on the same physical storage, it can be guaranteed that the availability characteristics for all of the user mailboxes are the same. This helps to alleviate user interface difficulties that can occur by associating multiple mailboxes with the same user that reside on separate physical stores.","As illustrated, the main mailbox subtree, in this example, is defined from the Main-Subtree node to the Outbox node. An example of a mirrored mailbox and subtree is shown with respect to the first alternate subaccount (User-Personal) as including the User-Subtree to the Outbox. A mirrored mailbox is defined as extending from the User-Personal node to the Outbox. The alternate mailboxes subtree is defined as extending from the Alternate Mailboxes node to and including the User-Personal alternate mailbox. The main mailbox subtree is defined as extending from the Main Mailbox node to the User-Personal alternate mailbox subaccount.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","406","408","410","404","412","414","406","412","412","412","416","418"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","402","404","406","408","410","404","412","414","406","412","412","412","502","418","504","504","504"]},"Because alternate mailboxes are associated with a single main mailbox, the alternate mailboxes do not need the added management burden of being exposed (e.g., in a directory) as a new kind of mailbox-enabled user object, but can instead be represented as an association of attributes on a single user object. The user object can be used to represent a mailbox, and includes attributes such as the mailbox distinguished name and home mailbox database GUID (globally unique identifier). To support alternate mailboxes, the user object can be extended to include a list of the associated alternate mailboxes. The entries encoded in this list include data such as the mailbox GUID, home mailbox database, display name, SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) address, mailbox quota, and mailbox type (e.g., archive, mirror, etc.).","For example, a user object with a primary mailbox on company.com (user@company.com) and two alternate mailboxes can have the following data in an alternate mailboxes list:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ID","HomeMdb","DisplayName","SmtpAddress","Quota","Flags"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["{Guid1}","{homeMdbGuid}","Annual","(null)","Unlimited","Archive"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Archive"]},{"entry":["{Guid2}","{homeMdbGuid}","User 1","user1@e-mail.com","1 GB","Mirror"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mirrored"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mailbox"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"To connect to a sub-mailbox, a client uses the same mailbox session API that is used to connect to the main mailbox. This API accepts the distinguished name (DN) or e-mail address of the mailbox to open, recognizes the DN or e-mail address of an alternate sub-mailbox, and directs the client to the appropriate sub-mailbox hierarchy.","For clients that are agnostic to the alternate mailbox architecture, a user profile is created (e.g., manually or through a discovery mechanism) that stores this DN. Clients that are alternate mailbox-aware can check the directory at runtime for the set of alternate mailboxes associated with a user, rather than storing the DN. Once the client has connected to the alternate mailbox, the client interacts with the mailbox as it would any other mailbox.","The two scenarios driving alternate mailbox support in mailbox servers (e.g., mailbox archiving and mailbox mirroring) place different requirements on the functionality that the mailbox exposes. For archive mailboxes, certain actions (e.g., send, deliver) and settings (e.g., out-of-office, rules) are only relevant for a user's primary mailbox. Thus, these actions and settings can be disabled for the alternate mailbox. For mirrored mailboxes, however, all mailbox features and settings can be fully enabled on all of this type of alternate mailbox.","To support these two scenarios (and provide expansion to other alternate mailbox types), a mechanism is provided to turn mailbox features on or off, based on a set of \u201cCapabilities\u201d flags. This mechanism also enables the mailbox session to advertise to clients which features the mailbox supports. Alternate mailbox-aware clients can use this data to turn user interface elements on or off, for example, depending on the capabilities of the session.","Included herein is a set of flow charts representative of exemplary methodologies for performing novel aspects of the disclosed architecture. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the one or more methodologies shown herein, for example, in the form of a flow chart or flow diagram, are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance therewith, occur in a different order and\/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all acts illustrated in a methodology may be required for a novel implementation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["700","702","704","706","708"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806","808","810","812","814","816","818","820"]},"At , if a match is not found, flow is to , where the client is looking at the main mailbox and the object is returned to . If, at , there the object does not have the alternate mailbox property set, flow is to  to return the user object to .","In this case, the client can be the MAPI protocol head  of . The client can discover the alternate mailboxes via the main mailbox. In one alternative implementation, the client can discover the mirrored mailboxes directly without going through the main mailbox.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d and \u201csystem\u201d are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, a hard disk drive, multiple storage drives (of optical and\/or magnetic storage medium), an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution, and a component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. The word \u201cexemplary\u201d may be used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a block diagram of a computing system  operable to support the disclosed alternate mailbox infrastructure in accordance with the disclosed architecture. In order to provide additional context for various aspects thereof,  and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of the suitable computing system  in which the various aspects can be implemented. While the description above is in the general context of computer-executable instructions that can run on one or more computers, those skilled in the art will recognize that a novel embodiment also can be implemented in combination with other program modules and\/or as a combination of hardware and software.","The computing system  for implementing various aspects includes the computer  having processing unit(s) , a system memory , and a system bus . The processing unit(s)  can be any of various commercially available processors such as single-processor, multi-processor, single-core units and multi-core units. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the novel methods can be practiced with other computer system configurations, including minicomputers, mainframe computers, as well as personal computers (e.g., desktop, laptop, etc.), hand-held computing devices, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, and the like, each of which can be operatively coupled to one or more associated devices.","The system memory  can include volatile (VOL) memory  (e.g., random access memory (RAM)) and non-volatile memory (NON-VOL)  (e.g., ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, etc.). A basic input\/output system (BIOS) can be stored in the non-volatile memory , and includes the basic routines that facilitate the communication of data and signals between components within the computer , such as during startup. The volatile memory  can also include a high-speed RAM such as static RAM for caching data.","The system bus  provides an interface for system components including, but not limited to, the memory subsystem  to the processing unit(s) . The system bus  can be any of several types of bus structure that can further interconnect to a memory bus (with or without a memory controller), and a peripheral bus (e.g., PCI, PCIe, AGP, LPC, etc.), using any of a variety of commercially available bus architectures.","The computer  further includes storage subsystem(s)  and storage interface(s)  for interfacing the storage subsystem(s)  to the system bus  and other desired computer components. The storage subsystem(s)  can include one or more of a hard disk drive (HDD), a magnetic floppy disk drive (FDD), and\/or optical disk storage drive (e.g., a CD-ROM drive DVD drive), for example. The storage interface(s)  can include interface technologies such as EIDE, ATA, SATA, and IEEE 1394, for example.","One or more programs and data can be stored in the memory subsystem , a removable memory subsystem  (e.g., flash drive form factor technology), and\/or the storage subsystem(s) , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . Generally, programs include routines, methods, data structures, other software components, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.","The one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data  can include the components and entities of the system  of , the components and entities of the system  of , the hierarchy  of , the components and entities of the infrastructure  of  and infrastructure  of , and the flow charts and diagrams of , for example.","All or portions of the operating system , applications , modules , and\/or data  can also be cached in memory such as the volatile memory , for example. It is to be appreciated that the disclosed architecture can be implemented with various commercially available operating systems or combinations of operating systems (e.g., as virtual machines).","The storage subsystem(s)  and memory subsystems ( and ) serve as computer readable media for volatile and non-volatile storage of data, data structures, computer-executable instructions, and so forth. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media. For the computer , the media accommodate the storage of data in any suitable digital format. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media can be employed such as zip drives, magnetic tape, flash memory cards, cartridges, and the like, for storing computer executable instructions for performing the novel methods of the disclosed architecture.","A user can interact with the computer , programs, and data using external user input devices  such as a keyboard and a mouse. Other external user input devices  can include a microphone, an IR (infrared) remote control, a joystick, a game pad, camera recognition systems, a stylus pen, touch screen, gesture systems (e.g., eye movement, head movement, etc.), and\/or the like. The user can interact with the computer , programs, and data using onboard user input devices  such a touchpad, microphone, keyboard, etc., where the computer  is a portable computer, for example. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit(s)  through input\/output (I\/O) device interface(s)  via the system bus , but can be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port, IEEE 1394 serial port, a game port, a USB port, an IR interface, etc. The I\/O device interface(s)  also facilitate the use of output peripherals  such as printers, audio devices, camera devices, and so on, such as a sound card and\/or onboard audio processing capability.","One or more graphics interface(s)  (also commonly referred to as a graphics processing unit (GPU)) provide graphics and video signals between the computer  and external display(s)  (e.g., LCD, plasma) and\/or onboard displays  (e.g., for portable computer). The graphics interface(s)  can also be manufactured as part of the computer system board.","The computer  can operate in a networked environment (e.g., IP) using logical connections via a wired\/wireless communications subsystem  to one or more networks and\/or other computers. The other computers can include workstations, servers, routers, personal computers, microprocessor-based entertainment appliance, a peer device or other common network node, and typically include many or all of the elements described relative to the computer . The logical connections can include wired\/wireless connectivity to a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), hotspot, and so on. LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies and facilitate enterprise-wide computer networks, such as intranets, all of which may connect to a global communications network such as the Internet.","When used in a networking environment the computer  connects to the network via a wired\/wireless communication subsystem  (e.g., a network interface adapter, onboard transceiver subsystem, etc.) to communicate with wired\/wireless networks, wired\/wireless printers, wired\/wireless input devices , and so on. The computer  can include a modem or has other means for establishing communications over the network. In a networked environment, programs and data relative to the computer  can be stored in the remote memory\/storage device, as is associated with a distributed system. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used.","The computer  is operable to communicate with wired\/wireless devices or entities using the radio technologies such as the IEEE 802.xx family of standards, such as wireless devices operatively disposed in wireless communication (e.g., IEEE 802.11 over-the-air modulation techniques) with, for example, a printer, scanner, desktop and\/or portable computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), communications satellite, any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag (e.g., a kiosk, news stand, restroom), and telephone. This includes at least Wi-Fi (or Wireless Fidelity) for hotspots, WiMax, and Bluetooth\u2122 wireless technologies. Thus, the communications can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11x (a, b, g, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wire networks (which use IEEE 802.3-related media and functions).","The illustrated aspects can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where certain tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules can be located in local and\/or remote storage and\/or memory system.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a schematic block diagram of a computing environment  that supports mid-tier alternate mailboxes in a hidden subfolder tree. The environment  includes one or more client(s) . The client(s)  can be hardware and\/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The client(s)  can house cookie(s) and\/or associated contextual information, for example.","The environment  also includes one or more server(s) . The server(s)  can also be hardware and\/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The servers  can house threads to perform transformations by employing the architecture, for example. One possible communication between a client  and a server  can be in the form of a data packet adapted to be transmitted between two or more computer processes. The data packet may include a cookie and\/or associated contextual information, for example. The environment  includes a communication framework  (e.g., a global communication network such as the Internet) that can be employed to facilitate communications between the client(s)  and the server(s) .","Communications can be facilitated via a wire (including optical fiber) and\/or wireless technology. The client(s)  are operatively connected to one or more client data store(s)  that can be employed to store information local to the client(s)  (e.g., cookie(s) and\/or associated contextual information). Similarly, the server(s)  are operatively connected to one or more server data store(s)  that can be employed to store information local to the servers .","What has been described above includes examples of the disclosed architecture. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components and\/or methodologies, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations are possible. Accordingly, the novel architecture is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, to the extent that the term \u201cincludes\u201d is used in either the detailed description or the claims, such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as \u201ccomprising\u201d is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
