In embodiments, a user device and\/or a recipient device comprises a wireless or mobile device with which a wireless telecommunications network is utilized for communication. In this regard, the device communicates with other devices using a wireless telecommunications network(s).","The user device  is utilized to communicate messages to one or more recipient devices, or recipients associated therewith, via a service provider. As used herein, a message refers to any message that can be communicated to a recipient or a recipient device (e.g., via a service provider) from a user device or user associated therewith. A user can generate a message (i.e., a user-generated message) using a computing device, such as user device , that is intended for communication to a recipient(s). In this regard, a user can input a message by way of the user device  (or other device), for example, using voice, text, a stylus, motion, or any other means capable of inputting a message that is directed to one or more recipients.","A message might be, for instance, a voicemail message, a social network message, a text message, an instant message, an electronic message, or the like. Messages can be communicated to a recipient(s) or a recipient device(s) via an appropriate service provider. A service provider provides message communication services for a user(s). Among other things, a service provider can facilitate delivery of messages from a user or user device to a recipient or recipient device. By way of example only, a service provider may be a voice provider, a text message provider, a social network provider, an electronic message provider, an instant message provider, or the like. A voice provider provides voice services to users. An exemplary voice provider might be a wireless service provider, such as Sprint\u00ae, AT&T\u00ae, etc. A text message provider provides text messaging services to users. An exemplary text message provider might be a wireless service provider, such as Sprint\u00ae, AT&T\u00ae, etc. A social network provider provides social networking services to users.

For example, a wireless provider may provide voice and text message services to users.","The recipient device  can receive messages communicated from one or more user devices, or users associated therewith. That is, the recipient device  can receive or retrieve messages that originate from the user device , or a user of the user device . Such messages may be received by the recipient device  via the network  and\/or a service provider, such as the first service provider , the second service provider , or the third service provider .","The first service provider , the second service provider , and the third service provider  provide communication services to the user device  and\/or the recipient device . In this regard, such service providers can be used to receive messages from a user device(s) and\/or communicate messages to a recipient device(s). The first service provider , the second service provider , and the third service provider  may take on any service provider that provides communication services. As previously mentioned, such service providers may be a voice provider, a text message provider, a social network provider, an electronic message provider, an instant message provider, a combination thereof, or the like.","The message recall system  is configured to manage messages associated with a user(s). In this regard, the message recall system  enables a user to manage messages generated by the user that are directed to or intended for one or more recipient devices, or recipients associated therewith. Accordingly, although  illustrates a single user device  associated with a user, as can be appreciated, the message recall system  can be used to manage messages generated by a user utilizing any number of user devices associated with the user. For example, the message recall system  can allow a user to manage messages communicated in connection with a mobile device, for example, with which the user generates a voice message, a text message, etc. as well as a personal computer, for example, with which the user generates an email message, an instant message, a social network message, etc. Further, the message recall system  can manage any number of messages generated by any number of users.","In embodiments, the message recall system  manages messages communicated to or in association with any number of service providers. For example, the message recall system  can manage messages sent via a voice provider, a text message provider, an email provider, and a social network provider. In some cases, the message recall system  may be a part of or hosted by one of the service providers or a network. In other cases, the message recall system  may operate independent from any of the service providers, may reside on a user device, etc.","As shown in , the message recall system  includes an account managing component , a message capturing component , a message managing component , an account data store , a message data store , and a user-preference data store . It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the components illustrated in the message recall system  are exemplary in nature and in number and should not be construed as limiting. Any number of components may be employed to achieve the desired functionality within the scope of the embodiments hereof. Further, components may be located on any number of servers or computing devices.","It should be understood that this and other arrangements described herein are set forth only as examples. Other arrangements and elements (e.g., machines, interfaces, functions, orders, and groupings of functions, etc.) can be used in addition to or instead of those shown, and some elements may be omitted altogether. Further, many of the elements described herein are functional entities that may be implemented as discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components, and in any suitable combination and location. Various functions described herein as being performed by one or more entities may be carried out by hardware, firmware, and\/or software. For instance, various functions may be carried out by a processor executing instructions stored in memory.","The account managing component  is configured to establish and manage user accounts associated with service providers. In this regard, the account managing component  can receive account data associated with user accounts established with service providers. Account data refers to data associated with a user account (i.e., an account established for a user that uses a service) established with a service provider. For example, assume the user of user device  has user accounts with the first service provider , the second service provider , and the third service provider . In such a case, the account managing component  can be used to receive, retrieve, access, identify, or reference account data for each of the user accounts associated with such service providers. Account data may include, for example, a user identifier that identifies an account user (e.g., a user name), a user device identifier that identifies a device associated with an account user (e.g., an IP address, a mobile device number, etc.), a password for an account, an account identifier that identifies a particular account or service provider thereof, and\/or the like. Such account data might be input by a user, for example, via the user device  or another computing device. Alternatively, account data might be provided via the service provider or identified by the account managing component .","In embodiments, a data store, such as account data store  can be used to store user account data associated with a user. For instance, the account data store  may store an indication of a user account(s) and account data (e.g., user identifier and password) associated therewith in connection with a particular user. Account data store  can store account data for any number of users. As discussed more fully below, such account data can be referenced and, thereafter, used to obtain and\/or recall messages associated with a corresponding user account.","The message capturing component  is configured to capture messages, or message data associated therewith, generated by a user and communicated to a service provider(s) and\/or a recipient device(s). Message data refers to data associated with a message that identifies, describes, or indicates a message and\/or content thereof. For instance, message data may be an indication of a time and\/or date associated with a sent message, a user or user device communicating the message, an intended recipient(s) of the message, content of the message (or a portion thereof), a title of the message, a subject of the message, a message summary, etc.","Messages or message data can be obtained by the message capturing component , for instance, via the user device , the recipient device , the first service provider , the second service provider , the third service provider , and\/or the network . Accordingly, a message being communicated from the user device  can be received, retrieved, or referenced as the message is being communicated to the service provider or recipient device  or upon receipt of the message by the service provider or recipient device .","A user-generated message may be received and\/or stored in connection with a service provider. Accordingly, the message capturing component  can obtain the message or associated message data from the corresponding service provider. By way of example only, assume that the user device  communicates a text message to the recipient device  via the first service provider . In such a case, the message might be routed through the first service provider  and, thereafter, communicated to the message recall system . In such a case, the message capturing component  can receive or retrieve the message, or message data associated therewith, from the first service provider .","As previously mentioned, messages can be received from a service provider or retrieved from a service provider. In this regard, messages may be pushed from a service provider or messages may be pulled from a service provider. In some embodiments, participating providers might push messages while messages might be pulled from non-participating providers. A participating provider refers to a service provider that operates in connection with the message recall system . That is, a participating provider may have an established relationship (e.g., a contractual relationship) with an entity associated with the message recall system . For a participating provider, the message capturing component  may communicate with the service provider using an established API to send a message with an appropriate user identifier, user password, etc. to capture sent messages. The message capturing component  may reference account data, for example, from the account data store , and utilize such account data to capture messages. Alternatively, upon receiving a message, a participating service provider may provide the message, or message data, to the message capturing component .","A non-participating provider refers to a provider that operates independently from the message recall system  in that there is not an established relationship between the non-participating provider and the message recall system . For a non-participating provider, the message capturing component  may utilize an appropriate user identifier, user password, or login component required by the service provider to capture or request messages sent in association with a user. In such a case, the message capturing component  can operate as the user logging into the service provider, for example, and retrieving a message. The message capturing component  may reference account data, for example, from the account data store , and utilize such account data to capture messages. Although reception and retrieval methods are described in relation to a participating provider and a non-participating provider, any such method, among others, can be used to receive or retrieve messages from a service provider.","In embodiments, a data store, such as message data store , can be used to store messages, and\/or message data associated therewith, in connection with a user. For instance, the message data store  may store each message communicated in association with a particular user. Alternatively, the message data store  may store message data associated with each message communicated in connection with a particular user. The message data store  can store messages or message data for any number of users.","As can be appreciated, in some embodiments, the message capturing component  may be configured to obtain and\/or store each message, or data associated therewith, that corresponds with a user. By way of example, the message capturing component  might obtain and\/or store each message sent by way of a service provider for which the message recall system  has account information. In other embodiments, the message capturing component  may be configured to obtain and\/or store a portion of the messages, or data associated therewith, that correspond with a user. For example, the message capturing component  may obtain and\/or store messages indicated as high priority, messages of a particular type (e.g., text message, voice message, email message), messages communicated via a particular service provider(s), messages sent at a particular time or within a particular time duration, messages indicated by a user to be captured, or the like.","The message managing component  is configured to manage messages communicated in association with a user. In this regard, the message managing component  manages messages sent from a user device(s) associated with a user that are delivered to a service provider(s) and\/or a recipient device(s). In embodiments, the message managing component  manages messages by enabling viewing of sent messages, initiating message recalls, etc. A message recall, as used herein, refers to canceling or deleting a message previously communicated from a user device or user to a recipient device, recipient, and\/or a service provider. In this regard, assume that a user provides a social network post via a social network provider (e.g., Facebook\u00ae). Further assume that the user wishes to recall the message such that the message can no longer be viewed by recipients. In such a case, the message managing component  can be utilized to initiate a message recall for the appropriate message.","Message recalls can be initiated by the message managing component  in response to a user providing an indication to recall one or more messages. In some embodiments, an interface, such as an online interface or an interface provided via an application, can be accessed by a user to view messages sent by the user, recall messages, and\/or otherwise manage messages. In such an embodiment, the interface may provide a user with sent messages or message data so that the user can view messages communicated from the user. Upon viewing a message(s) or message data, the user may select a recall option associated with a message(s) intended to be recalled. For example, a user may select a message title or other message data and indicate a desire to have the message recalled. As can be appreciated, in some cases, a user may be able to recall a set of messages. For instance, a user may select multiple messages to be recalled or select a category of related messages to be recalled. Messages can be related according to any category, such as, for example, a recipient, a date and\/or time of sent messages, a subject of messages, a communication method of messages, etc.","The message managing component  can maintain a recall log that includes a history of actions taken with respect to the stored messages. A recall log can be accessible to a user, for example, via a user interface. In this regard, a user can view message actions taken in connection with sent messages. For example, a user may view which sent messages have been recalled, view sent messages, etc. In some cases, even if a message is recalled with respect to a recipient device and\/or a service provider, the message may not be deleted from the message recall system such that the user can view the contents of previously sent messages, or data associated therewith. A recall log may also include details regarding deletion of a message(s). For example, a recall log may include an indication of a success or failure of a recall, a date and\/or time of a recall, a recipient(s) for which the recall was successful or a failure, whether a recipient(s) viewed a particular message, etc.","By way of example only, and with reference to ,  illustrates an exemplary user interface  for user access to manage messages. The exemplary user interface  includes a set of sent messages . Such messages can be organized in any fashion such as, for example, by communication method or service provider, by date\/time, by recipient, by subject, etc. Messages may include any number of data, some of which may be displayed initially and some of which may be provided upon selection to view more information (e.g., by selection of a message). For example, as shown in , each message may include a recall option , a recipient indication , a message subject indication , a communication method , a date\/time indication , and\/or the like.","To initiate a message recall, the user may provide such an indication. For example, to recall \u201cMessage 1\u201d directed to \u201cRecipient 1,\u201d the user may select recall option  to initiate a recall of \u201cMessage 1.\u201d To view a \u201cMessage 1,\u201d the user may select, for example, \u201cMessage 1\u201d and thereafter be provided with the message content associated with \u201cMessage 1.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["216","218","216","218"]},"With reference back to , in addition to or in the alternative to an interface, such as an online interface accessible via a website, that can be used to manage messages, a confirmation message can be sent to a user such that the user can initiate a message recall via the confirmation message. A confirmation message refers to a message sent to a user that enables the user to initiate a message recall for a particular message intended for one or more recipients or recipient devices. A confirmation message may include, for example, message content, message date\/time, a recipient(s) for the message, an indication of whether the message was viewed by a recipient(s), etc. A confirmation message may also include a recall option, that if selected by the user, initiates a message recall for the corresponding delivered message. As such, to delete a previously sent message, a user may select a recall option (e.g., a link or hyperlink) to initiate deletion of the message.","Accordingly, the message managing component  may be configured to generate and communicate confirmation messages, receive indications that a recall option has been selected, and thereafter, initiate deletion of the appropriate message. A confirmation message may be generated upon obtaining a sent message. Such confirmation messages can be delivered using any communication method, such as a voice provider, a social network provider, an electronic message provider, an instant message provider, a text message provider, etc. In some embodiments, message confirmations may be communicated using the same communication method utilized by the user to send the initial message intended to be recalled. For instance, if a text message provider is used to send a text message from a user device to a recipient device, a confirmation message may be sent by way of a text message to the user device. In other embodiments, a predetermined communication method may be used to communicate a message confirmation to a user device, such as a default or preferred service provider (e.g., a text message). For instance, if a voice message is sent from a user device to a recipient device, a confirmation message may be sent by way of a text message to the user device. Message confirmations may be communicated to a user automatically (i.e., without user intervention), in accordance with a user selection to receive a message confirmation, in accordance with a user preference, and\/or the like.","As can be appreciated, in embodiments, the message managing component  may access a user-preference data store, such as user preference data store , to reference preferences of the user. A user preference, as used herein, refers to any user preference related to managing messages. By way of example, a user preference may indicate a message type to capture, a service provider(s) for which to capture messages, message data to be included within a confirmation message, a communication method used to send confirmation messages to the user, a type of message to use to send confirmation messages to the user, a services provider(s) for which to send confirmation messages to the user, and\/or the like. Accordingly, upon capturing a message, the message managing component  may reference user preferences stored within the user preference data store  to determine an appropriate action. In some cases, the message managing component  may reference user preferences prior to capturing a message such that a determination can be made as to whether to capture a message and\/or message data.","The message managing component  can initiate message recalls by communicating with an appropriate service provider to delete a message(s). The method used to initiate message recalls may be based on the service provider or the services provided by the service provider. The message managing component  may communicate with the service provider (e.g., a participating provider) using an established API to send a message with an appropriate user identifier, user password, etc. to recall sent messages. The message managing component  may reference account data, for example, from the account data store , and utilize such account data to initiate a message recall. The message managing component  and\/or the service provider may recall messages desired to be deleted.","Alternatively, the message managing component  may utilize an appropriate user identifier, user password, or login component required by the service provider to recall messages sent in association with a user. In such a case, the message managing component  operates as the user logging into the service provider (e.g., a non-participating provider), for example, and deleting a message. The message managing component  may reference account data, for example, from the account data store , and utilize such account data to capture messages.","By way of example only, and with reference to , an exemplary method  for facilitating message recalls using a user interface (e.g., an online user interface such as a website) is provided. In embodiments, exemplary method  can be carried out via a user device or user devices associated with a user. Initially, as indicated at block , a message is communicated from a user device that is directed to one or more recipients via a service provider. Such a message may be an email message, a voice message, a text message, a social network message, or the like. At block , an indication to present messages sent in association with a user is received. In this regard, a user may login to an online user interface and select to view messages sent by the user. The user may utilize the user device used to communicate the message or utilize another user device to login to the online user interface. In some case, simply logging in to the online user interface provides an indication to view messages sent by the user. Subsequently, at block , a set of message identifiers that identify the messages sent in association with the user are presented. In embodiments, the content of the sent messages or any other data related to the sent messages (e.g., a title, a subject, a date\/time, a recipient, etc.) may be displayed. An indication from the user to recall the message communicated from the user device is received. This is indicated at block . A user might provide an indication to recall the message by selecting the message identifier, message data, a recall option (e.g., a selection box or a recall link), etc. As can be appreciated, the message desired to be recalled may have been communicated in connection with any user device associated with the user. Further, an indication to recall any number of messages may be received. A notification is provided to a message recall system to recall the message, as indicated at block . That is, a user device communicates with a message recall system to indicate a user desire to recall a particular message(s).","Turning to , an exemplary method  for facilitating message recalls using a user interface (e.g., an online user interface such as a website) is provided. In embodiments, exemplary method  can be carried out via a message recall system. Initially, as indicated at block , account data for one or more accounts of a user established with one or more service providers is received. Account data may include, for example, a user name and a user password. In embodiments, account data is received for an account with a first service provider and an account with a second service provider that is different from the first service provider. At block , messages sent in association with a user via any of the service providers are obtained. Messages can be sent from any user device being used by the user to a service provider to be delivered to one or more recipients. Such messages are stored, as indicated at block . At block , an indication to manage the messages is received from the user. An indication to manage message may be received in any manner, such as, for example, logging in to an online user interface, providing an indication upon logging in to an online user interface, etc. A set of message identifiers that identify the messages are presented. This is indicated at block . At block , an indication to recall a message or a plurality of related messages is received from the user. The account data is utilized to initiate a recall of the message or the plurality of related messages via the appropriate service provider(s), as indicated at block . In this regard, a username and a user password, for example, can be used to communicate with an appropriate service provider(s) to initiate a recall of a message(s). Although  describes obtaining and storing messages, message data associated with messages can be obtained and stored in addition to or in the alternative to messages.","With reference to , an exemplary method  for facilitating message recalls using confirmation messages is provided. In embodiments, exemplary method  can be carried out via a user device associated with a user. As indicated at block , a message is communicated from a user device that is directed to one or more recipients via a service provider. At block , a confirmation message is received that includes a recall option to recall the message.
