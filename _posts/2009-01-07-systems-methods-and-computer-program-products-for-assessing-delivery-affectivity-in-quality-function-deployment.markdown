{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["In general, embodiments herein disclosed relate to systems, methods, and computer program products for assessing the delivery affectivity in Quality Function Deployment (QFD) product or service planning and, more specifically, scoring the delivery affectivity of each Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attribute and design requirement parameters defined in QFD planning.","All facets of business have come to realize that quality must be designed into a product or service, not inspected into it after design. Thus, quality can be defined as meeting the customer's needs and providing superior value. This focus on satisfying customer needs places an emphasis on techniques such as Quality Function Deployment, commonly referred to as QFD, to assist in understanding the customer needs and planning a product or service that provides for superior value.","QFD is a method used to identify critical customer requirements, commonly referred to as Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attributes and to create a link between the CTQ attributes and design requirement parameters. QFD uses a series of matrices to document information collected, such as CTQ attributes and information developed, such as design requirement parameters and to represent the product or service provider's plan for designing the product or service.","Specifically, QFD employs the following general steps. Top-level product\/service design requirements or technical characteristics are derived from customer needs, i.e., CTQs. Based on the top-level design requirements, product\/service concepts are developed to satisfy these requirements and evaluated for the purpose of selecting the most optimum product\/service concepts. Once optimum product\/service concepts are selected, the product\/service is divided into subcategories that identify sub-product\/sub-service assemblies, processes or the like. In this regard, the top-level design requirements are flowed down to these sub-product\/sub-service assemblies, processes or the like. Lower-level product\/service requirements and specifications, such as assembly, process or component characteristics are derived from the sub-product\/sub-service assemblies, or processes. For critical assemblies, processes or components, further flow down of the lower-level product requirements and specifications may be needed. Once the lower-level product\/service requirements are defined, manufacturing or implementation process steps are determined to meet the lower-level product\/service requirements. Based on the manufacturing or implementation process steps, set-up requirements, process controls and\/or quality controls are determined to assure a successful execution of the product\/service.","QFD, by its very structure and planning approach, requires an initial time investment in the development process to assure that the product or service provider understands and agrees with what needs to be done before initiating design functions. As a result, less time should be spent deciding on designs or in redesign based on the product not being on target.","However, the current QFD approach does not provide for quantifiably assessing the overall design process after the process has been completed and the product, service or the like has been designed. Moreover, the current QFD approach does not provide for determining which initially identified CTQs were delivered as intended and which may require further attention prior to release of the product\/service.","Therefore, a need exists to develop systems, methods, computer program products and the like for quantifiably assessing the affectivity of QFD planning. In this regard, the desired systems, methods, computer program products and the like should provide the product\/service providers the ability to determine how well their new product\/service design delivers against their original CTQs. As a result, the product\/service providers can determine which CTQs require additional attention and, moreover, which high-level and\/or low-level design requirements associated with the CTQs require additional attention. Such systems, methods, computer program products and the like would provide process\/service stakeholders the ability to determine the quality delivered through the CTQs and design requirements and to identify which specific items require further analysis prior to product\/service release or may require further analysis after product\/service release.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Methods, devices, systems and computer program products are described herein that provide for a quantifiable assessment of the delivery effectiveness of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) planning designs. In this regard, present embodiments provide quantifiable metrics that help a key stakeholder, such as a product or service provider, determine the level of success for each design requirement or Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attribute defined in the QFD design process. Thus, based on presently described embodiments, the stakeholder can assess how well the deployment of their product or service met the original defined CTQs and\/or design requirements and which CTQs and which design requirements related to those CTQs should garner further attention to ensure that the CTQ meets its objective. In accordance with presently described embodiments, traceability in terms of quantifiable metrics is provided back to the highest detail level within a QFD design, such as a CTQ level, through each intermediary detail level from the final list of low detail level design requirements. As such, the user of the present embodiments can follow the linkage from the high detail level CTQs to the lowest detail level design requirements and make adjustments as necessary to further improve the quality of the product or service.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method is defined for assessing the effective delivery of Quality Function Deployment design planning. The method includes associating a plurality of first level, typically the lowest level, QFD requirements with one or more second level QFD requirements, receiving an implementation grade for a plurality of first level QFD requirements and determining an implementation score for one or more second level QFD requirements. The determination is based on the implementation scores that are associated with the one or more second level QFD requirements. The method additionally includes storing the implementation scores in memory.","According to an alternate embodiment of the method, receiving the implementation grade may further include receiving the implementation grade for a plurality, and in some embodiments all, of the lowest detail level QFD requirements. In such embodiments, determining the implementation score may further include determining the implementation score for one or more, and in some embodiments all, of the QFD requirements above the lowest detail level. Thus, in certain embodiments, determining an implementation score for each of the QFD requirements above the lowest detail level further defines each of the QFD requirements above the lowest detail level as at least one of QFD design requirements, QFD functional requirements or Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attributes.","Additionally, an optional embodiment of the method defines the implementation grade as an indicator of how effective the first level QFD design requirement has been implemented. In one embodiment, the implementation grade may be a numeric implementation grade that is based on a predetermined numeric grading scale. In another embodiment, the implementation grade may be a categorized implementation grade that is based on a perceived effectiveness of the first level QFD design requirement. In such aspects, the method may include converting the categorized implementation grade to a numeric implementation grade prior to determining the implementation score for the one or more second level QFD requirements.","In one alternate embodiment of the method, determining the implementation score may further include determining a Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) implementation score for one or more CTQ attributes. In such embodiments, the CTQ implementation score determination is based on the implementation scores of first level QFD requirements that are associated with one or more CTQ attributes.","In another alternate embodiment of the method, associating may further comprise associating the plurality of first level QFD requirements with the one or more second level QFD requirements based on QFD relationship matrix scoring values.","In further embodiments of the method, the determination of the implementation score is conducted by averaging the implementation grade of each first level QFD design requirement associated with a second level QFD design requirement to determine the implementation score of the second level QFD design requirement. In addition to averaging the implementation grades, the method may further include weighting the implementation grades of each first level QFD design requirement prior to averaging. In such embodiments, the weighting may account for an importance factor as determined by the QFD design process. In still further alternate embodiments, the determination of the implementation score may be conducted by averaging the implementation grade of lowest detail level QFD requirements associated with a first-higher or next-higher detail level QFD design requirement to determine the implementation score of the first-higher\/next-higher detail level QFD design requirement. This process can occur iteratively until all of the design requirements and CTQ attributes in all of the detail levels have been scored.","In yet another alternate embodiment, the method may include comparing the implementation score to predefined score thresholds. In such aspects, the method may further entail identifying an implementation success category for second level QFD requirements based on the comparison of the implementation scores to the predefined thresholds.","Another embodiment of the present invention is provided for by a device for assessing the effective delivery of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) design planning. The device includes a computing platform having at least one processor and a memory in communication with the processor. The device also includes a QFD implementation scoring module stored in the memory and in communication with the processor. The QFD implementation scoring module is operable to associate a plurality of first level QFD requirements with one or more second level QFD requirements, receive an implementation grade for a plurality of first QFD requirements, determine an implementation score for one or more second QFD requirements based on the implementation grades of first level QFD requirements that are associated with the one or more second level QFD design requirements and store the implementation scores in the memory.","In one embodiment of the device, the QFD implementation scoring module is further operable to receive the implementation grade for a plurality, and in some embodiments all, of lowest detail level QFD requirements. In such embodiments, the QFD implementation scoring module may be further operable to determine the implementation score for one or more, and in some embodiments all, of the QFD requirements above the lowest detail level. In such embodiments, the QFD requirements above the lowest-level may include QFD design requirements, QFD functional requirements and Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attributes.","In other alternate embodiments of the device, the QFD implementation scoring module may be further operable to associate the plurality of first level QFD requirements with the one or more second level QFD requirements based on QFD relationship matrix scoring values.","According to alternate embodiments of the device, the QFD implementation scoring module may further define the implementation grade as an indicator of how effective a first QFD design requirement has been implemented. In other optional embodiments of the device, the QFD implementation scoring module is further operable to receive a numeric implementation grade based on a predetermined numeric grading scale. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the QFD implementation scoring module is further operable to receive a categorized implementation grade based on a perceived effectiveness of the first QFD design requirement. In such aspects, the QFD implementation scoring module may be further operable to convert the categorized implementation grade to a numeric implementation grade prior to determining the implementation score for the one or more second QFD requirements.","In still further embodiments of the device, the QFD implementation scoring module may be further operable to determine a Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) implementation score for one or more CTQ attributes. In such embodiments, the CTQ implementation score determination is based on the implementation grades of first level QFD requirements that are associated with the one or more CTQ attributes.","Additionally, in other embodiments of the device, the QFD implementation scoring module may be further operable to average the implementation grade of each first QFD design requirement associated with a second QFD design requirement to determine the implementation score of the second QFD design requirement. In such aspects, the QFD implementation scoring module may further be operable to weight the implementation grades of each first level QFD requirement prior to averaging the scores to account for an importance factor. As such, the QFD implementation scoring module may be further operable to average the implementation grade of lowest detail level QFD requirements associated with a first-higher or next-higher detail level QFD design requirement to determine the implementation score of the first-higher\/next-higher detail level QFD design requirement. This process can occur iteratively until all of the design requirements and CTQ attributes in all of the detail levels have been scored.","In yet another alternate embodiment of the device, the QFD implementation scoring module may be operable to compare the implementation score to predefined score thresholds. In such embodiments, the QFD implementation score module may be further operable to identify an implementation success category for the second level QFD requirements based on the comparison of the implementation scores to the score thresholds.","Yet another embodiment of the invention is defined by a computer program product. The computer program product includes a computer-readable medium. The medium includes a first set of codes for causing a computer to associate a plurality of first level QFD requirements with one or more second level QFD design requirements and a second set of codes for causing the computer to receive an implementation grade for a plurality of first QFD requirements. The medium additionally includes a third set of codes for causing the computer to determine an implementation score for one or more second QFD requirements. The determination is based on the implementation grades of the first level QFD requirements that are associated with the one or more second level QFD requirements. Additionally, the medium includes a fourth set of codes for causing the computer to store the implementation scores in memory.","In one embodiment of the computer program product, the second set of codes may cause the computer to receive the implementation grade for a plurality, and in some embodiments all, of the lowest detail level QFD requirements. In such embodiments, the third set of codes may cause the computer to determine the implementation score for one or more QFD requirements above the lowest detail level. The determination is based on the implementation grades of the lowest detail level QFD design requirements that are associated with the one or more QFD design requirements above the lowest detail level. In such aspects, the one or more QFD requirements above the lowest detail level may include at least one QFD design requirements, QFD functional requirements or Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attributes.","In certain alternate embodiments of the computer program product the first set of codes may further cause the computer to associate the plurality of first level QFD requirements with one or more second level QFD requirements based on QFD relationship matrix scoring values.","In other optional embodiments of the computer program product, the second set of codes for causing the computer to receive the implementation grade defined as an indicator of how effective a first QFD design requirement has been implemented. Further embodiments of the computer program product may provide for the second set of codes to cause the computer to receive a numeric implementation grade that is based on a predetermined numeric grading scale. In other embodiments, the second set of codes may cause the computer to receive a categorized implementation grade that is based on a perceived effectiveness of the first level QFD requirement. In such embodiments, the second set of codes may further cause the computer to convert the categorized implementation grade to a numeric implementation score prior to determining the implementation score for the one or more second QFD requirements.","In one alternate embodiment of the computer program product, the third set of codes may be configured to cause the computer to determine a Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) implementation score for one or more CTQ attributes. The CTQ implementation score determination is based on the implementation grade of the first level QFD requirements that are associated with the one or more CTQ attributes.","In further embodiments of the computer program product, the third set of codes may cause the computer to average the implementation grade of each first level QFD requirement associated with a second level QFD requirement to determine the implementation score of the second level QFD requirement. In such embodiments, the third set of codes may cause the computer to weight the implementation grades prior to averaging. Likewise, in still further embodiments, the third set of codes may cause the computer to average the implementation grade of lowest detail level QFD requirements associated with a first-higher or next-higher detail level QFD design requirement to determine the implementation score of the first-higher\/next-higher detail level QFD design requirement. This process can occur iteratively until all of the design requirements, functional requirements and CTQ attributes in all of the detail levels have been scored.","In yet another embodiment, the computer program product may include a fifth set of codes for causing the computer to compare the implementation scores to predefined score thresholds. In such embodiments, the fifth set of codes may further cause the computer to identify an implementation success category for second level QFD requirements based on the comparison of the implementation scores to the predefined score thresholds.","Thus, present embodiments herein disclosed provide for a quantifiable assessment of the delivery effectiveness of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) planning designs. In this regard, present embodiments provide quantifiable metrics that help a key stakeholder, such as a product or service provider, determine the level of success for each design requirement or Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attribute defined in the QFD design process. Thus, based on presently described embodiments, the stakeholder can assess how well the deployment of their product or service met the original defined CTQs and\/or design requirements, and which CTQs and which design requirements related to those CTQs should garner further attention to ensure that the CTQ meets its objective.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more embodiments comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more embodiments. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various embodiments may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such embodiments and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more embodiments. It may be evident, however, that such embodiment(s) may be practiced without these specific details. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Various embodiments or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","The steps and\/or actions of a method or algorithm described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium may be coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium.

Additionally, in some embodiments, the events and\/or actions of a method or algorithm may reside as one or any combination or set of codes and\/or instructions on a machine-readable medium and\/or computer-readable medium, which may be incorporated into a computer program product.","In one or more embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored or transmitted as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage medium may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer.

Also, any connection may be termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. \u201cDisk\u201d and \u201cdisc\u201d, as used herein, include compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs usually reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Thus, present embodiments provide for methods, systems and computer program products that provide for a quantifiable assessment of the delivery effectiveness of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) planning designs. In this regard, present embodiments provide quantifiable metrics that help a key stakeholder, such as a product or service provider, determine the level of success for each design requirement or Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) attribute defined in the QFD design process. Thus, based on presently described embodiments, the stakeholder can assess how well the deployment of their product or service met the original defined CTQs and\/or design requirements and which CTQs and which design requirements related to those CTQs should garner further attention to ensure that the CTQ meets its objective.","Referring to , a block diagram is depicted of a computing device  configured to provide Quality Function Deployment (QFD) implementation scoring, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The computing device  includes a computing platform  having at least one processor  and a memory . The memory  of computing device  stored QFD implementation scoring module  that is operable to provide quantifiable scores for QFD requirements. The premise for QFD is discussed in relation to , infra. It should be noted that for the purposes of the claimed invention, QFD requirements may include Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) requirements, functional design requirements and\/or detailed design requirements.","The QFD implementation scoring module  includes QFD implementation scoring logic  operable to determine a QFD requirement implementation score  for QFD requirements based on user-inputted QFD requirement implementation grades  and a QFD association between a graded QFD requirement and a QFD requirement to be scored.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","110","140","110","130","130"]},"Further, computing platform  also includes processor , which may be an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), or other chipset, processor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. Processor  or other processor, such as ASIC, may execute an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer  that interfaces with any resident programs, such as QFD implementation scoring module , QFD design planning module  or the like stored in the memory  of the computing device .","Processor  includes various processing subsystems  embodied in hardware, firmware, software and combinations thereof, that enable the functionality of computing device  and the operability of the computing device on a network. For example, processing subsystems  allow for initiating and maintaining communications, and exchanging data, with other networked devices.","Computing platform  additionally includes communications module  embodied in hardware, firmware, software, and combinations thereof, that enables communications among the various components of the computing device , as well as between the computing device  and a network. Thus, communication module  may include the requisite hardware, firmware, software and\/or combinations thereof for establishing a network communication connection.","As noted in , the QFD implementation scoring module  includes QFD implementation scoring logic  operable to determine a QFD requirement implementation score  for QFD requirements based on user-inputted QFD requirement implementation grades  and a QFD association between a graded QFD requirement and a QFD requirement to be scored.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the QFD implementation module imports or otherwise receives QFD requirement association data  from a QFD design planning module , which may be stored in the memory  of computing device , as shown in , or it may be stored and executed on another computing device. The QFD requirement association data  may be automatically imported from a QFD design planning module  or the association data may be manually entered into the QFD implementation scoring module . The association data  defines which QFD requirements are associated or have a relationship with other QFD requirements.","In accordance with conventional QFD processing relationship\/association scoring is performed at each QFD level, such that relationships\/associations are defined between one level of design requirements and the next lowest level of design requirements. For example, if the highest level of QFD requirements is the CTQ requirements, relationship scoring is conducted between the defined CTQ requirements and the next lower level of requirements, such as defined functional design requirements. In turn, relationship scoring is conducted between the defined functional design requirements and the next lower level requirements, such as defined detailed design requirements. Relationship\/association scoring is used in QFD to assess the strength of the relationship between requirements at adjoining levels. Additionally, the relationship\/association scoring is used in QFD to assess the importance of a requirement and to prioritize the importance of the requirements.","In certain embodiments of the QFD design planning module , relationship\/association scoring may be numeric in nature, such that a score of \u201c9\u201d indicates a strong relationship\/association for the requirements, a score of \u201c3\u201d indicates a moderate relationship\/association and a score of \u201c1\u201d indicates a low relationship\/association. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, \u201cassociation\u201d, in terms of QFD implementation grading, may be any form of relationship\/association defined in the QFD design planning module . For example, in the numeric scoring scale described above, any relationship score equal to or above the minimum score of \u201c1\u201d may constitute an association for the sake of QFD implementation scoring. In other embodiments, an \u201cassociation\u201d, in terms of QFD implementation scoring, may provide for a threshold to be met in the relationship\/association scoring within the QFD design planning module . For example, in the numeric scoring scale provided above, the threshold for QFD implementation association may be any relationship score equal to or above the moderate level score of \u201c3\u201d.","The QFD implementation scoring module  further provides for a user to input implementation grades  for one or more QFD requirements. The implementation grades  are a subjective grade that assesses the overall effectiveness of the QFD requirement at deployment. The implementation grade  may be a numeric grade or some other form of grade, such as an alphabetic grade (i.e., alpha-grade), which may subsequently be converted to a numeric grade in accordance with a predefined scale. In one specific embodiment, in order to provide for a simplified grading of the QFD requirements, the user may provide a grade of \u201cH\u201d for high, \u201cM\u201d for medium and \u201cL\u201d for low to signify that a graded QFD requirement has high effectiveness at deployment, medium effectiveness at deployment or low effectiveness at deployment. As noted, the alpha-grades are subsequently converted to a numeric grade for the purpose of determining QFD requirement scores for other requirements of the QFD.","For example, the module may be configured to receive user-inputted implementation grades  for all of a particular level of QFD requirements. In order for the QFD requirement implementation scores  to be determined for all of the QFD requirements, the module may be configured to receive implementation grades  for all of the QFD design requirement on the lowest design level, i.e., the most detailed design requirement level. In such embodiments, once the implementation grades  of the lowest-leveled QFD design requirements have been inputted, the QFD implementation scoring logic  can systematically determine the QFD requirement implementation scores  for each QFD requirement in each of the higher QFD requirement levels, level-by-level, based on the inputted implementation grades  and the association data .","The QFD implementation scoring module  may additionally include a QFD implementation score comparison logic  operable to compare QFD requirement implementation scores  to QFD implementation score thresholds . The QFD implementation score thresholds  provide for implementation score for any QFD requirement to be classified according to thresholds. For example, in one embodiment, three QFD implementation score thresholds  are defined such that three distinct classifications of implementation scores exist. The three implementation score classifications may correspond to a low implementation score, a medium implementation score and a high implementation score, signifying that the requirement has been scored to indicate a low level of implementation, a medium level of implementation or a high level of implementation.","For the sake of understanding QFD implementation scoring, it is important that the reader have a basic understanding of QFD and the concepts related to a QFD design planning module . Therefore,  are herein presented, which provide for an overview of QFD design planning, in accordance with the prior art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"The planning matrix  is initiated by defining customer requirements , otherwise referred to as Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) requirements. The customer requirements are shown on the left-hand side of the planning matrix  and are identified as CTQ-, CTQ-, CTQ-, CTQ-, CTQ- and CTQ-. The CTQ requirements reflect the desired market segment(s) and address unspoken needs. CTQ requirements may be the output of surveys, customer meetings, focus groups or the like. If the number of identified CTQs is large, the planning matrix  may need to be decomposed into smaller modules\/subsystems to reduce the number of requirements in a matrix.","For each customer requirement, a customer priority is assigned and stated in the planning matrix under the column \u201cImportance of CTQs\u201d . The customer priority may be based on a numeric scale, for example a rating between 1 to 5. Customer priorities may be identified using ranking techniques, paired comparisons or the like. In the illustrated example of , CTQ- has been assigned a priority of 4; CTQ- has been assigned a priority of 5; CTQ- has been assigned a priority of 3; CTQ- has been assigned a priority of 4; CTQ- has been assigned a priority of 5; and CTQ- has been assigned a priority of 3.","Once the CTQs  have been identified a product strategy is developed. The product strategy may be based on prior generation products, competitive products, identification of price points, identification of market segments, warranty, service, reliability, customer complaint problems and the like. Based on the product strategy and CTQs , functional\/design requirements  are defined which respond to customer requirements. Functional\/design requirements  are shown along a top portion of the planning matrix  and are identified as design requirement -A, design requirement -B, design requirement -C, design requirement -D, design requirement -E, design requirement -F, design requirement -G and design requirement -H. Functional\/design requirements are characteristically meaningful, measurable and stated in a way to avoid implying a particular technical solution so as to not constrain the designers.","Once the CTQs  and the functional\/design requirements  have been identified, relationships are developed between the CTQs and the functional\/design requirements. In planning matrix , the relationships are identified in the relationship matrix portion .  illustrates the relationship matrix portion  having relationship identifiers  distributed throughout the relationship matrix portion , which indicate the level of the relationship between the CTQs  and the functional\/design requirements . As indicated in the relationship scoring matrix block , a shaded circle - indicates a strong relationship, a non-shaded circle - indicates a moderate relationship and a triangle - indicates a weak relationship. Each of the indicators is assigned a numeric value for the sake of subsequently calculating other design planning metrics. In the illustrated example of  a strong relationship is assigned a value of 9, a moderate relationship is assigned a value of 3 and a weak relationship is assigned a value of 1. If no relationship exists between a CTQ  and a functional\/design requirement  the corresponding entry in the relationship matrix portion  is left blank.","For purposes of the present invention, according to one embodiment, the threshold for defining an association or relationship for the purpose of implementation scoring is if the CTQ and functional\/design requirement (or functional\/design requirement and functional\/design requirement) are identified as having a relationship. Thus, according to such an embodiment, a weak, moderate or strong relationship would satisfy the association threshold. In other embodiments of the invention, a different threshold may be used to determine if the CTQ and functional\/design requirement (or functional\/design requirement and functional\/design requirement) should be associated. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, implementation scoring may treat all of the relationships the same, for the purpose of determining implementation scores, regardless of the strength of the relationship. In other embodiments of the invention, the strength of the relationship may be used to determine or assign a weighting value to the association.","The importance of the functional\/design requirement is indicated by Importance of Functional\/Design Requirement row . The entry in row  is determined by multiplying the numeric value of the relationship identifier  by the Importance of the CTQ value in column  and adding all of the products together to determine the Importance of Design Requirement value. Once an Importance of Design Requirement value has been determined for all of the functional\/design requirements, it is possible to determine the percentage of importance of each functional\/design requirement as indicated in the Percentage of Importance of Design Requirement row . A ranking of the functional\/design requirements in terms of their importance is provided in Prioritization of Design Requirement row .","In addition to the relationship matrix portion , the planning matrix or House of Quality may include a correlation matrix portion  (otherwise referred to as the roof of the House of Quality). The correlation matrix portion  serves to identify correlations between the functional\/design requirements . In the illustrated example of , correlation identifiers  indicate the correlation between two different functional design\/requirements. As indicated in the relationship scoring matrix block , a plus sign - indicates a synergy of correlation and a minus\/negative sign - indicates a compromise in terms of correlation. Each of the correlation identifiers is assigned a numeric value for the sake of subsequently calculating other design planning metrics. In the illustrated example of , a synergistic correlation is assigned a value of 1 and a compromise correlation is assigned a numeric value of \u22121. It should be noted that for present embodiments of the invention, while correlation scoring data is not typically used in determining an association for the sake of implementation scoring, it is not outside of the inventive concepts herein disclosed that the correlation scoring data be used to determine or otherwise assess association between functional\/design requirements.","Other product\/service planning matrices may include other ratings, scorings or the like (not shown in ). For example, other planning matrices may rely on a difficulty rating for each of the functional\/product requirements that serves to assess the difficulty of implanting the functional\/design requirement.","Referring to , a block diagram is depicted that illustrates a QFD product planning in which multiple product planning matrices\/\u201cHouse of Quality\u201d are implemented to take into account the various levels of CTQ and functional\/design requirements, in accordance with the prior art. The first level product planning matrix  provides for a relationship matrix  between high-level CTQs  and functional requirements . In addition, the first level product planning matrix  includes fields for Importance of CTQs , Prioritization of Functional Requirements  and a correlation matrix . Thus, the relationship matrix  provides association data that is implemented in the implementation scoring of the present invention, specifically, associations between the CTQs  and the Functional Requirements , which also factors in the Importance of CTQs  as a weighting of the CTQs .","The second level product planning matrix  provides for a relationship matrix  between the functional requirements  (as defined in the first level product planning matrix ) and higher level design requirements . In addition, the second level product planning matrix  includes fields for Prioritization of Functional Requirements , Prioritization of Design Requirements  and a correlation matrix . Thus, the relationship matrix  provides association data that is implemented in the implementation scoring of the present invention, specifically, associations between the functional requirements  and the design requirements , which also factors in the Prioritization of Functional Requirements  as a weighting for the Functional Requirements .","The third level product planning matrix  provides for a relationship matrix  between the design requirements  (as defined in the second level product planning matrix ) and lower level detailed design requirements . In addition, the third level product planning matrix  includes fields for Prioritization of Design Requirements , Prioritization of Detailed Design Requirements  and a correlation matrix . Thus, the relationship matrix  provides association data that is implemented in the implementation scoring of the present invention, specifically, associations between the Design Requirements  and the detailed design requirements , which also factors in the Prioritization of Design Requirements  as a weighting for Design Requirements .","While the QFD product planning example illustrated in  depicts three levels of product planning, other QFD product planning schemes may implement more or less product planning matrix depending on the complexity or simplicity of the product or service being designed.","Turning the reader's attention to , the exemplary QFD product planning matrix\/\u201cHouse of Quality\u201d of  are incorporated into a flow diagram, which illustrates a method for QFD implementation scoring, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Once the QFD product planning matrix ,  and  have been completed, at Event , all of the functional and design requirements flowing from the product planning matrix are implemented.","At Event , the QFD parameters, such as the CTQs, the functional requirements, the design requirements and the detailed design requirements are incorporated into the QFD implementation scoring module. In addition, the association data, which associates CTQs, functional requirements, design requirements and\/or detailed design requirements, is imported from the planning matrix or otherwise inputted into the QFD implementation scoring module.","At Event , QFD implementation grades are inputted for the lowest level design requirements, i.e., the most detailed level of design requirements. Based on the inputted implementation grades and the association data, at Event , QFD implementation scores are determined for all other QFD parameters, such as the CTQs, the functional requirements and any design requirements higher than the lowest level design requirements, i.e., the design requirements which were implementation graded.","At Event , based on the determined implementation scores, implementation issues\/concerns are identified. In one embodiment, implementation issues\/concerns may be automatically identified via implementation score thresholds that are compared to the implementation scores. For example, if a given implementation score falls below a predetermined threshold, the QFD parameter corresponding to the implementation score may be deemed low in terms of implementation success and, therefore, worthy of further remedial action.","At Event , necessary adjustments are made to the QFD parameters that have been identified as having implementation issues. In certain embodiments after the necessary adjustments have been made, the QFD implementation scoring module may be re-executed to ensure that the implementation issues previously determined have been adequately resolved.

By providing implementation grades for all of the lowest level design requirements the QFD implementation scoring modules are able to provide scores for all of the remaining (i.e., higher level) requirements in the QFD design planning process, up to and including the CTQs. In other embodiments, in which a user may provide implementation grades for only a portion of the lowest level design requirements, implementation scores may be limited to only those QFD requirements in which all associated lower level requirements have been graded.","It is also noted that while the tree structure  shows multiple occurrences of certain detailed design requirements in the detailed design requirement level , the user need only provide a grade to one occurrence and the grade will then be reflected in the other occurrences.

While conversion of the numeric implementation grades is not required, it may be necessary to scale the numeric implementations grades  accordingly as deemed by the logic used in the determination and\/or any weighting factors applied to the requirements being graded.","Additionally as shown and described in , the tree structure  of  shows multiple occurrences of certain detailed design requirements in the detailed design requirement level  and the user need only provide a numeric grade to one occurrence and the grade will then be reflected in the other occurrences.","Referring to , a tree structure block diagram is depicted in which design requirement level  requirements have determined implementation scores, according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , QFD implementation scores have been determined for the design requirements -A , -C , -D  and -E  based on associations with detailed design requirements and the grade provided to the associated detailed design requirements. In the illustrated example of , the implementation score is determined based on straight averaging of the implementation grades provided to those detailed design requirements associated with the design requirement on the design requirement level . For example, the QFD implementation score for -A  is the sum of the associated detailed design requirements -A , -B  and -C  grades (2+1+0) divided by the number of associated detailed design requirements (3). Thus, the determined QFD implementation score for -A  is one (1). Similarly, in likewise fashion, QFD implementation scores are determined for the other design requirements, -C , -D  and -E  in the design requirement level . In other embodiments of the invention, the QFD implementation scoring determination may take into account weighting factors assigned to the associated QFD requirements, so as to account for the relative importance of each QFD requirement as it applies to the QFD requirement being scored.","In addition, in accordance to one embodiment of the invention, as shown by the shading used in , the user interface of the QFD implementation scoring module  may provide for shading or color coding of the QFD design requirements as they are scored to indicate the score determined. The scoring key  indicates that a score at or below 0.75 may be categorized as low, a score between 0.76 and 1.49 may be categorized as medium and a score at or above 1.50 may be categorized as high. Thus, for example, a predetermined color or shading is provided to a requirement scored as high, another predetermined color or shading is provided to a requirement scored as medium and still another predetermined color or shading is provided to a requirement scored as low. Such color coding allows the user to easily identify QFD requirements and\/or CTQs that are scored as low and, thus, may require further remedial actions prior to releasing the product\/service to the consumer.","Referring to , a tree structure block diagram is depicted in which functional requirement level  requirements have determined implementation scores, according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , QFD implementation scores have been determined for the functional requirements -A  and -B  based on associations with design requirements and\/or detailed design requirements and the grade provided to the associated detailed design requirements or the score determined for the associated design requirements. In the illustrated example of , the implementation score is determined based on straight averaging of the implementation scores determined for those design requirements associated with the functional requirement on the functional requirement level . For example, the QFD implementation score for -A  is the sum of the associated design requirements -A , and -C  scores (1+0.5) divided by the number of associated design requirements (2). Thus, the determined QFD implementation score for -A  is 0.75. Similarly, in likewise fashion, a QFD implementation score is determined for the other functional requirement in tree structure , -B  in the functional requirement level . In other embodiments, as it should be apparent to those skilled in the art, the QFD implementation score for the functional requirements may be determined based on the associations flowing back to the detailed design requirement level  and the implementation grades provided to the associated detailed design requirements.","Referring to  a tree structure block diagram is depicted in which CTQ attribute level  requirement has a determined implementation score, according to an embodiment of the present invention.

In the illustrated example of , the implementation score for the CTQ attribute is determined based on straight averaging of the implementation scores determined for those functional requirements associated with the CTQ attribute. For example, the QFD implementation score for CTQ is the sum of the associated functional requirements -A , and -B  scores (0.75+1.125) divided by the number of associated functional requirements (2). Thus, the determined QFD implementation score for CTQ  is 0.9375. In other embodiments, as it should be apparent to those skilled in the art, the QFD implementation score for the CTQ attribute may be determined based on the associations flowing back to the detailed design requirement level  and the implementation grades provided to the associated detailed design requirements.","Finally, referring to , a flow diagram  is depicted of a method for determining QFD implementation scores, according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Additionally, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the first level QFD requirements are the lowest level or most detailed level of requirements in the design process.","At Event , an implementation grade is received for the plurality of first level QFD requirements. In most instances, the implementation grade is a subjective grade of the relative success of the implementation process implemented by a user or key stakeholder. According to one embodiment, the implementation grade may be an alphabetic identifier that corresponds to a numeric grade or, according to another embodiment, the grade may be a numeric grade. In most embodiments, the number of grading options is kept to a minimum so as to simplify the overall implementation grading process.","At Event , implementation scores are determined for the second level QFD requirements based on the implementation grades for the first level QFD requirements that are associated with the second level QFD requirements. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the QFD implementation score may be determined based on a straight averaging of all of the grades of the first level QFD requirements associated with the second level QFD requirement being scored. In other embodiments, predetermined weighting of the associated first level QFD requirement grades may be implemented to determine a QFD implementation score.","At Event , the determined second level QFD implementation scores are stored in memory. In accordance with optional embodiments, prior to storing the QFD implementation scores in memory, the QFD implementation scores may be compared to predetermined thresholds to determine if a QFD requirement should be identified as having a QFD implementation score that corresponds to a requirement requiring further remedial action prior to rectifying implementation concerns.","Thus, methods, devices, systems and computer program products are described herein that provide for a quantifiable assessment of the delivery effectiveness of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) planning designs.
