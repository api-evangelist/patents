No. 10\/925,336, entitled \u201cClose Combat Butt Stock With Blade For Assault Rifles\u201d, filed Aug. 24, 2004, which, in turn, is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/719,853, \u201cClose Combat Butt Stock With Blade For Assault Rifles\u201d, filed Nov. 21, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,807,763.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to firearms and, more particularly, to bayonets for affixing to firearms.","2. Related Art","When an army unit anticipates a close quarter combat, the command \u201cfix bayonets\u201d may be given. Currently, carrying out this command requires a four-step procedure including the following steps as shown in sequence in .\n\n","It will be noted that each of these steps mandate use of a firing hand. If the enemy surprised and rushed a soldier from a short distance, the soldier may not have sufficient time to either complete all of the steps necessary to fix a bayonet or even to move the firing hand to engage a trigger of the firearm. In such a case, or where the soldier is also out of ammunition, the soldier may be forced into combat using the firearm as a club. Also, it is evident that these steps are not easily accomplished by a soldier who is running or even moving slowly.","It will also be recognized that during fighting with a bayonet, the knuckles of the non-firing hand are not protected by the current configuration of handguards on many firearms.","Previous attempts to develop firearm bayonets are noted. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 1,314,672 describes an automatic bayonet that may be released by trigger action. As illustrated in , a trigger controls extension of a blade via action of a helical spring. It will be noted that this bayonet assembly suffers from the drawback that the trigger may be touched by accident, e.g. during cleaning of the firearm resulting in possible non-combat injuries.","In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 51,690 describes a firearm including a bayonet that is slid between two positions. With particular reference to , the bayonet slides in sockets made beneath the barrel, and is secured or locked in two different positions by means of a bolt passing through the inner end of the bayonet and secured by a spring that is said to press it constantly against the barrel so as to lock the bolt in one or the other of two holes drilled in the barrel. This configuration suffers from the drawback of requiring removal of a hand from supporting the barrel of the gun in order to retract the bolt from one hole and then to push and extend the bayonet from the firearm. Also, there is no protection for the knuckles during use of the bayonet.","Accordingly, to date, no suitable bayonet assembly is available which provides for rapid extension of a bayonet blade while also allowing for adequate control over the firearm during extension of the blade. It is also found that no suitable bayonet assembly is available which provides adequate protection for the knuckles of the non-firing hand during combat with the blade.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a bayonet assembly, for a firearm that includes a knuckleguard, comprises a rail connected to the firearm where the rail comprises a first position detent and a second position detent. The bayonet assembly may also comprise a bayonet that comprises a blade and a slide. The slide may be dimensioned and configured to engage the rail and the slide may comprise a slide catch that is dimensioned and configured to be engageable with the first position detent and the second position detent. In operation, the bayonet may be slid by a hand that is located within the knuckleguard from a remote position, where the slide catch engages the first position detent, to an extended position, where the slide catch engages the second position detent.","In another aspect of the invention, a bayonet assembly for a firearm, that includes a knuckleguard, comprises means for support connected to the firearm that, in turn, comprises a first means for engaging and a second means for engaging. The bayonet assembly also includes means for sliding that may be dimensioned and configured to engage and reciprocate along the support means between the first means for engaging and the second means for engaging. The slide means may comprise a third engaging means that is dimensioned and configured to be selectively engageable with the first engaging means. The second engaging means and the slide means may comprise means for cutting extending from the slide means. In operation, the cutting means may be reciprocated from a remote position to an extended position by hand that is located within the knuckleguard.","One embodiment of the present invention concerns a bayonet assembly for a firearm in which a blade may be rapidly extended without loss of adequate control over the firearm while the blade is being extended. The present embodiment also provides adequate protection for the knuckles of the non-firing hand during combat with the blade.","Referring now to , a firearm  including a bayonet assembly, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, is illustrated generally at . In this embodiment, the firearm  is generally illustrated as an M-16 rifle, although, it will be understood that any suitable firearm may be employed in the making and practicing of the present invention. Generally, the firearm  may comprise a trigger , a butt stock , a pistol grip  that may be gripped by a firing hand of a soldier, a magazine cartridge , a gun sight\/handle , a barrel  and a flash suppressor . In addition, and in accordance with the present embodiment, the firearm is advantageously fitted with a knuckleguard , which will be described in more detail below and which may function to protect a non-firing hand of a soldier.","The bayonet assembly  is best seen in  and may comprise a rail  and a bayonet . The rail  is supported by the firearm  and may be connected, as illustrated, to the barrel  via braces . Referring now also to , the rail  may comprise a metallic substance and include a generally rectangular outer configuration and a generally trapezoidal cross-sectional shape. The rail  may also comprise a first position detent , a second position detent  and a stop . As shown in phantom, the first position detent  and second position detent  may each comprise a pair of resilient arm portions ,  each of which terminate in an angled tooth , . The arm portions ,  may be resiliently mounted by any suitable means such as spot welding to the rail  and the stop  may be fastened to an outer end (not numbered) of the rail .","As shown in , the bayonet  may comprise a slide  and a blade . The slide  may comprise a cavity  that is generally configured to correspond to the generally trapezoidal cross sectional shape of the rail  () and thereby receive the rail therewithin. The slide  may also comprise a pair of support and alignment portions  for engaging the rail  and a pair of pivotable arms . Each of the pivotable arms  may be rotatable, in the direction of arrows , about a pin  that is connected to the slide . Each pivotable arm  may also include a triangular slot  for receiving an angled tooth ,  of the resilient arm portions ,  () and a pair of bosses  (shown in phantom) corresponding in shape to depressions (not shown) on the slide  for locking the pivotable arms  to the slide. Referring now also to , the bayonet assembly further comprises a handle  which may be connected to the slide  by neck portions . Advantageously, the handle  maybe engaged by the non-firing hand of left handed or right handed soldiers and each of the pivotable arms  of the slide  may be pressed by a thumb and a forefinger of a soldier, regardless of whether it is a right hand or a left hand, though a slot  in the firearm , in order to disengaged the slide from one or the other of the first or second position detents ,  and move the bayonet  to an extended () or unextended () position.","The blade  may comprise any suitable metallic substance and shape for cutting and includes sharpened edge  and a hub portion .","As shown in , a soldier  may release the bayonet , as described above, by disengaging the pivotable arms  () from the first position detent  of the rail  () and thereafter extending the bayonet by moving the handle  in the direction of arrow , until the pivotable arms  engage the second position detent . Referring now to , the soldier  has now fixed the bayonet and is ready for combat.","While the present invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the herein disclosed embodiment. Rather, the present invention is intended to cover all of the various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The following detailed description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A through 1D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A through 10C","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
