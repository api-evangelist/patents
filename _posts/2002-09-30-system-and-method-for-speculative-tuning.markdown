{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/121,561, filed Apr. 11, 2002, for \u201cA SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SPECULATIVE TUNING\u201d, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Multimedia receiver systems that employ multiple tuners have become increasingly popular in recent years. Certain types of these receiver systems, such as digital multimedia recorder systems, are capable of digitizing and storing audio and\/or video content on hard drives which are currently between 5 and 100 Gbytes in size. Various types of multimedia recorders are available today including personal video recorders (\u201cPVRs\u201d), from companies such as Tivo\u2122 and Sonicblue,\u2122 which are capable of storing several hours of broadcast television programming; and digital music recorders such as the iPod\u2122 from Apple Computer,\u2122 which is capable of storing hundreds of hours of audio content copied from compact discs (\u201cCDs\u201d) or downloaded from the Internet.","A prior art PVR system for storing digital video and audio content is illustrated in . As illustrated, one or more tuners ,  are configured to lock on to audio\/video signals ,  transmitted at specified carrier frequencies and down-convert the signals to baseband. Demodulators ,  demodulate the baseband signals to extract the underlying digital data. If the audio\/video signal is a cable signal, then the demodulators ,  are typically Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (\u201cQAM\u201d) demodulators. If the audio\/video signal is a satellite signal, then the demodulators ,  are typically Differential Phase Shift Keying (\u201cDPSK\u201d) demodulators.","The demodulated signals are then transmitted to conditional access (\u201cCA\u201d) subsystems ,  which prevent channels\/content from being transmitted on the system which the user does not have the right to receive (e.g., subscription-based content such as HBO or pay-per-view channels). If the CA subsystems ,  allow the user to view a particular channel then multimedia content (i.e., audio and\/or video content) from the channel is transmitted over a system bus  (via bus interface ) to a mass storage device . An MPEG-2 decoder module  coupled to the system bus  decodes\/decompresses the multimedia content before it is rendered on a multimedia rendering device  (e.g., a television).","Prior art PVR systems may also utilize a main memory  for storing instructions and data and a central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d)  for executing the instructions and data. For example, the CPU may provide a graphical user interface displayed on the television, allowing the user to select certain television or audio programs for playback and\/or storage on the mass storage device .","Multi-tuner receiver systems, such as the PVR system illustrated in , may be equipped with two sets of tuners, demodulators and CA subsystems and are therefore capable of concurrently receiving, decoding and, perhaps, storing multimedia content from two independent broadcast channels. In the case of a PVR system, for example, such a configuration is useful for recording one program (e.g., received by the first tuner ), while watching another program (e.g., received by the second tuner ). Frequently, however, when a user is simply browsing through channels, one (or more) of the tuners remains unutilized.","Accordingly, what is needed is a digital multimedia receiver system which takes advantage of at least one unused tuner to improve the speed with which the system tunes to selected channels.","This invention relates generally to the field of multimedia receiver systems. More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus and method for improving the speed at which multimedia receivers tune to selected channels.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the underlying principles of the invention.","Introduction","An advanced digital recorder system (hereinafter \u201cMedia Server\u201d) is described in the co-pending application entitled MULTIMEDIA AND COMPUTING SYSTEM, U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/653,964, filed Sep. 1, 2000, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is incorporated herein by reference. Certain aspects of this system will now be described followed by a detailed description of embodiments of a system for speculative tuning. It should be noted, however, that the underlying principles of the invention may be implemented on virtually any type of multimedia receiver system, including digital multimedia recorder systems, that employ multiple tuners. For example, the speculative tuning techniques described below may be employed on both advanced multimedia recorder systems (e.g., such as a Media Server) and standard PVR systems such as those described above in the background section.","Embodiments of a Media Server","As illustrated in , a digital media server  equipped with a processor and a mass storage device acts as a central repository for decoding, storing and distributing multimedia content and data. More particularly, the digital media server  (or a plurality of digital media servers ) coordinates multimedia content from Internet communication channels  (e.g., DSL, cable Internet), broadcast communication channels  (e.g., digital\/analog cable, satellite), and\/or Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) communication channels  (i.e., standard telephone) to provide a stable, real-time home media network  for a plurality of network devices -.","As illustrated in , one embodiment of a home media server  computing architecture includes a central processing unit  capable of processing data and multimedia content stored in main memory  and a mass storage device  for storing data and multimedia content. In one embodiment, the central processing unit  is a Pentium\u00ae-class processor such as a Pentium III\u00ae operating at a 1 GHz or faster clock frequency. It should be noted, however, that the underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular processor speed or processor type. The main memory  may be a random access memory or any other dynamic storage medium (e.g., SDRAM, DDRAM, RD-RAM, . . . etc). The mass storage device  of one embodiment is capable of storing hundreds, or even thousands of hours of multimedia content (e.g., movies, digital audio, . . . etc) as well as other types of digital data (e.g., computer programs, word processing documents, . . . etc). Devices transmit and receive data to\/from the mass storage device  over a high speed interface such as an enhanced IDE interface with Ultra DMA capabilities or a Small Computer System Interface (\u201cSCSI\u201d). However, various other interfaces may be employed while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.","An application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d)  coordinates communication between the various system components and offloads certain designated processing tasks from the CPU. The ASIC may be custom built based on the requirements of the home media server  or may be built using gate arrays, standard cells or programmable logic devices.","Communication modules - electrically coupled to the home media server  via a system bus , allow the home media server  to communicate over different local and remote communication channels. In one embodiment, the system bus  is a peripheral component interconnect (\u201cPCI\u201d) bus, although various other bus types may be configured within the home media server  (e.g., ISA, EISA, Micro Channel, VL-bus . . . etc).","In the particular embodiment illustrated in , the communication modules - electrically coupled to the system bus  include an RF network module  for communicating over the home media network  (i.e., via a wireless RF channel), a cable TV module  for receiving broadcast cable channels, a cable modem module  for providing Internet access via a cable system (i.e., using the TCP\/IP protocol), a satellite TV module  for receiving satellite broadcasts, and a DSL module  for DSL Internet access. Moreover, a virtually unlimited number of new modules may be added as necessary to support new or existing communication channels\/protocols (as indicated by module ).","Other components within the home media server  architecture include an MPEG-2 decode module  (and\/or other decode modules such as AC3, MPEG-1, . . . etc); an audio module  comprised of a digital-to-analog converter, a Sony-Philips Digital Interconnect Format (\u201cSP-DIF\u201d) interface and a standard telephony interface for providing digital and analog audio and standard telephone service to external audio\/telephony devices; an Ethernet port provided directly the system ASIC  (as indicated by the \u201c100 Base-T Ethernet\u201d designation); a Firewire (IEEE 1394) port ; a Universal Serial Bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) port ; and an infrared port . Various other communication interfaces may be configured in the system, either directly on the primary home media server architecture  (e.g., on the media server  \u201cmotherboard\u201d), or as an add-on module -. Moreover, the communication modules (e.g., -), the CPU  and\/or the memory  may be incorporated within the system ASIC , rather than as separate modules as illustrated in ","Embodiments of the home media server  may also be equipped with a DVD drive, CD player, CD Read-Write drive, recordable DVD drive (as described in greater detail below), and\/or any other type of portable storage medium . In one embodiment, these devices may communicate with the home media server  via an AT Attachment Packet Interface (\u201cATAPI\u201d), although the type of interface used is not pertinent to the underlying principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["110","280","270","280","292","270"]},"A media toolkit  executed within the home media server  provides an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) for the different media server  applications described herein as well as a set of media server  utilities. In one embodiment, a minimum quality of service (\u201cQoS\u201d) is defined within the media toolkit . The media toolkit  may be comprised of several functional layers including a media stream abstraction layer; a media stream resource management layer; a security\/conditional access layer; and a transport\/storage abstraction layer.","In one embodiment, the home media server  is configured with support for the realtime transport protocol (\u201cRTP\u201d) and the realtime streaming protocol (\u201cRTSP\u201d) (see, e.g., RTP\/RTSP module ). Briefly, RTP is an IP protocol which supports real time transmission of voice and video. An RTP packet typically resides on top of a user datagram protocol (\u201cUDP\u201d) and includes timestamping and synchronization information in its header for proper reassembly at the receiving end. RTSP is a well known protocol for streaming multimedia content over a network. It should be noted, however, that various other streaming protocols may be implemented while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention (e.g., Quicktime\u00ae, Windows Media, . . . etc).","RTP and RTSP were designed primarily for PC to PC communication over non-realtime networks. Accordingly, because one embodiment of the home media server  operates over a realtime home media network  and communicates to devices other than PCs, certain optimizations  may be programmed within the RTP\/RTSP component . These include, for example, support for multiple data streams between the home media server  and the various multimedia devices - (e.g., one or more video streams and several audio streams)","Apache HTTP server support , or other suitable HTTP server support such as Microsoft\u00ae Internet Information Server, is also included in one embodiment of the home media server . Apache is an open-source HTTP server software product which may be executed on various modern desktop and server operating systems. Once again, certain media server customizations  may be included within the Apache component , further refining HTTP support for the home media network  environment.","In one embodiment, a plurality of device servers  are executed on the home media server . These devices servers provide application support for each of the media nodes - and other devices - communicating with the home media server  over the home media network . For example, in response to a \u201ctune\u201d command sent from a media node , a tuning device server will cause the home media server to tune to a broadcast channel specified by the tune command. The tuning server may also include conditional access functionality (i.e., only allowing tuning to occur for channels to which the user has access rights).","Although described above as a \u201csoftware\u201d architecture, it should be noted that various elements illustrated in may also be implemented in firmware and\/or hardware while still complying the underlying principles of the invention.","Referring again to , numerous digital and analog devices may be configured to communicate with the home media server  over the home media network  and thus function as multimedia nodes. By way of example, and not limitation, these multimedia nodes include set-top boxes , personal computers , cameras or digital camcorders , printers , notebook computers , automotive audio\/video systems , cell phones or personal digital assistants , standard telephones  (including fax machines), home security systems (not shown); and\/or home climate control systems (not shown).","In one embodiment, complex multimedia and data processing such as tuning to selected channels, recording of specified programs\/music, storing phone numbers and personal data, connecting to remote network sites, etc., is performed at the media server , rather than at the individual network devices -. As such, these devices may be manufactured relatively inexpensively. For example, multimedia nodes - may be equipped with just enough processing power and memory to receive and play back a multimedia signal, with storage and control (e.g., tuning) functions offloaded to the home media server . Similarly, a telephone  may be designed with nothing more than a low power microcontroller coupled to an RF transmitter, with telephony functions and contact data storage provided by the home media server . In addition, because these network devices - do not require as much circuitry, they will be lighter than currently-existing devices, and will consume less power.","In one embodiment, the primary communication medium over which the home media server  and the various devices - communicate is wireless RF (e.g., via network module ), with terrestrial transport connections such as Ethernet reserved for devices which are not within RF transmission range. Moreover, certain devices which require a substantial amount of home media network  bandwidth (e.g., high definition television ), and\/or devices which are in close proximity to the media server  may be configured to communicate over terrestrial transports, depending on the requirements of the particular configuration.","One Embodiment of a Multimedia Node Architecture","Distributed multimedia nodes  and  illustrated in provide an interface to the home media network  for audio systems  (e.g., audio amplifiers and speakers) and\/or video systems  (e.g., standard television sets, wide screen television sets, high definition television (\u201cHDTV\u201d) sets, or any other device capable of displaying video).","As illustrated in , one particular embodiment of a multimedia node architecture (see, e.g., node  in ), is comprised of a network interface  coupled to the multimedia node bus  (e.g., a PCI bus); a system ASIC , including MPEG-2 decode\/graphics logic  (or other multimedia decode logic); a central processing unit  and memory ; an audio processing unit ; and\/or an infrared port .","The local central processing unit  and memory  execute programs and process data locally (i.e., at the multimedia nodes , ). The network interface , which may be an RF interface or a terrestrial interface (e.g., Ethernet), receives\/transmits multimedia content and control data from\/to the home media server  over the home media network . The system ASIC  decodes and processes incoming multimedia content transmitted from the home media server  via MPEG-2 decode\/graphics logic  (or other multimedia compression standard) to produce one or more video outputs  (e.g., an NTSC output, an HDTV output, . . . etc). In one embodiment, a separate audio processing unit  produces both digital and analog audio outputs,  and , respectively. Moreover, one embodiment also includes a local mass storage device (not shown) for storing certain multimedia content and\/or data (e.g., frequently-requested content\/data).","In one embodiment, the local infrared interface  receives control commands from a remote control unit (e.g., unit  in ) operated by a user. As described below with reference to , control data\/commands received through the infrared interface  may subsequently be transmitted to the home media server  for processing. For example, in one embodiment, if a user selects a command to change to a live broadcast channel (e.g., the evening news), the command is transmitted from multimedia node  to a home media server   tuning application, which forwards the command to a video module (e.g., CATV module , satellite TV module ). The tuner in the video module (see, e.g., tuner  in ) then tunes to the requested frequency and the new video signal is streamed from the home media server  to the multimedia node . Alternatively, or in addition, if the requested content was previously stored on the home media server  (e.g., on mass storage device ), then no broadcast tuning is necessary\u2014the content is simply read from the storage device  and transmitted to the multimedia node . Accordingly, as described in greater detail below, the amount of audio\/video content which must be broadcast to the home media server  (i.e., over dedicated broadcast channels) is significantly reduced.","One embodiment of a multimedia node  software architecture is illustrated in . Various hardware architectures  may be used to support the software architecture, including the architecture illustrated in . An operating system  executed on hardware  (e.g., Windows '98, Linux, . . . etc) includes client customizations for optimizing communication over the home media network  (e.g., providing low level support for real time streaming of audio and video).","A standard set of user interface components  included in one embodiment may be employed (e.g., by application developers) to generate unique interactive interfaces at each of the media nodes , . For example, a user-navigable tuning index may be included which lists available content by dates\/times and allows users to graphically select a particular broadcast channel and\/or stored content from the mass storage device .","In addition, support for the hypertext markup language (\u201cHTML\u201d) and\/or the extensible markup language (\u201cXML\u201d) are included in one multimedia node  embodiment, allowing users to download, view and modify various types of Internet content (e.g., Web pages).","Applications executed on multimedia nodes ,  may include client-specific applications  and\/or home media server  control applications . Two examples of media server control application  will now be described with reference to . It should be noted, however, that these examples are for the purpose of illustration only and should not be read to limit the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["192","601","192","110","190","602","110","271","260","271","1010","1030"]},"If the user has access rights, then the tuner server module  creates video stream for the specified broadcast channel and feeds the stream to the multimedia node . In one embodiment, the tuner server module  creates the stream using the RTP\/RTSP protocol (i.e., by communicating with the RTP\/RTSP module ). The media node receives the stream through the local TV tuning application  and decodes the stream using a codec embedded within the media toolkit  (various additional encoding features of the system are set forth below). Once decoded, the video image is generated on the video display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["191","191","603","191","110","604","110","606","260","230","604","191","252","251","191","601","260"]},"Network Operations Center","In one embodiment, a network operation center (\u201cNOC\u201d)  illustrated in provides data and multimedia services for the home media server . The NOC may be comprised of one or more servers communicating with the home media server  over the Internet  (or other network). In one embodiment, the NOC performs one or more of the following functions:","Remote Monitoring and Maintenance. The NOC  monitors the home media server to ensure that it is operating within normal parameters. In one embodiment, the home media server  periodically transmits a status update to the NOC , indicating whether any particular services are required and\/or whether any problems have arisen. If the home media server  fails to transmit a status update after a predetermined period of time, the NOC  may take steps to determine the cause of the problem and\/or take steps to contact the user. For example, diagnostic tests may be performed to evaluate the network connection between the home media server  and the NOC . If the diagnostic tests do not provide an answer, then the user may be contacted via telephone to determine the next course of action. In one embodiment the NOC  is staffed by engineers or other technical assistance personnel 24-hours a day.","In one embodiment, the user's home security system and\/or fire system communicates with the home media server  over the home media network . Accordingly, the home media server  may be programmed to relay home security and\/or fire system data to the NOC  on a periodic basis during certain periods of time (e.g., every minute). If a security problem or fire trouble to indication is encountered during this period of time (e.g., a door\/window is opened without the proper security access code), the NOC  may notify a local law enforcement agency and\/or the local fire department.","Automatic Downloading and Upgrades. In one embodiment, the NOC  provides automated software downloading and upgrades to the home media server . For example, when a new software interface\/program (e.g., a new graphical user interface) is developed for the home media server  it may be automatically downloaded from the NOC  and installed. Whether the NOC  should upgrade software on the home media server  automatically may be determined by each individual user. Certain users may opt to manually upgrade all of their software while other users may specify a particular subset of software to be automatically upgraded. For example, a user may specify automatic upgrades for graphical user interface software and manual upgrades for email clients and word processors.","In addition, the NOC  may store up-to-date drivers for various home media network devices -. In one embodiment, when a user purchases a new device, such as a new telephone, the device may automatically identify itself to the home media server  (e.g., via USB, IEEE 1394 or other device identification technology). The home media server  will then determine whether the device is supported by the system and, if so, query the NOC  for the latest driver. In one embodiment, once the driver is identified, it is automatically downloaded from the NOC  and installed on the home media server . Once installed, the driver may be updated automatically as new updates become available. Accordingly, driver software will no longer need to be bundled with home network devices -, resulting an additional cost savings to the end-user. In addition, users will not be required to install and configure device drivers for each new network device they purchase.","In addition, the home media server  may check the NOC  to determine whether the home network device has been certified by the NOC  as meeting some minimum level of quality and\/or performance. In one embodiment, device drivers will be downloaded and installed on the system only if the device has been certified. In this manner, a minimum quality of service may be maintained for all devices employed on the system.","The same type of device identification, certification, and driver installation may be performed for communication modules - such as those described above. Thus, as with home network devices -, certain communication modules - which do not meet a minimum quality of service requirement (e.g., those which perform inefficient bus transactions which tie up the system bus ) will not be certified by the NOC  and will not be permitted to be installed in the home media server .","In addition, in one embodiment the communication modules - are manufactured and certified by third party content providers (e.g., satellite broadcast operators). In this embodiment, the content providers may configure the modules - to work with their own proprietary communication protocols, encryption techniques, and\/or application programs. For example, DirecTV\u2122 may develop a proprietary interface for its users so that when a user selects his DirecTV feed he will be presented with a unique user interface and\/or channel programming environment. Accordingly, while the present invention provides a standard media transport interface for a variety of different communication channels, service providers can still distinguish their services based on the proprietary applications\/transports which they develop.","Logging\/Data Warehousing. In one embodiment, the NOC  may perform logging and data warehousing for the home media server . More specifically, the NOC  may maintain a log of network transactions for each home media server  and subsequently evaluate the log for a variety of reasons (e.g., to troubleshoot system problems, to determine a user's preferences and tailor services and\/or advertising to that user, . . . etc). For example, by monitoring usage patterns, the NOC  may determine that every time a certain Java applet is downloaded, the home media server  crashes. As such, the NOC  may takes steps to ensure that the applet in question is no longer downloaded by the home media server  (e.g., by notifying the user or automatically blocking the applet). The NOC  could then notify the technical support staff to determine the problem with the applet.","Similarly, the usage log may be evaluated to determine the preferences of a user and to provide specialized services to that user based on those preferences. For example, based on the Web sites the user visits and\/or the channels that the user watches, the NOC  may determine that the user is interested in baseball. As such, the NOC  may automatically provide baseball-related content to the user such as, for example, broadcast schedules for upcoming games, a subscription offer to a sports magazine, advertisements, and various other baseball-related content. Similarly, the NOC  may determine that the user watches certain television shows on a regular basis, and may automatically download\/record those shows on the home media server  (e.g., via TCP\/IP), so that they will be readily available for the user (e.g., during non-broadcast periods of time).","Archiving. In one embodiment, users may backup multimedia content and other types of data at the NOC . For example, a user may take a series of pictures with a digital camera and transmit the originals to the NOC  for developing. In one embodiment, the NOC will transmit the pictures to a developer on behalf of the user and will store a backup copy of each of the originals (the NOC  will be backed up regularly to prevent loss of the originals).","In one embodiment, the NOC  will monitor all multimedia content purchased by the user over the Internet. For example, when the user downloads a new compact disk (\u201cCD\u201d) from a music download site, the NOC  will record the transaction in the user's profile. As such, the user does not need to store all of his\/her multimedia content locally on the home media server . Rather, because the NOC  keeps track of all the content to which the user has access rights, the user can offload storage to the NOC  and re-download the content when necessary (e.g., following a hard drive failure on the home media server ).","Registration\/configuration. In one embodiment, users may be required to register with the NOC  upon purchasing a home media server  and related network devices -. The NOC  may prompt each user to respond to a series of question directed to the user's preferences, the type\/level of NOC   services desired by the user, the authorization level of each user in the home media server  household (e.g., children may be provided with limited limited functionality), and any other user-related data which may aid the NOC  in providing user services. In one embodiment, the NOC  will automatically detect the home media server  configuration and store this data in a user database (e.g., to be used for software upgrades, troubleshooting, . . . etc).","Bridge to Satellite\/Cable Operations. In one embodiment, the NOC  will coordinate communication between the home media server  and any satellite\/cable services to which the user has subscribed. For example, the NOC  may forward pay-per-view requests transmitted from the home media server  to the various cable\/satellite operators, and perform the back-end processing (e.g., authentication, billing) required for the pay-per-view transaction. Because a persistent communication channel exists between the NOC  and the home media server  (e.g., through DSL or cable modem), no dial-up processing is required (unlike current pay-per-view cable and satellite systems).","E-commerce Support. In one embodiment, rather than acting merely as a conduit between the home media server  and other e-commerce Internet sites, the NOC  may perform various e-commerce functions itself. For example, the NOC  may market and sell products on behalf of other online retailers (e.g., Amazon.com\u00ae). The NOC  of this embodiment may perform the back-end processing (e.g., billing and record keeping) required for each e-commerce transaction.","Application Support. In one embodiment, the NOC  will provide support for applications executed on the home media server . For example, the NOC  may provide a compact disk database containing CD titles, track information, CD serial numbers, etc. When a user copies his CDs onto the mass storage device  of the home media server , the home media server  may query the database (as described in greater detail below) and download title and track information (or other information) used to identify\/index each CD and each track. In one embodiment, public CD databases (e.g., such as the database maintained at \u201cwww.cddb.com\u201d) may be filtered and improved by the NOC  to remove errors. Various other types of application support may be implemented at the NOC  consistent with the underlying principles of the invention.","Remote-Access Gateway. In one embodiment, the NOC  may be used as a gateway to access to the home media server  from a remote location.","For example, a user from a PC connected to the Internet may log in to his home is media server  through the NOC .","In one embodiment, the home media server  is configured to make outgoing connections only (i.e., to reject direct incoming connections). As described briefly above, the home media server  may poll the NOC  periodically (e.g., every few seconds) and transmit a status update. During this periodic poll the home media server  may query the NOC  to determine whether anyone is attempting to access the home media server  from a remote location. If so, then the NOC  transmits specific information related to the connection attempt to the home media server  (e.g., authentication data such as user ID's, passwords, . . . etc). The home media server  may then initiate a connection with the remote user (e.g., using the remote user's IP address and encryption key).","In one particular embodiment, the NOC  will authenticate the remote user before notifying the home media server  of the connection attempt. For example, upon receipt of a remote connection request, the NOC  may prompt the user to answer a series of questions (e.g., personal questions, questions related to the user's account, . . . etc). If the user does not answer the questions in a satisfactory manner, a member of the NOC staff may contact the user directly (e.g., via standard telephone or IP telephone). Regardless of how authentication takes place, once a remote user is authenticated, the user's data is transmitted to the home media server , which subsequently establishes a connection with the remote user.","Additional Home Media Server Embodiments and Applications","An external illustration of one embodiment of the home media server  is shown in  (from the back and front, respectfully).  shows a home media server  with a plurality of different media modules - installed in its expansion bays (i.e., electrically coupled to its system bus ). As illustrated, in one embodiment, certain standard communication ports such as Ethernet , IEEE 1394 , USB , digital\/analog audio , standard telephone , XGA\/HDTV , and\/or other standard audio\/video ports (e.g., AV output ports  and ) may be installed directly in the primary home media server, rather than as an expansion card.","As illustrated in , one embodiment of the system includes a DVD player  (and\/or a CD player, CD-ReWritable drive, recordable DVD drive or other type of portable digital media player\/recorder). The DVD player  is capable of playing a DVD directly and\/or transferring multimedia content from the DVD to the mass storage device . In one embodiment, as multimedia content is transferred to the storage device , either from the DVD player  or over the Internet , an indexing module executed on the home media server  indexes the multimedia content in a content database (not shown).","Various DVD\/CD identification techniques may be used to identify the particular DVD\/CD inserted and copied to the storage device . For example, a checksum may be calculated for a known unique portion of the DVD\/CD and compared with a CD\/DVD checksum database (e.g., maintained at the NOC  or other server). Similarly, the serial number may be read from the DVD\/CD and compared with a database of DVD\/CD serial numbers. Additional DVD\/CD identification techniques which may be utilized in accordance with the principles of the invention are disclosed in co-pending applications entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SCALING A VIDEO SIGNAL, U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/632,458, filed Aug. 4, 2000 which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is incorporated herein by reference.","In one embodiment of the system, the storage device  (e.g., a hard drive) is preferably large enough to store hundreds of hours of video and\/or audio content, as well as a variety of other digital information such as telephone voice messages, computer programs\/data . . . etc. The current recommended size for the storage device  is at least 80 gigabytes, however the particular size of the storage device is not pertinent to the underlying principles of the invention.","One or more RF transmitters  are also provided in one embodiment of the home media server . The transmitter  (as well as the LAN , if one is installed) allows the home media server  to simultaneously transmit multimedia content and other types of data to the various media devices -, - over the home media network  (e.g., at least one MPEG-2 video stream and several audio streams).","In one embodiment, the wireless transmission system is capable of handling isochronous multimedia traffic reliably (i.e., without jitter) in a wide range of residential settings. For example, the system must be capable of working in the presence of common residential RF interference such as microwave ovens and cell phones. In one embodiment, these requirements are met through the proper choice of modulation and coding. More specifically, one embodiment employs a modified version of IEEE 802.11b adapted to operate in a real time environment (e.g., using Reed-Solomon forward error-correction and antenna diversity with circular polarization).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["110","520","522","522","524","110","522"]},"Data\/commands sent from remote control devices ,  are transmitted through the nodes ,  to the home\/media server  as indicated. In one embodiment, the remote control devices include an LCD (not shown) or other type of display for displaying information about the multimedia content stored on home media server  (i.e., instead of, or in addition to, the multimedia node  display ).","As described briefly above, using the foregoing system, all of a user's data, music and video may be stored in a single location (i.e., home media server ) and accessed from anywhere in the house (e.g., stereo node ) or the car (e.g., via an automotive multimedia node  as indicated in ). Moreover, if the home media server  is connected to the Internet through, for example, a persistent DSL connection , the user can access all of the stored content from various other locations across the globe (e.g., a summer home or a hotel while away on business). One embodiment of the system provides a secure, encrypted data stream when content\/data is requested from the home media server  in this manner, thereby protecting the user's privacy as well as the copyrights to the underlying multimedia content.","If a multimedia node is employed in a user's automobile as described above, when the automobile is parked within range of the media server's RF transmissions, music or other audio\/video content may be transmitted and stored on a storage device within the automobile, even when it is not running. The specific type of audio\/video content to be transmitted at a particular time during the day or week may be variable, based on users' preferences. For example, the home media server  may be configured to transmit up-to-date traffic reports during the morning and evening hours before the user leaves home\/work. The user will then receive an instant traffic report as soon as he starts his car in the morning and\/or evening, followed by music or video selected based on the user's preferences. Various additional aspects of this feature are set forth in the co-pending applications incorporated by reference above.","In an embodiment which includes a CD-ReWritable (\u201cCD-RW\u201d) drive, users can produce custom CDs using the audio content stored on the mass storage device  or downloaded from the Internet. The CD-RW drive may utilize serial copy management techniques to produce CDs which cannot themselves be copied, thereby protecting the copyrights to the underlying works. Moreover, in one embodiment, the system will determine whether the content owner or content creator allows copying of the multimedia content. For example, certain content creators\/owners may allow a copy to be stored on the home media server mass storage device , but may not allow copying to a portable disk (e.g., a CD-RW disk). In one embodiment, content stored on the mass storage device  may be labeled as non-copyable by setting one or more \u201ccopy\u201d bits to a particular value (e.g., in a bit field associated with the content).","In one embodiment of the system, a portable music\/video player node may be configured to retrieve multimedia content directly from the home media server  or via an adapter module. Portable MP3 players such as the Rio\u2122 from Diamond Multimedia\u2122, for example, may be used to store and play back digital audio content transmitted from the home media server in a flash memory module. In one particular embodiment, the CD-RW drive  is capable of accepting the \u2153 inch \u201cmini CD\u201d format. Accordingly, users may produce unique mini CDs (e.g., using tracks stored on the mass storage device ), for playback on MP-3 players capable of playing mini-CDs.","MPEG conversion logic is configured on one embodiment of the home media server  (e.g., in software, hardware or any combination thereof), allowing the home media server  to convert from one MPEG format to another. Using the MPEG conversion logic, video content stored in MPEG-2 format may be converted to MPEG-1 format and recorded on a \u201cvideo CD\u201d (a compact disc format used to hold full-motion MPEG-1 video). As such, users may store video on a portable medium, even on a home media server  which is not equipped with a recordable DVD drive.","In another embodiment of the system, home appliances (e.g., the refrigerator, the toaster, the air conditioner) and other home systems (e.g., security, air conditioning) are all provided with RF transmission devices to communicate with the home media server . Each device may also be configured with it's own internal network address and\/or Internet address. Users may then access information pertaining to these devices and\/or control these devices from any room in the home or over the Internet. In one particular embodiment, the user's automobile is outfitted with an RF transmitter and a network address. Thus, in this embodiment, the automobile is capable of reporting maintenance information to the user via the home media server  (e.g., low brake pads, oil change needed . . . , etc).","In one embodiment, a user may publish a home Web page containing up-to-date information on each home appliance or other network device. Accordingly, users of this embodiment are able to monitor and control home appliances and systems from anywhere in the world. In one embodiment this includes the ability to select broadcast listings and direct the home media server  to make recordings (e.g., based on date\/time or broadcast ID code). In addition, in one embodiment, users may connect remotely to the home media server to review email and\/or voicemail listings (which may be displayed to the user in the form of a single, generic \u201cmessage\u201d box). Voicemail messages may be streamed to the remote user's location over the Internet or other network.","Telephony Embodiments","As illustrated in , in one embodiment, home telephone devices  may also be configured to run through the home media server . In this embodiment, incoming faxes and voicemail are stored on the home media storage device  and may be accessed from any room in the house (e.g. from telephone devices , personal computers , PDAs , and\/or video systems \/). In addition, phone number and address information may be stored in a contact database  on the home media server  and accessed through the various telephone devices  (or other home media devices). Offloading user contact data from the telephone devices  in this manner allows telephone devices  to be manufactured will less memory and less processing power, further decreasing costs to the end user.","As illustrated in , in one embodiment, the home media server  includes a telephone connection module  which coordinates between standard telephony calls placed\/received over the public switched telephone network (\u201cPSTN\u201d)  and calls placed over the Internet  using IP telephony protocols. The telephone connection module  will automatically route incoming calls from both sources to the same set of home telephone devices  (or other home media devices such as the user's personal computer ).","Users may specify whether a particular outgoing call should be placed over the Internet  (e.g., to an IP telephony device ) or over the PSTN  (e.g., to a standard telephone device ). In one embodiment, the telephone connection module  analyzes each outgoing telephone connection request to determine whether the call should be routed through the Internet  or through the PSTN . The telephone connection module  may factor in various types of connection data to make telephone connection determinations. For example, a user may specify certain contacts within the contact database  for which IP telephone connections should be used and certain contacts for which standard telephone connections should be used. In one embodiment, the telephone connection module  will select a particular connection based on whether it is the least expensive option for the user (e.g., for contacts with both IP and standard telephone capabilities). Another variable which may be factored into the selection process is the connection throughput available to the user over the Internet. More specifically, the telephone connection module  may initially test the connection throughput (including the availability of a reliable connection) over the Internet  and place an IP telephony call only if some minimum level of throughout\/reliability is available. Any of the foregoing variables, alone or in combination, may be evaluated by the telephony connection module  to select and appropriate telephone connection.","One embodiment of a protocol architecture for supporting IP telephony and related communication functions on the home media server  is illustrated in . Various telecommunication standards are supported by this embodiment, including the H.248 media gateway control standard (\u201cMEGACO\u201d) standard; the ITU-T H.323 and session initiation protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d) standards for multimedia videoconferencing on packet-switched networks; the Realtime Control Protocol (\u201cRTCP\u201d) standard\u2014a companion protocol to the realtime transport protocol (\u201cRTP\u201d) (described above) used to maintain a minimum QoS; and the ITU T.120standard for realtime data conferencing (sharing data among multiple users).","In addition, various audio and video codecs are supported by the illustrated embodiment, including G.711, G.723, and G.729 (for audio); and H.261 and H.261 (for video). As illustrated, each of these codecs may be executed above RTP, an IP protocol that supports realtime transmission of voice and video. Each of the foregoing IP communication protocols may be utilized by media server  application programs through the programming interfaces of the media toolkit .","It should be noted that, although the embodiment illustrated in includes a specific set of communication protocols, various other communication protocols may be implemented within the home media server  while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention. For example, in one embodiment, new protocol stacks (both proprietary and industry-standard) may be automatically transmitted from the NOC  and installed on the home media server  as they become available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["110","750","1","2","2","110","751","110","752","760","1","2","760","753","754","755","756"]},"Broadcast and Packet-Switched Channel Coordination","In one embodiment illustrated in , content providers  may transmit content to home media server  over Internet channels  as well as standard broadcast channels . The transmitted content may then be cached locally in a content database . When a user subsequently requests the same content to be played back on an audio device or video device  (e.g., via media node ), it will be replayed to the user directly from the local content database rather than over a broadcast channel. In one embodiment, a content selection module  will determine whether to retrieve the content through a broadcast channel or directly from the content database .","In one embodiment, the home media server  and\/or the content provider  will monitor the preferences of each user in the media server  household to determine the content which will be requested during certain times of the day, and\/or days of the week. For example, if a user watches \u201cthe Simpsons\u00ae\u201d at 6:00 PM, the home media server  and\/or content provider  will record this behavior. The content provider  may then transmit the latest Simpsons episode to the home media server  over the Internet  before its scheduled broadcast at 6:00 PM (e.g., during periods of the day or evening when traffic on the Internet  is low). Various other pre-recorded broadcast programs may be transmitted to the home media server  over the Internet rather than over a dedicated broadcast channel, thereby freeing up a substantial amount of inefficiently used broadcast network bandwidth (pre-recorded content currently represents the vast majority of all broadcast content).","As indicated in , this embodiment of the home media server  will provide a seamless mechanism for transitioning from standard digital broadcast channels (e.g., MPEG-2 channels) and analog broadcast channels to packet switched isochronous channels (for live broadcasts) and asynchronous channels (for pre-recorded broadcasts). Initially, the breakdown between broadcast and packet switched channels (e.g., TCP\/IP) will be similar to that illustrated in column , with analog broadcast  taking up approximately half of the available bandwidth, with the other half split between digital broadcast  and packet switched channels . As content providers begin to switch over to a packet-switched transmission scheme, this breakdown will change as indicated at bandwidth allocation , with packet-switched channels taking up approximately half of the available bandwidth and the remainder split between analog broadcast  and digital broadcast .","Finally, when standard analog and digital broadcast channels have been phased out completely, all content will be delivered over packet switched channels as indicated in bandwidth allocation . Many packet switched protocols support both asynchronous and isochronous data transmissions. Accordingly, several isochronous channels may be provided to support live, real time events (e.g., sports events, the evening news, . . . etc) and the remainder of the bandwidth may be allocated to pre-recorded events (e.g., sitcoms, game shown, talk shows, . . . etc). These pre-recorded events\/shown may be asynchronously downloaded to the home media server  at any time of the day or evening (e.g., during periods of low network activity), resulting in a much more efficient allocation of available transmission bandwidth.","Because embodiments of the home media server  described above are capable of receiving, storing and coordinating content transmitted from both packet switched channels (e.g., TCP\/IP) and standard broadcast channels, the transition illustrated in may be accomplished seamlessly, while at the same time improving the overall quality of service to the end user.","In one embodiment, several concurrent, real-time multimedia streams are supported by the home media server  through buffering and\/or disk storage techniques as illustrated in . More specifically, incoming multimedia content - from several different channels (e.g., standard broadcast channels ,  and packet switched channels , ) may be buffered in a set of input buffers - and output buffers - on the home media server . The input buffers and output buffers - and -, respectively, may be portions of memory allocated within the main memory  (see ). Alternatively, or in addition, the input\/output buffers may be configured on the communication modules -, within the system ASIC , and\/or as separate modules on the home media server  motherboard.","In one embodiment, the mass storage device  reads the multimedia data from each of the input buffers - and writes the data to a set of multimedia tracks -. The multimedia data is subsequently read from each of the multimedia tracks - to a set of output buffers -, from which it is transmitted to one or more of the destination multimedia devices , . Buffering data streams on the home media server  in this manner provides significant cost efficiencies for the entire system. Specifically, because the multimedia data is buffered at a single distribution point within the home media network  (i.e., the home media server ), no buffering is required at each of the individual multimedia devices -, thereby significantly reducing the cost and complexity of these devices.","The mass storage device  of this embodiment has enough bandwidth in its read\/write operations to support several multimedia streams at once. Although the seek time of the mass storage device  (i.e., the time required to jump from one track to another) may be relatively low (i.e., relative to its read\/write bandwidth), buffering of the multimedia data in input and output buffers as described ensures that the various streams will be provided to their respective multimedia devices - without interruption.","In one embodiment, each of the multimedia streams - operate independently of one another. For example, if playback of a particular multimedia stream is paused, e.g., from multimedia device , the home media server  will interrupt transmission of multimedia content from the output buffer  associated with that device , and will begin storing subsequent, incoming multimedia content on the mass storage device  (e.g., within the media track ). However, this will not affect playback at any of the other multimedia devices on the network . When playback is resumed, the content will be streamed from the output buffer  (and media track ) from the same point at which is was paused (thereby providing real time, time-shifting functionality for live, real-time broadcasts).","In one embodiment, an indexing module (not shown) will generate a content index for users of the home media server  which will provide users with a comprehensive, seamless listing of multimedia content from the Internet (e.g., streaming media content), broadcast channels (including live and pre-recorded broadcast channels), asynchronous\/isochronous multimedia channels, and\/or various other media sources\/channels. Accordingly, this embodiment will provide users with the ability to navigate through and select content from a virtually unlimited number of different multimedia sources and channels having any knowledge of the underlying protocols and communication infrastructure supporting the sources\/channels.","Intelligent Buffering and Bandwidth Allocation","Virtually all communication channels are bandwidth-limited in some manner, due to the physical limitations of the underlying transmission medium and\/or the signaling limitations of the channel (e.g., the channel's allocated frequency spectrum). For example, a 100 Base-T Ethernet network is capable of providing a total data throughput of 100 Mbps, which is shared by all nodes (e.g., computers) on the network. Similarly, multimedia devices - communicating on the home media network  described above all share some maximum network signaling rate (e.g., if a standard IEEE 802.11 b network is employed the signaling rate is 11 Mbps).","Because bandwidth is shared on these systems, overall network performance may degrade as a result of nodes performing concurrent, high-bandwidth network transactions. This can be particularly problematic on networks such as the home media network  which support real-time multimedia services. More specifically, high quality audio and video signals transmitted from the home media server  to multimedia nodes , , require some minimum level of network bandwidth to be rendered properly (i.e., without distortion or interruption). Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention includes intelligent buffering and bandwidth allocation techniques to ensure smooth playback of the multimedia signal at each of the multimedia nodes , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["902","904","906","191"]},"One embodiment of the home media server , illustrated in , uses this type of bitrate data to allocate bandwidth and buffering levels for multimedia playback. Accordingly, when a user selects audio or video content (e.g., a DVD) to be transmitted to a multimedia node (e.g., video node ), the home media server  initially retrieves a bitrate template  (e.g., a histogram of bitrate data) associated with the requested content from a bitrate database . The database  may be maintained locally on the home media server  and\/or, as illustrated, may be maintained on a remote database server  (e.g., maintained at the NOC ). In either case, the database  may be continually updated as new multimedia content becomes available. Once the bitrate template  is initially downloaded from the remote server , a copy may be stored locally on the home media server  for future reference. In one particular embodiment, the bitrate template  may be transmitted along with the underlying multimedia signal (e.g., embedded within the MPEG-2 stream read from a DVD or broadcast over a cable channel), rather than maintained in a separate database .","If the bitrate template  is maintained in a database , various types of identification data  may be used to identify the correct template for the multimedia content being played including, but not limited to, those set forth in co-pending application entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SCALING A VIDEO SIGNAL, Ser. No. 09\/632,458 (incorporated by reference above). For example, a checksum may be calculated for a known unique portion of the multimedia content and compared with checksums stored in the database . Similarly, if the content is stored on a CD or DVD, the CD\/DVD serial number (or other embedded identification code) may be used to perform a database  query. Various other identification techniques may be used to identify the multimedia content while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention. Once the correct bitrate template  is identified, it is transmitted from the remote server  to the home media server . Alternatively, if the data is stored locally on the home media server , it is retrieved directly from the home media server's storage device .","In one embodiment, an allocation module  running on the home media server  analyzes the bitrate template  to establish an efficient bandwidth allocation and\/or buffering policy for transmitting the multimedia stream(s). The allocation module  acts as a data \u201cthrottle,\u201d increasing or decreasing the data throughput from the home media server  to the multimedia nodes - as necessary to meet the bitrate requirements of each multimedia stream (e.g., through control of the home media server output buffers - and\/or RF transceiver ). The goals of one embodiment of the system are (1) to ensure that the underlying multimedia content is reproduced at the multimedia node  without interruption\/jitter; (2) to minimize the memory requirements at the multimedia node ; (3) to minimize the playback delay experienced by the end user; and\/or (4) to minimize the bandwidth required to accurately reproduce the multimedia content at the node . Any of these goals, alone or in combination, may be factored into the allocation module's 's bandwidth\/buffering allocation policy.","In one embodiment, the allocation module  analyzes the bitrate template  to ensure that the amount of multimedia content in each multimedia node buffer\u2014e.g., buffer  of multimedia node \u2014is sufficient to handle upcoming spikes. For example, given the bitrate template data set forth in , the multimedia node buffer  must have sufficient multimedia data (i.e., an adequate number of bits) to handle the bitrate spike between 3 seconds and 4 seconds (i.e., 6.2 Mbps). As such, by analyzing the bitrate template  as a whole, the allocation module  may increase the allocated data throughput between 1 second and 3 seconds to sufficiently fill the buffer  by the time the bitrate spike arrives (i.e., at 3 seconds). Thus, the number of bits consumed during the spike (6.2 Meg) must be less than or equal to the number of bits in the buffer at start of spike period (3 seconds) minus the bits added to buffer during spike period (i.e., the per-second bitrate). Otherwise, playback of the multimedia stream will stall due to an underrun condition (i.e., a lack of multimedia data at the multimedia node ).","The allocation module  may also factor in bitrate templates  of other multimedia streams when making allocation decisions for a given stream. For example, when making allocation decisions for the DVD stream in (which passes through buffers  and ), the allocation module  may evaluate the bitrate requirements of the other two streams (i.e., the MP3 stream and Cable stream passing through buffers ,  and , , respectively). As such, if one particular stream requires a significant amount of throughput at a given point in time, the allocation module will take anticipatory steps to ensure that sufficient multimedia data will be available. For example, in , the bitrate data illustrated in timeline  indicates a severe bitrate spike between 40 and 60 seconds. The spike is severe enough that in order to properly render the multimedia stream associated with it, the allocation module  may need to fill the multimedia node buffer by the time the spike arrives (i.e., at 40 seconds) and also divert a significant amount of the system bandwidth to the stream to avoid an underrun condition. As such, in anticipation of the spike, the allocation module  may attempt to fill all the buffers on the system including the buffers of the other two streams (associated with the bitrate data shown in timelines  and ) so that by the time the spike arrives, it can divert bandwidth from these streams to the stream with the bitrate spike. It should be noted that the foregoing bandwidth\/buffer allocation example was for the purpose of illustration only and should not be read to limit the scope of the invention.","In one embodiment, the when a new playback stream is requested at a multimedia node , the allocation module  will initially allocate all system bandwidth available at that time to the stream. It will subsequently decrease the bandwidth (i.e., the \u201cthrottle\u201d) only when other multimedia nodes require additional bandwidth and\/or when the buffer at the multimedia node  fills up. Accordingly, one goal of this embodiment is to keep the buffer at the multimedia node  filled to its limit at all times (e.g., so that it will be ready for upcoming spikes).","Playback of the multimedia data from the multimedia node buffer  may start at different times, depending on the histogram data associated with the content. For example, the bitrate for certain high definition television broadcasts or DVDs such as the one illustrated in (which shows bitrate data for the movie \u201cSouth Park\u201d) may start off at a relatively high value (i.e., approximately 8.6 Mbps). As such, it may be necessary to accumulate a certain amount of multimedia data in the multimedia node buffer  before initiating playback. The table  illustrated in shows the amount of data that must be buffered before playback (column ), given a particular multimedia stream bitrate (column ). The table  also indicates the amount of time which a user must wait before playback begins (column ). As indicated in the bottom row of the table , at a bitrate of 9 Mbps, no buffering of the multimedia signal is required. In one embodiment, playback is initiated by the allocation module  (as indicated by the control signal  in ).","In contrast to multimedia stream described by the histogram of , the multimedia stream described by the histogram illustrated in (the DVD for the movie \u201cSpecies 1\u201d) requires significantly less buffering before playback. More particularly, as indicated in table , no pre-playback buffering is required at a bitrate of 5 Mbps. As such, if 5 Mbps or more system bandwidth is available, playback may begin as soon as the stream reaches the multimedia node . In addition, in one embodiment, the allocation module  may initially allocate more bandwidth than required to fill the multimedia node buffer  during playback (e.g., so that more system bandwidth may be allocated elsewhere once the buffer is full).","In one embodiment, when a new playback stream is requested from a multimedia node , the allocation module  may initially allocate just enough system bandwidth to meet some minimum playback delay threshold. Thus, if this minimum delay threshold is set at 4.5 seconds, the allocation module  must allocate at least 7 Mbps to reproduce the multimedia content represented by the histogram of (see Table , 5row). By contrast, to meet the minimum delay threshold for the multimedia content represented by the histogram of , the allocation module  may allocate a bitrate of less than 5 Mbps (see Table ). After the initial bandwidth allocation, the allocation module may use the histogram data to ensure that the amount of multimedia content in the multimedia node buffer  is sufficient to handle upcoming spikes in bitrate (as described above).","Conditional Access and Encryption","One embodiment of a cable broadcast module for receiving one or more broadcast channels is illustrated in . This embodiment includes two tuners ,  for concurrently tuning to two separate broadcast channels (e.g., to be viewed at two separate multimedia nodes on the home media network ). Additional tuners may be included within the cable broadcast module as necessary (i.e., for receiving additional broadcast channels).","In one embodiment of the system, a smartcard  (see also ) inserted into one or more of the media modules - may be programmed with a specific set of access rights defining the particular channels to which users are permitted access. The smartcard  may work in conjunction with a conditional access module , which will prevent certain channels\/content from being transmitted on the system which the user does not have the right to receive. In one embodiment, different members of a family may be assigned smartcards  with different access privileges. For example, children may be assigned smartcards  which limit the channels and\/or Internet sites which they are permitted to access.","In the illustrated embodiment, the signal outputs from each of the tuners ,  are fed into separate audio and video analog-to-digital decoder modules ,  (audio) and ,  (video), respectively. In one embodiment, the signals are then re-encoded with a compression codec. For example, in the embodiment shown in , MPEG-2 encoder modules ,  encode the audio\/video signals into MPEG-2 format (i.e., which may subsequently be decoded by any multimedia devices ,  on the home media network ). It should be noted that various other digital compression codecs may be used (e.g., AC-3, MPEG-1, . . . etc) while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.","In addition, in one embodiment, before being transmitted onto the system bus , the encoded multimedia signals are encrypted by an encryption module  using a unique encryption key . As such, in this embodiment, all multimedia data stored on the home media server  (i.e., on the mass storage device ) and transmitted across the home media network  are encrypted, thereby preventing copying and playback by any unauthorized devices listening in one the network  or on the system bus . Moreover, authorized multimedia devices - (i.e., those certified by the NOC ) communicating on the home media network  are configured with the same unique encryption key , thereby allowing them to properly decode the multimedia data transmitted from the home media server .","In one embodiment, the encryption key  is transmitted securely to the home media server  and media devices - through the conditional access system. Alternatively, or in addition, the key  may be transmitted using conventional secure communication techniques such as Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) or Data Encryption Standard (\u201cDES\u201d).","One embodiment of a satellite module for connecting the home media server  over a satellite channel is illustrated in , including multiple tuners , ; forward error correction modules , ; a smartcard  and associated conditional access module ; and an encryption module  for encrypting content transmitted onto the system bus  (and across the home media network ). The different decoding, encryption, and authentication features described above with respect to the cable broadcast module illustrated in  are also configured into one embodiment of the satellite module.","One embodiment of a cable modem for connecting the home media server  over a cable channel is illustrated in . The cable modem includes a modulator unit , a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (\u201cDOCSIS\u201d) module , and a data pump\/PCI interface unit . Various different types of cable modems may be coupled to the home media server  while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.","In addition to the encryption system described above, one embodiment of the system provides copyright protection through the use of copyright tags associated with content stored on the home media server . The tags of this embodiment identify which types of content\/information may be copied or streamed to which multimedia devices. As illustrated in , tags may be set to a variety of copy\/playback levels, including, for example, a tag  indicating no restrictions on copying for audio file ; a tag  allowing only a single serial copy (e.g., to a CD-RW disk) with no copying to personal computers for audio file ; a tag  permitting playback to local TVs (i.e., within the home media network ) for video file ; and a tag  allowing 24-hour playback to local TVs only (e.g., similar to a pay-per-view feature) for video file . Accordingly, this embodiment provides an additional mechanism for providing secure storage and transmission of copyrightable material. In one particular embodiment, content providers (e.g., cable and satellite providers) are provided with the ability to program tags into their content as necessary.","Speculative Tuning","As described above with respect to the multi-tuner system illustrated in , when a single user is browsing through channels (i.e., and is not recording a program), only a single tuner in the multi-tuner system is utilized. As the user switches from one channel to the next, the tuner must change the carrier frequency at which it receives the multimedia signal and lock on to the new channel at the new carrier frequency. Depending on the type of tuners employed on the system, locking on to the new channel will typically take a perceptible amount of time, potentially frustrating users who \u201cchannel surf\u201d (i.e., browse from one channel to the next to locate a program).","To improve the speed at which the system switches between channels, one embodiment of the invention, illustrated in , employs speculative tuning logic  to speculate as to what the next selected channel will be. Specifically, in response to the user's channel selections  and\/or the user's historical channels selections and preferences , the speculative tuning logic  causes the additional, unused tuners to lock on to the speculated channels even before they have been selected by the user, thereby improving the tuning efficiency of the overall system.","By way of example and not limitation, if tuner  is locked on to a channel currently being viewed by the user via one or more of the multimedia nodes -, the speculative tuning logic  may cause tuners  and  to tune to channels adjacent to the selected channel, in anticipation of the user pressing the \u201cchannel up\u201d or \u201cchannel down\u201d keys on the remote control. Thus, if tuner  is tuned to channel , the channel selection logic  may automatically cause tuners  and  to tune to channels  and , respectively (i.e., if these are valid channels). Subsequently, if the user hits the \u201cchannel up\u201d key, channel , having already been tuned to by tuner , will be readily available for rendering on a display device coupled to one or more of the multimedia nodes - once selected via a channel output selector .","In one embodiment, channel output selector  is an output signal multiplexer which selects a channel tuned to by one of the tuners - based on the user's channel selections . It will be appreciated that the channel output selector  may be implemented in software or any combination of hardware and software while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.","Various additional speculative techniques may be employed by the speculative tuning logic . For example, in one embodiment, when a user manually types in a particular channel number, the speculative tuning logic  will cause one of the spare tuners to tune to that channel, even before the user hits the. \u201center\u201d key on the remote control (most remote controls require entry of channel number followed by an \u201center\u201d command). If the user selects the enter key, the channel will be provided via the channel output selector . Once selected, the speculative tuning logic may then tune the remaining tuners to channels adjacent to the newly-selected channel (as described above).","One embodiment of the invention may be employed in conjunction with a user interface such as an electronic program guide (\u201cEPG\u201d), examples of which are set forth in and\/or . An embodiment of the invention may also be employed in conjunction with a user interface such as that described in commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/097,174, filed Mar. 12, 2002, for \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FOCUSED NAVIGATION WITHIN AN INTERACTIVE TELEVISION USER INTERFACE\u201d, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","A typical \u201cgrid guide\u201d EPG is illustrated in , in which each row represents a particular channel (e.g., such as HBO ) and each column represents a particular block of time (e.g., such as the 12:00-12:30 block ). The programs are represented by a plurality of irregular-shaped cells (e.g., cell ) which may extend across multiple columns, depending on the length of the represented programs. Using a remote control with directional keys (e.g., up, down, left and right), a user may select a particular program by highlighting the cell corresponding to the desired program (e.g., via selection element ) and pressing an enter key.","By contrast, a \u201chierarchical\u201d EPG is illustrated in comprised of first and second menu regions  and , respectively, a graphical information region , and a video display region . In this embodiment, the first menu region  includes menu items higher up the menu hierarchy from the elements listed in the second menu region . As a user moves up and down through the elements in the first menu region , the list of selectable choices in the second menu region  changes accordingly. In the specific example shown in , the first menu region  includes a list of available channels. As the user moves a selection element  up and down through the channels, the schedule for each respective channel is displayed in the second menu region . Although the list of channels in the first region  is ordered alphabetically in , the list of channels may be ordered in a variety of ways including, for example, consecutively while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.","In one embodiment, the speculative tuning logic  monitors the manner in which the user navigates throughout the EPG, and makes speculative tuning choices accordingly. For example, in one embodiment, when the user moves a selection element ,  between programs\/channels or cards, the speculative tuning logic  may cause one of the available tuners to tune to the channel over which the selection element ,  is positioned. Accordingly, if the user selects the highlighted element or card, the channel represented by the highlighted element or card will be immediately available to the television  (or other display device) via the channel output selector . Moreover, if additional tuners are available, the speculative tuning logic  may cause these tuners to tune to channels adjacent to the highlighted channel and\/or adjacent to the current channel.","In one embodiment, the channel over which the selection element  is positioned may be displayed in the video region  of the EPG. In this embodiment, the speculative tuning logic  may also cause tuners to tune to channels adjacent to the channel over which the selection element is positioned (e.g., in addition to causing tuners to tune to channels adjacent to the current channel, if a sufficient number of tuners are available). Alternatively, or in addition, the current program being viewed by the user may be displayed in the video region  as the user navigates through the EPG.","In one embodiment, channels are selected by the speculative tuning logic  based on the remote control functions available to the user when the EPG is displayed. For example, if the \u201cchannel up\u201d and \u201cchannel down\u201d commands still function normally when the EPG is displayed, then the speculative tuning logic  may still reserve one or more tuners for channels adjacent to the current channel (i.e., not necessarily adjacent to the channel which is highlighted on the EPG). If, however, the \u201cchannel up\u201d and \u201cchannel down\u201d controls to not function when the EPG is displayed, then the speculative tuning logic  may reserve one or more tuners for channels adjacent to the channel highlighted on the EPG. Various other channel speculation techniques may be employed while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.","As indicated in , one embodiment of the system will continually monitor and record the user's channel selection history . This information may then be used by the speculative tuning logic  to anticipate channels which the user will select. For example, the user may watch the Simpsons at 6:00 each evening on a regular basis. Accordingly, if the user begins browsing channels at 6:00, one tuner may automatically be allocated to the channel on which the Simpsons is broadcast. Similarly, the user may jump between the three same news programs at a particular time during the day or evening before selecting one to view (e.g., FOX News, CNN, and a local news station). If a sufficient number of tuners are available, the speculative tuning logic  may allocate one tuner to each of the three news programs as soon as the user tunes to any one of the news programs, or at a given time of the day. Various other types of user preference data may be employed to speculatively tune to particular channels.","Embodiments of the present invention include various steps, which have been described above. The steps may be embodied in machine-executable instructions which may be used to cause a general-purpose or special-purpose processor to perform the steps. Alternatively, these steps may be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps, or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.","Elements of the present invention may also be provided as a computer program product which may include a machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions which may be used to program a computer (or other electronic device) to perform a process. The machine-readable medium may include, but is not limited to, floppy diskettes, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnet or optical cards, propagation media or other type of media\/machine-readable medium suitable for storing electronic instructions. For example, the present invention may be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program may be transferred from a remote computer (e.g., a server) to a requesting computer (e.g., a client) by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a communication link (e.g., a modem or network connection).","Throughout the foregoing description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details were set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present system and method. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the system and method may be practiced without some of these specific details. For example, while above description of the speculative tuning embodiments focus on video programming, the underlying principles may be implemented on pure audio programming as well. Additionally, while a large portion of the above description describes the invention in the context of multimedia recorder systems, the underlying principles may be implemented on any device employing multiple tuners. Accordingly, the scope and spirit of the invention should be judged in terms of the claims which follow."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING","p":["A better understanding of the present invention can be obtained from the following detailed description in conjunction with the following drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 9-"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 15and 15"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
