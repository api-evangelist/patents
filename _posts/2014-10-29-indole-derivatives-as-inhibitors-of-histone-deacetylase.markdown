HDAC-mediated deacetylation of chromatin-bound histones regulates the expression of a variety of genes throughout the genome. Importantly, HDACs have been linked to cancer, as well as other health conditions. To date, eleven major HDAC isoforms have been described (HDACs 1-11). HDACs are categorized into two classes. Class I HDACs include HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8 and HDAC11. Class II HDACs include HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9 and HDAC10.

Acetylation of histone proteins occurs on lysine residues near the N-termini of these proteins. In conjunction with other modifications of histone proteins and DNA, the acetylation state of histones determines whether the chromatin is in a condensed, transcriptionally silent state or in a form more accessible to the transcription machinery of the cell. In general, hyperacetylation of histone proteins is associated with transcriptional activation of genes. The steady-state histone acetylation level arises from the opposing action of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes.","Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine \u03b5-amino groups near the N-termini of histones. This reaction promotes the condensation of chromatin, leading to repression of transcription.","HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) modify gene expression positively or negatively in a cell- and gene-specific manner. HDIs increase the accumulation of acetylated histones, directly influencing chromatin structure and, thereby, the relationship of the nucleosome to gene promoter elements.","Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes modulate gene expression through the deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues on histone proteins. They operate in biological systems as part of multiprotein corepressor complexes. Histone deacetylases have been grouped into three classes. Class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) are zinc containing hydrolase enzymes. The division of the proteins into classes I and II is based on protein size, sequence similarity, and organization of the protein domains.","Members of class I are related to the yeast RPD3 gene product. Class I HDACs include: HDAC1 (GenBank Accession Number NP_004955; Wolffe, A. P., 272, 5260, 371-372, 1996); HDAC2 (GenBank Accession Number NP_001518; Furukawa, et al., 73; 1-2, 130-133, 1996); HDAC3 (GenBank Accession Number NP_003874; Yang, et al., 272, 44, 28001-28007, 1997); HDAC8 (GenBank Accession Number NP_060956; Buggy, et al., 350 Pt 1, 199-205, 2000); HDAC11 (GenBank Accession Number NP_079103; Gao, L. et al., 277, 28, 25748-25755, 2002).","HDAC8 is a 377 residue, 42 kDa protein localized to the nucleus of a wide array of tissues, as well as several human tumor cell lines. The wild-type form of full length HDAC8 is described in GenBank Accession Number NP 060956; Buggy, J. J. et al., 350 (Pt 1), 199-205 (2000). The HDAC8 structure was solved with four different hydroxamate inhibitors bound (Somoza et al., 2004, 12, 1325)","Class II are homologues of the yeast HDA1 protein (de Ruijter et. al. 2003, 370(Pt 3), 737-49), and include:","HDAC4 (GenBank Accession Number NP_006028; Wolffe, A. P., 387, 6628, 16-17, 1997); HDAC5 (GenBank Accession Number NP_631944; Nagase, T., et al., 5 (1), 31-39, 1998); HDAC6 (GenBank Accession Number NP_006035; Wolffe, A. P., 387, 6628, 16-17, 1997); HDAC7 (GenBank Accession Number NP_057680; Kao, H. Y., et al., 14 (1), 55-66, 2000); HDAC9 (GenBank Accession Number NP_478056; Sparrow, et al., 18 (18), 5085-5098, 1999); HDAC10 (GenBank Accession Number NP_114408; Kao, H. Y., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277 (1), 187-193, 2002).","Class II HDACs have been further subdivided into classes IIa (HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9) and IIb (HDACs 6 and 10).","The third class of deacetylases consists of the members of the Sir2 family of enzymes. These enzymes have histone deacetylase activity but are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to the class I and class II proteins. They are (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) NAD-dependent and unlike class I HDACs and class II HDACs, they do not contain a catalytic zinc site","In the cell, HDAC proteins are recruited as part of multicomponent repressor complexes. Several HDAC containing complexes have been characterized, including the N-CoR\/SMRT, Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST complexes. Within these complexes, HDACs 1 and 2 typically interact with the mSin3, Mi-2, or CoREST proteins. HDAC3 and the class IIa HDACs have been shown to interact with SMRT and the related N-CoR protein. A large number of transcription factors have been shown to bind to one of the corepressor complexes as a means of regulating transcription. The recruitment of HDACs by DNA-binding proteins allows histone deacetylation to be directed toward specific regions of the chromatin in order to promote targeted transcriptional repression","HDAC proteins are promising therapeutic targets on account of their involvement in regulating genes involved in cell cycle progression and control. Inhibition of HDACs has been shown to upregulate genes, including p21WAF\/CIP1, p, p53, and cyclin E, and to downregulate genes such as cyclin A and cyclin D. Growth inhibition in several lines of cancer cells has been observed upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors, and in vivo studies have shown that some of these inhibitors are efficacious in slowing tumor growth. The biological activity of each of the HDAC isozymes is determined by a combination of the intrinsic activity of the enzyme and the effects of cofactor binding on reactivity and substrate recognition (Schultz et al., 2004, 43, 11083-11091).","Methods for determining HDAC activity in vivo or in vitro are known in the art, as disclosed in, e.g., Kim et al. (2006), 325:273-283.","Non-selective HDAC inhibitors inhibit the deacetylase activity of most, if not all, of the HDACs with equal potency. The mechanisms of the anticancer effects of SAHA, a non-selective HDAC inhibitor, are not completely understood, and likely result from both altered gene expression and altered function of proteins regulating cell proliferation and cell death pathways. Non-selective HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA, can induce the accumulation of acetylated histone proteins and non histone proteins. Non-histone proteins that are acetylated include, but are not limited to:","Bcl-6 (Oncoprotein); LEF\/TCF (Lymphoid enhancer factor); P53 (Tumor suppressor); Ku70 (Autoantigen with multiple function, including DNA repair); H1F-1\u03b1 (angiogenesis); GATA-1 (Transcription factor); WRN (Werner helicase); E2F-1 (Transcription factor); Smad7 (Transcription factor); Rb (Tumor suppressor); TFIIF (Transcription machinery); c-Jun (Transcription factor); \u03b1-Tubulin (Structural protein); HMGI(Y) (Chromatin structure); ACTR (Nuclear receptor coactivator); Androgen Receptor (Signal transduction); EKLF (Erythroid kruppel-like factor); YY-1 (Transcription factor); NF-\u03baB(RelA) (Transcription factor); MyoD (Transcription factor); Importin a7 (Nuclear pore protein); Hsp90 (Chaperone protein); TFIIE (Transcription machinery); b-Catenin (Signaltransduction); TFJB (Transcription factor).","Genes whose transcription is altered by histone deacetylase inhibitors include:","1) Genes that are induced by HDAC inhibitors: Cell cycle (p1 and cyclin E); Proapoptotic (Bak, BAX, CD95, and its ligand gelsolin, GADD45\u03b2, p53, Apaf-1 DFF45a, Bim, BAD, TRAIL, DR5, Fas and its ligand, and Caspase 9, -8 and -3); Redox Components (Thioredoxin-binding protein-1, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin and methallothionein IL); Chromatin structure (Histone H2B); Retinoic acid pathway (RAR\u03b2).","2) Genes that are repressed by HDAC inhibitors: Cell cycle (Cyclin D1 and A, and thymidylate synthase); Antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, c-FLIP, survivin, XIAP); Angiogenic factor (Vascular endothelial growth factor and HIF-Loc); Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-g and IL-1b and -6); Signaltransducer and activator of transcription 5-controlled genes (STATS).","The pharmaceutical industry seeks novel anti-cancer therapies targeting the underlying molecular defects that cause cancer with less toxicity than traditional chemotherapy (Miller et al., 2003, vol. 46, no. 24, 5097-5116). The inappropriate deacetylation of tumour suppressor genes, a molecular defect, may silence these genes, resulting in the progression of cancer. HDAC inhibitors selectively switch on these tumour suppressor genes, something traditional chemotherapy may not do.","HDAC enzymes or isoforms appear to be involved in many different types of cancer. Inhibition of HDACs with HDAC inhibitors results in multiple and desirable anti-cancer effects such as, but not limited to, (i) the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, (ii) the induction of apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells, (iii) cell cycle regulation, (iv) the induction of tumour suppressor genes, and (v) the blocking of tumour angiogenesis (development of new tumour blood vessels). These multiple effects provided by HDAC inhibitors provide a method of treating cancer.","Interest in histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) as targets for pharmaceutical development has centered on the role of HDACs in regulating genes associated with cell-cycle progression and the development and progression of cancer (Kramer et. al. 12, 294-300, (2001)). Several studies have shown that treatment of various cell lines with HDAC inhibitors leads to hyper acetylation of histone proteins and cell-cycle arrest in late Gphase or at the G\/M transition. Genes involved in the cell cycle that have been shown to be up regulated by HDAC inhibitors include p21, p27, p53 and cyclin E. Cyclin A and cyclin D have been reported to be down regulated by HDAC inhibitors. In tumor cell lines, several studies have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors can lead to growth inhibition, growth arrest, terminal differentiation and\/or apoptosis. In vivo studies have demonstrated growth inhibition of tumors and a reduction in tumor metastasis as a result of treatment with HDAC inhibitors.","The clearest link between abnormal HDAC activity and cancer occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this condition, a chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor RAR\u03b1 with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) proteins. Both PML-RAR\u03b1 and PLZF-RAR\u03b1 promote the progression of leukemia by repressing retinoic acid-regulated genes through the abnormal recruitment of SMRT-mSin3-HDAC complex (Lin et. al. 391, 811-814 (1998)); Grignani et al. 391, 815-818 (1998)). Whereas the PML-RAR\u03b1 form of the disease is treatable with retinoic acid, the PLZF-RAR\u03b1 form is resistant to this treatment. For a patient with the retinoic acid-resistant form of the disease, the addition of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate to the dosing regimen led to complete clinical and cytogenic remission (Warrell et al. 90, 1621-1625, (1998)). HDACs have also been associated with Huntington's disease (Steffan, et al., 413:739-744, \u201cHistone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration in \u201d).","In general, almost all of the inhibitors targeting HDACs are broad spectrum compounds, inhibiting all of the HDAC isoforms with equal potency. These broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors cause the induction of differentiation, growth arrest and\/or apoptosis in a large number of tumor cell lines in vitro.","Clinical administration of broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors (pan HDAC inhibitors) has been associated with many dose limiting toxicities. These include thrombocytopenia, and other hematological toxicities, QTc prolongation and other cardiac toxicities, nausea, fever, fatigue, and anorexia (For example, see 2003, 9(10), 3578-35882002, 8(7), 2142-2148; and 2005, 46, Abs 3978). Selective HDAC inhibitors that selectively inhibit only one HDAC isoform, as opposed to a pan-selective inhibitor, is expected to produce a drug with an improved toxicity profile.","Adverse effects in humans have been reported in several clinical trials using pan-HDAC inhibitors (Kelly et al., (2003). \u201cPhase I clinical trial of histone deacetylase inhibitor: suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid administered intravenously.\u201d 9: 3578-3588. Kelly et al. (2005). \u201cPhase I study of an oral histone deacetylase inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, in patients with advanced cancer.\u201d 10: 3923-3931.2003, 2005; Ryan et al., (2005). Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of MS-275, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in patients with advanced and refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.\u201d 10: 3912-3922.2005). Originally designed for oncological applications, such toxicities might not be crucial when taking into consideration their therapeutic effects and the high mortality rate of cancer. HDAC inhibitor compounds with reduced toxicities would be beneficial and could be used in the treatment of diseases or conditions other than cancer.","There is an ongoing need for compositions and therapeutic methods based on inhibition of specific histone deacetylases. Described herein are selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds. Compounds described herein selectively inhibit HDAC8 over other HDAC isoforms (e.g. HDACs 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, and 11).","As described herein, HDAC8 is expressed primarily in delta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas; in small intestinal epithelial cells; and in neuroendocrine cells. Of note, delta cells express and secrete somatostatin, a peptide hormone that inhibits the secretion of insulin and growth hormone. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that HDAC8 activity drives the expression of somatostatin in delta cells. Thus, inhibiting HDAC8 activitity is expected to decrease somatostatin expression and secretion from delta cells, and consequently increase systemic insulin and growth hormone levels.","Described herein are methods for inhibiting somatostatin expression in a subject by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Further, described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from an insulin deficiency or a growth hormone deficiency by administering a selective HDAC8 inhibitor to the subject.","T-Cell Lymphomas or Leukemias","HDAC8 is expressed at unusually high levels in tumor cell lines, e.g., Jurkat, HuT78, K562, PC3, and OVCR-3. In fact, as described herein, inhibiting HDAC8 activity decreases proliferation of T-cell derived tumor cells (e.g., Jurkat cells) by apoptosis. In contrast, HDAC8 inhibition does not affect the proliferation of either non-cancerous cells (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells) or tumor cell lines other than T-cell derived lines. Thus, selective HDAC8 inhibitors are useful for slowing or arresting the progression of T-cell derived cancers with lessened or no toxicity to non-cancerous cells.","Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein were screened against a large panel of tumor cell lines in vitro, and were found to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from T-cell lymphomas or leukemias. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein at low micromolar concentrations inhibits the growth of Jurkat and HuT78 cell lines while doses as high as 20 micromolar have no effect on B cell or myeloid-derived lymphomas or solid tumor lines. Unlike broad spectrum inhibitors, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein do not cause detectable histone or tubulin acetylation, but lead to a dose dependent decrease in HDAC8 protein levels in treated cells. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein activated caspases 3, 8 and 9, showing that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptic pathways were involved; accordingly, apoptosis was blocked completely by pan-caspase inhibitors but only partially by inhibitors of specific caspases. Thus, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein may be of benefit in the treatment of T-cell lymphomas and leukemias.","Described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T-cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Also described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T-cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a population of autologous T-cells that have been exposed to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition ex vivo.","Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds and compositions thereof can be used to treat a subject suffering from a T-cell lymphoma, e.g., a peripheral T-cell lymphoma, a lymphoblastic lymphoma, a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or an adult T-cell lymphoma.","In some embodiments, the T-cell lymphoma treatment method includes administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition.","In other embodiments, the T-cell lymphoma treatment can include administering, in addition to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition, one or more additional anti-cancer agents described herein in any combination.","The methods described herein include administering a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vivo by a therapeutically effective amount. In some embodiments, cells derived from a subject to be treated (i.e. autologous cells) are exposed, ex vivo, to a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vitro.","In one embodiment, T-cells from a donor subject suffering a T-cell lymphoma are cultured and expanded, ex vivo, in the presence of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor at a concentration that is effective for selectively killing transformed T-cells. Afterwards, the expanded T-cell population, free of transformed T-cells, can be introduced into the donor subject. T-cell culture, in vitro expansion, and in vivo transfer is described in, e.g., Porter et al. (2006), 107(4):1325-1331; Rapoport et al. (2005), 1230-1237; Laport et al. (2003), 102(6):2004-2013.","Inhibition of IL-1b Secretion","Pan-HDAC inhibitors have been examined for their application in immunological disorders. Cytokine production is regulated through selective patterns of histone acetylation (Avni et al. 2002, 3, 643). It is known that broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors (e.g. suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), trichostatin (TSA)) decrease LPS-stimulated cytokine production in vitro and in vivo and have anti-inflammatory properties (Leoni et al. 2002, 99, 2995; Mascagni et al., International Patent Publication WO 03\/013493). Nonselective HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA and TSA, have also been shown to antagonize systemic lupus erythematosus in a mouse model (International patent publication WO 02\/55017; Mishra et al., 2003, 111, 539).","Histone deacetylase inhibitors prevent exocytosis of interleukin-1b-containing secretory lysosomes. A functional microtubule network is required for IL-1b secretion and disruption of tubulin is the mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors reduce cytokine secretion (Carta et al. 2006, 1; 108(5):1618-26). Carta et al. examined the effects of pan-HDAC inhibitors (e.g. SAHA, TSA) on IL-1b secretion, and concluded that the effects of the pan-HDAC inhibitors on secretion of IL-1b is acheived by the inhibition cytoplasmic HDAC6. Carta et al. also showed that HDAC inhibitors inhibit the secretion of IL-1b, but do not inhibit the synthesis of its presursor.","As described herein, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein reduce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including but not limited to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b). Thus, HDAC8 is the HDAC enzyme involved in cytokine secretion. The use of selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds provides a method of reducing cytokine secretion with reduced toxicity, due to the selective inhibition of one HDAC isoform (vs. the use of pan-HDAC inhibitors that inhibit all of the HDAC isoforms).","Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit, in a dose dependent fashion, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and\/or ATP stimulated secretion of IL-1b from purified human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as from the monocyte cell line THP-1. In some embodiments, the ECfor inhibition ranges from 0.5 micromolar to 5 micromolar.","The production and secretion of IL-1b is via a non-classical pathway of protein secretion, involving potassium efflux, the autocatalytic processing of procaspase-1, the cleavage by active caspase-1 of the IL-1b precursor, the influx of calcium ions, and the activation of specific phospholipases including PLA-2. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit one or more steps in this secretory pathway.","Selective HDAC8 inhibitors may be used to treat diseases or conditions that are mediated or linked to IL-1b secretion and activity. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds may be used to treat autoimmune diseases or conditions in which IL-1b is contributor to the signs and symptoms of the diseases or conditions (Burger et al., & , Vol. 20, No. 5, pp. 879-896, 2006; Dayer et al., 2001, 13:170-176; Abramson et al., 2002; 41; 972-980). Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds may be used to inhibit IL-1b secretion and thus find utility in the treatment of diseases or conditions that are linked to IL-1b secretion and activity, which include, but are not limited to, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, gout, pseudogout, juvenile arthritis, Still's disease, Ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), hemochromatosis, hepatitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), HIDS (hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome), TRAPS (TNF-alpha receptor associated periodic fever syndrome), inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, recurrent fever, anemia, leukocytosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myalgia; Adult Still's disease, Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Lupus arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS), Blau syndrome, FCAS, MWS, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS); Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS); neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID); chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA); cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS); pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome (PAPA).","Chronic inflammation in patients has been linked to cancer development (Coussens et al., 420, 860-867, 2002). Cancers associated with chronic inflammation include, but are not limited to, lung, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, cervical, bladder, prostate and colorectal cancers. The role of the inflammatory microenvironment as a causative factor in the etiology of cancer is also supported by findings that regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal, breast and gastric cancer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are mediators of chronic inflammatory responses, and have effects on malignant processes.","Pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in carcinogenesis and malignant transformation, tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Persistent expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in or near tumors, exerts a range of effects, including but not limited to, increasing growth and invasiveness of the malignant cells, metastsis, tumorigenesis, to activation of immune-mediated mechanisms, leading to the destruction of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor growth. IL-1b-transfected tumor cells have been reported to fail to induce effective antitumor immune responses. In several human cancers, local IL-1b expression by the malignant cells or the microenvironment has been associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis.","In IL-1b-transfected fibrosarcoma cells, an up-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and TGF\u03b2, genes that are involved in invasiveness, was observed, as opposed to the shut-off of these genes in IL-1\u03b1-transfected fibrosarcomas cells. IL-1b may also enhance the invasiveness of already existing tumor cells by switching on angiogenesis and by the induction of inflammatory molecules, such as MMPs, heparanase, chemokines or integrins on the malignant cells or endothelial cells, leading to tumor dissemination and metastasis. Il-1b induces secretion of growth and invasiveness-promoting factors, e.g. matrix metalloproteinases and angiogenic factors (i.e. VEGF and bFGF and ELR-positive CXC chemokines, i.e. IL-8 and MCP-1). (Apte et al., seminars in , vol. 12, 2002, 277-290).","Secreted IL-1b seems to be involved in tumor growth and invasion. Inhibition of IL-1b secretion, e.g. by using selective HDAC8 compounds, in malignant cells, or in the tumor's microenvironment may provide a method for cancer therapy.","Thus in one embodiment, selective HDAC8 compounds described herein, may be used in cancer therapy. In one embodiment, selective HDAC8 compounds described herein, may be used in the treatment of sarcomas. In another embodiment, selective HDAC8 compounds described herein, may be used in the treatment of sarcomas selected from among alveolar soft part sarcoma, angiosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma, desmoid tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, extraskeletal chondrosarcoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, hemangiosarcoma, kaposi's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, neurofibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, askin's tumor, ewing's, malignant hemangioendothelioma, malignant schwannoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma.","Compounds","Compounds described herein, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxides, pharmaceutically active metabolites, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof, inhibit HDAC8 activity, and may be used to treat patients where inhibition of HDAC8 activity provides benefit.

Compounds","Compounds described herein may possess one or more stereocenters and each center may exist in the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Separation of steroisomers may be performed by chromatography. Alternatively, individual stereoisomers may be obtained by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein, dissociable complexes are also possible (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. The diastereomers can be separated by chiral chromatography, or by separation\/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer(s) is\/are then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, \u201cEnantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions\u201d, John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Stereoisomers may also be obtained by stereoselective synthesis.","In some situations, compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the formulas described herein.","The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides, crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations, compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.","Indole compounds described herein in unoxidized form can be prepared from the corresponding N-oxides indole compounds by treating with a reducing agent, such as, but not limited to, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus tribromide, or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent, such as, but not limited to, acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like at 0 to 80\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the \u201cprodrug\u201d) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.","To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound. (see, for example, Nogrady (1985) , Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), , Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), , Vol. 4, p. 1985; Rooseboom et al., 56:53-102, 2004; Miller et al., . Vol. 46, no. 24, 5097-5116, 2003; Aesop Cho, \u201cRecent Advances in Oral Prodrug Discovery\u201d, 41, 395-407, 2006).","Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.","Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., 269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., 106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et al., 6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard, 37, 87 (1987); J.

Roche, , American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated herein in their entirety.","Sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds described herein can be susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, such as, by way of example only, halogens can reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway.","The compounds described herein may be labeled isotopically (e.g. with a radioisotope) or by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels.","Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulae and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine, such as, for example, H, H, C, C, N, O, O, S, F, Cl, respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.","In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect.","Compounds described herein may be formed as, and\/or used as, pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Protecting groups are used to block some or all of the reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. It is preferred that each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal.","Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, reducing conditions (such as, for example, hydrogenolysis), and\/or oxidative conditions. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.","Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, which include conversion to alkyl esters, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.","Allyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.","Typically blocking\/protecting groups may be selected from:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0227","num":"0331"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"230.89mm","wi":"65.79mm","file":"US09371281-20160621-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Other protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, N.Y., 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","General Synthesis","Indole compounds described herein may be prepared from commercially available materials or they may be prepared by methods known in the art.","In one embodiment, compounds of structure 1 and structure 2 are used as starting materials for the synthesis of compounds described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0231","num":"0335"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"50.72mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09371281-20160621-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"PGrepresents carboxylic acid protecting groups.

Additional embodiments also include a suspending agent and\/or a wetting agent. This bulk blend is uniformly subdivided into unit dosage packaging or multi-dosage packaging units.","In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance with the present disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal agent in a dry mixture, usually composed of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and\/or tartaric acid. When such salts are added to water, the acids and the base react to liberate carbon dioxide gas, thereby causing \u201ceffervescence.\u201d Examples of effervescent salts include, e.g., the following ingredients: sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate, citric acid and\/or tartaric acid. Any acid-base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids, as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.","In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include an indole compound described herein, are solid dispersions. Methods of producing such solid dispersions are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,343,789, 5,340,591, 5,456,923, 5,700,485, 5,723,269, and U.S. Pub. Appl 2004\/0013734. In still other embodiments, the formulations described herein are solid solutions. Solid solutions incorporate a substance together with the active agent and other excipients such that heating the mixture results in dissolution of the drug and the resulting composition is then cooled to provide a solid blend which can be further formulated or directly added to a capsule or compressed into a tablet. Methods of producing such solid solutions are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,151,273, 5,281,420, and 6,083,518.","The pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms including formulations described herein, which include an indole compound described herein, can be further formulated to provide a controlled release of the indole compound. Controlled release refers to the release of the indole compound described herein from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include, for example, sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations.","In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet\/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and\/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule (coated or uncoated) containing pellets, beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition, which are themselves coated or uncoated.","The term \u201cdelayed release\u201d as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating for the methods and compositions described herein to achieve delivery to the lower gastrointestinal tract. In some embodiments such polymers are anionic carboxylic polymers. In other embodiments, the polymers and compatible mixtures thereof, and some of their properties, include, but are not limited to:","Shellac, also called purified lac. This coating dissolves in media of pH >7;","Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers (primarily their solubility in biological fluids) can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series E, L, S, RL, RS and NE (Rohm Pharma) are available as solubilized in organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, NE, and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L, L-30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine;","Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are: ethyl cellulose; reaction mixtures of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) dissolves in pH >6. Aquateric (FMC) is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried CAP psuedolatex with particles <1 \u03bcm. Other components in Aquateric can include pluronics, Tweens, and acetylated monoglycerides. Other suitable cellulose derivatives include: cellulose acetate trimellitate (Eastman); methylcellulose (Pharmacoat, Methocel); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose succinate (HPMCS); and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (e.g., AQOAT (Shin Etsu)). The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, HPMCP such as, HP-50, HP-55, HP-55S, HP-55F grades are suitable. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, suitable grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate include, but are not limited to, AS-LG (LF), which dissolves at pH 5, AS-MG (MF), which dissolves at pH 5.5, and AS-HG (HF), which dissolves at higher pH. These polymers are offered as granules, or as fine powders for aqueous dispersions;","Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate (PVAP). PVAP dissolves in pH >5, and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric fluids.","In some embodiments, the coating can, and usually does, contain a plasticizer and possibly other coating excipients such as colorants, talc, and\/or magnesium stearate, which are well known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10-25% by weight of a plasticizer, especially dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.","Colorants, detackifiers, surfactants, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., carnuba wax or PEG) may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.","In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include an indole compound described herein, are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Pulsatile dosage forms including the formulations described herein, may be administered using a variety of pulsatile formulations known in the art. For example, such formulations include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,692, 5,017,381, 5,229,135, and 5,840,329. Other pulsatile release dosage forms suitable for use with the present formulations include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,871,549, 5,260,068, 5,260,069, 5,508,040, 5,567,441 and 5,837,284. In one embodiment, the controlled release dosage form is pulsatile release solid oral dosage form including at least two groups of particles, (i.e. multiparticulate) each containing the formulation described herein. The first group of particles provides a substantially immediate dose of the indole compound described herein upon ingestion by a mammal. The first group of particles can be either uncoated or include a coating and\/or sealant. The second group of particles includes coated particles, which includes from about 2% to about 75%, preferably from about 2.5% to about 70%, and more preferably from about 40% to about 70%, by weight of the total dose of the indole compound described herein in said formulation, in admixture with one or more binders. The coating includes a pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient in an amount sufficient to provide a delay of from about 2 hours to about 7 hours following ingestion before release of the second dose. Suitable coatings include one or more differentially degradable coatings such as, by way of example only, pH sensitive coatings (enteric coatings) such as acrylic resins (e.g., Eudragit\u00ae EPO, Eudragit\u00ae L30D-55, Eudragit\u00ae FS 30D Eudragit\u00ae L100-55, Eudragit\u00ae L100, Eudragit\u00ae S100, Eudragit\u00ae RD100, Eudragit\u00ae E100, Eudragit\u00ae L12.5, Eudragit\u00ae S12.5, and Eudragit\u00ae NE30D, Eudragit\u00ae NE 40D\u00ae) either alone or blended with cellulose derivatives, e.g., ethylcellulose, or non-enteric coatings having variable thickness to provide differential release of the formulation that includes an indole compound described herein.","Many other types of controlled release systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are suitable for use with the formulations described herein. Examples of such delivery systems include, e.g., polymer-based systems, such as polylactic and polyglycolic acid, plyanhydrides and polycaprolactone; porous matrices, nonpolymer-based systems that are lipids, including sterols, such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids, or neutral fats, such as mono-, di- and triglycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide-based systems; wax coatings, bioerodible dosage forms, compressed tablets using conventional binders and the like.

The concentration of the viscosity enhancing agent will depend upon the agent selected and the viscosity desired.","Examples of sweetening agents suitable for the aqueous suspensions or dispersions described herein include, for example, acacia syrup, acesulfame K, alitame, anise, apple, aspartame, banana, Bavarian cream, berry, black currant, butterscotch, calcium citrate, camphor, caramel, cherry, cherry cream, chocolate, cinnamon, bubble gum, citrus, citrus punch, citrus cream, cotton candy, cocoa, cola, cool cherry, cool citrus, cyclamate, cylamate, dextrose, eucalyptus, eugenol, fructose, fruit punch, ginger, glycyrrhetinate, glycyrrhiza (licorice) syrup, grape, grapefruit, honey, isomalt, lemon, lime, lemon cream, monoammonium glyrrhizinate (MagnaSweet\u00ae), maltol, mannitol, maple, marshmallow, menthol, mint cream, mixed berry, neohesperidine DC, neotame, orange, pear, peach, peppermint, peppermint cream, Prosweet\u00ae Powder, raspberry, root beer, rum, saccharin, safrole, sorbitol, spearmint, spearmint cream, strawberry, strawberry cream, stevia, sucralose, sucrose, sodium saccharin, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, mannitol, talin, sucralose, sorbitol, swiss cream, tagatose, tangerine, thaumatin, tutti fruitti, vanilla, walnut, watermelon, wild cherry, wintergreen, xylitol, or any combination of these flavoring ingredients, e.g., anise-menthol, cherry-anise, cinnamon-orange, cherry-cinnamon, chocolate-mint, honey-lemon, lemon-lime, lemon-mint, menthol-eucalyptus, orange-cream, vanilla-mint, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the aqueous liquid dispersion can comprise a sweetening agent or flavoring agent in a concentration ranging from about 0.001% to about 1.0% the volume of the aqueous dispersion.","In another embodiment, the aqueous liquid dispersion can comprise a sweetening agent or flavoring agent in a concentration ranging from about 0.005% to about 0.5% the volume of the aqueous dispersion. In yet another embodiment, the aqueous liquid dispersion can comprise a sweetening agent or flavoring agent in a concentration ranging from about 0.01% to about 1.0% the volume of the aqueous dispersion.","In addition to the additives listed above, the liquid formulations can also include inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents, and emulsifiers. Exemplary emulsifiers are ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol, 1,3-butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium doccusate, cholesterol, cholesterol esters, taurocholic acid, phosphotidylcholine, oils, such as cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil, and sesame oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, fatty acid esters of sorbitan, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions, spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase can be added just prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self-emulsifying dosage forms are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,401, 6,667,048, and 6,960,563.","It is to be appreciated that there is overlap between the above-listed additives used in the aqueous dispersions or suspensions described herein, since a given additive is often classified differently by different practitioners in the field, or is commonly used for any of several different functions. Thus, the above-listed additives should be taken as merely exemplary, and not limiting, of the types of additives that can be included in formulations described herein. The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, according to the particular properties desired.","Intranasal formulations are known in the art and are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,476,116, 5,116,817 and 6,391,452. Formulations that include an indole compound described herein, which are prepared according to these and other techniques well-known in the art are prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, fluorocarbons, and\/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. See, for example, Ansel, H. C. et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Sixth Ed. (1995). Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are known to those skilled in the preparation of nasal dosage forms and some of these can be found in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, 21st edition, 2005, a standard reference in the field. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters, emulsifiers or dispersing agents, preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agents may also be present. Preferably, the nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.","For administration by inhalation, the indole compounds described herein may be in a form as an aerosol, a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, such as, by way of example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound described herein and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.","Buccal formulations that include indole compounds described herein may be administered using a variety of formulations known in the art. For example, such formulations include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,229,447, 4,596,795, 4,755,386, and 5,739,136. In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period, wherein the delivery of the indole compound is provided essentially throughout. Buccal drug delivery, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, avoids the disadvantages encountered with oral drug administration, e.g., slow absorption, degradation of the active agent by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and\/or first-pass inactivation in the liver. With regard to the bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier, it will be appreciated that virtually any such carrier can be used, so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised, and the carrier is compatible with the indole compound described herein, and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. Generally, the polymeric carrier comprises hydrophilic (water-soluble and water-swellable) polymers that adhere to the wet surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers useful herein include acrylic acid polymers and co, e.g., those known as \u201ccarbomers\u201d (Carbopol\u00ae, which may be obtained from B.F. Goodrich, is one such polymer). Other components may also be incorporated into the buccal dosage forms described herein include, but are not limited to, disintegrants, diluents, binders, lubricants, flavoring, colorants, preservatives, and the like. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in a conventional manner.","Transdermal formulations described herein may be administered using a variety of devices which have been described in the art. For example, such devices include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,598,122, 3,598,123, 3,710,795, 3,731,683, 3,742,951, 3,814,097, 3,921,636, 3,972,995, 3,993,072, 3,993,073, 3,996,934, 4,031,894, 4,060,084, 4,069,307, 4,077,407, 4,201,211, 4,230,105, 4,292,299, 4,292,303, 5,336,168, 5,665,378, 5,837,280, 5,869,090, 6,923,983, 6,929,801 and 6,946,144.","The transdermal dosage forms described herein may incorporate certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are conventional in the art. In one embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein include at least three components: (1) a formulation of an indole compound described herein; (2) a penetration enhancer; and (3) an aqueous adjuvant. In addition, transdermal formulations can include additional components such as, but not limited to, gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like. In some embodiments, the transdermal formulation can further include a woven or non-woven backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein can maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin.","Formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described herein may employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and\/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. Additionally, transdermal patches can provide controlled delivery of the indole compounds described herein. The rate of absorption can be slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely, absorption enhancers can be used to increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier can include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.","Formulations that include an indole compound described herein, suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection may include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles including water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene-glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","For intravenous injections, compounds described herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For other parenteral injections, appropriate formulations may include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically compatible buffers or excipients. Such excipients are generally known in the art.","Parenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and\/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.","In certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be employed, such as, for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments, compositions provided herein can also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), poly(methylmethacrylate), polyacrylamide, polycarbophil, acrylic acid\/butyl acrylate copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran.","In some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered topically and can be formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.","The compounds described herein may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as enemas, rectal gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, suppositories, jelly suppositories, or retention enemas, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. In suppository forms of the compositions, a low-melting wax such as, but not limited to, a mixture of fatty acid glycerides, optionally in combination with cocoa butter is first melted.","Examples of Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens","The compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the inhibition of HDAC8, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that would benefit, at least in part, from inhibition of HDAC8. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one indole compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.","The compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic and\/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective amounts by routine experimentation (including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial).","In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a \u201cprophylactically effective amount or dose.\u201d In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation (e.g., a dose escalation clinical trial). When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.","In the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.","In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a \u201cdrug holiday\u201d). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%.","Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.","The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, preferably 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.","The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.","The daily dosages appropriate for the compounds described herein described herein are from about 0.01 to 2.5 mg\/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered in divided doses, including, but not limited to, up to four times a day or in extended release form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration include from about 1 to 50 mg active ingredient. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.","Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.","Combination Treatments","The compounds and compositions described herein can also be used in combination with other well known therapeutic agents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.","In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein, such as an indole hydroxamic acid compound described herein, is nausea, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.","The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.","It is known to those of skill in the art that therapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.","For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s).","In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a HDAC8 selective compound described herein) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.","It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder or condition from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.","The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval.","In addition, the compounds described herein also may be used in combination with procedures that may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and\/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.","The compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, preferably within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, more preferably within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, and most preferably within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound is preferably administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, preferably about 1 month to about 5 years, and more preferably from about 1 month to about 3 years.","Anti-Cancer Agents","Combinations of selective HDAC8 inhibitors described herein with other anti-cancer or chemotherapeutic agents are described herein. Examples of such agents can be found in by V. T. Devita and S. Hellman (editors), 6edition (Feb. 15, 2001), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to discern which combinations of agents would be useful based on the particular characteristics of the drugs and the cancer involved.","HDAC inhibitors in combination with other anti-cancer agents have been explored. HDAC inhibitors have been reported to be additive or synergistic with a number of anticancer agents, including, but not limited to anthrocyclins, fludarabine, flavopiridol, imatinib, bortezomib, anti-angiogenesis agents and nuclear receptor ligands, such as, all-trans retinoic acid and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Fuino L, et al.

Specific DNA methyltransferase inhibitors include 5-azacytosine and Zebularine\u00ae.","Radiation Therapy","Radiotherapy, also called radiation therapy, is the treatment of cancer and other diseases with ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy that injures or destroys cells in an area being treated (a \u201ctarget tissue\u201d) by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, the latter are better able to repair themselves and function properly. Radiotherapy can be used to treat localized solid tumors, such as cancers of the skin, tongue, larynx, brain, breast, prostate, colon, uterus and\/or cervix. It can also be used to treat leukemia and lymphoma (cancers of the blood-forming cells and lymphatic system, respectively).","A technique for delivering radiation to cancer cells is to place radioactive implants directly in a tumor or body cavity. This is called internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy, interstitial irradiation, and intracavitary irradiation are types of internal radiotherapy.) Using internal radiotherapy, the radiation dose is concentrated in a small area, and the patient stays in the hospital for a few days. Internal radiotherapy is frequently used for cancers of the tongue, uterus, prostate, colon, and cervix.","The term \u201cradiotherapy\u201d or \u201cionizing radiation\u201d include all forms of radiation, including but not limited to \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 radiation and ultra violet light.

These same concentrations are concurrently applied to a separate group of treated cells and evaluated for possible compound-induced cytotoxicity.","Compounds were also examined for effects on inhibition of IL-1b secretion in THP-1 monocyte cell lines. The results show that selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds reduce IL-1b secretion. Thus, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds offer the opportunity for treatment of IL-1b mediated diseases or conditions with reduced toxicity (as compared to pan HDAC inhibitors).","To prepare a parenteral pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration by injection, 100 mg of a water-soluble salt of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor compound described herein is dissolved in DMSO and then mixed with 10 mL of 0.9% sterile saline.
