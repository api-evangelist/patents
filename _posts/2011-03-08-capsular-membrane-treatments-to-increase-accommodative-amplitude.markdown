title: Capsular membrane treatments to increase accommodative amplitude
abstract: Methods and apparatus treat the lens capsule so as to increase accommodation of the eye. The treatment of the lens capsule may comprise treating a portion of the lens capsule so as to stiffen the treated portion and improve accommodation of the eye. The intermediate portion of the lens capsule may located between an optically used central portion of the lens capsule and a peripheral portion of the lens capsule connected to zonules of the eye. The stiffened intermediate portion of the lens capsule can improve coupling of the peripheral portion of the lens capsule to the central portion of the lens capsule, such that an amount of accommodation of the optically used central portion of the lens is increased. As the force of the lens capsule to a lens disposed within the lens capsule is increased, the lens may comprise the natural lens of the eye or an artificial lens such as an accommodative IOL. The treatment of the eye to stiffen the intermediate portion may comprise application of one or more of an energy or a substance to the intermediate portion.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/570,780, filed on Sep. 30, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,518,028 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention relates to accommodation of the eye and treatment of presbyopia.","The eye has a cornea and a lens. The cornea and lens focus light on a retina such that the person can perceive the image with the retina located on the back of the eye. When the image on the retina is focused, the image appears sharp to the patient. However, when the image is out of focus, the image appears blurred. An eyeglass prescription to correct far vision of the eye can be referred to clinically as a refraction of the eye, and the measured refraction of the eye can include a sphere, a cylinder and an axis of the cylinder. Corrective lenses can be prescribed based on the refraction of the eye such that optical errors of the eye such as nearsightedness, also referred to as myopia, and farsightedness, also referred to as hyperopia, can be corrected. Nearsightedness corresponds to an eye having too much optical power such that objects near the eye appear in focus and distant objects appear blurred. With a nearsighted eye, lenses having negative optical power can be used to correct the refractive error of the eye. Farsightedness can refer to an eye not having enough optical power such that positive lenses placed in front of the farsighted eye can correct near vision.","In the normal healthy eye, the lens of the eye can accommodate to both near and far distances of the object viewed such that the image of the object is focused on the retina and remains sharp to the patient. For far vision, the ciliary muscles of the eye can relax and adjust the lens to focus on a far object that may be several meters away. For near vision, the ciliary muscles of the eye can constrict and adjust the lens to focus on a near object. The near object can be located at a distance suitable for reading, for example. The eye can accommodate with movement of the lens to focus on objects at intermediate distances.","With age the accommodation of the eye can decrease such that a person with good distance vision may benefit from lenses to see near objects clearly. The decrease of accommodation of the eye corresponding to presbyopia may be related to a stiffer crystalline lens that decreases the accommodative amplitude of the lens of the eye in at least some instances. People who are near sighted and wear glasses for distance vision may find glasses that correct sight for far vision do not provide near vision correction in at least some instance. This loss of accommodation of the eye can be referred to as presbyopia.","Although many forms of optical correction and devices have been proposed to treat presbyopia, at least some of these approaches have one or more deficiencies such that the prior correction of presbyopia may be less than ideal in at least some instances. Although reading glasses can be effective when worn, in at least some instances a person may not have glasses and need near vision. Also, switching from near vision to far vision with reading glasses can be less than ideal in at least some instances. Although bifocals are available, such corrective lenses may provide less than ideal results in at least some instances such as when a person engages in water sport or sweats such that the correction of the lenses can be at least partially distorted.","Although it has been proposed to reduce the stiffness of the natural crystalline lens through laser treatment allowing for improvement in the ability of the crystalline lens to change power, in at least some instances it is possible to create a premature cataract. Also, treatments of the lens can potentially result in changes in refraction that may require the patient to wear glasses in at least some instances. Further, at least some tissue treatments can be unstable in at least some instances such that the treatment results in no more than a temporary change to the eye in at least some instances. For example, electrocautery of the lens capsule may result in decreased thickness of the lens capsule that may contribute to cataract formation and may be related to unstable refraction of the eye in at least some instances.","Patients who receive intraocular lenses (hereinafter \u201cIOLs\u201d) may have no effective accommodation, and may be considered presbyopic in at least some instances. For example, although IOL surgery to replace a cataract of the natural lens of the eye can be effective in restoring vision of the patient, such patients cannot accommodate effectively in at least some instances.","Although multifocal lenses have been proposed, such lenses can result in undesirable visual phenomenon (hereinafter \u201cdysphotopsia\u201d) in at least some instances. Although multifocal lens may provide a first optical correction for near vision and a second optical power for distance vision, the light rays having the second optical power for near vision may provide visual phenomenon such as halos for a distant object, for example when the patient views a distant object.","One promising approach to treat patients who have received IOLs for cataract surgery has been to introduce an accommodating IOL. However, such IOLs have resulted in less accommodation than would be ideal and can be more difficult to implant in at least some instances. Also, recovery time of accommodating IOLs may be longer than a non-accommodating IOL, in at least some instances. Also, the accommodative abilities may not be restored as would be ideal in at least some instances. Though vision may be improved, the degree of improvement can vary among patients and may be less predictable than would be ideal in at least some instances.","In light of the above, it would be desirable to provide improved methods and apparatus for treating vision that overcome one or more of the above mentioned limitations of the prior approaches. Ideally such methods and apparatus would restore accommodation to provide near and far vision correction with reduced side effects.","Embodiments of the present invention provide treatment of the lens capsule so as to increase accommodation of the eye. The treatment of the lens capsule may comprise treating an intermediate portion of the lens capsule so as to stiffen the treated intermediate portion and improve accommodation of the eye. The intermediate portion of the lens capsule may be located between an optically used central portion of the lens capsule and an elastic peripheral portion of the lens capsule connected to zonules of the eye. The intermediate portion of the lens capsule may comprise an intermediate portion of the anterior lens capsule, or an intermediate portion of the posterior lens capsule, or combinations thereof. The stiffened intermediate portion of the lens capsule can improve coupling of the elastic peripheral portion of the lens capsule to the central portion of the lens capsule or an IOL at least partially within the capsule, such that an amount of accommodation of the optically used central portion of the natural lens or IOL can be increased. The accommodation of the eye can be increased based on an increased curvature of the optically used central portion of the natural lens or IOL, or based on an increased anterior axial movement of the optically used central portion of the natural lens or IOL, or combinations thereof, when the eye accommodates. In many embodiments, the thickness of the treated intermediate portion is maintained substantially, such that the treated intermediate portion substantially resists and decreases radial movement so as to improve coupling and increase radial forces of the peripheral portion of the lens capsule. The stiffened intermediate portion may comprise an annular shape profile such as a ring or annular oval extending substantially continuously around the central portion so as to enclose the central portion, such that radial motion and stretching of the intermediate portion can be decreased substantially. The stiffened intermediate portion comprising the annular shape profile can decrease circumferential stretching of the intermediate portion that may correspond to the radial movement of the intermediate portion, so as to decrease radial movement of the intermediate portion corresponding to the circumferential stretching of the intermediate portion.","The increased amount of accommodation may comprise one or more of an increased radially inward force from the peripheral portion of the lens capsule toward the central portion of the lens capsule, increased anterior movement of the anterior lens capsule, increased movement of the lens anteriorly, increased curvature of the lens, an increased curvature of the central portion of the anterior lens capsule, or a protrusion of the central portion of the anterior lens capsule having the increased curvature, or combinations thereof. As the radially inward force from the lens capsule to a lens disposed at least partially within the lens capsule can be increased, the lens may comprise the natural lens of the eye or an artificial lens such as an accommodating IOL. When used to increase accommodation of the natural lens of the eye, the treatment can be applied to an anterior surface of the anterior lens capsule so as to decrease invasiveness of the procedure and inhibit cataract formation. The treatment of the eye to stiffen the intermediate portion may comprise an agent to stiffen the intermediate portion such as one or more of an energy, a substance to the applied to the intermediate portion, or a support coupled to the intermediate portion. The energy may comprise one or more of electromagnetic energy, RF energy, microwave energy, light energy, UV light energy, visible light energy or infrared light energy to stiffen the portion. The agent may comprise a substance applied to the portion so as to stiffen the portion, for example a stiffening adhesive, a tissue adhesive, or a tissue fixative, or for example riboflavin, or a substance to inhibit nutrients to the portion. The amount of treatment may comprise enough energy or substance so as to stiffen the intermediate portion of the lens capsule without substantially shrinking the intermediate portion, such that far vision of the eye is substantially maintained. The stiffening treatment may be combined with an additional treatment, such as a softening treatment, so as to soften tissue of the lens capsule disposed between the central portion and the stiffened intermediate portion so as to increase accommodation of the central portion.","In a first aspect, embodiments of the present invention provide a method of treating an eye having a lens capsule and a lens, such as a natural lens or an IOL. The lens capsule has a central portion, a peripheral portion and an intermediate portion. The peripheral portion is connected to zonules of the eye. The intermediate portion corresponds to a location between the peripheral portion and the central portion. The intermediate portion of the lens capsule is treated so as to stiffen the intermediate portion of the capsule and increase curvature or movement of at least a portion of the lens when the eye accommodates. The increased curvature can be combined with the increased movement to increase an amount of accommodation of the eye.","The increased curvature of the lens may comprise an increased curvature of a natural lens of the eye or an increased curvature of an IOL, and the increased movement anteriorly may comprise an increased axial movement of the natural lens of the eye or an increased axial movement of the IOL implanted in the eye.","In many embodiments, the increased curvature of the lens may comprise an increased curvature of natural lens of the eye or an increased curvature of an IOL, and the increased movement anteriorly may comprise an increased movement of the natural lens of the eye or an increased movement of the IOL implanted in the eye.","In many embodiments, the intermediate portion is stiffened without shrinking substantially tissue of the intermediate portion such that far vision of the eye is maintained. The intermediate portion can be stiffened such that far vision of the eye is maintained to within about 1 D and the accommodation is increased by at least about 1 D. In many embodiments, the far vision refraction of the eye is maintained to within about 0.5 D, and the accommodation is increased by about 1 D. The intermediate portion of the capsule may be treated so as to maintain the optical clarity and corresponding image quality of the intermediate portion when the intermediate portion is stiffened. Alternatively or in combination, the intermediate portion of the capsule may be treated so as to maintain substantially the thickness and corresponding distance vision of the intermediate portion of the lens capsule when stiffened.","In many embodiments, the capsule comprises an anterior capsule and the intermediate portion comprises an intermediate portion of the anterior capsule. The lens may comprise the natural lens of the eye, and the treatment can be applied to the intermediate portion of the anterior capsule without penetration of the capsule.","In many embodiments, the central portion of the capsule is coupled to the peripheral portion of the capsule with the stiffened intermediate portion such that the central portion is moved forward when the eye accommodates and peripheral portion moves inward. The central portion of the lens capsule may move anteriorly along an axis of the eye a first amount and the intermediate portion may move anteriorly along the axis a second amount, in which the first amount is greater than the second amount such that the curvature of the central portion is increased when the eye accommodates.","In many embodiments, the capsule comprises a posterior capsule and the intermediate portion comprises an intermediate portion of the posterior capsule.","In many embodiments, treating the intermediate portion comprises delivering one or more of an energy or a substance to the intermediate portion. The energy may comprise one or more of thermal energy, mechanical energy, or electromagnetic energy. The electromagnetic energy may comprise RF energy, microwave energy, light energy, UV light energy, visible light energy or infrared light energy. The substance may comprises one or more of an adhesive, a thermoreversible adhesive, a setae based adhesive, a curable adhesive, a tissue fixative, a crosslinker, a photo-sensitive crosslinker, or a substance to inhibit nutrients to the intermediate portion. The substance can be suitable for a chemical reaction, such as a photochemical reaction, and may comprise cross-linker, such as a photosensitive cross-linker.","In many embodiments, the light energy is transmitted through the cornea of the eye and absorbed with the intermediate portion to treat the intermediate portion.","In many embodiments, the one or more of the energy or the substance is delivered to the intermediate portion of the capsule with a probe tip and the probe tip is introduced into an anterior chamber of the eye through an incision in an outer portion of a cornea.","In many embodiments, the substance comprises one or more of an adhesive, a thermoreversible adhesive, a setae based adhesive, a curable adhesive, a tissue fixative, riboflavin, or a substance to inhibit nutrients to the intermediate portion.","In many embodiments, the one or more of the energy or the substance is delivered to the intermediate portion of the capsule with a probe tip and the probe tip is introduced into an anterior chamber of the eye through an incision in an outer portion of a cornea.","In many embodiments, a capsulorhexis is performed to remove the central portion of the capsule and place an intraocular lens within the capsule.","In many embodiments, the stiffened intermediate portion decreases radial movement of the capsulorhexis edge such that radially inward force of the peripheral portion is increased by at least about 1 g when the eye accommodates.","The intermediate portion of the capsule can be treated before performing the capsulorhexis to remove the central portion of the capsule, and at least a portion of the stiffened intermediate portion of the capsule remains so as to move the peripheral portion inward when the eye accommodates with the intraocular lens.","In many embodiments, the stiffened portion supports the peripheral portion such that the peripheral portion moves the intraocular lens forward with a force of at least about 3 g.","In many embodiments, the lens capsule is retreated with a second treatment to stiffen the lens capsule at least about one day after the treatment to increase the amount of accommodation of the eye.","In many embodiments, the lens with is treated a softening treatment located inward of the treatment to stiffen the intermediate portion capsule so as to couple the stiffened intermediate portion to the softened tissue to increase the amount of accommodation of the eye.","In another aspect, embodiments of the present invention provide and apparatus to treat an eye. The eye has a lens comprising a capsule. The apparatus comprises a delivery device to couple to an intermediate portion the capsule to deliver one or more of an energy or a substance to the intermediate portion. Circuitry is coupled to the delivery device to deliver the one or more of the energy or the substance to the eye to stiffen the intermediate portion.","In many embodiments, the circuitry is configured to deliver the one or more of the energy or the substance to the intermediate tissue with a treatment profile so as to stiffen the tissue without shrinking substantially tissue of the intermediate portion.","In many embodiments, the circuitry comprises a processor having computer readable memory, the computer readable memory having instructions stored thereon to treat the tissue with the treatment profile.","In another aspect, embodiments provide an apparatus to treat an eye, in which the eye has a lens and a lens capsule. The lens capsule has an intermediate portion extending between a central portion of the lens capsule and a peripheral portion of the lens capsule. The apparatus comprises a deflectable structure to couple to the intermediate portion the lens capsule to deliver an agent to the intermediate portion so as to stiffen the intermediate portion, and the deflectable structure comprises an amount of the agent sufficient to stiffen the intermediate portion.","In many embodiments, the deflectable structure is sized to pass through an incision of no more than about 2 mm, and the deflectable structure comprise a first configuration to provide a narrow profile for insertion through the incision and a second configuration to provide a wide profile for placement on the intermediate portion of the capsule. The first configuration may comprise one or more of a folded or rotated configuration for passage through the incision and the second configuration may comprise one or more of an unfolded or a c-shaped configuration for placement on the intermediate portion of the capsule.","In another aspect, embodiments provide a method of treating an eye having a lens and a lens capsule. The capsule has a central portion and a peripheral portion connected to zonules of the eye. An adhesive is applied to the intermediate portion of the capsule to stiffen the intermediate portion to increase one or more of curvature or movement of the lens when the eye accommodates. The intermediate portion is located between the central portion and the peripheral portion.","Embodiments of the present invention as described herein can be used in many ways to improve accommodation of the presbyopic eye such that accommodation is increased to at least some extent. The embodiments as described herein can be used to treat presbyopia with an otherwise healthy eye, in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner, such that the accommodation of the natural lens of the eye is enhanced. The embodiments as described herein can also be used in conjunction with IOLs such that the amount of accommodation with the IOL can be increased. The treatment of the capsular tissue can increase radially inward force to an IOL from about 1 gram (hereinafter \u201cg\u201d) to at least about 3 g, for example at least about 4 g, in exemplary embodiments at least about 6 g, so as to provide corresponding improvement in accommodation, for example at least about a two fold increase, for example about a three fold increase, in the amount of accommodation when combined with a commercially available accommodating IOL.","The embodiments as described herein can be used in combination with enhancements to the crystalline lens or with the cornea, or with a phakic IOL or intracorneal inlays, for example. The treatment may comprise treatment of the capsule such that the other portions of the lens remain substantially untreated. Alternatively, the crystalline lens may be softened with a laser in conjunction with treating the capsule. Embodiments as described herein can also be used with accommodating IOLs so as to increase substantially the amount accommodation of the implanted accommodating IOLs. The accommodating IOL may comprise a deformable IOL that can provide increased curvature when the eye accommodates, or an IOL in which the treatment increases axial movement of the substantially rigid lens when the eye accommodates, or combinations thereof. For example the treatment can be combined with an IOL having a substantially rigid lens in which the treatment increases axial movement of the lens.","The stiffening of the capsule to increase the amount of accommodation can be done in many ways. Stiffening of the capsule can be done to increase the power change by creating stiffening rings and\/or regions that can amplify the optical power change, for example by increasing curvature of the lens capsule. The capsule can be stiffened with use of methods such as laser, mechanical, electrical (radiofrequency) or chemical.","Alternatively or in combination with increasing an amount of accommodation of the eye, the stiffening treatment as described herein can be used to treat astigmatism of the eye, and may decrease spherical aberration of the eye, for example with increased accommodation of the eye.","As used herein, stiffness encompasses a relationship between stress and strain. The relationship can be linear, or non-linear, or combinations thereof, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["10","10","12","20","15","20","20","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","12","14","16","12","20","10","13","16","18","11","16","20","22","24","26","32","30","30","22","22"]},"Description of the eye  suitable for combination in accordance with the embodiments as described herein with reference to  and  is at least partially described in one or more the following publications by Adrian Glasser:\n\n","During accommodation, the lens and ciliary components of the eye adjust to bring an object into focus. When the eye has a \u201crelaxed\u201d configuration for far vision, the ciliary muscle  of the eye is relaxed such that zonules  pull the lens capsule  outward. When the eye accommodates for near vision, the ciliary muscle  contracts such that zonules  allow the lens peripheral portion P of the lens capsule to move radially inward with a radially inward force . When the peripheral portion P moves radially inward, the front portion of the lens capsule moves forward with anterior movement  such that the anterior optical surface of the lens moves forward so as to bring the image of the near object into focus on the retina. In addition, the curvature of the anterior surface of the lens  can increase when the front portion of the lens capsule moves forward so as to increase the optical power of the lens  and bring the image of the object into focus on the retina. When the peripheral portion P moves radially outward, the front portion of the lens capsule moves with posterior movement  such that the anterior optical surface of the lens moves posteriorly and decreases curvature so as to bring the image of the far object into focus on the retina.","With presbyopia, the inner components of the lens such as the cortex  may stiffen, such that the amount of accommodation decreases. The amount of anterior movement  of lens  and the amount corresponding curvature change decreases such that the eye is no longer capable of bringing both near and far objects into focus with accommodation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":["22","20","20","20","32","30","42","20","20","43","20","20","20","46"]},"The lens  stretches when the ciliary muscles relax such that the capsule is stretched radially outward.

The radial distance RIS is greater than the radial distance RIA corresponding to stretching of the intermediate portion I and central portion C. The radial distance ODA is less than the radial distance ODS corresponding to stretching of the outer portion O located between intermediate portion I and peripheral portion P.

The intermediate portion I can be located away from the central portion C such that the central portion remains optically clear and substantially free from aberrations and light scatter. The intermediate portion may correspond to a portion of the capsule covered by the pupil, for example in bright light. In many embodiments, the intermediate portion is covered by the pupil in dim illumination, for example, such that the patient can receive the benefit of increased accommodation when reading in dim light or viewing objects in dim light for example. The intermediate portion may comprise an intermediate portion of the anterior capsule, or an intermediate portion of the posterior capsule, or both, for example.","The thickness of the treated intermediate portion I can be maintained substantially, such that the treated intermediate portion substantially resists and decreases radial movement. The resistance and decreased radial movement can improve coupling and increase radial forces of the peripheral portion of the lens capsule to the central portion of the lens capsule. As radial stretching of the intermediate portion I can correspond to an increase circumference of the stretched intermediate portion, the stiffened intermediate portion may comprise an annular shape such as a ring or oval extending circumferentially and substantially continuously around the central portion, so as to enclose the central portion the such that decreased circumferential stretching of the intermediate portion can decrease the radial motion and stretching of the intermediate portion.","The stiffened intermediate portion of the capsule I can increase accommodation of the eye  in many ways.

In: Guthoff R, Ludwig K, eds. Current Aspects of Human Accommodation II. Heidelberg: Kaden Verlag; 2003). Although the material properties of the lens capsule can be at least somewhat non-linear and the Young's modulus of the lens capsule can vary with age, a person of ordinary skill in the art can determine empirically the thickness and corresponding modulus based on the teachings described herein, so as to provide stiffening treatment to the intermediate portion I and increased accommodation.","The intermediate portion of the lens capsule can be stiffened an amount sufficient to increase accommodation, for example increased by at least about 50%. In many embodiments, the stiffening of the lens capsule may comprise at least about 100% stiffening so as to increase accommodation of the eye.

The treatment of the lens capsule can maintain thickness of the lens capsule when stiffened, such that the stiffened intermediate portion can resist radial movement and decrease movement radially so as to improve coupling increase radial forces of the peripheral portion of the lens capsule coupled to the lens disposed at least partially within the capsule. As the amount of radial force to stretch the lens capsule radially outward and the corresponding radially inward force available to move the lens during accommodation can be related to the thickness of the lens capsule and the modulus of the lens capsule, substantially maintaining the thickness of the lens capsule to within about +\/\u221230% of the thickness prior to treatment when the lens capsule is stiffened can improve coupling and increase radial forces of the peripheral portion to the lens components located at least partially within the lens capsule and increase radially inward forces to the lens components. In many embodiments the thickness of the stiffened tissue can be maintained to within about +\/\u221220%, for example to within about +\/\u221215%.

The increased stretching of lens capsule  corresponds to increased stretching of outer portion O of the capsule between the stiffened intermediate portion I and the peripheral portion P coupled to the zonules. The radial distance RIS is similar to radial distance RIA corresponding to no substantial increased stretching of the intermediate portion I and central portion C. The radial distance ODA is less than the radial distance ODS corresponding to stretching of the outer portion O located between intermediate portion I and peripheral portion P. As the peripheral portion P of the lens may be pulled that radial distance PRS corresponds substantially to the eye without the stiffening treatment as shown above, the radial stretching distance ODS can be substantially greater for the eye with the stiffened intermediate portion I.","The intermediate portion of the lens capsule can be treated with amounts of strain corresponding to the relaxed lens capsule during accommodation, or amounts of strain corresponding to stretching of the lens capsule when the ciliary muscle of the eye relaxes for far vision, and amounts in between. For example, with capsulorhexis, it can be helpful to stiffen the tissue around the edge of the capsulorhexis incision when the eye is dilated and corresponds to a stretched lens capsule. With the natural crystalline lens of the eye, the amount of strain of the intermediate portion I and the central portion C can be related to the elevation of protrusion CP. The decreased radial movement and decreased circumferential stretching of intermediate portion I can define an outer boundary of protrusion CP and encourage formation of protrusion CP.","The curvature profile elevation data and figures as described herein show that presbyopia can be treated with an appropriately sized intermediate portion I so as to produce a protrusion to treat presbyopia, and that the protrusion can be used in combination with additional components of accommodation, such as movement anteriorly of the intermediate portion I and the central portion C when the eye accommodates, and radially inward elastic force and radially inward movement of the peripheral portion of the lens capsule. The elastic peripheral and outer portions of the lens capsule can move the intermediate and central portions of the lens capsule anteriorly when the eye accommodates, and the elastic peripheral and outer portions of the lens capsule can provide radially inward force and radially inward movement of the peripheral portion of the lens capsule to move the intermediate portion I and the peripheral portion P anteriorly. The intermediate portion I can be stiffened with an amount of strain to provide appropriate far vision refraction and increased accommodation. The amount of strain of the stiffened intermediate portion may correspond to the stretched lens capsule for far vision, the non-stretched accommodating lens capsule, or amounts of strain in between corresponding to intermediate vision.

For example, the long dimension of the oval intermediate portion I can be aligned with the steeper substantially vertical axis C, and the shorter dimension of the oval intermediate portion I can be aligned with the flatter substantially horizontal axis B. The oval protrusion P can have a ratio of the long axis to the short axis so as to correct the astigmatism of the eye when the lens capsule is relaxed with ciliary muscle contraction and the eye accommodates for near vision, or when the lens capsule is stretched with the zonules and the ciliary muscle is relaxed for far vision.","The stiffened oval intermediate portion I can induce astigmatism of the lens with tonic protrusion CP so as to correct the astigmatism of the eye. The oval intermediate portion I coupled to annular oval support  comprises a shorter inner dimension A and a shorter outer dimension B. The oval stiffened intermediate portion I comprises an elongate inner dimension B and an elongate outer dimension B. The shorter inner dimension A and the elongate inner dimension A can define the oval outer boundary of the central portion C, such that the central portion C comprises an oval shape profile having one or more of an elliptical shape profile, a lentoid shape profile, or an asymmetrical elliptical shape profile. In many embodiments, the oval shape profile corresponds to a tonic shape of the protrusion CP when the eye accommodates. When the lens capsule moves anteriorly with accommodation of the lens capsule such that central portion C comprises protrusion CP, the curvature change of the lens capsule can be related to the inner dimensions across the intermediate portion such as shorter inner dimension A and elongate inner dimension B. The shorter dimension A corresponds to a steeper curvature change of the lens capsule when the central portion moves anteriorly, and the elongate dimension B corresponds to a less steep change in curvature when the lens capsule moves anteriorly. The flatter curvature change along the axis of the elongate dimension B of the oval can correct the with the rule astigmatism along the vertical axis C.","The curvature CPC and corresponding elevation profile of the protrusion CP can be combined with the shorter inner dimension A and the elongate inner dimension B so as to determine the amount of optical correction of the protrusion. Alternatively or in combination, the ratio of the shorter dimension to the longer dimension and the elevation of the protrusion C can be used to determine the optical correction of the tonic protrusion.

The dimensions of the short dimension and the long dimension of the oval can be sized to induce astigmatism of the lens to correct the astigmatism of the eye when the eye accommodates. For example the long dimension and the short dimension of the oval support can be sized such that the long dimension corresponds to about +1 D of optical power along axis C and the short dimension of the oval corresponds to about +2 D of optical power along axis B when the eye accommodates, such that the refraction of the eye with accommodation based on the change in curvature CPC of the central portion CP is about \u22122 D along axis B and about \u22122 D along axis C.","The cylinder of the eye can be corrected with many ratios of the long and short dimensions of the oval support . For example, an eye having a far vision refraction of 0 D sphere \u22121 D cylinder at axis of 180 degrees can be corrected with the oval protrusion. The long inner dimension B can be aligned along the 90 degree axis and the short inner dimension A can be aligned along the 180 degree axis.

Many additional combinations of dimensions can be identified by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the teachings described herein. The protrusion coupled to the oval support can provide about +2 D of optical power along axis B and about +2 D of optical power along axis C corresponding spherical near vision refraction of about \u22122 D sphere when the eye accommodates.","As the central and intermediate portions of the anterior lens capsule can move forward together so as to provide optical correction in addition to the curvature CPC of the protrusion CP, the amount of accommodation and corresponding near vision refraction of the eye can be greater than the amount provided by the curvature CPC of protrusion CP.

The intermediate portion of the lens capsule corresponding to the stiffened tissue was constrained such that the radial position remained fixed but was allowed to move along the axis of the coordinate system, as described herein. The radial location of the stiffened intermediate portion of lens capsule tissue was fixed at a radial distance. The lens profile in the non-stretched lens condition corresponding to accommodation was used to determine the fixed radial distance of the stiffened tissue of the intermediate portion of the lens capsule.
