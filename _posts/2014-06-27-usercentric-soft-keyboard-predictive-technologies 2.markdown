No. 12\/729,130 (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,782,556), filed Mar. 22, 2010, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/304,341, filed Feb. 12, 2010, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present disclosure pertains to devices and methods for enhancing text entry using a touch screen device.","With the increasing popularity of mobile devices, including cellphone devices, handheld devices, handheld computers, smartphones, PDAs, etc., there is a need for improving the user interface experience by increasing user text input speed, reducing text entry errors, and improving the overall user experience.","Mobile devices with capacitive or resistive touch capabilities often utilize a touch screen keyboard, a hardware keyboard, speech recognition, handwriting recognition, or combination of the four, for entry of text input. Touch screen keyboards enable larger displays for videos, web pages, email, etc., without the requirement of a physical keyboard. Because touch screen keyboards are software-based, they can be easily adjusted for different languages, touch screen orientation, and key layouts. Furthermore, touch screen keyboards can be augmented with widgets for word prediction and disambiguation candidates.","Users of devices with touch screens, especially mobile devices, have varying abilities and styles of entering text. A particular user may tend to use certain words, including words not found in a system dictionary, more or less frequently depending on the input scope. For example, the frequency of word usage used may vary depending on whether the input scope is a message body, subject lines, or to\/from fields. Similarly, the frequency of word usage or typing accuracy may also vary between individual users. Therefore, there exists ample opportunity for improvement in technologies related to facilitating user input on electronic devices by learning user tendencies when entering text in order to accelerate user text entry and reduce user input error rates while taking into account input scope and the completion state of a given text entry.","An apparatus and method are disclosed for providing feedback and guidance to touch screen device users to improve the text entry user experience and performance.","The described techniques and tools for solutions for improving text entry user experience and performance can be implemented separately, or in various combinations with each other. As will be described more fully below, the described techniques and tools can be implemented on hardware that includes software touch screen keyboards or hardware keyboards. As will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the disclosed technology can be implemented using various platforms coupled with a touch screen including, but not limited to, mobile devices (cellphones, smartphones, PDAs), tablet or laptop computers, desktop computers, and home theater systems. As used herein, a touch screen includes a display coupled with touch sense capabilities (for example, displays using capacitive or resistive sensors).","According to a first embodiment, a method comprises receiving first input data, automatically learning user tendencies based on the first input data to generate input history data, receiving second input data, and based on the input history data and the second input data, generating auto-corrections or suggestion candidates for the second input data. In some examples, the receiving first input data comprises receiving a completion event indicating that the first input data is complete, such as the sending of a text message, instant message, or email. In some examples, the automatically learning user tendencies comprises analyzing user-specific web content associated with the user. In some examples, the input history data can include touch position data, data representing the last time a word of the first input data was used, typing speed data, or data representing the orientation of a touch screen while receiving data.","In some examples, some or all of the receiving first input data and second input, automatically learning user tendencies, and generating auto-corrections or suggestion candidates can occur in a cloud. In some examples, the receiving second input data includes resizing one or more target areas associated with one or more associated keys on a touch screen keyboard based on one or more characters previously received in the second input data, one or more characters of the second input data are determined at least in part using the resized target areas. In some examples, resizing the one or more target areas includes using a generic touch model based on previously-collected touch screen keyboard typing data for plural users, the generic touch model including one or more child probability scores for one or more input data sequences for the typing data.","According to a second embodiment, a method comprises receiving first input data comprising one or more words and associated with an input scope of a mobile device, automatically learning user tendencies using the first input data to generate user-specific input history data, receiving second input data from a touch screen keyboard; analyzing the second input data and at least a portion of the user-specific input history data, and based on the analyzing, providing one or more user-specific auto-corrections or suggestion candidates for the second input data to the touch screen keyboard.","In some examples, the user-specific input history data includes data indicating that at least one input word of the first input data was previously auto-corrected and the auto-correction was undone. In some examples, the user-specific auto-corrections comprise suppressing an auto-correction based on comparing a threshold value to a score generated by combining first data comprising a weighted probability based on one or more candidate sources with second data comprising a weighted edit distance based on one more edit distance penalty categories. In some examples, the analyzing comprises combining a weighted probability for at least one of the words based on one or more candidate sources with a weighted edit distance based on one or more edit distance penalty categories and at least one of the one or more candidate sources is based on user-specific input history data.","In some examples, receiving second input data includes resizing one or more target areas associated with one or more associated keys on the touch screen keyboard based on one or more characters previously received in the second input data, and the resizing can be based at least in part on the user-specific input history data.","In some examples, some or all of the receiving first input data and second input, automatically learning user tendencies, and generating auto-corrections or suggestion candidates can occur in a cloud.","According to a third embodiment, a computer-readable storage device stores computer-readable instructions that when executed cause a computer to perform a method comprising using a touch screen keyboard coupled with a mobile device, receiving first user input data associated with an input scope, the first user input data comprising one or more characters, receiving a completion event associated with the input scope using the text entry device, after the receiving, automatically analyzing the first user input data and storing user-specific input history data including an indication of the input scope based on the analyzing, using the touch screen keyboard, receiving second user input data, determining a weighted probability determined from one or more candidate source data selected from a group including at least one of the following: the user-specific input history data, the second user input data, dictionary probability data, user-specific touch model data, and generic touch model data, determining a weighted edit distance determined by calculating one or more edit distances selected from a group of penalty categories including at least one of the following: insertion, deletion, transposition, non-fuzzy substitution, fuzzy substitution, case change, and accent, automatically determining one or more suggestion candidates based on a score determined by combining the weighted probability and the weighted edit distance, and displaying the suggestion candidates on the touch screen keyboard.","Some embodiments include a computer-readable storage device storing instructions that when executed cause a computer to perform one or more of the methods disclosed herein.","Some embodiments include a system for performing one or more of the method disclosed herein. In some examples, the system can include a computing cloud.","The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.","This disclosure is set forth in the context of representative embodiments that are not intended to be limiting in any way.","As used in this application and in the claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include the plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

The disclosed systems, methods, and apparatus are not limited to any specific aspect or feature or combinations thereof, nor do the disclosed things and methods require that any one or more specific advantages be present or problems be solved.","Although the operations of some of the disclosed methods are described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that this manner of description encompasses rearrangement, unless a particular ordering is required by specific language set forth below. For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various ways in which the disclosed things and methods can be used in conjunction with other things and method. Additionally, the description sometimes uses terms like \u201cproduce,\u201d \u201cgenerate,\u201d \u201cselect,\u201d \u201chighlight,\u201d and \u201cprovide\u201d to describe the disclosed methods. These terms are high-level abstractions of the actual operations that are performed. The actual operations that correspond to these terms will vary depending on the particular implementation and are readily discernible by one of ordinary skill in the art.","Theories of operation, scientific principles or other theoretical descriptions presented herein in reference to the apparatus or methods of this disclosure have been provided for the purposes of better understanding and are not intended to be limiting in scope. The apparatus and methods in the appended claims are not limited to those apparatus and methods that function in the manner described by such theories of operation.","In the following description, certain terms may be used such as \u201cup,\u201d \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cupper,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201chorizontal,\u201d \u201cvertical,\u201d \u201cleft,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d \u201cover,\u201d \u201con,\u201d \u201cnear,\u201d and the like. These terms are used, where applicable, to provide some clarity of description when dealing with relative relationships. But, these terms are not intended to imply absolute relationships, positions, and\/or touch screen orientations.","As used in this disclosure, the term \u201cwait\u201d may be used to describe the action a device takes while waiting for particular value or type of input before proceeding with a particular operation. This waiting should not be construed as limiting the device to only waiting for the particular type of input; rather, the device may receive other input or perform other actions concurrently with the waiting.","As used in this disclosure, the term \u201cautomatically\u201d is used to describe actions that can proceed immediately, without receiving further user input. As used in this disclosure, the term \u201cimmediately\u201d means that an action occurs within a short time period following a preceding action without needing to receive intervening user input. In some cases, there may be intervening actions performed between or concurrently with the preceding action and the action occurring \u201cimmediately,\u201d for example, screen refresh or redraw, sound playback, etc.","As used in this disclosure, the term \u201cover\u201d is used to describe the positioning of objects (for example, a finger, thumb, or stylus) over, on, or near a location on a touch screen. In some embodiments, this object need not come into contact with the touch screen for the object's position to be determined. In other embodiments, the object described as \u201cover\u201d the touch screen may be in contact with the surface of the touch screen. In some embodiments, the object determined to be \u201cover\u201d a location of the touch screen may not actually be positioned directly over the touch screen location, but determined to be \u201cover\u201d the location on the touch screen, for example, by a position correction module of the text entry device or touch screen.","The disclosed technology includes various approaches to improving typing accuracy or typing speed when using devices having a touch screen by using suggestion candidates to augment other input devices. These suggestion candidates are typically represented in a candidates area, which need not be permanently reserved for that purpose, or can appear in varying location on the touch screen. After entering one or more words to form a text entry, the user can review the text entry by viewing the touch screen and deciding whether to select a word for suggestions. Once the user has selected the word, one or more suggestion candidates are displayed on the touch screen. In some embodiments, the suggestion candidates are presented as buttons, which include a word related to the word selected by the user. Suggestion candidates can be determined to be related to the selected word using a candidate generation module, which can use candidate sources including: a dictionary, a thesaurus, a common speller application programming interface (CSAPI), an input history data source (IHDS), or other methods, to determine suggestions. The user reviews the suggestion candidates, and selects one of the candidates for replacement using a single touch screen input over the desired suggestion candidate on the touch screen.","As used in this disclosure, a single touch screen input refers to the input received when a user positions an object over the surface of a touch screen such that the touch screen device can determine the position of the object. In some embodiments, the object can be the user's finger or thumb. In other embodiments, the object can be a stylus or puck. In some embodiments, the single touch screen input is received after the user \u201ctaps\u201d the touch screen over a word or suggestion candidates. In other embodiments, the single touch screen input is received when the user presses the screen with a finger, thumb, or stylus. When a touch is detected over a touch screen surface, touch position data is generated. Receiving touch position data for a single touch screen input is sufficient to determine which word or which suggestion candidate the user is indicating on the touch screen\u2014no additional keyboard input, mouse input, trackball input, voice input, or additional touches are necessary. Using a single touch screen input to determine user selections simplifies the input process and allows for the fast correction of text entries without the need to use submenus, popup menus, or additional input devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","104"]},"The illustrated mobile device  can include a controller or processor  (e.g., signal processor, microprocessor, ASIC, or other control and processing logic circuitry) for performing such tasks as signal coding, data processing, input\/output processing, power control, and\/or other functions.

Web content can include web queries, clicks, URLs, as well as content available via the Web such as social networking data (e.g., from Facebook, LinkedIn, MSN, etc. sites) and web directories.","After receiving a completion event, the method proceeds to process block , where the first input data is analyzed to determine any words of the first input history that were auto-corrected and then undone. For example, a user sending emails describing a delicious meal may intend to type the word \u201cyummy\u201d several times, but by default this word is auto-corrected to \u201ctummy.\u201d The user then needs to undo these auto-corrections several times to enter the intended word \u201cyummy.\u201d Thus, when analyzing the first input data at process block , these undone auto-corrections can be identified and data added to the input history data that represents these undone corrections.","At process block , for each word in the first input data, a usage count for each word can be incremented in the input history data. This data can be used to tailor subsequent auto-correction or suggestion candidate generation for a specific user. For example, a user enters \u201cyummy\u201d several times in the completed first input data and then sends messages, emails, or web posts. On subsequent entry of text input data, a score generated for \u201cyummy\u201d will be higher based on the high frequency usage of this word by the user, and thus subsequent auto-correction or suggestions will be less likely to correct the word \u201cyummy.\u201d Thus, by tracking word usage, subsequent auto-corrections and suggestions can be more accurate and require less intervention to correct unwanted auto-corrections.","At process block , subsequent second input data is received. This second input data can be received using similar techniques as described for the first input data at process block .","At process block , the second input data and input history data are analyzed in order to generate auto-corrections or suggestion candidates for the second input data.

On the other hand, a high score indicates that words are dissimilar and that the second word (i.e., the word being considered for auto-correction or as a suggestion candidate) is less applicable to the first word.

Insertion: an input word is in the insertion category when a candidate word is the same as the input word, plus one or more additional characters. An example of an insertion is when a user has typed input word \u201cwrd,\u201d which is being compared to candidate word \u201cword.\u201d In some examples, the insertion category is defined such that having exactly one additional character places a candidate word in the insertion category (e.g., input word \u201cwrd\u201d vs. candidate word \u201cword\u201d). In other examples, the insertion category is defined such that having one, two, or more additional characters places a candidate word in the insertion category (e.g., \u201cMisisipi\u201d vs. \u201cMississippi,\u201d which is an edit distance of three insertions). In some examples, an additional penalty can be applied depending on the number of additional characters between the input word and the candidate word (e.g., \u201cMisisipi\u201d could have a higher penalty score than \u201cMississipi\u201d).","2. Wildcard is a special case of insertion. An input word is in the wildcard category when a candidate word is the same as the input word, plus one or more designated additional characters, for example, apostrophe or question mark. A lower penalty can be applied for the wild card so that input words are penalized less for the presence of designated wildcard characters. For example, the wildcard penalty is implicated when comparing input words \u201cperson's\u201d or \u201cpersons\u201d to candidate word \u201cpersons.\u201d Similar to the insertion category, the wildcard category can be defined such that having exactly one additional wildcard character places a candidate word in the wildcard category, or the wildcard category can be defined such that having one, two, or more additional wildcard characters places a candidate word in the wildcard category. In some examples, an additional penalty can be applied, depending on the number of additional wildcard characters.","3. Deletion: an input word is in the deletion category when a candidate word is the same as the input word, less an additional character. An example of a deletion is when a user has typed input word \u201cworrd,\u201d which is being compared to candidate word \u201cword.\u201d Similar to the insertion category, some examples may limit this category to the case where exactly one character has been deleted (e.g., input word \u201cworrd\u201d vs. candidate word \u201cword\u201d). In other examples, one, two, or more deleted characters can place a candidate word in the deletion category (e.g. \u201cbannanna\u201d vs. \u201cbanana\u201d). In some examples, an additional penalty can be applied depending on the number of deleted characters between the input word and the candidate word (e.g., \u201cbannanna\u201d could be assigned a higher penalty score than \u201cbannana\u201d).","4. Transposition: an input word is in the transposition category when an input word has two consecutive characters reversed (transposed) compared to the candidate word. An example of a transposition is when a user has typed input word \u201cwrod,\u201d which is being compared to the candidate word \u201cword\u201d (i.e., the characters \u201cr\u201d and \u201co\u201d are transposed in the input word). Similar to the insertion and deletion categories, some examples may only consider a word with exactly one transposition to be in the transposition category, while other examples may allow multiple transpositions, with an optional additional penalty (e.g., input word \u201cMciroosft\u201d vs. candidate word \u201cMicrosoft\u201d has two transpositions).","5. Non-fuzzy substitution: an input word is in the non-fuzzy substitution category when the input word has one or more characters that are different than the candidate word, and the different characters are not determined to be adjacent, e.g., the keys for the characters are not physically adjacent on a touch screen keyboard. An example of a non-fuzzy substitution is when the input word is \u201cwoid,\u201d which is being compared to candidate word \u201cword,\u201d and the input was received using a QWERTY keyboard. Similar to the insertion and deletion categories, some examples may only consider a word with exactly one character different to be in the non-fuzzy substitution category, while other examples may allow multiple characters to be different, with an optional additional penalty (e.g., input word \u201cbinina\u201d vs. candidate word \u201cbanana\u201d has two non-adjacent characters substituted).","As described further below, a determination whether two characters are adjacent is dependent on the input source. For example, a QWERTY touch screen keyboard, a Dvorak touch screen keyboard, a DTMF keyboard (i.e., a standard telephone keypad), a hardware keyboard, and non-keyboard input sources (e.g., from handwriting recognition or voice recognition) can all have different keys designated as adjacent to each other. Further, keyboards based on different languages (e.g., English vs. French) can also have different keys designated as adjacent to each other.","6. Fuzzy substitution: an input word is in the fuzzy substitution category when an input word has one or more characters different than the candidate word, and the keys for the characters are determined to be adjacent (e.g., the different characters can be typed by adjacent keys on a touch screen keyboard). If the two words are in the fuzzy substitution category, an error model is used to dynamically calculate a penalty. The error model can be based on real usage data collected on a physical device with a statistically significant set of keystrokes. The error model can contain different values or probabilities based on the language being used (e.g., English vs. French). For example, on a QWERTY touch screen keyboard, the keys \u201co\u201d and \u201cp\u201d are adjacent. A lower fuzzy substitution penalty can be assigned for the input word \u201cwprd\u201d and candidate word \u201cword,\u201d because the characters \u201co\u201d and \u201cp\u201d are adjacent, and the error model indicates that \u201cwprd\u201d is often changed by users to \u201cword\u201d based on previously collected user data. A higher fuzzy substitution penalty can be assigned for the input word \u201ccave\u201d and candidate word \u201ccafe.\u201d This is because even though the keys \u201cv\u201d and \u201cf\u201d are adjacent, based on previously collected user data, the word \u201ccave\u201d is frequently not corrected at all. In some examples, the fuzzy substitution determination can rely not only on input history data but also other candidate sources, for example: dictionaries, thesauruses, or a CSAPI. In these examples, \u201ccave\u201d would be assigned a higher fuzzy substitution penalty than \u201cwprd,\u201d because the word \u201ccave\u201d appears in a system dictionary, while \u201cwprd\u201d does not.","7. Case change: an input word is in the case change category when the input words has one or more characters that are different than the candidate words, and the characters only differ based on being uppercase\/lowercase. For example, the case change category is indicated when the input word is \u201cmrs.\u201d and is being compared to the candidate word \u201cMrs.\u201d Similarly, the case change category is indicated when the input word is \u201cmicrosoft\u201d and the candidate word is \u201cMicrosoft.\u201d Similar to the insertion and deletion categories, some examples may only consider a word with exactly one character case difference to be in the case change category, while other examples may allow multiple characters to have case change differences, with an optional additional penalty.","8. Accent: an input word is in the case change category when the input word has one or more characters that are different than the candidate words, and the characters only differ based on an associated accent mark. For example, the accent category is indicated when the input word \u201ccafe\u201d is being compared to the candidate word \u201ccaf\u00e9\u201d (i.e., the base character \u201ce\u201d differs from that in the candidate word character only by the accent \u201c\u00e9\u201d). Similar to the insertion and deletion categories, some examples may consider a word with exactly one accent character different to be in the accent category, while other examples may allow multiple characters to have accent differences, with an optional additional penalty.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0134"},"figref":"FIG. 10E","b":"1060"},"At process block , an input word is received (e.g., from a mobile device) and one or more candidate sources are searched for likely candidate words.","At process block , one or more word probabilities are determined for the input word(s) over one or more likely candidate words. In some examples, the candidate sources are only searched for single words (unigrams). In other examples, the candidate sources can be searched for two-word combinations (bi-grams) or three-word combinations (trigrams). For example, the two-word combination \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d is stored in a candidate source as a bi-gram so that possible auto-corrections or suggestion candidates can be determined more readily, regardless of whether the first or second word is misspelled. Similarly, a three word combination such as \u201cbest of breed\u201d can be stored in a candidate source such that certain possible errors, for example input words \u201cbest or breed\u201d can be designated incorrect even though the word that is incorrect, \u201cor,\u201d appears in the system dictionary.","At process block , a weighted edit distance score for the input word(s) over one or more likely candidate words is determined.

For example, a data collection tool coupled with a soft keyboard device can prompt one or more users to enter a series of phrases to type using a touch screen keyboard device. As the user enters the phrases, the data collection tool logs touch data (e.g., X-Y location, pressure, speed, touch screen orientation, etc.) with the prediction feature turned off. The cursor position associated with the prompted phrase is advanced if the user hits either the exact next key in the phrase, or any of the adjacent keys. By comparing the collected touch data with the prompted phrases, it can be determined for any given touch data, which key the user intended to hit.","By collecting this touch data for many users, simulations can then be run which vary the touch model parameters and then replay the logged touch data, in order to determine the impact that a given set of touch model parameters have on the accuracy of the touch model. For example, a first simulation could be run with the default hit target locations shown in , while a second simulation could be run with some of the keys shifted one pixel to the left, a third simulation could be run with some the keys shifted one pixel to the bottom, and so forth. After running several simulations, the results can be analyzed to determine the set of parameters that produce the largest general reduction in keyboard error. Thus, a generic touch model based on previously collected simulation data for plural users is generated. Typing error rate reductions as high as 50% have been observed using this technique.","The data collection tool can also be used to output a fuzzy set representing the probability of a given key press being correct. For example, when the desired key is a \u201cq\u201d the probability of pressing a \u201cw\u201d or \u201ce\u201d accidently is known. These scores can be used to weight the child probability scored while traversing a language probability model data structure or user to calculate edit distance scores for sorting candidates. In some examples, a general touch model is used for all keys of a soft keyboard. In other examples, a key-specific touch model is generated for each key. In some examples, an individual user can be prompted to enter a series of training phrases, the data can be logged and simulated using different touch model parameters, and a user-specific touch model generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0161"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1400"]},"The computing environment  is not intended to suggest any limitation as to scope of use or functionality of the technology, as the technology may be implemented in diverse general-purpose or special-purpose computing environments.
