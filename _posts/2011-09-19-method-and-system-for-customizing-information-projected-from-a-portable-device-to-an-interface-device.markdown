{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to external device integration within a vehicle.","An increasing number of vehicles are being configured such that portable consumer electronic devices, for example, smart phones, may interface with the human machine interface (HMI) offered by the vehicle. The portable device, for example, a vehicle user's phone, may interface with the vehicle by projecting through a vehicle user interface, such as a navigation screen, where the output displayed on the vehicle user interface by the phone is that of the phone and not of the vehicle. Because the phone hardware and software can be readily updated, this provides the advantage that the hardware and software used to provide information to the vehicle user interface can be conveniently maintained and readily updated. However, because the user's phone controls the display, including the look-and-feel of the user interface as projected through the vehicle HMI, the graphical elements of the display are dictated by the user's phone, and are not controlled by the vehicle or vehicle manufacturer.","As part of their branding strategy, most vehicle manufacturers adopt a vehicle brand-specific look-and-feel for many styling elements of the vehicle design, which may include a vehicle brand-specific look-and-feel for the vehicle HMI elements, including the vehicle display. The vehicle brand specific look-and-feel may include vehicle specific styling of fonts, colors, etc., of the vehicle display. When the user's phone controls the look-and-feel of the vehicle HMI elements to project graphical information through the vehicle display, the vehicle brand-specific style guidelines are overridden, which is inconsistent with the vehicle manufacturer's branding strategy.","A method and system provided herein includes an interface device configured to send customized style information to a portable device in communication with the interface device. The portable device customizes the user interface of the portable device using the customized style information from the interface device to provide a customized interface to be presented by the interface device. The portable device may be configured as a smart phone, netbook, e-reader, personal digital assistant (PDA), gaming device, video player, or other computing device capable of defining a user interface which may include graphical information, a video or another type of image that may be projected on a screen.","The interface device may include a human-machine interface (HMI) for presenting the customized interface of the portable device. In a non-limiting example, the interface device may be a vehicle interface device defined at least in part by a head unit, a navigation system or an infotainment system of the vehicle. By way of example, an advantage of the method and system described herein is the capability for a vehicle manufacturer to control the style, e.g., the look-and-feel, of the information presented to a vehicle user by the vehicle interface device from a portable user device, and thereby maintain a vehicle look-and-feel consistent with the vehicle's branding guidelines for customized information provided by the vehicle interface device to the vehicle user for the information presented.","A method of customizing the user interface of the portable device which is presented by an interface device in communication with the portable device includes linking the portable device and the interface system, where the portable device includes an operating system defining a user interface, and the interface device includes an HMI. The method further includes providing customized style information defined by the interface device to the portable device and generating a customized interface, wherein the portable device generates the customized interface using the customized style information. The customized interface may be outputted from the portable device to the interface device and presented to the user by the interface device using the HMI.","The method may further include using the interface device to run an application from the portable device, where the application is resident on the portable device and the application defines an application user interface. The portable device may create a customized application interface using the customized style information, and may output the customized application interface from the portable device to the interface device. The interface device may receive the customized application interface from the portable device and present the customized application interface using the HMI. The customized style information may include one or more of a style rule, a style selector, and a style sheet and may define one or more of a font size, a font color, a font style, text alignment, a color, a shape, a background style, a border, a margin, spacing, alignment, and size which is defined by the interface device.","A system for projecting a user interface using an interface device in communication with a portable device is described herein. In a non-limiting example, the interface device may be a vehicle interface device included in a portable device-to-vehicle interface device communication system of a vehicle. The system may include a portable device defining a user interface and configured to modify the user interface using customized style information. The system may include an interface device configured to provide the customized style information, the interface device including a human-machine interface (HMI). The HMI is configurable to present the user interface of the portable device when the portable device and the interface device are linked by a communication link configured to selectively link the portable device and the interface system. In a non-limiting example, when the portable device and the interface device are linked, the interface device may provide customized style information to the portable device, and the portable device may modify the user interface using the customized style information to generate a customized interface which is presented by the interface device using the HMI.","The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers represent like components throughout the several figures, there is shown in  a perspective view of a portable device-to-vehicle interface system  including a vehicle interface device  configured to be in selective communication with a portable device  via a communication link . The vehicle-based interface device  includes at least one human machine interface (HMI) device  configured to project the user interface of the portable device  through the vehicle interface device  to the vehicle user. In a non-limiting example, the portable device-to-interface system  is shown as a vehicle interface system, however it would be understood that the interface system  may be configured as a non-vehicle interface system.","The portable device  may be carried by a user of the interface system , e.g., a user of the vehicle. An example of a portable device  includes, but is not limited to, a smart phone, a netbook, an e-reader, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable media player, a gaming device, and any other device capable of running a plurality of software applications , either pre-loaded or downloaded by the user, which may be stored on and executed by the portable device  to provide a video, e.g., a graphical output such as but not limited to a graphical user interface. Examples of the plurality of software applications  may include, but is not limited to, music, DVD, phone, navigation, weather, email and a web browser. In some devices  software applications may be added, updated or deleted from the portable device  at the user's discretion. Other devices  may be special purpose and have a set functionality that cannot be changed by the user.","As shown in , the portable device  may include an operating system , which may provide functionality such as authenticating the portable device  to the interface device  through a handshaking process or other authenticating process, presenting a menu or listing of available applications  to a user, and enabling a selected application . The operating system  may be configured to format a user interface using style information which is provided to the portable device .","The portable device  further includes a communications interface  which may be used to enable interaction between the portable device  and the vehicle interface device . The communications interface  may be designed to allow an HMI  of the vehicle interface device  to accept video data from the portable device , such that a user interface or other graphical or video output of the portable device  may be displayed on or otherwise provided to the HMI  of the vehicle interface device . The communications interface  may utilize one or more application programming interfaces (APIs), instructions, libraries and operating systems to execute the protocols used to communicate between the portable device  and the vehicle interface system . The communications interface  may be used when the vehicle interface device  and portable device  communicate to configure the HMI , exchange content, and exchange control information. It should be understood that the communications interface  may include a complete interface, a single function interface, or a plurality of interfaces. The communications interface  may execute the communication protocol, and may receive style information  from the vehicle interface device  to control the style, e.g., the formatting or look-and-feel of a video, image and\/or user interface provided by the portable device  to the HMI .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["22","12","10","30","12","22","32","12","22","36","22","12","30","30","22","14","22","22","12","14","12"]},"The portable device  may be configured to generate and display a user interface, which may be a graphical user interface and\/or a video, including an image (static or otherwise) that may be projected on a screen. A portable device  may utilize a touch screen wherein the user interface is projected on the screen and selections are made by either touching an application\/icon on the screen or utilizing a cursor to navigate to the application\/icon. A user interface of the portable device  is outputted to the vehicle interface device , and the HMI  presents, via a vehicle screen, the outputted video or graphical information of the user interface. This allows a user of the vehicle to access the user interface of the phone, which may be a home screen, menu screen, application screen, etc. via the controls of the vehicle interface  and HMI , as opposed to handling and viewing the portable device  directly. Additionally, a user of the vehicle may select, launch and use one or more of the applications  on the portable device  via the controls of the vehicle interface  and the HMI , and view the video output, e.g., the graphical user interface, of a selected application  on a vehicle screen as presented by the HMI . The vehicle screen may be a touch screen, such that a vehicle user may utilize the vehicle touch screen to make selections and generally operate the application by either touching an application\/icon on the screen or utilizing a cursor to navigate to the application\/icon projected from the HMI .","Preferably, the HMI  has dual functionality that includes accepting a user's manual input and\/or presenting application content to the user. An example of an HMI  that includes dual functionality is a navigation device. The navigation device has dedicated buttons or a touch screen for accepting the user's selection. The navigation device further includes a display screen that can be used to display application content. Another example of an HMI  having dual functionality is a radio system. Radio control buttons\/knobs can be used by the user for making input selections and the radio display may be used for presenting the graphical application content to the user. In a non-limiting example, the HMI  may include at least one of a head unit and a video projection screen.","Alternatively, two separate devices may be used for input selection and output selection, respectively. For example, a respective HMI device  may be used for receiving a user input selection, such as a switch disposed on the steering wheel. A second respective HMI device  used to present application content to the user may include a message display screen such as those used to display vehicle speed, fuel economy, odometer readings, etc. Moreover, text-to-speech functionality may also be provided by the vehicle interface device  to output audio to the user in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle could also provide a speech recognition system for entering text into an application  on the portable device  through the HMI . The speech recognition system would be an alternative for a control input switch, touch screen, keyboard or similar.","The vehicle interface device  may include an operating system  which may provide functionality such as authenticating the portable device  to the interface device  through a handshaking process or other authenticating process, and transmitting customized style information  to the portable device . The vehicle interface device  may include a memory  which is configured of sufficient size and type to store the customized style information . It would be understood that the operating system  and\/or the memory  may be configured elsewhere within the vehicle interface system  and in operable communication with the vehicle interface device .","The portable device  may store the customized style information  sent by the vehicle interface device . The portable device  may have a graphics system that the portable device  uses to project a user interface to a screen. The graphics system may be configured to read the customized style information  and to change the look of the user interface based on the content of the customized style information . In one non-limiting example, the portable device  may have an operating system  that includes a graphics system. The operating system  may have built-in graphical elements that are used by the operating system  to build a user interface. These graphical elements may be able to change their look based on the customized style information . These graphical elements may also be used by one or more applications  resident on the portable device  to build the application's user interface. Thus, when the operating system  changes the look of the graphical elements based on the customized style sheet  the user interface of the application  also changes its look. One or more of the applications  may also define its own custom graphical elements. These custom graphical elements may also be designed to change their look based on customized style information . Thus, when the operating system  communicates new customized style information to the applications , the applications  will be able to change the look of the customized graphics elements as well.","The vehicle interface device  may use the customized style information  to format information generated by the vehicle interface system  and displayed using the HMI . Information which is generated by the vehicle including the vehicle interface system  may include vehicle speed, fuel economy, odometer readings, etc., derived from sensors or systems incorporated in the vehicle. Other examples may include information from accessories permanently incorporated into the vehicle, such as the vehicle radio or navigation system, where the information displayed may include the radio channel selection, sound settings, navigation settings, maps, etc., understanding these images are generated, formatted and displayed by the vehicle interface system . The vehicle interface device  may use the customized style information  to format the graphical information displayed, where the customized style information  is defined according to, and\/or in compliance with the vehicle manufacturer's branding guidelines for that vehicle. By way of example, the vehicle branding guidelines may specify a specific font type and color to be used for the display of information, may specify a brand related color scheme or pattern for background areas and\/or borders, and\/or may incorporate elements of a vehicle manufacturer's logo or the vehicle's nameplate, etc. By formatting the displayed information in a manner consistent with the vehicle manufacturer's branding guidelines for the vehicle and\/or the vehicle manufacturer, the vehicle manufacturer can provide a consistent look-and-feel to the vehicle HMI elements, which provides a consistent brand experience to the vehicle user.","As described herein, the vehicle interface system  may be configured to customize the look-and-feel of the graphical information coming from, e.g., outputted by, the portable device  and presented to the user by the HMI . By having the portable device  modify (according to the customized style information ) the graphical user interface projected to the HMI , the vehicle manufacturer can continue to provide a consistent, vehicle branded, look-and-feel for information displayed through the HMI , even for information displayed from a portable device . Because the vehicle brand specific (customized) style information  is provided by the vehicle interface device  to the portable device  when the portable device  and the vehicle interface device  are in communication, the portable device  is able to customize its user interface for the style of vehicle with which it is linked. When the portable device  is removed by the user and linked to another vehicle of another make or manufacturer, the portable device  may receive another set of customized style information  specific to the other vehicle, to customize its output according to that other vehicle's branding guidelines as defined by that vehicle's customized style information .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["40","22","14","22","12","41","22","12","30","22","41","22","12","41","22","12","12","22","30","12","22","42","43","30","12","44","12","14"]},"At step , if the connection process is successful, the communications link  is established between the interface device  and the portable device , and the method proceeds to step . At step , the vehicle interface device  provides or transmits customized style information  to the portable device , and the customized style information  is received and stored by the portable device . At step  the operating system  of the portable device  may use the customized style information  to modify the user interface projected to the HMI . In one non-limiting example, the built-in graphical elements of the operating system  may have the ability to take on different looks based on the customized style information . The operating system  may also have a default look when there is no customized style information  from a connected vehicle interface device . The resulting user interface of the portable device  is projected to the HMI  via a video output . The video output  may be, for example, a user interface of the portable device operating system , a graphical user interface of an application , or other form of graphical output from the portable device  which has been formatted by the portable device  using the customized style information  provided by the interface device  to the portable device  at step .","The customized style information  is specific to the vehicle interface device  and\/or the vehicle interface system , and may, in the non-limiting example shown in , include style information which is defined by the vehicle manufacturer and\/or defined by branding or styling guidelines according to one or more of the vehicle manufacturer, the vehicle brand, the vehicle make and the vehicle model. The customized style information  may include at least one of a font size, a font color, a font style, text alignment, a color, a shape, a background style, a border, a margin, spacing, alignment, and size which is defined by the interface device  and\/or vehicle interface system , and which, in a non-limiting example, may be identifiable to one or more of the vehicle brand, the vehicle make and the vehicle model. The customized style information may include at least one of a style rule, a style selector, and a style sheet. The style sheet, in a non-limiting example, may be configured as a subset or modification of a cascading style sheet (CSS), or may be otherwise configured to define those characteristics of the graphical elements of the operating system  of the portable device  which may be customized. In a non-limiting example, a standardized style sheet may be developed to be used by a plurality of smart phone operating systems, defining those characteristics of a phone projector user interface using one of the plurality of smart phone operating systems, which may be customized, such that the standardized style sheet including customized style information  for a vehicle interface device  may be provided by the vehicle interface device  to any smart phone  in communication with the vehicle interface device , wherein the smart phone  is configured with one of the plurality of smart phone operating systems for use by the smart phone  in customizing its user interface for display by the vehicle interface device .","At step , the portable device  outputs the customized interface  to the vehicle interface device  to be displayed by the HMI , such that the user interface of the portable device , now formatted using the customized style information , is displayed by the HMI . In a non-limiting example, the HMI  may include at least one of a head unit and a video projection screen.","At step , the user may elect to terminate or maintain the communications link . The user may elect to terminate the communications link , for example, when the portable device  is removed from the vehicle by the user, or when the user elects to use the portable device  directly, for example, when the user is a passenger in the vehicle. When the user elects, at step , to terminate the communications link , the communications link  may be discontinued at step  by removing the portable device  from the vehicle interface device  to terminate a wired connection, or by discontinuing a wireless connection, and at step , the vehicle user may be notified via the vehicle interface device  and\/or the HMI  that the communication link  has been terminated. At this point the portable device  may revert back to a default user interface and stop using the customized style information .","At step , the user may elect to maintain the communications link  providing continued access to the user interface of the portable device  through the HMI . At step , the vehicle user may request an application , which may be one of a plurality of applications , to be launched by the portable device , by selecting the application  from the customized interface of the portable device  projected on the HMI . The HMI  may include a touch screen through which the vehicle user may select the application , or the HMI  may provide other inputs by which application  may be selected, including but not limited to switches on the steering wheel, inputs for navigation unit or radio including hard buttons, knobs or switches, message center display switches, and speech recognition.","At step , the application  creates its application user interface, and the application user interface is modified and\/or formatted using the customized style information  to generate a customized application user interface, also referred to herein as a customized application interface. The application user interface may be, for example, a graphical user interface, a video, or other interface including graphical images. In a non-limiting example, the application user interface may be modified by the operating system  of the portable device  using the customized style information  to generate the customized application interface. In another non-limiting example, the application  may use the customized style information  to generate the customized application interface which is projected to the vehicle interface device . In yet another non-limiting example, the built-in graphical elements used by applications  resident on the portable device  to build the application's user interface may also have the ability to take on different looks based on the customized style information . These application graphical elements may also have a default look when there is no customized style information  from a connected vehicle interface device . At step , the customized application interface is outputted by the portable device  to the vehicle interface , and at step  the customized application interface is projected by the HMI  for display to and access by the vehicle user.","After completing use of the application , the method continues as shown in  at step , where the vehicle user may elect to terminate or maintain the communications link , where maintaining the communications link  may include selecting another of the applications  to be launched by the portable device . In this event, the process would continue as described previously, including selecting the application  at step , modifying the application user interface using the customized style information  and the operating system  and\/or application  to generate a customized application interface at step , outputting the customized application interface at step  to the vehicle interface device  from the portable device , and projecting the customized application interface using the HMI  at step .","Other configurations of the system and method described herein are possible. The system and method described herein may be implemented for a non-vehicle interface system projecting output from a portable device. For example, the non-limiting interface system may be a branded interface including a display provided for user convenience, such human machine interface provided to an airline passenger for use with the passenger's portable device, where the style selectors may be specified by the airline consistent with airline branding guidelines. In another non-limiting example, the interface system may be a transaction interface system for a financial transaction, such as a retail purchase or banking transaction, where the portable device may be in communication with the transaction interface system to enable use of a payment or financial transaction application resident on the portable device, and wherein the style selectors used to project the graphical user interface of the application on the transaction interface may be specified by the retailer or bank consistent with the retailer or bank's branding strategy.","While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
