Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a developer carrying member and a developing apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, service environments of electrophotographic image forming apparatus are becoming more diverse than ever. Accordingly, it has become important to provide a developer carrying member that can stably provide toners with triboelectric charges over a long period of time even in various environments. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-312136 discloses a toner carrying member having a surface layer containing a quaternary-ammonium-containing copolymer. Then it discloses that such a toner carrying member can provide toners with superior negative chargeability, can prevent after-images from occurring and can remedy any fogging on electrophotographic images.","The present inventors have made studies on the above toner carrying member. As the result, they have realized that it has not still any sufficient performance in providing toners with triboelectric charges in an environment of high humidity. They have also realized that there is room for improvement also about charge-providing performance to a toner standing immediately after an electrophotographic image forming apparatus having been left to stand stopped over a long period of time is again operated. Further, it is preferable for the surface of a developer carrying member to have an appropriate conductivity so that the toner can be prevented from being charged in excess (undergoing charge-up) to come to stick to the surface of the developer carrying member because of mirror force. In order to obtain a developer carrying member which exhibits stable performance in various environments, it is important to make the developer carrying member have these properties in a well-balanced state.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to provide a developer carrying member which can stably provide toners with triboelectric charges even in various environments. Further, the present invention is directed to provide an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, and a developing apparatus, that can stably form high-grade electrophotographic images even in various environments.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a developer carrying member comprising a substrate and a resin layer as a surface layer, wherein said resin layer comprises a thermosetting resin as a binder resin, an acrylic resin having units represented by the following formulas (1) and (2), and a conductive particle:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.61mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08059997-20111115-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"29.13mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US08059997-20111115-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["3 ","4 ","5","6 ","7 "],"sup":"\u2212"},"According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a developing apparatus comprising a developer having a toner particle contained in a developer container, and the afore-mentioned developer carrying member.","According to the present invention, the developer carrying member having the surface layer containing the acrylic resin having specific structures as described above can quickly stably provide the toner with uniform triboelectric charges. It can also keep the toner from being charged in excess (undergoing charge-up). Further, it makes its triboelectric charge-providing performance to toner not easily change even under conditions of high humidity.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.","Developer Carrying Member","The developer carrying member according to the present invention is described below.","The developer carrying member has, as shown in , a substrate  and a resin layer  as a surface layer. The resin layer  contains a thermosetting resin as a binder resin, an acrylic resin and conductive fine particles.","Thermosetting Resin:","That the resin layer  contains a thermosetting resin as a binder resin makes the resin layer have good durability and environmental stability. The thermosetting resin may preferably include phenol resins, melamine resins, urea resins and benzoguanamine resins. Of these, phenol resins are particularly preferred from the viewpoint of wear resistance and environmental stability of the resin layer, and from the viewpoint of compatibility with the acrylic resin, which is detailed later. Of these thermosetting resins, a type that is soluble in lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol is particularly preferred because of their good compatibility with the acrylic resin used in the present invention.","Acrylic Resin:","The acrylic resin contains at least an ester unit represented by the following formula (1) and a cationic unit represented by the following formula (2).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"22.52mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US08059997-20111115-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (1), Rrepresents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and Rrepresents an alkyl group having 8 to 18 carbon atoms. A form preferable as the ester unit represented by the formula (1) is that Ris a methyl group and Ris a long-chain alkyl group selected from a decyl group, an undecyl group, a dodecyl group, a tridecyl group and a tetradecyl group.","Then, inasmuch as the Rin the formula (1) is a long-chain alkyl group having 8 to 18 carbon atoms, the acrylic resin is improved in its compatibility with the thermosetting resin, and such an acrylic resin can uniformly be present in the binder resin with ease. This enables the developer carrying member according to the present invention to make the toner have more uniform triboelectric charges. In addition, pigments such as conductive particles can be improved in their dispersibility in the binder resin to make the developer carrying member less non-uniform in electrical resistance of its surface. This also acts effectively in making the toner have uniform triboelectric charges. If the Ris a lower alkyl group having 7 or less carbon atoms, the acrylic resin becomes higher in its polarity. That is, a greater difference in polarity may come between the acrylic resin and the thermosetting resin. Hence, the acrylic resin may come lower in its compatibility with the thermosetting resin, so that the acrylic resin may tend to be unevenly distributed in the resin layer. This acts disadvantageously in providing the toner with uniform triboelectric charges. This also makes the conductive particles tend to agglomerate in the resin layer, and hence acts disadvantageously in making the toner have uniform charge distribution. If on the other hand the Ris a long-chain alkyl group having 19 or more carbon atoms, the acrylic resin becomes more highly crystallizable to tend to cause phase separation between the thermosetting resin and the acrylic resin. In such a case, the acrylic resin tends to be so unevenly distributed in the resin layer as to be disadvantageous in providing the toner with uniform triboelectric charges.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"29.13mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US08059997-20111115-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (2), Rrepresents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and Rrepresents an alkylene group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

Also, such a quaternary ammonium base undergoes ionic dissociation in the resin layer to bring an improvement in conductivity of the resin layer. This enables the toner to be kept from being charged in excess, i.e., kept from a phenomenon of charge-up of the toner.","What is preferable as specific combination of the Rto Ris a cationic unit in which Ris any one selected from the group consisting of an octyl group, a nonyl group, a decyl group, an undecyl group, a dodecyl group, a tridecyl group and a tetradecyl group and Rand Rare each independently a methyl group, an ethyl group or a propyl group. This and the presence of the moiety of the formula (1) act together to make the resin layer much more improved and much more uniform in its performance of providing the toner with triboelectric charges. Also, inasmuch as at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of Rto Ris a long-chain alkyl group having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, the unit of the formula (2) can readily be present in a larger number on the surface side of the resin layer. Since the unit of the formula (2) is cationic, cationic units can consequently be in a large number on the resin layer surface to bring an improvement in negative charge-providing performance to the toner.","A is an anion of those in halogens, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid and organic acids such as carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids.

It may preferably be an anion containing a sulfur atom or a halogen atom, and may much preferably be a halogen such as Br or Cl.","As a process for producing the acrylic resin, any known polymerization process may be used. The process therefor may include bulk polymerization, solution polymerization, emulsion polymerization and suspension polymerization. Solution polymerization is preferred in view of an advantage that the reaction can be controlled with ease. A solvent used in the solution polymerization may include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-butanol and isopropyl alcohol. Besides, xylene, toluene and or like may also optionally be used in the form of a mixture. However, in view of improving the compatibility with the thermosetting resin used in the present invention, it is preferable to chiefly use a lower alcohol as the solvent. As the ratio of such a solvent to copolymerization monomer components, the solution polymerization may preferably be carried out using 30 parts by mass or more to 400 parts by mass or less of the copolymerization monomer components based on 100 parts by mass of the solvent.","The polymerization of such a monomer mixture may be carried out by, e.g., heating the monomer mixture in the presence of a polymerization initiator, in an atmosphere of an inert gas and at a temperature of from 50\u00b0 C. or more to 100\u00b0 C. or less. As examples of the polymerization initiator used for the polymerization, it may include the following: t-Butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, cumyl perpivarate, t-butyl peroxylaurate, benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, octanoyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, t-butylcumyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2\u2032-azobis-(2-methylbutyronitrile), 2,2\u2032-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), 2,2\u2032-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), and dimethyl 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-methyl propionate).","The polymerization initiator may be used alone or in combination of two or more types. Usually, the polymerization reaction is initiated with addition of the polymerization initiator to a monomer solution. However, in order to make any unreacted monomers less remain, part of the polymerization initiator may be added on the way of the polymerization. A method may also be employed in which the polymerization is accelerated by irradiation with ultraviolet rays or electron rays. These methods may also be combined. The polymerization initiator may preferably be used in an amount of from 0.05 part by mass or more to 30 parts by mass or less, and much preferably from 0.1 part by mass or more to 15 parts by mass or less, based on 100 parts by mass of the copolymerization monomer components.

A compound used as the quaternizing agent may include alkyl halides and organic acid compounds.","Examples of the alkyl halides are shown below: Butyl bromide, 2-ethylhexyl bromide, octyl bromide, lauryl bromide, stearyl bromide, butyl chloride, 2-ethylhexyl chloride, octyl chloride, lauryl chloride, stearyl chloride, etc. Examples of the organic acid compounds are shown below: Methyl p-toluenesulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, methyl hydroxynaphthalenesulfonate, etc.","The quaternizing agent may preferably be used in an amount of from 0.8 mole or more to 1.0 mole or less, per mole of the monomer represented by the formula (5). Such a monomer may be quaternized by, e.g., heating the monomer and the quaternizing agent to 60\u00b0 C. or more to 90\u00b0 C. or less in a solvent.","What has been obtained by copolymerizing the monomer of the formula (3) with the monomer of the formula (5) may also be further quaternized with the above quaternizing agent to obtain the desired quaternary ammonium base-containing acrylic copolymer. Besides, for example, the monomer represented by the formula (5) is quaternized with an alkyl halide such as methyl chloride and thereafter copolymerized with the monomer of the formula (3). The quaternary ammonium base-containing acrylic copolymer thus obtained may be treated with an acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or hydroxynaphthalenesulfonic acid to effect counter-ion exchange to obtain a quaternary ammonium base-containing acrylic copolymer made into the intended anionic species.","The respective units in the above acrylic resin may preferably be in such a compositional proportion that, where the number of the unit (1) and the number of the unit (2) in the acrylic resin are represented by a and b, respectively, the value of b\/(a+b) is 0.5 or more to 0.9 or less. Inasmuch as the value of b\/(a+b) is 0.5 or more, the acrylic resin is improved in its negative charge-providing performance and the effect of ionic conduction that is attributable to the quaternary ammonium base structure can be enhanced with ease. Hence, this brings an improvement in quick-charging performance to the toner. Inasmuch as the value of b\/(a+b) is 0.9 or less, the respective units can uniformly be present in the binder resin. This makes the acrylic resin well compatible with the binder resin to make the former readily uniformly present in the resin layer. Further, this makes well dispersible the conductive particles that are to be present in the resin layer. Incidentally, in the present invention, where any units satisfying the make-up of each of the units (1) and (2) are contained in plural kind in the acrylic resin, the total number of the plural kind of unit components satisfying the structure (1) and the total number of the plural kind of unit components satisfying the structure (2) are represented by the a and the b, respectively.","The acrylic resin may contain a unit(s) other than the units (1) and (2). Such other unit(s) that may be contained in the acrylic resin may preferably be in a content of 30 mole % or less of the total number (mole) of units making up the acrylic resin. Inasmuch as the other unit(s) is\/are in a content of 30 mole % or less, the effect due to the introduction of the units (1) and (2) can be obtained with ease.","The acrylic resin containing at least the units (1) and (2) may preferably be added in an amount of from 1 part by mass or more to 40 parts by mass or less, based on 100 parts by mass of the thermosetting resin as the binder resin. Its addition within this range can bring out the effect of charge control that is attributable to the addition, and also can make the acrylic resin uniformly present in the binder resin to enable the resin layer to retain its film strength.","In order to control resistance value of the resin layer, conductive particles including the following are incorporated in the resin layer. Examples of the conductive particles are shown below: Fine powder of metals (such as aluminum, copper, nickel and silver), particles of conductive metal oxides (such as antimony oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, molybdenum oxide and potassium titanate), crystalline graphite, all kind of carbon fibers, conductive carbon black, etc. of these, conductive carbon black and crystalline graphite are preferred because of their superior dispersibility and superior electrical conductivity. The above conductive particles may be used in the form of a mixture of two or more types. The conductive particles may also preferably be added in an amount of from 20 parts by mass or more to 100 parts by mass or less, based on the mass of the binder resin. Their addition within this range enables the resin layer to have resistivity at the desired level without damaging its strength.","The resin layer at the surface of the developer carrying member of the present invention may preferably have a volume resistivity of from 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. Inasmuch as its value is within this range, the developer can be prevented from sticking to the surface of the developer carrying member because of charge-up, or from being poorly provided with triboelectric charges from the surface of the developer carrying member because of charge-up of the developer.","In the present invention, roughening particles for forming surface unevenness may also be added to the resin layer in order to make its surface roughness uniform and also to maintain its appropriate surface roughness, whereby much preferable results can be obtained. As the roughening particles for forming surface unevenness that may be used in the present invention, spherical particles are preferred. Inasmuch as they are spherical particles, the desired surface roughness can be achieved by their addition in a smaller quantity than any amorphous particles (particles lacking definite form), and also uneven surface with uniform surface profile can be achieved. Further, the resin layer may less change in surface roughness even where the surface of the resin layer has worn, and the toner layer on the developer carrying member can not easily change in thickness. Thus, the toner can uniformly electrostatically be charged, any sleeve ghost can well be prevented, any lines and non-uniformity can not easily occur, and also any sleeve staining with toner and toner melt-sticking can be made not to easily occur on the developer carrying member. Such effects can be brought out over a long period of time.","Substrate:","As the substrate, a member such as a cylindrical member, a columnar member or a beltlike member may be used. In the case of a developer carrying member used in a developing method in which it is in non-contact with a photosensitive drum, a cylindrical tube or solid rod of a rigid body like a metal may preferably be used. Such a substrate may be a non-magnetic metal or alloy such as aluminum, stainless steel or brass molded in a cylindrical shape and thereafter subjected to abrasion and grinding, which may preferably be used.","In the case of a developer carrying member used in a developing method in which it is brought into direct contact with a photosensitive drum, a columnar substrate may preferably be used which is made up of a mandrel made of a metal and provided on its peripheral surface a layer containing a rubber or elastomer such as urethane, EPDM or silicone. In a developing method making use of a magnetic developer, a substrate of a cylindrical shape may be used and a magnet roller may be disposed in the interior of the substrate in order to magnetically attract the developer to, and hold it on, the developer carrying member.","Resin Layer:","The resin layer may be formed by, e.g., a method in which components for the resin layer are dispersed and mixed in a solvent to make up a coating fluid and the substrate is coated therewith on its surface, followed by drying to harden or cure the wet coating formed. In dispersing and mixing the components to make up the coating fluid, a known dispersion mixer making use of beads may preferably be used, such as a sand mill, a paint shaker, Daino mill and a ball mill. As a coating method, a known method may preferably be used, such as dipping, spraying or roll coating.","In the present invention, the resin layer may preferably have, as its surface roughness, an arithmetic-mean roughness Ra (JIS B 0601-2001) of from 0.3 \u03bcm or more to 2.5 \u03bcm or less, and much preferably from 0.4 \u03bcm or more to 2.0 \u03bcm or less. Inasmuch as the resin layer surface has Ra within this range, the level of transport of the developer by the developer carrying member can be made stabler, and also the resin layer can have good wear resistance and resistance to contamination by developer. The resin layer may also preferably have a thickness of 25 \u03bcm or less, much preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, and still much preferably from 4 \u03bcm or more to 20 \u03bcm or less. This is preferable in order to achieve a uniform layer thickness, to which, however, the thickness is not particularly limited.","Developing Apparatus","A developing apparatus in which the developer carrying member according to the present invention has been incorporated is described next.  is a sectional view of the developing apparatus according to the present invention. In what is shown in , an electrostatic latent image bearing member, e.g., an electrophotographic photosensitive drum , holding thereon an electrostatic latent image formed by a known process is rotated in the direction of an arrow B. A developer carrying member  carries thereon a one-component developer  having a magnetic toner fed through a hopper  serving as a developer container holding therein the developer, and is rotated in the direction of an arrow A. Thus, the developer  is transported to a developing zone D where the developer carrying member  and the photosensitive drum  face each other. As shown in , inside the developer carrying member (developing sleeve) , a magnet roller  internally provided with a magnet is provided so that the developer  can magnetically be attracted to and held on the developer carrying member .","The developer carrying member  has a metal cylindrical tube (substrate)  and provided thereon a resin layer  as a surface layer. Inside the hopper , an agitating blade  for agitating the developer  is provided. Reference numeral  denotes a gap, which shows that the developer carrying member  and the magnet roller  stands non-contact. The developer  gains triboelectric charges which enable development of the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum , as a result of the friction between magnetic toner particles one another which constitute the developer and between the developer and the resin layer  of the developer carrying member . In the example shown in , in order to control layer thickness of the developer  to be transported to the developing zone D, a magnetic control blade  made of a ferromagnetic metal, serving as a developer layer thickness control member, is used. The blade  vertically extends downwards from the hopper  in such a way that it faces on the developer carrying member  in a gap width of about 50 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm from the surface of the developer carrying member . The magnetic line of force exerted from a magnetic pole N of the magnet roller  is converged to the magnetic control blade  to thereby form on the developer carrying member  a thin layer of the developer . In the present invention, a non-magnetic blade may also be used in place of the magnetic control blade .","The thickness of the thin layer of the developer , thus formed on the developer carrying member , may preferably be much smaller than the minimum gap between the developer carrying member  and the photosensitive drum  in the developing zone D. It is especially effective to set the developer carrying member of the present invention in a developing apparatus of the type the electrostatic latent image is developed through such a developer thin layer, i.e., a non-contact type developing apparatus. The developer carrying member of the present invention may also be used in a developing apparatus of the type the thickness of the developer layer is not smaller than the minimum gap between the developer carrying member  and the photosensitive drum  in the developing zone D, i.e., a contact type developing apparatus. In the following description, to avoid complicacy of description, the non-contact type developing apparatus as described above is taken as an example.","In order to cause to fly the one-component developer  having a magnetic toner, carried on the developer carrying member , a development bias voltage is applied to the developer carrying member  through a development bias power source  serving as a bias applying means. When a DC voltage is used as this development bias voltage, a voltage having a value intermediate between the potential at electrostatic latent image areas (the region rendered visible upon attraction of the developer ) and the potential at back ground areas may preferably be applied to the developer carrying member .","In the case of what is called regular development, where a toner is attracted to high-potential areas of an electrostatic latent image having high-potential areas and low-potential areas, a toner chargeable to a polarity reverse to the polarity of the electrostatic latent image is used. In the case of what is called reverse development, where a toner is attracted to low-potential areas of an electrostatic latent image having high-potential areas and low-potential areas, a toner chargeable to the same polarity as the polarity of the electrostatic latent image is used. What is herein meant by the high-potential areas or the low-potential areas is expressed by the absolute value. In either case of these, the developer  is electrostatically charged upon its friction with at least the developer carrying member .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["511","504","508","511","511","508","511","508","508","508","508","504","508","514","511","517","508"]},"In what is shown in , a developer stripping member  is provided in addition to the above. As the developer stripping member, used are a roller-shaped member made of resin, rubber or sponge and further a belt-shaped member or a brush-shaped member. In what is shown in , such a roller-shaped developer stripping member  is rotated in the direction reverse to the rotational direction of the developer carrying member . The developer stripping member  strips off the surface of the developer carrying member  any developer having not moved to the electrostatic latent image bearing member  and also makes uniform the charging of the developer. Incidentally, the electrostatic latent image bearing member is hereinafter also termed \u201cphotosensitive member\u201d or \u201celectrophotographic photosensitive member\u201d. Also, in the example shown in , a cylindrical tube  made of a metal is used as the substrate of the developer carrying member .","In the developing assemblies shown in , construction other than the foregoing is the same as the developing apparatus shown in , and like reference numerals denote basically the like members.  are diagrammatic views each showing construction in which an elastic control member is provided in a developing apparatus making use of a magnetic toner.  diagrammatically exemplify to the last the developing assemblies of the present invention. Needless to say, there may be various modes of the shape of the developer container (the hopper ), the presence or absence of the agitating blade  and the arrangement of magnetic poles.","Developer","The developer (toner) is described below. Particles of the toner may be produced by a pulverization process or a polymerization process. Where they are produced by the pulverization process, any known method may be used. For example, components necessary for the toner, such as a binder resin, a magnetic material, a release agent, a charge control agent and optionally a colorant, and other additives, are thoroughly mixed by means of a mixer such as Henschel mixer or a ball mill. Thereafter, the mixture obtained is melt-kneaded by means of a heat kneading machine such as a heat roll, a kneader or an extruder, followed by cooling to solidify, then pulverization, thereafter classification, and optionally surface treatment to obtain toner particles. Either of the classification and the surface treatment may be first in order. In the step of classification, a multi-division classifier may preferably be used in order to improve production efficiency. The pulverization step may be carried out by using a known pulverizer such as a mechanical impact type or a jet type.","Such toner particles may be used after they have been subjected to sphering treatment or surface smoothing treatment by any method of various types, whereby it is observed that the magnetic material can more easily be enclosed in particles than in merely pulverized toner particles. This enables the developer to be improved in its transfer performance to keep, in virtue of its effect, the developer from being consumed in excess. As a method therefor, a method is available in which, using an apparatus having an agitating vane or blade and a liner or a casing, toner particles are made to pass through a micro-gap between the blade and the liner, where the surfaces of toner particles are made smooth, or toner particles are made spherical, by a mechanical force. Also, as a method for producing spherical toner particles directly, a method is available in which a mixture composed chiefly of monomers for forming the binder resin of toner particles is suspended in water and then polymerized to make it into toner particles. A commonly available method is a method in which a polymerizable monomer, a colorant, a polymerization initiator, and optionally a cross-linking agent, a charge control agent and other additives are uniformly dissolved or dispersed to prepare a monomer composition, and thereafter this monomer composition is dispersed by means of a suitable stirrer in a continuous phase, e.g., an aqueous medium, containing a dispersion stabilizer, to have a proper particle diameter, where polymerization reaction is further carried out to obtain toner particles having the desired particle diameter.","As toner particles having a high sphericity, it is preferable that, in toner particles having a circle-equivalent diameter of from 3 \u03bcm or more to 400 \u03bcm or less as measured with a flow type particle image analyzer, their average circularity is 0.970 or more. Inasmuch as the average circularity is 0.970 or more, the surfaces of individual toner particles can readily uniformly triboelectrically be charged to contribute to more improvement in charging uniformity. On the other hand, particles of a toner made to have a high sphericity tend to be charged in excess. However, the developer carrying member according to the present invention can well keep even such a toner from being charged in excess throughout its use at the initial stage up to image formation on a large number of sheets. This is considered due to the fact that the resin layer of the developer carrying member has a good conductivity because it contains the acrylic resin having the unit (2).","The toner may preferably have a weight average particle diameter of from 3 \u03bcm or more to 10 \u03bcm or less. Inasmuch as it has weight average particle diameter within this range of numerical values, transfer residual toner can be made less remain on the photosensitive member. Such a toner can also be kept from lowering in fluidity and agitation performance required as a powder, and hence the individual toner particles can readily uniformly be charged.","For the purpose of improving triboelectric charge characteristics, a charge control agent may be used in the developer (toner) by incorporating the former in toner particles (internal addition) or blending it with toner particles (external addition). As a positive charge control agent, it may include the following: Nigrosine, triaminotriphenylmethane dyes, and modified products thereof, modified with a fatty acid metal salt; quaternary ammonium salts such as tributylbenzylammonium 1-hydroxy-4-naphthosulfonate and tetrabutylammonium teterafluoroborate. Any of these may be used alone or in combination of two or more types. As a negative charge control agent, an organometallic compound or a chelate compound is effective. As examples thereof, it may include acetylacetonatoaluminum, acetylacetonatoiron(II) and chromium 3,5-di-tertiary-butylsalicylate. In particular, acetylacetone metal complexes, monoazo metal complexes, naphthoic acid, and salicylic acid type metal complexes or salts are preferred.","Where the developer (toner) is a magnetic developer (toner), a magnetic material is mixed. The magnetic material may include the following:\n\n","The above magnetic material may serve also as a colorant. As a colorant to be mixed in the developer (toner), any pigment or dye used conventionally in the present field may be used, which may be used under appropriate selection.","A release agent may preferably be mixed in the developer (toner). The release agent may include the following: Aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes such as low-molecular weight polyethylene, low-molecular weight polypropylene, microcrystalline wax and paraffin wax; and waxes composed chiefly of a fatty ester, such as carnauba wax, Fischer-Tropsch wax, sasol wax and montan wax.","In order to improve environmental stability, charging stability, developing performance, fluidity and storage stability and to improve cleaning performance, it is preferable to externally add an inorganic fine powder such as silica, titanium oxide or alumina powder to developer (toner) particles, i.e., to make it present on the surfaces of developer (toner) particles.","The inorganic fine powder may be added in such an amount of from 0.1% by mass to 5.0% by mass, and preferably from 0.5% by mass to 4.0% by mass, in the toner. Such an external additive may be used in combination of various types. An external additive(s) other than the inorganic fine powder may further be added. The external additive(s) other than the inorganic fine powder may include lubricants such as polytetrafluoroethylene, zinc stearate and polyvinylidene fluoride (in particular polyvinylidene fluoride), and also cerium oxide, strontium titanate and strontium silicate.","How to measure physical properties concerning the present invention is described next.","(1) Measurement of Arithmetic-Mean Roughness (Ra) of Developer Carrying Member Surface:","The arithmetic-mean roughness of the developer carrying member surface is measured according to JIS B0601 (2001) \u201cSurface Roughness\u201d, using SURFCORDER SE-3500, manufactured by Kosaka Laboratory, Ltd., and under conditions of a cut-off of 0.8 mm, a measurement distance of 8 mm and a feed rate of 0.5 mm\/s. Measured at the positions of 3 spots which are at the middle and coated resin layer both end portions of the developer carrying member in its lengthwise direction, 3 spots which are at the middle and both end portions of the same developer carrying member in its lengthwise direction at its position rotated by 90\u00b0 from the first-measured position, and 3 spots which are at the middle and both end portions of the same developer carrying member in its lengthwise direction at its position further rotated by 90\u00b0, i.e., 9 spots in total. Then, their arithmetic-mean value is taken as the arithmetic-mean roughness (Ra) of the developer carrying member surface.","(2) Measurement of Volume Resistivity of Resin Layer of Developer Carrying Member:","A resin layer of 7 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm thick is formed on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet of 100 \u03bcm thick, and its volume resistivity is measured with a resistivity meter LORESTAR AP (manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), using a four-terminal probe. Measured in an environment of a temperature of 20 to 25\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 50 to 60% RH.","(3) Volume Average Particle Diameter of Conductive Particles Added to Developer Carrying Member Resin Layer:","This is measured with a laser diffraction particle size distribution meter \u201cCoulter LS-230 Particle Size Distribution Meter\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.). In the measurement, a small-level module is used and, as a measuring solvent, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is used. First, the inside of a measuring system of the measuring instrument is washed with the IPA for about 5 minutes, and background function is executed after the washing. Next, about 10 mg of a measuring sample is added to 50 ml of IPA. The solution in which the sample has been suspended is subjected to dispersion by means of an ultrasonic dispersion machine for about 2 minutes to obtain a sample fluid. Thereafter, the sample fluid is slowly added to the interior of the measuring system of the measuring instrument, and the sample concentration in the measuring system is so adjusted as to be 45% to 55% as PIDS (polarization intensity differential scattering) on the screen of the instrument. Thereafter, measurement is made, and volume average particle diameter calculated from volume distribution is determined.","(4) Measurement of Volume Resistivity of Conductive Fine Particles:","The particles are put in an aluminum ring of 40 mm in diameter, and then press-molded under 2,500 N. In a low-resistance region, the volume resistivity of the molded product obtained is measured with a resistivity meter LORESTAR AP (manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation) using a four-terminal probe. In a medium\/high-resistance region, it is measured with a resistivity meter HIRESTAR IP (manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation) using a ring electrode probe. Measuring environment is set at 20 to 25\u00b0 C. and 50 to 60% RH.","(5) Measurement of Particle Diameter of Toner:","Coulter counter Multisizer II (manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.) is used as a measuring instrument. As an electrolytic solution, an aqueous about 1% NaCl solution is prepared using first-grade sodium chloride. As a method of measurement, 0.5 ml of an alkylbenzenesulfonate as a dispersant is added to 100 ml of the above aqueous electrolytic solution, and further 10 mg of a measuring sample is added. The electrolytic solution in which the sample has been suspended is subjected to dispersion for about 1 minute in an ultrasonic dispersion machine. The volume and number of the measuring sample are measure to calculate its volume distribution and number distribution, by means of the above measuring instrument and using a 100 \u03bcm aperture or 30 \u03bcm aperture as its aperture. From the results obtained, weight-base weight average particle diameter (D4) (the middle value of each channel is used as the representative value for each channel) determined from volume distribution is determined.","(6) Average Circularity of Toner Particles:","The average circularity referred to in the present invention is used as a simple method for expressing the shape of particles quantitatively. In the present invention, the shape of particles is measured with a flow type particle image analyzer FPIA-1000, manufactured by Toa Iyou Denshi K. K., and circularity (Ci) of each particle measured on a group of particles having a circle-equivalent diameter of 3 \u03bcm or more is individually determined according to the following expression.\n\nCircularity (Ci)=(circumferential length of a circle with the same projected area as particle image)\/(circumferential length of particle projected image)\n","As further shown in the following expression, the value obtained when the sum total of circularity of all particles measured is divided by the number of all particles is defined to be the average circularity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0105"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Average","circularity"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"C"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":["Ci","m"],"mo":"\/"}}],"mo":"="}}}},"The measuring instrument \u201cFPIA-1000\u201d used in the present invention employs, in calculating the circularity of each particle and thereafter calculating the average circularity and modal circularity, the following method. It is a method in which particles are divided into classes where the circularities of from 0.40 to 1.00 have been divided into 61 ranges at an interval of 0.010 in accordance with the resultant circularities, and the average circularity is calculated using the center values and frequencies of divided points. Between the values of the average circularity as calculated by this calculation method and the values of the average circularity as calculated by the above calculation equation which uses the circularity of each particle directly, there is only a very small accidental error, which is at a level that is substantially negligible. Accordingly, in the present invention, such a calculation method in which the concept of the calculation equation which uses the above circularity of each particle directly is utilized and is partly modified is used, for the reasons of handling data, e.g., making the calculation time short and making the operational equation for calculation simple. The circularity referred to in the present invention is an index showing the degree of surface unevenness of particles. It is indicated as 1.000 when the particles are perfectly spherical. The complicate the developer particle surface shape is, the smaller the value of circularity is.","As a specific measuring method, in 10 ml of water in which about 0.1 mg of a surface-active agent has been dissolved, about 5 mg of the developer is dispersed to prepare a dispersion. Then the dispersion is exposed to ultrasonic waves (20 kHz, 50 W) for 5 minutes. The dispersion is made to have a concentration of from 5,000 particles\/\u03bcl to 20,000 particles\/\u03bcl, where the measurement is made using the above analyzer to determine the average circularity of particles having a circle-equivalent diameter of 3 \u03bcm or more. The summary of measurement is described in a catalog of FPIA-1000 (an issue of June, 1995), published by Toa Iyou Denshi K. K., and in an operation manual of the measuring instrument, and is as follows:","The sample dispersion is passed through channels (extending along the flow direction) of a flat flow cell (thickness: about 200 \u03bcm). A strobe and a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera are so fitted as to position oppositely to each other with respect to the flow cell so as to form a light path that passes crosswise with respect to the thickness of the flow cell. During the flowing of the sample dispersion, the dispersion is irradiated with strobe light at intervals of 1\/30 seconds in order to obtain an image of the particles flowing through the cell, so that a photograph of each particle is taken as a two-dimensional image having a certain range parallel to the flow cell. From the area of the two-dimensional image of each particle, the diameter of a circle having the same area is calculated as the circle-equivalent diameter. The circularity of each particle is calculated from the projected area of the two-dimensional image of each particle and from the circumferential length of the projected image according to the above equation for calculating the circularity.","The reason why in this measurement the circularity is measured only on the group of particles having a circle-equivalent diameter of 3 \u03bcm or more is that a group of particles of external additives that is present independently from toner particles are included in a large number in a group of particles having a circle-equivalent diameter of less than 3 \u03bcm, which may affect the measurement not to enable any accurate estimation of the circularity on the group of toner particles.","(7) How to Analyze Resin:","The structure of polymer of the acrylic resin is determined by analyzing with a pyrolytic GC\/MS (gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry) analyzer VOYAGER (trade name; manufactured by Thermo Electron Inc.) a sample obtained by scraping the resin layer of the developer carrying member.

That is, as to each Example, the resin layer of the developer carrying member was improved in its hydrophobicity because a long-chain alkyl group having 8 to 18 carbon atoms and a long-chain alkyl group having 4 to 18 carbon atoms were introduced into the ester unit (1) and the cationic unit (2), respectively, which constitute the acrylic resin. Hence, electrophotographic images having a high image density were obtained stably even in the H\/H environment. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples 5 and 7, each making use of a developing roller incorporated with an acrylic resin the cationic unit and ester unit of which did not have any long-chain alkyl group, the image density was seen to come greatly low in the H\/H environment. In addition, solid images reproduced 5 days after the running test was finished also resulted in a low image density.","In virtue of the introduction of the long-chain alkyl group into the ester unit (1), the acrylic resin was improved in its compatibility with the binder resin thermosetting resin. Hence, this enabled the toner to be provided with uniform triboelectric charges, so that the toner was kept from coming charged in excess or low charged. In virtue of these effects, the present invention was achievable of the level C or higher about the ghosts, the level B or higher about the blotches and the level C or higher about the fog, even in various environments. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples 1 and 2, which differ from Example 1 in that each made use of an acrylic resin containing an ester unit not having any long-chain alkyl group, the acrylic resin had an insufficient dispersibility in the thermosetting resin. Hence, the images reproduced in the L\/L environment were seen to have caused blotches at the level D as well as fog.","Further, in virtue of the introduction of the long-chain alkyl group into the quaternary ammonium base of the cationic unit (2), the developer carrying member was more improved in charge-providing performance to the toner. As the result, the images reproduced at the initial stage, after reproduction on 15,000 sheets and 5 days after reproduction on 15,000 sheets were stably achievable of the level C or higher in every environment, in light of their evaluation criteria. On the other hand, in the developer carrying members according to Comparative Examples 3, 5 and 7, the cationic unit (2) of the acrylic resin in each of their resin layers did not have any long-chain alkyl group, and hence any sufficient charge-providing ability was obtainable. Hence, the image densities of solid images reproduced at the 5th day after reproduction on 15,000 sheets were all at the level E or lower.","In the developer carrying member according to Comparative Example 9, the resin layer the acrylic resin did not contain any acrylic resin, and hence its charge-providing ability was so low that the image densities of solid images reproduced after 15,000-sheet running evaluation and 5 days thereafter were all at the level F.","A mixture of the following materials was prepared.

With this coating fluid, a cylindrical tube made of aluminum and having an outer diameter of 24.5 mm, which was stood upright, masked at its top and bottom portions and rotated at a constant speed, was coated while a spray gun was descended at a constant speed, to form a resin layer on the tube. Subsequently, the resin layer was hardened by heating it for 40 minutes in a 150\u00b0 C. hot-air drying oven, to produce a developer carrying member, S-20. Make-up of the resin layer of the developer carrying member S-20 is shown in Table 7.","A magnet roller was inserted to the developer carrying member S-20 obtained, and this developer carrying member was mounted, as a developing roller, to a developing apparatus of a digital composite machine (trade name: iR5075N; manufactured by CANON INC.). Here, its gear ratio was so changed that the peripheral speed of the developer carrying member with respect to the peripheral speed of the photosensitive drum came to 125%. The gap between its magnetic doctor blade and the developer carrying member was set to 280 \u03bcm.

Thereafter, the machine was switched on, and solid black images were reproduced. The toner carried on the developer carrying member at this point was collected by suction through a metal cylindrical tube and a cylindrical filter, where toner charge quantity per unit mass Q\/M (mC\/kg) and toner transport quantity per unit area M\/S (g\/m) were calculated from the charge quantity Q accumulated in a capacitor through the metal cylindrical tube, the mass M of the toner collected and the area S over which the toner was sucked. The values found are taken as \u201cQ\/M(1)\u201d and \u201cM\/S(1)\u201d, respectively.","Next, in the N\/L environment, character images of 4% in print percentage were reproduced on 500,000 sheets in A4-breadthwise paper feed, and subsequently solid black images were reproduced. About the toner carried on the developer carrying member at this point, the Q\/M and the M\/S were calculated in the same way as the above. The values found are taken as \u201cQ\/M(2)\u201d and \u201cM\/S(2)\u201d, respectively. Further thereafter, the digital composite machine was left for 5 days in the N\/L environment in the state it was disconnected. Then the machine was again switched on, and solid black images were reproduced. The Q\/M and M\/S of the toner carried on the developer carrying member at this point were calculated in the same way as the above. The values found are taken as \u201cQ\/M(3)\u201d and \u201cM\/S(3)\u201d, respectively.","A series of the above evaluation was also made in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment (23\u00b0 C., 50% RH; N\/N) and in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment (32\u00b0 C., 85% RH; H\/H). \u201cQ\/M(1)\u201d \u201cQ\/M(2)\u201d and \u201cQ\/M(3)\u201d in each environment and the rates of change (1) and (2) in \u201cQ\/M(2)\u201d and \u201cQ\/M(3)\u201d with respect to \u201cQ\/M(1)\u201d are shown in Table 8.

The image densities were measured with \u201cMacbeth Reflection Densitometer RD918\u201d, manufactured by Macbeth Co.), where relative density with respect to the images on a white background portion of 0.00 in print density was measured.","A: 1.40 or more.","B: 1.35 or more to less than 1.40.","C: 1.30 or more to less than 1.35.","D: 1.25 or more to less than 1.30.","E: 1.00 or more to less than 1.25.","F: Less than 1.00.","(3) Halftone (HT) Uniformity:","Misty tone non-uniformity that may occur in halftone images, which tends to occur because of any non-uniform charge quantity distribution of the toner or any excess charging of the toner, was visually observed to make evaluation by the following criteria.","A: Any tone non-uniformity is not seen at all both on images and on the sleeve.","B: A slight difference in density is ascertainable on halftone images, but is little ascertainable at a glance.","C: A difference in density is ascertainable on halftone images, but at a level of no problem on solid black images.","D: A band perceivable of a difference in density is ascertainable on halftone images, but only a slight difference in density is seen on solid black images.","E: A difference in density which is clearly measurable with reflection densitometer appears on halftone images, and a difference in density is visually seen also on solid black images.","(4) Fog:","The reflectance of solid white images in proper images was measured and further the reflectance of a virgin transfer sheet was measured to make evaluation on fog, which tends to occur because of any excess charging or non-uniform charging of the toner. The value of (worst value of reflectance of solid white image)\u2212(average value of reflectance of virgin transfer sheet) was found as fog density. The results of valuation are shown by the following criteria. Here, the reflectance was measured at 10 spots picked at random. The reflectance was measured with TC-6DS (manufactured by Tokyo Denshoku Co., Ltd.).","A: Less than 0.5%.","B: 0.5% or more to less than 1.0%.","C: 1.0% or more to less than 2.0%.","D: 2.0% or more to less than 3.0%.","E: 3.0% or more to less than 4.0%.","F: 4.0% or more.","(5) Image Quality:","The evaluation of image quality was made as evaluation on spots around minute fine-line images, concerned with the image quality of graphical images. Line reproducibility and toner spots around lines in the printing of one-dot line images, which more tends to cause spots around line images than when character lines cause spots around line images, were evaluated under magnification of images by 30 times with use of a magnifier.","A: Spots around line images little occur, showing a good line reproducibility.","B: Slight spots around line images are seen.","C: Spots around line images are seen, but not much affect line reproducibility.","D: Conspicuous spots around line images are seen, showing a poor line reproducibility.","Developer carrying members S-26 to S-28 and S-44 and S-46 were produced in the same way as in Example 25 but under formulation shown in Table 9, and were evaluated in the same way.
