{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["Government has rights in this invention, pursuant to Contract No. NAS3-00177 awarded by NASA.","The present invention relates to a novel heat exchanger panel which has particular utility in high temperature environments, such as in air breathing and rocket propulsion systems.","One method for fabricating a high temperature capability composite heat exchanger comprised processing or densifying a composite material with high temperature capability and metallic coolant containment tubes integrally assembled into the composite. This method required the use of expensive and high density (heavy) metal tubes which could not be removed for inspection or replacement. As a result, these old heat exchangers were heavy, costly, difficult to inspect, and virtually impossible to maintain.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a heat exchanger panel which is less complex, lighter, and less expensive to manufacture.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide a heat exchanger panel as above which is high temperature capable.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a heat exchanger panel as above which is easy to inspect and repair.","It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a heat exchanger panel as above which has utility in air breathing and rocket propulsion systems.","The foregoing objects are attained by the heat exchanger panels of the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a high temperature capable heat exchanger panel is provided. The heat exchanger panel broadly comprises a first panel, a second panel, and at least one fluid containment device positioned intermediate the first and second panels. At least one of the first panel and the second panel have at least one feature on an interior surface to accommodate the at least one fluid containment device which is separable from and independent of the first and second panels.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each of the first and second panels is formed from a high conductivity, high temperature composite material such as a high conductivity, high temperature carbon\/carbon composite material and\/or a high conductivity, high temperature carbon\/silicon carbide composite material.","Also, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first and second panels are joined together by one or more composite fasteners. The fasteners may also be used to join a heat exchange panel in accordance with the present invention to a substructure.","Other details of the heat exchanger panel of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrate a heat exchanger panel  in accordance with the present invention. The heat exchanger panel  includes a first panel , a second panel , and a fluid containment device  positioned intermediate the first and second panels  and . The fluid containment device  may be formed from any suitable metallic and\/or non-metallic materials known in the art, such as composite materials. In accordance with the present invention, the fluid containment device  is not fastened to either panel  or panel  in any manner. Rather, it is merely sandwiched between the panels  and .","The panel  further includes one or more fasteners  for joining the first and second panels  and  together and\/or for joining the heat exchanger panel  to a substructure , such as a load carrying substructure. When the panels  and  are joined together in this manner, they hold the fluid containment device  in place.","In order to enable the heat exchanger panel  to be used in a high temperature environment, such as a wall panel for a scramjet engine or a rocket engine, each of the panels  and  is formed from a lightweight, high conductivity, high temperature capable composite material, preferably a non-metallic composite material. Suitable high conductivity, high temperature materials for the panels  and  include, but are not limited to, high conductivity, high temperature carbon\/carbon and\/or carbon\/silicon carbide composite materials. Carbon\/silicon carbide composite materials preferably are used only in situations where the temperature encountered by the panel(s) does not exceed 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. In accordance with the present invention, each of the panels  and  may be a simple monolithic sheet of material. Such sheets are advantageous in that they do not require expensive tooling and are not labor intensive to fabricate. Yet another advantage is that the aforementioned composite materials may be densified to be at least 75 to 80% dense using any number of common techniques known in the art and may be easily coated with an oxidation resistant material. Both densification and coating may be performed prior to installation of any fluid containment device .","In order to accommodate and position the fluid containment device , an interior surface  of each of the panels  and  is provided with a surface feature  which conforms to the exterior shape of the fluid containment device. For example, in the heat exchanger panel embodiment of , the fluid containment device  may comprise a plurality of parallel fluid passageways or tubes  connected to fluid inlet and outlet manifolds (not shown). In this embodiment, the surface feature  comprises a plurality of arched portions or grooves for receiving conforming the interior surface  to the exterior shape of the tubes .","While it is preferred to have appropriate surface features on each of the interior surfaces  of the panels  and , it should be noted that one could design a heat exchange panel so that the interior surface  of the panel  has a surface feature , while the interior surface  of the panel  is planar or flat.","While the tubes  have been shown as having circular cross-sections, it should be realized that they could have other cross-sectional shapes. When such other cross-sectional shapes are used, the surface feature(s)  are shaped to conform to the shape of the tubes .","In the embodiment of , the fluid containment device  may comprise two metallic sheets  which are formed to create fluid passages and which are brazed, bonded, or welded at the contact points. As before, the fluid passages may be joined to fluid inlet and outlet manifolds (not shown). In this embodiment, the surface features  on the panels  and  comprise a plurality of arched portions separated by planar portions  to accommodate the metallic sheets .","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the fluid containment device  may be a metallic heat exchanger  having thin planar face sheets to minimize weight. In this embodiment, the fluid passages in the metallic heat exchanger  may be joined to integrally formed fluid inlet and outlet manifolds (not shown). In this embodiment, the surface feature  is a planar interior surface feature on each of the panels  and  because there is no need to accommodate tubular cooling arrays.","The composite material panels  and  used in the heat exchanger panel  may be woven to minimize labor costs. The surface features  required to accommodate the fluid containment device  may be woven in to avoid machining and cutting fibers, if they can not be molded. If conductivity is an issue, a 2D lay-up could be used in order to cut down on the through thickness conduction.","Where high through the thickness conductivity is desired, a pitch fiber may be used in the composite materials forming the panels  and  and heat set after 3-D weaving to drive the conductivity as high as possible, while still allowing for weaving.","As previously mentioned, the panels  and  of the heat exchanger panel  are joined together by one or more fasteners . Each of the fasteners  is preferably formed from a high temperature capable composite material. Suitable composite fasteners which may be used are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,042,315 and 6,045,310, both to Miller et al., which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. As shown in , each of the fasteners  has an enlarged head portion  and a rectangularly or square shaped shaft . The shaft  is received by a rectangularly or square shaped orifice  in a metal sleeve . The metal sleeve  has an exterior thread  and a bore  for receiving a locking pin . The locking pin  is inserted through the bore  into a bore  in the shaft , thereby securing the sleeve  and the fastener  together.","Referring now to , the panel  has a countersunk bore  for receiving the head portion  of the fastener . The panels  and  and the substructure or back structure  having mating bores  for receiving the shaft  of the fastener . To secure each fastener  in place and thus secure the panels  and  and the substructure  together, a nut  is threaded onto the sleeve . The use of the composite fasteners  allows the panel  to be mechanically assembled and disassembled periodically for inspection and maintenance and to allow easy removal of the fluid containment device  or portions thereof.","The fluid containment devices  described herein may be used to transfer a coolant fluid through its passages. Alternatively, they may be used in some situations to heat or pre-warm a fluid, such as fuel, to be delivered to a portion of a propulsion system.","As can be seen from the foregoing description, the two piece heat exchanger panel of the present invention sandwiches the fluid containment device\/manifold system and utilizes low cost composite materials and fabrication techniques. The material thickness of the panel  may be minimal, since it is for fluid\/coolant containment only. The weight of the fluid containment device  is not a large contributor to the weight of the panel . Thin conductive foils or paste could be used in areas where voids exist to enhance thermal conduction. This, in addition to thermal expansion and flowpath pressure, should result in good thermal conductivity from the composite to the fluid\/coolant. One advantage to the panel of the present invention is that the panels  and , when heated and\/or pressurized, will conform to the coolant passage contour of the composite resulting in good thermal conduction.","The heat exchanger panel  of the present invention has utility in a wide range of air breathing propulsion systems such as jet turbine engines, ramjet engines and, in particular, a scramjet engine such as that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,333,445, which is incorporated by reference herein. A number of portions of such air breathing propulsion engines are subjected to extreme temperatures and require cooling. These portions include the cowl wall and the engine sidewalls of a scramjet engine amongst others. Also, the heat exchanger panel  may be used in rocket propulsion systems.  illustrate one way in which a wall , such as a cowl wall, can be provided with a heat exchanger panel  in accordance with the present invention.","As can be seen from these figures, a wall , such as the cowl wall, may have a leading edge , an inlet section , a combustion panel section , and a nozzle section . The leading edge  may be formed from any suitable high temperature composite material known in the art, preferably a non-metallic composite material. Each of the sections , , and  may be formed from a heat exchanger panel in accordance with the present invention. For example, each of the sections , , and  may have a first or hot panel  formed from a high conductivity, high temperature capable composite material which forms the hot side of the wall, a second panel  formed from a composite material which forms a lower cold wall, and a coolant containment system  comprising a plurality of tubes or fluid passageways  which extend between a coolant inlet manifold (not shown) and a coolant outlet manifold (not shown). As can be seen from , the tubes or fluid passageways  run parallel to a longitudinal axis of the wall . A first one of the manifolds may communicate with inlet tubes  for introducing a coolant into the tubes or fluid passageways . A second one of the manifolds may communicate with outlet tubes  through which heated coolant can be removed from the tubes or fluid passageways . The heated coolant may be passed through a heat exchanger (not shown) to be cooled and recycled.","The panels  and  may be formed as discussed above and may be provided with appropriate surface features for accommodating the tubes  of the coolant containment system . Each of the panels  and  may be formed from a composite material selected from a group consisting of a carbon\/carbon composite material and a carbon\/silicon carbide composite material. The panels  and  may be joined to each other and to a substructure or back structure  using the composite fasteners  in the manner discussed above. The substructure  may be formed from any suitable metallic or non-metallic material known in the art. Typically, the substructure  will be formed by a hollow metallic structure.","The combustion panel section  may also be used to distribute cooled fuel into a space bounded by the wall  of the air breathing propulsion system. To this end, the combustion panel section  may be provided with one or more fuel supply tubes  which are each connected to a manifold  which extend transverse to the longitudinal axis of the wall . As shown in , each manifold  may be situated within the substructure  and may communicate with a plurality of injection nozzles  through which heated fuel is injected into the engine. As shown in , the injection nozzles  may terminate flush with the surface  or relatively close to the surface , i.e. less than 0.010 inches below the surface , of the hot panel  of the combustion panel section . Alternatively, as shown in , the injection nozzles  may extend through the hot panel  of the combustion panel section  and have their outlets above the surface . If desired, the substructure or back structure  may be slotted in the area of each injection nozzle  to allow for thermal differential growth between the cold panel  and the substructure or back structure . Further, each hot panel  has a plurality of openings  with each injection nozzle  having its outlet aligned with one of the openings .","In some instances, it may be desirable to not have a continuous cold panel . In such situations, a discontinuous cold panel  may be utilized. As shown in , in lieu of a continuous cold panel , local supports or spacers  may be used to maintain separation between the fluid passageways or tubes  in the fluid containment system . The spacers  are preferably joined to the substructure or back structure . If desired, however, the spacers  may be joined to the underside of the hot panel . Any suitable means known in the art may be used to join the spacers  to the substructure or back structure  or the panel . If desired, the spacers  may be integrally formed with the substructure . In this type of system, the hot panel  may be joined to the substructure  directly via the composite fasteners  in the manner previously mentioned herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["106","104","108","122","90","102","102","108"]},"In the wall system of , the inlet, combustion panel, and nozzle sections , , and  have been shown as being separate heat exchanger panels. If desired, these sections could be formed from a single heat exchanger panel  which extends from a point  near the leading edge  to a trailing edge point . The single heat exchanger panel would have a single hot panel  and a single cold panel  which extends from the point  to the point . In such an embodiment, the fluid\/coolant containment system  may extend from an inlet manifold adjacent one of the points  and  to an outlet manifold adjacent the other of the points  and . A fuel injection system such as those discussed above may be placed anywhere along the panel as required.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the wall  may be formed by a heat exchanger panel which has a cold panel  that extends from the point  to the point  and a hot panel  which is made up of a plurality of sections as shown in FIG. . Such an arrangement has the advantage that if a particular area of the heat exchanger panel  has to be inspected, only one of the hot panels  needs be removed.","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a heat exchanger panel which fully satisfies the objects, means, and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations which fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
