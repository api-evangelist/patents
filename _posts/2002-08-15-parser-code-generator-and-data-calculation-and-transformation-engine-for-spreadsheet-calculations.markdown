{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of appln. 60\/312,981 filed Aug. 16, 2001.","The present invention pertains in general to software based calculation and data transformation engines, and more particularly, to conversion of the calculation and data transformation features of spreadsheet data into source code of a target software development language for independent run-time execution.","Spreadsheet applications for computers, such as IBM's Lotus 123\u00ae and Microsoft\u00ae Excel, have become very popular analysis and communication tools. Spreadsheets are typically used to perform numerical analyses and \u2018what if\u2019 analyses, to simulate complex systems, and to communicate ideas. Many users are familiar with the spreadsheet metaphor. With little or no training, users can create complex, interrelated calculations and data transformations in spreadsheet applications.","The rapid growth and adoption of the Internet has spawned an explosion in web-based distribution of application functionality and server-based applications. Many such distributed and server-based applications have underlying logic that comprises complex calculations and data transformations. Development of such functionality in software language source code can be effort intensive, tedious, and error-prone. Furthermore, creating such functionality requires highly skilled software developers.","Being able to embed the calculations and data transformations of a spreadsheet directly into stand-alone applications, distributed applications, and server-based applications can be very powerful. Some spreadsheet applications have application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow them to provide calculation and data transformation as a service to other applications. But distributing and using spreadsheets in this way requires that users have the same or a compatible spreadsheet application as the one in which the spreadsheet was created.","Using spreadsheet applications as calculation engines in server-based applications also has limitations. Background art spreadsheet applications are meant for single users and cannot scale to support high-volume server-side processing. Also, the User Interface and display features of spreadsheet applications carry significant overhead.","There are background art spreadsheet components available that can read and write spreadsheet data created by popular spreadsheet applications and perform calculations at runtime. These components do facilitate the integration of spreadsheet functionality into other distributed applications or server-based applications. But these components operate internally in the same way spreadsheet applications do: they interpret Cell formulas at runtime. Runtime interpretation of Cell formulas is generally considered to be a desirable feature because it allows Cell formulas to be changed at runtime. But in many application scenarios, calculations and data transformations need to remain unchanged at runtime. So when a spreadsheet component is used as a calculation engine in such an application, then the runtime Cell formula interpretation feature adds memory and processing overhead without adding any value. Background art spreadsheet components are typically larger than 1 Megabyte in size.","When using background art spreadsheet components in server-based applications, the overhead associated with the User Interface and runtime cell formula interpretation features can negatively impact server performance, both from processing speed and memory usage standpoints. When using background art spreadsheet components in distributed applications, the overhead can also significantly degrade download performance.","Some spreadsheet applications and spreadsheet components use mechanisms to represent simple cell formulas as machine code during idle time processing. While this can reduce the negative performance impact related to run-time cell formula interpretation, it maintains the memory overhead and it can limit the spreadsheet application or spreadsheet component to running on only a single platform.","It would be desirable to provide a facility for automatically generating source code from spreadsheet data such that the generated source code embodies the calculations and data transformations embodied in the spreadsheet data. The generated source code may then be integrated into a wide variety of different types of applications or other utilization mechanisms. The calculations and data transformation may allow features to be accessed by users who do not have a spreadsheet application or spreadsheet component, or who have a spreadsheet application or spreadsheet component that is incompatible with the original spreadsheet application. The calculations and data transformation may protect features from being modified accidentally or deliberately. Thus, spreadsheet applications may be used as design tools for creating and testing complex, interrelated calculation functionality for use in a wide variety of applications. The calculations and data transformation allows features to be embedded into high-volume server architectures, such as mainframe computers or super computers, that are not fully supported by background art spreadsheet applications or components. Moreover, the calculations and data transformation may allow features to be embedded into disparate or distributed computing environments, such as web-browsers, embedded systems, gaming consoles, cell phones, and personal digital assistants (PDAs), that are not fully supported by background art spreadsheet applications or components.","One of the most labor-intensive aspects of software development is testing to verify that the software meets specifications. In many software development efforts, major parts of the system must be built before any of the parts can be tested. This makes it difficult to localize the origin of errors. But when using a spreadsheet to develop the core logic of a system it is easy to create multiple sets of test data and switch between the sets to test the spreadsheet. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a core functionality that can be verified locally, before deployment and without writing any code.","Developing complex logic in a spreadsheet is much more efficient than hand-coding in a software language. The visual nature of spreadsheets and usability features like drag-copy have been critical to their widespread adoption. When these productivity enhancers are applied to programming, the effects are no less dramatic. Developers can create calculations and data transformation routines in a spreadsheet in a fraction of the time that it takes to do the same in code. Sophisticated systems may incorporate with built-in functions. Beginning developers can be effective at coding logic that might otherwise require a very skilled resource.","Briefly summarized, the present invention relates to source code generator programming interfaces defined to facilitate the analysis of a body of spreadsheet data and the generation of software source code representative of the body of spreadsheet data. The generated software source code embodies structural aspects of the body of spreadsheet data. The calculations and data transformations are performed thorough a plurality of spreadsheet sheets. This makes the calculations and data transformations available through a programming interface. Further, the grammar and syntax is conformed to a target software development language.","A preferred embodiment of the Parser and Code Generator integrated directly into a spreadsheet application. The preferred embodiment optionally generates source code conforming to the syntax of multiple target software development languages, including Java\u00ae by Sun Microsystems, C, C++, and others.","With reference to the figures and particularly , a block diagram of the representative computer hardware is shown illustrating a computer system implementing a source code generator with methods employing a process and computer-readable medium containing instructions for controlling the computer system, which comprises a processor or CPU  receiving input from a keyed input device  or pointing device . A display device  and printing device  are provided for output and volatile storage  and non-volatile storage  may include computer-readable media and random access memory and the like. As described further below, a spreadsheet application  is employed with a plurality of sheets from which a data structure including calculation files are used for corresponding spreadsheet data. A data acquisition interface is used for receiving the spreadsheet data, which is transferable to the calculation files. A parser and source code generator  is used for extracting information from the data structure. An information processor facilitated the use of CPU  for performing a data transformation of extracted information stored in said data structure through said programming interface to conform to the grammar and syntax of a target software development language. A calculation engine  is provided, which has the following benefits:\n\n","Within the field of object orientation, the concepts of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance are well known. A Class is an embodiment of characteristics and behaviors. An instance of a Class is an object that exhibits the characteristics and behaviors of the Class. There are many well-known and widely available references describing object-oriented principles in great detail.","Within the field of computer applications, spreadsheet concepts are well known. In a typical background art spreadsheet application, a body of spreadsheet data comprises a singleton Workbook comprising a plurality of Worksheets. Worksheets comprise a plurality of Cells that can contain literal data values or formulas that are dependent on other Cells. Individual Cells as well as Ranges of Cells can be Named and can be referred to and accessed by Name. There are many well-known and widely available references describing spreadsheet principles and specific spreadsheet applications and components in great detail.","The disclosed invention comprises several data structures that represent the various entities of a spreadsheet. In a preferred embodiment, the data structures are object-oriented software classes that embody characteristics and behaviors of said spreadsheet entities. The Data Structures may be representative of spreadsheet entities, which may be instantiated as Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) data representative of spreadsheet entities. Some of these Data Structures are considered at code-generation time and some are considered at runtime. For the purposes of specification, it is useful to define said data structures:","In a preferred embodiment, the data structures of the Parser and Code Generator comprise the following object oriented software classes: KDBook, KDSheet, KDCell, KDName, KDFunc, KDFuncArg, KDColorScheme, KDEncoder, KDParser, KDCodeSegment, and KDSharedFormula.","In background art spreadsheet applications and components, the global data aspects of a body of spreadsheet data are commonly referred to as a \u2018workbook\u2019 or a \u2018book\u2019. KDBook is a software Data Structure that represents the global data aspects of a body of spreadsheet data. In a preferred embodiment, KDBook is an object-oriented software class.
