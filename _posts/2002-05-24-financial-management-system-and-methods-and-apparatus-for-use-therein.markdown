{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Benefit is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) to Foreign application Serial No. 0112596.2 entitled \u201cFinancial management system, and methods and apparatus for use therein\u201d by THE ONE ACCOUNT LIMITED, filed on 24th May, 2001, in United Kingdom which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference for all purposes.","The present invention relates to financial management systems, in particular ones which provide a versatile virtually structured personal bank account. More specifically, the present invention relates to apparatus and methods for providing an integrated banking account where only one actual financial account is held but which is represented as different virtual sub-accounts according to user-defined parameters. The invention further relates to a set of computer-implemented process steps suitable for implementing such an apparatus or method when installed on a customer's or a service provider's computers.","One of the traditional approaches to personal financial management has been to allocate different accounts for different purposes. For example, borrowing and saving in different accounts. An individual's income may be paid into a general purpose account such as a current account (\u201cchecking\u201d account in US terminology) and separate accounts kept for loans such as mortgages. Credit cards traditionally also have separate accounts according to which provider issues them. Savings accounts are also traditionally held separately from other accounts.","There are drawbacks in having separate accounts. General purpose accounts generally pay low rates of interest whereas in contrast higher interest-bearing accounts may oblige the account holder to commit large sums of money or restrict access to funds. Mortgage accounts can be inflexible regarding repayment schedules and amounts. Additionally, if an individual has several accounts it can be difficult to manage and track transactions and total expenditure. This approach to account structure is still evident in modem financial services accessible remotely, such as telephone and Internet banking.","Integrated financial products have become known which offer a single account on which all financial services are based. This typically takes the form of a single mortgage-based account, where only a single rate of interest is applicable. All credits and debits are made to and from this account, thereby combining, for example, a mortgage with salary and savings payments into the account together with personal loan and credit card payments out of the account.","One such financial management system is the Virgin One\u00ae account available in the United Kingdom from Virgin Direct Personal Finance Limited which provides a single mortgage-based account of the type described above. Virgin One is a registered trade mark of Virgin Enterprises Limited. One Account\u2122 is a trade mark of Virgin Direct Personal Finance Limited. A borrowing limit termed the \u201cfacility\u201d and based on the value of the mortgage sets the limit up to which a customer may borrow money. Such an account greatly simplifies money management matters as all real credits and debits relate to the same account on which a single rate of interest applies. Interest is only paid on the net amount borrowed, instead of the conventional situation in which a customer pays interest on a mortgage while simultaneously earning a different (lower) amount of interest on savings, even with the same institution. There is internet access for the account where an individual can access account details remotely and view account details as well as instructing transactions of various types.","However, although such single accounts offer the aforementioned advantages it may be desired to track financial information on a more detailed level to examine credits and\/or debits relating to a specific category of financial activity, for example what portion of income is being directed towards mortgage payments, or what amount of money is available for spending.","It would be advantageous to provide means to control and budget such an account more effectively. Historically customers have been left to their own devices when it has come to budgeting. Although in the Virgin One account a customer can track their net balance against a \u201ctarget\u201d curve which is calculated to pay off the mortgage within a desired term, existing services do not currently provide any more detailed methods whereby a customer can see their exact financial position at any point in time and understand exactly how much money they have to spend in view of other commitments. Similarly, it may be difficult for a customer of such an account to see the effect of any \u201csavings\u201d and \u201cloans\u201d which they may have, as these are held in the account as a single sum. It would also be beneficial to account customers if they could not only track detailed financial information as a past history but to analyse and forecast what would happen to their finances in the future.","It has been recognised by the inventors that it would be advantageous to have a financial product which operates as a single account, with all the benefits such an account structure brings, but also to provide an improved system and method for the customer's own management of such an account. Further, it has been recognised as being advantageous to provide such financial services remotely, for example as part of an internet based bank account, and to provide a high degree of user definition of how financial information is presented.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved financial management system for remotely accessible banking services.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a financial management system enabling the creation and management of user defined virtual sub-accounts for a remotely accessible single banking account.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide for a tool for the live on-line forecasting of financial trends in a traditional banking account.","The invention in a first aspect provides a financial management system, wherein a real bank account is notionally sub-divided into at least two virtual sub-accounts and transactions may be effected between said virtual sub-accounts without affecting the operation of the real bank account. Such a system allows a customer to maintain an automatically updated model of the customer's finances within the single account, to assist visualisation of his or her financial position, while retaining the benefit of the single account.","The virtual-sub accounts may be created with predefined attributes or user defined attributes.","Transactions relating to the parent account may be categorised and traced by a virtual account.","The virtual-sub accounts may also be categorised according to use. It is further possible to create sub-categories within a category.","For example, a virtual sub-account may be assigned \u201csavings\u201d category so that all transactions for the parent account which have been labelled as \u201csavings\u201d will apply to that virtual sub-account.","The financial management system may be operable to trace and summarise real and virtual transactions according to category and other attributes.","The invention in one particular embodiment provides a financial management system comprising account operation apparatus, arranged to implement integrated bank accounts for a plurality of customers, each integrated bank account combining the features of (i) a loan secured against an asset of the customer and (ii) a current account, whereby the customer's day-to-day credit and debit transactions are aggregated with the loan into a single account balance, said account operation apparatus comprising:\n\n","The sub-accounts may include a virtual current account whose balance is said single account balance minus the other virtual sub-account balances.","The secondary customer interface means may be arranged to present all real transactions, as transactions with said virtual current account.","The real transaction means may be operable to create regular and ad hoc transactions according to said customer instructions.","The virtual transaction means may include means for generating automatic virtual transactions at intervals, in accordance with sub-account parameters defined by the secondary customer instructions.","Said sub-account creating means may be operable to create a loan-type sub-account, the virtual transaction means being arranged to generate virtual transactions automatically so as to \u201crepay\u201d the loan-type sub-account over a period of time.","The virtual transaction means may be operable to associate portions of the interest deductions of the single account with a loan-type sub-account, thereby to present interest deductions as virtual transactions with said sub-account.","Similarly, said sub-account creating means may be operable to create a savings-type sub-account, the virtual transaction means being arranged to generate virtual transactions automatically so as to transfer funds from another sub-account into said savings-type sub-account over a period of time.","Said virtual accounting means may be arranged to operate only in response to customer activation of said secondary customer interface means. In contrast, real transactions and accounting must be performed in real-time, and subject to the strict requirements of banking practice. The versatile financial management system can therefore be implemented far more cheaply than a correspondingly versatile system based on real accounts.","Said virtual accounting means may be arranged to update the balances of all sub-accounts before allowing access to functions for the creation and\/or modification of sub-accounts.","Said virtual accounting means may include projection means for calculating and reporting projected sub-account balances at a future date, by reference to a database of expected virtual transactions. Said projection means may be operable to report on the effect of hypothetical changes in attributes of the sub-accounts.","Said account operation apparatus and said secondary customer interface apparatus may be implemented on independent computer systems.","The primary and secondary customer interface means may include means for establishing a secure connection with a customer's own terminal over a public telecommunications network.","The sub-account database may be maintained on a customer's own terminal, such as a personal computer or PDA. In a presently preferred embodiment, however, sub-account databases for said plurality of customers are maintained on a central server apparatus.","The customer's own terminal in that case merely handles instructions and reporting functions, for example by means of a graphical user interface (GUI), the virtual transactions being implemented on the sub-account database remote from the customer.","The secondary customer interface apparatus may be controlled by an intermediate service provider separate from the banking institution controlling the account operating apparatus. In this way, flexibility for the customer and the service provider can be maximised without complicating or prejudicing the integrity of the account operating apparatus.","The invention further provides a customer service apparatus comprising a data processing and communication system arranged to implement the secondary customer interface apparatus of a financial management system according to the invention as set forth above.","The invention further provides an apparatus for the creation and maintenance of a model of a single bank account in which the single account is sub-divided into virtual sub-accounts.","Said virtual sub-accounts may be created as loan-type accounts or as savings-type accounts.","Said virtual sub-accounts may have associated virtual transactions whereby parameters of said virtual sub-accounts are altered without affecting the single account balance.","Said virtual transactions between said sub-accounts may be linked to real transactions associated with the single account.","In a preferred embodiment, the customer can define the operational model parameters of said virtual sub-accounts and their associated transactions by way of a customer user interface means.","The parameters of a virtual sub-account may be modified so as to associate a particular type of transaction to that particular sub-account.","Similarly, the parameters of a virtual transaction may be modified so as to associate a particular type of sub-account to that particular transaction.","The model may include as a parameter the timeframe over which financial data relating to the virtual sub-accounts and single account is calculated.","The timeframe parameters of the model may be modified so as to produce a forecast model of the future financial position of said single account. Said forecast position can be further analysed by way of said virtual sub-accounts. Such a forecast model may be used to determine the most suitable way to allocate financial resources.","The invention in another aspect provides a method of representing a personal single banking account as a number of virtual sub-accounts wherein parameters of said sub-accounts can be modified by a customer to produce a time-dependent model of the financial position of the customer.","Said parameters of said sub-accounts may include real transactions associated with said single account, or virtual transactions between said sub-accounts.","Said method of modelling said single account may further include filtering data according to sub-account parameters to provide an analysis of financial resources.","Said analysis of financial resources may be for a historical time period so as to produce a historical analysis.","Said analysis of financial resources may be for a future time period so as to produce a forecast analysis.","The invention yet further provides computer-readable program steps on a record carrier or other form for causing a programmable data processing and communication apparatus to implement the features of said secondary customer interface means as set forth above.","The invention further provides methods of providing financial management services based on the principles of the systems set forth above.","Introduction to Integrated Accounts",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In this example a customer has access to a banking account via suitable means such as the internet via a personal computer  (PC). Other possible means of access include by telephone  and other suitably enabled devices such as a personal digital assistant (PDA)  or a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) mobile telephone . The account may be held remotely, accessible through a customer gateway and\/or database  connecting to the computing resources  of a financial institution which provides the actual banking account facilities. In this example the customer database is held at one level and communicates with a separate facility which handles the actual account. In this way, if preferred, an enhanced service may be provided and administered by an intermediate institution, separate from the institution which provides the actual financial infrastructure. The customer database is a database holding the primary customer data, shared for use between these institutions. The means - for accessing the banking account are termed \u201cchannels\u201d.","The customer can remotely interrogate the system to acquire account information. Using such a service the customer can check account details such as account balance and transactions. Additionally, a customer may amend billing details from his\/her account such as direct debits and standing orders.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The integrated account is structured as a single large loan, typically based on a mortgage of property. All financial transactions are carried out through this account with a ceiling credit limit related to the mortgage, known as the \u201cFacility\u201d. This allows for the account to operate in a multifunctional manner, as a mortgage, savings and current account (\u201cchecking\u201d account in US terminology), as well as providing other lending facilities.","For example, the ceiling, or Facility, up to which an individual's debt may rise is determined based upon a property value. The total value of loans, debits and credits determine the actual level (balance) at which that individual sits in the account. The single integrated account thus represents all financial matters for the individual. Financial transactions such as car loans or a mortgage are treated simply as debits against the account with credits to the account treated similarly. Transactions can be carried out on an individual basis affecting the total balance of the account. There is an absolute constraint that the total debt at any time must not exceed the Facility. There is also a \u201ctarget\u201d curve for reducing the debt over time. This target curve corresponds to the typical debt curve of a repayment mortgage, the difference with the integrated account being that day-to-day debits, credits, savings and loan accounts are effectively temporary deviations from the target curve, rather than separate accounts.","In the example process structure shown a customer  can enter the system via log in module  to access a financial management system through the integrated account facility  (embodied in database  or host  in ). The integrated account is linked to a separate banking account engine  which hosts the necessary computing and database resources for the operation of a bank account (within  in ). The means used for accessing the system and the computing and database resources could be any of those channels discussed for  above. For example, a personal computer could be used to access remote computer resources  and  via the Internet. The means used for navigating the account may be suitably adapted internet browser software capable of communicating with the remote system.","The module  provides summary details of the banking account and further provides access to modules - which control or implement other banking account related services. These modules can be implemented in a desired fashion, centralised or distributed, in separate hardware or common hardware, as the skilled person will readily appreciate. The choice of any particular implementation forms no part of the present invention, and the following description, for convenience, does not distinguish between the hardware\/software modules - etc and the services which they provide.","The customer can navigate to these services (that is, can interact with the relevant modules) in order to scrutinise account details and services. For example, at the top level of selection, the customer can navigate to the services providing details of account activity (transactions) (module ), regular payments () and one off payments (). Additionally the customer can print () account information, check for service related messages () and alter account settings ().","The customer has some control over the presentation and control of account information via sub-modules under the top-level modules -. Regarding navigation to view account activity, the customer may at  define filtered views of account information. For regular payments such as direct debits and standing orders or their equivalent, the customer may view their history (module ), view details (), amend details (), or cancel the payments (). Similarly, for irregular payments such as one-off bills the customer may cancel payments (), view instructions (), or create () and amend () payment details. The customer may also utilise the messaging service  to view messages and create new messages (), reply to existing messages (), view a history file () and other message details (). Using the remote banking service the customer may alter settings on his account (). These may include personal details () or customer preferences ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","210","230","235","260","260","280","285","290","295","300"]},"In this example the One Account product button  has been activated so that the display screen shows information relating to the integrated banking account. The account summary button  has also been activated so that the display screen  shows sections representing a summary  of the account attributes, a statement of \u201cplan position\u201d  and current interest rates applicable . At this stage, module  is active (). Also shown is a graph  showing account activity and a summary of credit card transactions .","The features shown in  and in  as described so far represent the \u201creal\u201d banking account and the primary customer interface means, referred to in the introductory portion of this specification above.","Budget Planner\u2014Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Such a virtual financial management system, or \u201cbudget planner\u201d, forms a secondary customer interface means  and allows the customer to define various categories of transactions in for virtual accounts relating to different matters and produce reports on them. By using this service the customer is able to access an augmented integrated banking account service which has an number of improvements to that outlined in , while the single integrated account, with all the attendant benefits, operates beneath.","The financial management system providing the services indicated in  allows a customer to exercise a high degree of control over the manner in which financial matters are presented and categorised, allowing added functionality and features to the integrated banking account not previously present. As before, the customer  may log in () and access information and all the other features as described for . Within the secondary customer interface means  (the budget planner) module  gives the customer the ability to create and maintain \u201cpots\u201d or which are effectively \u201cvirtual\u201d sub-accounts of the parent account, according to customer defined parameters. Also provided are a calendar function , financial database functionality  and a \u201cfree cash\u201d usage function  which further has a budgeting function  by which the customer can allow for future anticipated transactions. Additionally the customer can create custom reports () on his account, detailing both past transactions (), and future transactions. The customer can create and model different financial scenarios (). The modelled results can be linked back to create targets in the budget planner by creating or amending pots (), which will impact the free cash  to aid the customer manage their real account usage to try to follow the modelled scenarios.","To enable this added functionality the customer also has the ability to categorise transactions (module  within ). In connection with this, the customer may also reconcile transactions with receipts ().","By module  and , additional services may be provided to augment the simple single integrated account to make it more versatile, as will be described below in more detail. The customer can choose to categorise transactions and track them, assigning them to virtual sub-accounts of the parent account by creating pots. The additional functionality can be added in such a manner that the operation of the single integrated account and the benefits thereof are not disrupted. In the embodiment described above, the versatile integrated account provided by the improved financial management system is realised by employing an application on the server side of the banking account computing resources. This can gather the appropriate data from the banking account host computer and related databases with another application used to display the information in the appropriate format on the customer's screen.","In the embodiment discussed, the application is held entirely server side and implemented in the Java computing language with Java Server Pages (JSPs) used to display the required data on screen. Such server side based software can process the customer's commands, fetch and process the relevant data from the banking account host computer and display on the customer's remote access device, in this case an internet enabled personal computer.","One feature of the budget planner  is that it need not operate in real-time, or with the reliability and security of the real banking system. In other possible embodiments, other models for the customer data and single integrated account may be employed. For example, it is also possible for some or all of the applications providing the additional functionality to be located on client side of the operation. However, it is intended that the implementation will be platform independent and thus the amount of specific client-side functionality required will be limited.","Data Model and Virtual Sub-Account Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"350"},"At the head of the logical data model is the data  relating to the single integrated account itself. This data relates to the fundamental aspects of the account such as the account balance, facility and interest rate. Personal information  relating to the account holder is linked to this which is further linked to date-related data  such as period type and start and end dates over which other data for the account has been calculated. For the purposes of this example the account represented by account data  can be though of as a parent account from which the customer may define further virtual sub-accounts.","Linked to the basic account data  are data on account transactions . Basic details included here would include the type of transaction such as debit or credit to the account, the amount of the transaction and date carried out and to what client the transaction is related. The category or attributes of the transaction, and whether or not the transaction has been reconciled is stored in a related virtual transaction record ().","From the basic transaction data  are linked more data fields giving greater detail on transactions. These include data structures  linking transactions to sub-category or attribute type with further sub-trees on each attribute ,  and sub-category ,  providing the list of possible categories\/attributes. Categories such as \u201cfood\u201d, \u201cdrink\u201d, \u201ccar\u201d etc. could be broken down to \u201ccar-fuel\u201d, \u201ccar-service\u201d etc. or consolidated into \u201cgroceries\u201d (combining \u201cfood\u201d and \u201cdrink\u201d). The operation of this will be described in more detail below with reference to .","There is also associated with the account data  a set of data describing anticipated transactions , linking to the sub-category and attribute data . This data relates to any transactions which are anticipated to happen in the future with the basic data structure of transactions  but with expected dates for which the transaction is expected, the actual date of the transaction and whether or not the transaction has actually taken place.","In addition to this data structure there is also a data structure relating to the \u201cpot\u201d data, that is, a data structure relating to the virtual sub-accounts which may be defined on top\/into the existing account structure. Account data is stored at account level on a number of tables. The customer's virtual accounts are stored in separate tables that are linked to the real account data via a link table. This provides the link between the real account and a virtual bank account for each of the virtual sub-accounts for that account. Information such as the interest rate is extracted using the real account (data ) and linked to the virtual account via the look up table.","The basic pot data  defines the central fields for the pots such as the pot type. For each pot there will also be fields for the pot balance, the related interest rate, and the planned balance for that pot. The pot data will also have a description of that pot, for example \u201cCar loan\u201d.","Linked to the basic pot data structure are data on pot type  which classifies the type of sub-account for a pot. Typical examples of pot type would include saving and debt type sub-accounts. There are also fields relating to pot repayments () and transaction types (). A pot transaction types data structure  is linked with the transaction logical data model . Pot repayments in this example are stored as virtual transactions.","This logical data model allows for the superposition of virtual sub-accounts on a single integrated account structure without interfering with the regular operation of such an account, as will be described in further detail below. This will enable customers to have (or at least view) their savings, loans and current account along the lines of a conventional bank whilst keeping all of benefits which the integrated account has to offer.","Budget Planner Core Processing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":"350"},"The customer logs on to the budget planner at step . The system retrieves the \u201creal\u201d account balance from the banking system, which corresponds to the spot ledger as at the end of the last business day. The system then sums all the loan pot balances (, ) and sums all the savings pot balances (, ). Using the resultant figures from these calculations the system then calculates the current account balance at  before allowing the customer access to the budget account at .

The system begins by performing step  which obtains information relating to the customer's actual account. For example, this stage retrieves the interest rate and initialises variables such as setting the coming month's expected total capital reduction to zero. The system then proceeds to carry out a number of housekeeping tasks needed for the maintenance of the pots before showing any details which result from the balances of the pots. These include checks to see if any loan pots have a (virtual) regular payment that has been missed because the customer has not logged on for over a month (or whatever the period has been set to).","Each loan pot is checked  to determine if the loan pot has any remaining capital to pay off (interest only loans will not have any capital to pay off). If there is still capital owing on the loan pot a further check is performed () to test if there is any capital reduction overdue (because the customer has not logged on for over a month). This is performed for every loan pot where the stored capital PB is greater than zero and if a regular payment has been missed because the customer has not logged on for over a month missing the last regular pot payment, the outstanding capital reduction due is then calculated .","There is an option to allow for the automatic management of pots without the need for manual intervention by the customer. If there is an outstanding amount due, the system checks at  whether the pot is manually maintained the recommended payment for the loan pot is stored thus indicating that the pot still has an outstanding manual payment due. The system then proceeds back to step  for the next loan pot. If the auto-look-after function has been set (i.e. automatically maintain the pot PB) then the system proceeds to create a transaction  for the loan pot. This is the process called for every pot where a payment is overdue from the previous month or earlier, creating the necessary transaction and storing  the relevant changes for that pot. The system then proceeds back to step  for the next loan pot.","After processing the outstanding capital reduction through steps - the system checks  if any of the loan pots still have any capital reduction outstanding. This is called once per logon after the automatic catch up payments have been made. For each pot that has a manual catch up payment due the payment is displayed  and can be checked and changed before being confirmed. After checking  that the amount due is not zero a suitable transaction is created  and details stored that the pot is correct as at the end of the previous month (or time period). This allows the customer to be asked once for all overdue manual loan payments.","After capital reduction has been dealt with the system then proceeds to check  if there are any unpaid ad hoc transactions outstanding. If so, then the system performs a sub-process  for each ad hoc transaction, for each pot. The system checks that the transaction amount is less than or equal to the last planned balance and if it is not then adjusts the transaction amount to be the stored last planned balance (to stop the loan pot going into credit). The system then applies either the original or modified transaction and changes the current balance. The stored last capital planned balance is then updated. The system then returns to step . Checking and processing is carried out for each pot. After all the pots' ad hoc payments have been checked the ad hoc payment date is updated at .","Referring now to  as a continuation of the flowchart of , the system then proceeds to process each loan pot to check and calculate this month's capital payments.","First, each loan pot is checked ,  and if the payment for that month has not been made yet then the capital reduction per loan pot is calculated  and monthly loan cost per loan pot calculated . If the system determines that this month's payment is due  and that the auto-look-after function has been set  then the transaction is created  and the change details stored . If the auto-look-after has not been set then the system stores the relevant amount for the pot .","After processing each pot in this fashion the system then proceeds to check  if any loan pots still have this month's payment due. This is called once per logon after the automatic catch up payments have been made. For each pot that has a manual catch-up payment due, the payment is displayed  and can be checked and changed before being confirmed. After a check has been made to determine if the amount is zero  the transaction is made  and the pot updated  so as to be correct as at the end of the current month. The monthly loan cost for each loan pot is recalculated  in case the recommended payment in  has been changed.","Once the system has performed these \u201chousekeeping\u201d functions it is ready  to proceed with dealing with the regular functions of the budget planner such as the budget account view.","Also shown in  are the steps the system performs for other events. These can be triggered as activating buttons on a user interface, for example of the general type depicted previously in . The actual manner in which a customer accesses the services and triggers events could be through any number of channels used to access the account features.","Creating\/Maintaining Virtual Sub-Accounts","Moving now to , the system can create a loan pot by a procedure starting at . For each loan pot the system collects and displays the relevant details at  and stores the initial planned balance values at . The monthly loan cost per loan pot is calculated and a check  carried out to determine if the saving start month is on or before the current month. If the saving start month is not on or before the current month then the system proceeds to calculate the monthly loan cost  an assumes ready state  as before. If the saving start month is on or before the current month then the system proceeds to the housekeeping functions at .","The creation of new pots may be implemented in a number of ways, in terms of customer interaction. For example, by activating this function the customer can be presented by a data capture screen allowing the customer to record the relevant details for that new pot. Selecting the type of pot will dictate which fields the customer will be presented with and which need to be completed. The customer specifies the reason for the pot (category and sub-category) which can be user-defined or according to a pre-defined reason provided by the system (for example \u201ccar\u201d, \u201choliday\u201d, \u201chome improvement\u201d).","A pop-up box control on the user interface showing a tree directory of categories offers controls to add, amend or cancel categories and sub-categories. It is also possible to split and re-categorise existing categories.","The system can also create new ad hoc (irregular) payments in relation to a loan pot, starting at . The system first checks  if the transaction is for that day, and if not then creates  a \u201cfuture\u201d unpaid ad hoc transaction. If the transaction is scheduled for that day then the system calculates  the new balance and creates a \u201cpaid\u201d ad hoc transaction and stores  the new planned balance. The last capital changed month is not updated so that the payment of ad hoc amounts does not interfere with the regular payment schedule. The system then proceeds to check  if the payment for this month payment has been made. If the payment has been made it proceeds to calculate  the monthly loan cost as before, then assuming ready state . If the payment has not been made then the system proceeds to the housekeeping functions at  ().","Starting at , if the customer wishes to change the loan pot interest-only amount then the system calculates the stored capital planned balance  and proceeds to steps  and  to calculate the monthly loan cost, then proceeds from there as before.","Similarly, starting at , if the customer wishes to change a loan pot end date the system collects the relevant details and checks at  if the loan is still active before calculating the monthly loan cost at  and  and proceeding as before.","Moving to , and starting at , if the customer wishes to change the debt reduction day then the system will first check at  if that month's payment is due. If not, the system will proceed to the ready state , but if so then the system will enter the housekeeping check stage  () as shown.","The customer can also initiate procedures to change other details of the loan pots such as the loan start date () or loan amount () and can further delete a loan pot (). For each of these functions the system deletes the loan pot  before proceeding to the ready state  as before. That is to say, rather than changing these parameters of an existing loan pot, internally at least, the system prompts the customer to delete the loan pot and start again. Starting at , the customer can also access the details of each individual loan pot, where the system calculates the monthly loan cost for that loan pot at  and returns to ready state .","Referring back now to , and starting at , the customer can ask the system to display the repayment plan for a single loan pot or all loan pots. The system first displays the repayment plan for a single loan pot  and then retrieves or calculates the previous month's balance per loan pot before calculating the future planned balance per loan pot. The system can then either display for a single loan pot () or accumulate details for all pots () and compare this with standard repayment plan plan before the displaying the results .","Similar functionality for similar events is provided for savings pots, the system allowing the customer to create and maintain savings pots in much the same way as for the loan pots described above. Detailed flowcharts for these are not provided, although the key procedures for both loan pots and savings pots are defined in the Appendix.","Customer Benefits","The internal structure and workings of the system having just been described, an overview of the benefits of the system just described will now be provided, from the point of view of the customer. Then a number of examples will be presented to demonstrate the different functions of the novel financial management system implementing the versatile integrated account, again from the point of view of the customer.","As explained elsewhere the customer has the ability to be able to divide up their account into one or more \u2018virtual\u2019 accounts represented by the \u201cpots\u201d maintained within the system, as described above. The pots can have specific purposes or types e.g. loan, saving, budget etc. Along with the ability to set-up these pots, the customer is also able to \u2018virtually\u2019 move money between them. There are at no time any real transactions affecting the parent account balance. All transactions between the pots are virtual, manipulating the raw integrated account information according to the specifications of the customer. Pots can be created and amended as wished, with the ability to create and amend virtual transactions for the pots. The customer can create views of summaries of each pot or balances across pots allowing the customer to track financial matters in detail. The customer has the ability to track pots, for example if they are saving for a specific amount by a specific time. To this end, each pot also has its own plan, allowing for the budgeting of future events and the like.","The ability to create \u2018virtual\u2019 loans and savings pots to represent the funds within the real account will provide the customer a more understandable view of their finances and enable them to plan far more easily. As the accounts are \u2018virtual\u2019, they can be created, amended and deleted at any point in time without fear of affecting the actual balance of the account, of running up real bank charges, or of making any irreversible financial decision.","When setting up the pots the customer is able to define specific parameters to order to help them track their progress, for example they wish to have a specific amount saved by a specific date or a loan repaid within a specific time-scale, without negotiation or restriction by the service provider. The necessary (virtual) repayment\/savings plans are then created around these criteria","As well as the regular payments as prescribed by the plans the customer will also be able to make ad hoc payments where it is identified that they have spare cash to do so. It is also flexible enough for the customer to withdraw payments from the account when extra money is required in a period.","Example Screens",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0132"},"figref":["FIGS. 8 and 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 3"],"b":["700","702","704","706","708"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"712"},"The purpose of the summary screen is to provide the customer with a high level view of all of their \u2018accounts\u2019. This screen will be the point of entry to the budget\/financial planning system, initiating the various procedures described above with reference to . This screen provides a graphical as well as numerical view of all pots in existence as well as the overall parent account balance. It basically interrogates all existing pot balances and displays them together to provide an overall view. Where multiple types of accounts exist the summary screen will only show the overall total e.g. if multiple savings pots exist the summary screen will show the overall saving, if multiple loans it will show the overall debt.","If the customer does require more information at this stage it could also be possible for them to \u2018double click\u2019 on a graphic which will then display the detail, e.g. savings graphic will display an overview of all current savings pots currently in existence. Balances displayed are correct as at the point in time that the budget tool was accessed\/updated.","The customer can define the parameters for each individual pot that they create. When a pot is created a schedule of payment triggers will be set-up behind the scenes. As the pots are \u2018virtual\u2019 there are no real transactions that will occur to cause them to accumulate funds. The schedule therefore provides the mechanism that gives the impression that money is physically moving.","The customer also has the ability to view a detailed account of all payments that have been received into\/have left the pot.","When a date on the schedule of payments is reached a number of actions will be triggered. The budget summary screen will be updated to show that the payment has been made. The detailed record of payments will be updated to show that a payment has been received. This in turn will update the total saving to date field on the pot summary.","The customer may decide that they wish to withdraw payments from their savings accounts in order to have a larger amount of free cash. In this situation the new monthly saving amount, target amount or end date will be calculated based on the user defined details. Interest is taken into account for loan pots to calculate the repayment plan and could be optional for savings pots.","The target date for any account cannot be greater than the agreed term of the parent account. Warnings can be given when the monthly virtual transaction amount into a pot is greater than the defined budget available for the period.","Available Cash Display",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0141"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Free cash usage is essentially a view of the customers' budget account pot. The purpose of this pot is to enable the customer to see exactly how much cash is left to spend once all other outgoings for the period have been taken into consideration. This will therefore give an accurate daily view of their account for expense purposes.","Account Balance Display",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0143"},"figref":"FIGS. 11 and 12"},"Once the budget balance is established the screen then shows all payments, both actual and virtual which will be made from the budget account. Actual transactions are defined as physical amounts which will leave the clients parent account, for example Direct Debits and standing orders, interest payments and anticipated transactions which the customer wishes to allow for. Virtual transactions include payments to loan (including pots marked as mortgages) and savings accounts.","In order to track their budget account and their free cash a customer must define the period over which the account will be tracked. There is a default or prompt to help the customer set up the period. Expected outgoings are the key elements that will be taken into consideration as part of the budget free cash calculation.","At the start of the defined period all of these payments will be awaiting. As and when payments are made this is illustrated by the payment amount showing as paid. For loans and savings the amount shown is the total of all loans and savings in existence. As they may have different payment dates the summary should reflect the correct proportion of the total as paid.","As already discussed there are no physical transactions which will trigger payments to be made to virtual accounts. The movement for these transactions on the budget account is therefore triggered by the payment schedule that is created when the pot is set up. There is however a mechanism which recognises when real payments such as Direct debits, standing orders and mortgage interest payments leave the account.","Definitions for expected outgoings are as follows:\n\n","It is possible to change or delete these transactions at any time. As previously discussed virtual transactions will be triggered by the payment schedule in place for the pot concerned which in turn will be put in place by the repayment plan for the pot.","Whilst the customer will be able to see at an overall level from the budget summary screen what their position is, they may also wish to know the detail which lies behind. This detail looks at the transactions that make up the balances and also allows the customer to create their anticipated transactions.","\u2018Daily\u2019 Transactions","For transactions such as ATM, switch, cheque etc, the customer will see an up to date view of all transactions which have taken place. This functionality already exists within present online services. As an addition to this existing functionality there will also be a very simple mechanism for allowing the customer to manually reconcile their paper receipts against actual transactions. This is simply a form of tick box facility against each transaction which the customer can click when the transaction is matched up, as provided by existing manual-entry financial management products such as Quicken (\u00ae Intuit), without the need for downloading transaction detail.","Anticipated Transactions","Anticipated transactions allow the customer to key details of any payments that they know are going to take place during the period. These transactions can then be summarised within the budget account and taken into consideration when calculating the remaining free cash element. The customer can create any number of anticipated transactions for the future or in the past.","There is reconciliation mechanism which allows the customer to match anticipated transactions against their actual counterparts once they occur. Comparing , a single transaction with payee \u201cSUPERSTORE\u201d is shown for simplicity.  shows the actual transaction dated 4 Aug. 2000 in the upper half of the display, which information is derived automatically from the real bank account.  shows the situation where the user has anticipated this transaction, and it appears as an anticipated transaction for 1 Aug. 2000 in the lower half of the display. The user has already assigned a category \u201cGROCERIES\u201d to this transaction. In this situation, once the matching real transaction has been effected (in fact on 4 Aug. 2000), the customer activates the check box beside that transaction to reconcile (match) it with the real transaction. The system then prompts the user to confirm deletion of the anticipated transaction, as shown in . At the same time, the system automatically transfers the category \u201cGROCERIES\u201d from the anticipated transaction to the real one.","The customer is also allowed to delete anticipated transactions at any time, the system updating the free cash balance accordingly. It is also possible to split anticipated transactions to match actual, for example when a total anticipated shopping bill of \u00a3200 is actually made up of four separate shopping trips and should be matched accordingly","Categories",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0158"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 2"],"b":"170"},"Every real transaction can be categorised. This is predominantly a manual process. The customer can have any number of categories; for example a category may be FOOD. This category may then have any number of sub categories, for example sub categories of FOOD may be BUY-IN, EAT OUT, TAKE-AWAY. A category can also have attributes attached to it for example FOOD may have an attribute marking it as \u201cEssential\u201d or BUY-IN may have \u201cEssential\u201d with EAT OUT as \u201cNon-essential\u201d.","At the outset the customer is provided with default list of categories. At this stage or at any point in the future the customer can choose to amend existing category names and attributes or add additional categories and sub categories. The customer can rename, divide and delete categories or sub-categories as wished.","Reporting","The improved account also allows for the customer to monitor financial matters by way of reporting functions.","For example, a customer may wish to analyse what has happened to their account and how they have arrived at a particular position. The customer can produce reports on the account by defining filtered views of transactions. For example, a category analysis report can be carried out for a particular date range, grouping transactions by a chosen category and displaying them graphically as part of a report. It is further possible to perform a category transaction report for a such a date range showing each transaction for each category, again with the ability to report these and display them graphically. Using such a data processing structure would also form the basis for calculations for producing a monthly trend analysis for each category.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0163"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"The customer also has the option of the time period that they wish to interrogate, either from a standard list of timeframes or a defined \u2018non-standard\u2019 time period such as the previous 3 weeks, the previous week etc.","It is further possible to generate standard reports such as \u2018what I have spent?\u2019 and \u2018what is my annual view? The customer can further specify views such as spending per category.","Forecasting\u2014\u201cWhat-If\u201d Function","The purpose of the \u201cwhat if\u201d tool is to enable customer to understand their current position and the effect that future actions will have on their overall repayment. This enables the customer to plan for events such as moving house and to analyse the positive and negative aspects of changing, for example, mortgage repayments.

It is therefore possible for the customer to access the date on the calendar to view all transactions which took place. This therefore provides a full transaction history with the customer being able to access any date at any point in time. In the same way it is also be possible to provide a history of the free cash on any particular date.","Alerts Function","The facility to track events whether they are calendar-based or report-based also allows for the creation of an alerts by the system, drawing attention to particular events. Notification of such alerts could be through the use of on-screen messaging systems or other channels such as mobile telephony WAP\/SMS systems.","Alerts can be set around specific pots, for example to advise when a target date has been reached or amounts over a certain size coming into or leaving the account. Alerts can also link in with the calendar to advise when specific financial events are approaching or have been reached, for example a self-employed person might require an alert around the time that their tax returns are due. Some alerts can also be triggered automatically where it is seen that the customer should be aware of certain events such as general interest rate increases, or an invitation to reduce your facility (for example to benefit from a reduced interest rate).","For receiving these alerts the customer can also specify communication methods. These could be via the online service itself or via WAP\/SMS, email or a telephone call.","It is further possible to extend the functionality of the versatile integrated account by providing additional services. The system can make provision for the uploading and downloading of data to and from the customer. This would enable customers to import data into third party tools such as financial applications or spreadsheets. Such tools provide the facility to enable customers to download transactional information directly from online banking services in a compatible format such as the Open Financial Exchange (OFX) format. A download module  is shown in  for this purpose. This facility will allow customers to be able to download details of their physical transactions. This facility could also be used for local archival purposes controlled by the customer but based on a central database to allow access to information which could be stored for immediate retrieval or archived for storage.","The financial database module  () can be used by the customer for storing data unrelated to the account itself, for ease of reference.","This application claims priority form UK 0112596.2 filed May 24, 2001 and form provisional US application number 60\/382,603 filed May 24, 2002.
