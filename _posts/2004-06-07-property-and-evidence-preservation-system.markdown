{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to the preservation of an inventory of items for subsequent return or use and, more particularly, to a method of preservation of the personal property of an individual charged with a crime and sentenced to be incarcerated in a prison, for example, and the subsequent return of the property.","2. Description of the Prior Art","The problem of protecting the personal property of a prison inmate has been a long recognized problem. Oftentimes when the personal property is retrieved by the owner after being stored, it has been found that certain items were missing from the inventory.","Many attempts have been made to seal the personal property in various containers containing an integral itemized listing of the inventory. However, in many instances, upon the return of the inventory to the owner, items have been found to be missing from the itemized inventory.","It is an object of the present invention to produce a method of preserving the integrity of personal property for later retrieval wherein the personal property and an associated itemization thereof may be readily and easily viewed for later use of the property as evidence in a court proceeding or the return thereof to the owner.","It is another object of the invention to produce a method of preserving the integrity of personal property and the chain of possession thereof in a tamper evident package for subsequent return to the owner.","Another object of the invention is to produce a method of preserving the integrity of personal property along with a viewable acknowledged inventory itemization for subsequent verification.","The above as well as other objects and advantages of the invention may be typically achieved by a method of preserving discrete inventory of personal property for later return including the steps of providing an inventory of property to be preserved; providing an itemization of the property; placing the property and itemization of the property in a viewable tamper evident package; and sealing the package.","Referring to the drawings, there is illustrated in  a package formed by the basic steps illustrated diagrammatically in block form in .","More specifically, there is illustrated a package  for containing the personal items in a viewable, tamper evident manner.","As illustrated in , the steps for forming the package  of  includes the initial step of providing a base consisting of a porous board  such as, for example, a packaging board produced by International Paper Company and sold under the trademark EVEREST SKINBRITE 24 PT.","The board  is typically printed and coated with a thermoplastic adhesive (heat seal coating). The heat seal coating may be a product manufactured and sold by Sovereign Packaging Group, Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y. 14241 under the trademark LATISEAL.","The items of personal property are then placed in spaced relation on the upwardly facing surface of the board . An itemization  containing a listing of the inventory of personal property is dated and signed by the owner of the property and placed on the surface of the board  with the inventory listing, date, and signature facing upward.","Next, an optically transparent and impervious sealing film  is heated, directed over the upwardly facing of the board , applied around the various items of personal property and against the heat seal coating on the upwardly facing surface of the board . A vacuum is simultaneously drawn through the pores in the board  forcing the film tightly around the individual items and is superposed adjacent relative to the head seal coating on the upward facing surface of the board . This action simultaneously encapsulates the individual items of personal property and seals the film to the board . Along with the items of personal property being sealed, the itemization  is likewise sealed. The package  thereby provides a view of the personal property and the associated itemization , and, thereby, will make it readily apparent if any tampering later occurs, or if any of the items are missing.","The completed package  may then be transferred to a storage facility for return to the individual upon release from incarceration. It may be understood that the completed package  may contain articles which may later be required as evidence in a criminal proceeding. In such instance, the items may be readily located and introduced into evidence with ease.","While there may be a number of machines or equipment utilized in carrying out the certain steps of the invention, it has been found that satisfactory results have been obtained with the employment of a skin packaging machine manufactured by Audion Automation of Dallas, Tex. and sold under the trademark VACUMASTER. The VACUMASTER machine is employed to enclose the contents between juxtaposed sheet material comprising a flat base sheet and a covering sheet in which the covering sheet is forced by fluid pressure; e.g., vacuum into tight engagement with the contents and is secured at its free margins to the base sheet to form a thin, skin-like covering over the contents.","The machine typically utilizes a polyethylene resin sealing film which is optically transparent and manufactured by DuPont Company, Wilmington, Del. and sold under the trademark SURLYN 1601-2 packaging resin. The resultant film is thermoformable and provides product protection and a reliable heat seal.","While it has been mentioned that the intemization  was provided with a certifying verification signature of the owner, it will be understood that the signature could be supplemented and\/or replaced by a thumb or fingerprint of the owner or some other identifying mark between the plastic film and the packaging board .","The aforedescribed method has produced a tamper evident package and puts to rest any questions about the package being opened when the owner is not present.","In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the present invention has been described in what is considered to represent its preferred embodiment. However, it should be understood that the invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically illustrated and described without departing from its spirit or scope."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["The above and other objects of the invention will become readily manifest to one skilled in the art from reading the following detailed description of the invention in the light of the accompanying drawing in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
