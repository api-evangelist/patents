{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The growth of the Internet has made digital distribution of content more desirable. The lower costs of digital distribution over a computer network versus distribution using physical media can only be expected to further drive the growth of the digital distribution channel. A growing number of content types such as applications, games, music, books and movies are now available through digital downloads, either as an alternative to physical media or as the exclusive distribution channel for the content.","With the growth of digital distribution of content, content marketplaces have appeared that aggregate and provide content from multiple publishers. Content marketplaces allow users to have a \u201cone stop shop\u201d for a variety of types of content. However, as there are many content marketplaces, managing content submissions to multiple content marketplaces can be a difficult and complicated process for content developers.","Typically, different marketplaces have different submission formats for content. Thus, a content developer may need to create different content submissions to submit the same content item to different respective marketplaces. For example, an application developer wishing to distribute a mobile application via multiple Internet-based application stores typically must create a separate submission package (each having a different format) for each application store. This process can become burdensome and time consuming.","In addition, many content developers submit content using web interfaces provided by the content marketplaces. The web interfaces may require content to be submitted using multiple pages, in a particular order and\/or with additional content descriptions. The use of the web interfaces can further complicate the content submission process.","One embodiment of the invention is a content submission system that addresses at least some of these problems. The content submission system may provide a submission format to a content creator that allows content, including but not limited to software applications, to be submitted in a content submission bundle. The content submission system may examine the received content submission bundle, and determine one or more submission formats for submitting the content to one or more electronic content marketplaces. In some embodiments, the content submission system may act as a central broker for content submissions to multiple content marketplaces. For example, the content submission system may translate the content submission bundle into the submission formats used by respective marketplaces so that the content creator\/submitter need not perform this task.","By providing management of the content submission process, the content submission system can simplify the submission process for content developers or other content creators. Other potential benefits may include consistency in published content items, time savings for content submissions, faster updating of content items to a new version, and\/or better quality submissions. For example, the content submission system can track and propagate new versions of content items to other marketplaces so that the content creator\/submitter need not perform this task. By managing content submissions to other marketplaces, the content management system may help keep content items consistent and up to date, even if located in different content marketplaces operated by different entities. In another example, the content submission system can validate or otherwise test the content submission and\/or can add enhanced content to the content submission, thereby improving the quality of the submission.","Various aspects of the disclosure will now be described with regard to certain examples and embodiments, which are intended to illustrate but not to limit the disclosure. Nothing in this disclosure is intended to imply that any particular feature or characteristic of the disclosed embodiments is essential. The scope of protection is defined by the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","100","110","140","155","100"]},"The content submission system  may be in communication with multiple content marketplaces ,  and may be associated with a particular content marketplace . Among other functions, content marketplaces ,  store content items\/products (e.g., applications, e-books, etc.) submitted by publishers, authors, and\/or developers, and make these items available to customers. The content marketplace  preferably hosts an electronic catalog that provides functionality for customers to locate, download, and, where applicable, pay for content items of interest. The electronic catalog may be accessible via a web site, an \u201capp store\u201d application that runs on mobile devices of users, and\/or other types of interactive systems. Typically, the electronic catalog includes a separate detail page for each content item. The detail page for a given content item may, for example, include a description provided by the item's creator, price information, information about the item's creator, customer reviews, device compatibility information, screen shots (where applicable), and other types of information that may be useful to customers.","In some embodiments, the content submission system  maintains accounts for its users (e.g., developers or other content creators). The accounts may be associated with information about the users' content submissions, such as content files, the price of the content, description of the content, current version of the content or other account information. This data can be updated based at least partly on content submissions sent by the users. For example, if a user wants to publish a new version of an application, the user can submit a content submission having new content files. The content submission system can then update the content files for that application and update the information associated with that content. In some embodiments (e.g., where the content submission system  is associated with a content marketplace ), the content submission system  may maintain or have access to accounts of content marketplace  customers who purchase content from the content marketplace . Typically, these customer accounts are different from the user accounts associated with content creators.","Typically, the user computing system  stores the content data associated with particular content items. The content data may include images, binaries, videos, and\/or other electronic data, and may be grouped as a content bundle . Typically, the content data are stored and\/or transmitted as electronic files, though the content data may also be transmitted as one or more data streams. The content bundle may comprise a single content file or stream, a compressed file (e.g., ZIP, RAR, or other compressed file format) or multiple files. In one embodiment, the content files may be stored in a common directory. The content or content files may be described by the content metadata . In some embodiments, the content metadata  comprises content file titles, descriptions, key words, content price, versioning information and\/or the like. The content metadata may, for example, be contained in an extensible markup language (XML) file. Other file formats, such as flat text files, S-expressions, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and\/or text streams can also be used. In some embodiments, the content metadata file may be part of the content bundle . The content bundle  and content metadata  may be stored in data storage  of the user computing system  or may be stored elsewhere, for example, on a file storage service, web site, or computing system different from the user computing system .","In , users may use the user computing systems  to access the content submission system  over the communication network . The network  may, for example, be a publicly accessible network of linked networks, possibly operated by various distinct parties, such as the Internet. In other embodiments, the network  may be a private network, such as, for example, a corporate or university network that is wholly or partially inaccessible to non-privileged users. In still other embodiments, the network  may include one or more private networks with access to and\/or from the Internet.","The content submission system  provides a variety of functionality for managing content submissions from multiple users. In some embodiments, the content submission system comprises one or more computing systems having one or more computing devices. In , the content submission system comprises a content submission manager , data storage  and, optionally, a content marketplace  in communication via a communication medium . In some embodiments, the communication medium  comprises a network, which may include multiple networking devices (not shown) such as, e.g., switches, edge routers, core routers, etc. The network may, but need not, be a different network than the network  shown in . In some embodiments, the communication medium comprises a computer bus, for example, where two or more components are located on the same computing device. In some embodiments, the content marketplace  may be operating on a separate computing system from the content submission system . The separate computing system may be in communication with the content submission manager  via the network . For example, the content submissions system  may be a broker service that acts as an intermediary between developers and various marketplaces are unaffiliated with the broker service.","Users (e.g., content creators) of the content submission system  can interact with the content submission system (e.g., via a content submission manager ) to submit content. The content submission manager  can receive content submissions from the user computing systems  over the network . A user may request that the content submission manager  submit a content item to the content marketplace  or other third-party marketplaces . Typically, the content marketplace  and the third-party marketplaces are operated by different business entities, though a single business entity may operate more than one content marketplace. For example, the third-party marketplaces may operate on computing systems comprising one or more computing devices, the computing systems operated by different business entities, the computing systems in communication with the content submission system  via the network .","In , the user computing system  can send a content submission bundle to the content submission system. In some embodiments, the content submission bundle includes a copy of the content bundle  and the content metadata . The content submission may include pointers, links, addresses or locations to one or more electronic files, rather than the actual files. For example, the content submission may include an address of a location of a network server (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH FTP or the like) or the data storage  from which the content submission manager  may obtain the content bundle  and\/or content metadata. Generally, the location is a secure location that requires access credentials in order to obtain the content stored at the location. The network server may be located at an external network location (e.g., on an external public network). In some embodiments, the content submission manager  occasionally or periodically (e.g., daily, weekly or monthly) checks the content location in order to determine if the content needs to be submitted to the marketplace . For example, if the content submission manager  finds that a new version of the content at the location, the content submission manager  can download the content, wholly or partially (e.g., only download updated files), and submit the content to the content marketplace  or other marketplaces in order to update the published version to the new version of the content. The content submission manager  may determine that that there is new content based at least partly on changes in the files found in the location such as the file names, the addition or removal of files, a change log at the location, or other indication provided by the user.","In some embodiments, the content submission may include access credentials (e.g., keys, tokens, usernames, account names, passwords, etc) for accessing the content bundle  or content metadata , and\/or may include access credentials for submitting the content to a marketplace. The access credentials may be stored or already stored in an account of the content submission system associated with the user. In some embodiments, the content submission is digitally signed with a public key certificate or other electronic certificate in order to verify that the content submission comes from a particular user.","After the content submission manager  receives the content submission from the user and obtains the content bundle  and content metadata , the content submission manager  can process the content submission. The content submission manager  can store the content bundle  and content metadata  on data storage  (e.g., database, file server, hard drive, optical drive, etc.) of the content submission system. The data storage  may also store user credentials , such as access credentials for accessing one or more content marketplaces , . In some embodiments, the content submission manager  validates the files by performing security testing. For example, the content submission manager  may check access credentials received with the content submission to determine whether the user submitting the content has access rights to an account maintained by the content submission system. If access rights are verified, the content submission manager  can then update files and other data associated with the account. The content submission manager  may also check a digital signature on the files to verify that the content submission came from the user associated with the account. In some embodiments, the content submission manager  performs virus checks or other quality assurance processes on the content submission.","One benefit that may be provided by the content submission manager  is abstracting out the submission format used by the content marketplace  or by third party marketplaces . Thus, the content submission system  can translates the content submission bundle into other formats used by other marketplaces so that the content creator\/submitter need not perform this task. The content submission bundle may be translated by generating a new, format-compliant content submission bundle or by modifying the content submission to comply with the new submission format used by the content marketplace  or third party marketplaces . The following disclosure below describes an exemplary scenario where the content submission manager  manages submissions of content, including optionally providing the content to third party marketplaces.","The content submission manager  can determine the submission format used by the content marketplace . The content marketplace  may require that files be submitted in a particular submission format. For example, the content marketplace  may expect to receive particular file types, may expect files to be in a particular order, may expect descriptions or other metadata about the files, or may expect to receive particular files in response to particular prompts or at particular times (e.g., a first file is expected to be uploaded at a first screen, a second file at a second screen, etc.). As will be apparent, many different types of submission formats could be used by the content marketplace .","In one embodiment, the content submission manager  accesses format data that describes the submission format. The format data may have been collected by a technician or other person who analyzed the submission format of the content marketplace or the format data may have been provided by the content marketplace. In one embodiment, the content submission manager  programmatically communicates with the content marketplace to determine the submission format, such as by communicating through an Application Programming Interface (API). In one embodiment, the API specifies the submission format, for example, by providing an interface for submitting content.","The content submission manager  can analyze the content submission to determine the contents of the content bundle  and content metadata . In one embodiment, the content marketplaces or the content submission system  may publish or provide a file naming convention or other content submission standard. For example, the naming convention may identify the file type, the purpose of the file, whether the file is part of the purchasable or downloadable content, whether the file is descriptive of the content (e.g., advertisement or screenshots) or the like. Thus, in one embodiment, the content submission manager  examines the file names to obtain submission data describing the content submission, such as the purpose of particular files or which files comprise the content and which files are non-essential files (e.g., readmes, manuals for an application, cover art, reviews, screen shots, etc.).","In addition or as an alternative to examining content files, the content submission manager  may use the content metadata  to obtain the necessary or requested information regarding these files. The content metadata  can include information, such as descriptions, price, etc., that may be needed or requested by the content marketplace. Thus, in some embodiments, the content submission manager  can examine the content metadata to obtain submission data describing the content submission.","The content submission manager  can use the submission data about the content submission (e.g., from the content metadata or file naming convention) and\/or the submission format from the content marketplace  to determine which content files are needed or requested by the content marketplace . For example, if a particular prompt (e.g., web page, input screen, upload field or the like) of the content marketplace requests a particular file or type of file, the content submission manager  can use the submission data about the content submission to identify the corresponding file that would be responsive to the particular prompt. In another example, if the content marketplace requires files to be named or formatted in a particular way or in a particular order, the content submission manager  can use the submission data about the content submission to identify the corresponding files and then rename, reformat, reorder or otherwise manipulate the files as needed or requested by the content marketplace . For example, digital image or video content items may be manipulated to change particular aspects such as size, format or encoding. In some embodiments, digital rights management (DRM) encryption may be applied to content items.","The content submission manager  may translate the content submissions to comply with the content marketplace's  submission format. The content submission manager  can then submit the content files and\/or content metadata to the content marketplace . In some embodiments, the content submission manager  may generate enhanced content for the content submission before submitting the content files. For example, in the case of application content, the content submission manager  may run the application and take screen shots of the application. The content submission manager  can then include those screenshots of the application, and\/or other enhanced content, with the content submission. In some embodiments, the enhanced content may be generated by a person (e.g., copywriter, technical writer, advertising person, reviewer, or employee associated with the content submission system) and received by the content submission manager . Examples of enhanced content can include: reviews, screenshots, videos, product descriptions or the like. In some embodiments, the content submission manager  may e-sign the content files to verify that the files came from the content submission manager  or content submission system.","After receiving the content submission, the content marketplace  can publish the content item and make it available to customers. Customers may then purchase and\/or download the content item.","In some embodiments, the content submission manager  may act as a broker or coordinating party for content submissions and also submit the content submission to third-party marketplaces . In a similar fashion as described above, the content submission manager  can determine a second submission format for the third-party marketplace. Typically, this second submission format is different than the submission format of the content marketplace . Based at least partly on the content metadata, the content submission manager  can modify the content submission to comply with the second submission format of the third-party marketplace . As will be apparent, the content submission manager  may submit the content submission to multiple other marketplaces by complying with those other marketplaces' submission format(s), for example, by converting the content submission or generating a new content submission compliant with the submission format used by a target marketplace.","By acting as a central broker, the content submission manager  can potentially simplify the submission process for content developers by automating (partially or wholly) the submission process. In additional, the content submission manager  can maintain consistency of content by centrally managing the different submissions to different third-party marketplaces . For example, if the content submission manager  receives a new version of an application, it can propagate the version to other marketplaces without requiring further action form the application developer. In some embodiments, the content submission manager  may e-sign the content files with the user's security certificate on behalf of the user and with the use's permission to verify that the files came from the user.","In some embodiments, the content submission manager includes a content submission module, monitoring and reporting module, and billing module. The content submission module can receive or transmit content submissions in various ways. For example, a submission can be received directly from a user (e.g., via an interactive console, web service, or other GUI provided by the content submission system) or from a program that interacts with the content submission manager  via an Application Programming Interface (e.g., an API that uses Web services), and so forth. The content submission module may provide a web-based or other interface through which the content creator\/submitter can specify the content marketplaces to which a given content item is to be submitted. In some embodiments, the content submission module includes a submission interface (e.g., network interface card, API, subroutine, transmitter, receiver, or the like) configured to communicate with one or more content marketplaces , .","The monitoring and reporting module monitors and tracks content submissions and reports information and statistics to the user. For example, the monitoring and reporting module  may track submission histories, versioning data for submitted content, the status of the submission, the progress of updating the content, or which marketplaces the content has been propagated to. In some such embodiments, the monitoring and reporting module  may provide interactive feedback to the user including, for example, current status, time till completion, etc. In some embodiments, the monitoring and reporting module  can generate a report detailing or summarizing the submission statistics and data and communicate the report to the user via electronic mail or provide access to the report, usage statistics, or interactive feedback via Web services.","Some content submission services may be fee-based such that the service executes content submissions on behalf of a user in exchange for payment of one or more fees by that user. In some fee-based services, the content submission manager  may optionally include the billing module. For example, in some embodiments, fees may be charged to a user based at least partly on an amount of storage, an amount of network resources, a priority level for the request, number of marketplaces for publishing, enhancements to the content, or other criteria. In some embodiments, fees may be charged on the basis of a variety of use factors, such as a price per use of the service, a price per unit of time that computing services are used, a price per storage used, a price per data transferred in and\/or out, etc. In at least some embodiments, a content submission system may offer one or more of various tiers, types and\/or levels of services or functionality for content submissions. For example, different tiers may receive different levels of content enhancement. The billing module can monitor and track usage of the computer resources, calculate fees due for the usage, or bill the user. The user may be charged a fixed fee payment (e.g., upfront or periodically billed) or other use fees (e.g., variable fees associated with use of various resources, such as electricity, physical rack space, network utilization, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["105","130","105","105","105","105","105","105","130","105","110","130"],"i":["a ","a","b","n","a","b","n ","a "]},"In some embodiments, the request includes a copy of the content bundle  and content metadata . In some embodiments, the request may include pointers, links or locations to one or more electronic files, rather than the actual files. The reporting message may also include one or more access credentials (e.g., keys, tokens, user names, passwords, etc.) that are associated with the user's request. The access credentials may be for the content submission system or for third-party marketplace  (e.g., for submitting content to the other marketplaces). For example, the access credentials for multiple content marketplaces may be stored by the content submission system  and used by the system to access and\/or submit content to respective content marketplaces.","In the example shown in , the content submission manager  communicates a reporting message using a reporting API (3) via the network  which is (4) received by the user computing system . The reporting message can include information related to the results of the content submission or whether the content submission system can grant the request (in whole or in part). The reporting message may also include one or more request identifiers (e.g., keys, tokens, user names, passwords, etc.) that are associated with the user's request. The reporting message can include other information such as, for example, one or more reports including results from the testing.","Other types of programmatic interactions (additionally or alternatively) between the content submission system and the user computing systems are possible in addition to those described above. For example, a request can be received directly from a user (e.g., via an interactive console or other GUI provided by the content submission system) or from an executing program on a user computing system . In some embodiments, users may interact with the content submission manager  using other types of interfaces and in other ways. For example, the content submission manager  may provide a web services interface (e.g., a web page) that allows a user to submit a request using a web browser. Other types of interfaces may also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["130","100","130"]},"With reference to , at block , a content submission bundle or request is received by the content submission manager  from the user. The content submission may be associated with a content bundle  and content metadata . The content bundle  or content metadata  may be included in the content submission request or may be indicated in the request (e.g., by providing a file location). The submission bundle or request may include other types of preferences, requirements, restrictions, or content data.","At block , the content submission manager  determines a first submission format for a target marketplace. The first submission format describes the requirements or requested format of content submissions by the marketplace. The marketplace may be the content submission system associated with the content submission manager  or may be a third party marketplace. For example, the target marketplace may comprise the content marketplace  of . As discussed above, the content submission manager  may determine the first submission format in a variety of ways, such as, for example, by accessing format data, analyzing a submission interface of the marketplace, or communicating with an API of the marketplace.","At block , the content submission manager  analyzes the content submission from the user. The content submission manager  may uncompress the content bundle , if needed. It can then analyze the content submission to determine the contents of the file. As described above, the content submission manager  may examine the file names, the content metadata, the files themselves, metadata about the files, or other data related to the content.","At block , the content submission manager  translates the content submission bundle to comply with the first submission format of the target marketplace based at least partly on the analysis. The content submission manager  can use information about the content submission determined from the analysis to identify differences between the content submission and the first submission format. Based at least partly on these differences, the content submission manager  can determine how to modify the content submission to comply with the first submission format or generate a new, content submission compliant with the first submission format. For example, the content submission manager  may rename, reformat, or reorder the files as needed or requested by the content marketplace. The content submission manager  may also determine when to submit particular content metadata to the target marketplace based on its analysis. The content submission manager  can submit portions of the content metadata as required or requested by the target marketplace. For example, the content submission manager  can determine that the price of the content is an entry requested at a particular screen of the submission interface of the target marketplace and can then obtain the price from the metadata and submit the price in response to that particular screen.","At block , the content submission manager  communicates the translated content submission to the target marketplace. Portions of the content submission may be communicated at different times. For example, a first file may be sent in response to a first prompt and a second file sent later in response to a second prompt. In some situations, only some of the content submission received from the user is passed on to the target marketplace while in other situations, the entire content submission may be sent. In some embodiments, enhanced content may be added to the content submission or substituted with portions of the content submission (e.g., content metadata  or content bundle ). For example, descriptive text may be added to the content metadata  or image files, such as screen shots of the application, may be added to the content bundle .","At block , the content submission manager  optionally determines whether the user desires that the content submission be submitted to additional marketplaces. For example, the request received by the content submission manager  at block  may have indicated a list of marketplaces for submission. In another example, the content submission manager  may examine an account associated with the user to determine whether additional marketplace submissions are desired by the user or to determine which additional marketplaces to submit the content to.","In one embodiment, the content submission is submitted to only the content marketplace  and the optional determination at block  is not made. In one embodiment, the content submission may be submitted to one or more additional third party marketplaces . If the content submission is to be submitted to additional marketplaces, the process proceeds back to block  to determine a second submission format (or third, or fourth, etc.) for another target marketplace. If no further marketplaces are targeted for submission, the process proceeds to block .","At block , the content submission manager  generates one or more reports comprising results of the content submission, as described above in . For example, the reports may include submission histories, versioning data for submitted content, the status of the submission, the progress of updating the content, or which marketplaces the content has been propagated to. After block , the process ends.","In some embodiments, the content submission manager  of  is executed or embodied by one or more computing systems. For example, in some embodiments, a server computing system that has components including a CPU, I\/O components, storage, and memory may be used to execute the content submission manager . The I\/O components include a display, a network connection to the network , a computer-readable media drive, and other I\/O devices (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, etc.). An embodiment of the content submission manager  can be stored as one or more executable program modules in the memory of the server and\/or on other types of non-transitory computer-readable storage media. In some embodiments, the content submission manager  may be configured differently than described above. For example, various functionalities provided by the modules can be combined, rearranged, added, or deleted. In some embodiments, additional or different processors or modules may perform some or all of the functionalities described above. The content submission system , including the components , ,  shown in , may be implemented by a computing system that comprises one or more physical computers or computing devices, including devices that are remote from each other. The computing system may be programmed via executable code modules to perform the various functions described herein. Many implementation variations are possible.","Each of the processes, methods, and algorithms described in the preceding sections may be embodied in, and fully or partially automated by, code modules executed by one or more computers or computer processors.
