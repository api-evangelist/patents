The government has certain rights in the invention.","Biofouling plagues a wide spectrum of applications, from medical devices to maritime vessels. For the latter, biofouling increases the fuel consumption of the vessel, in turn leading to increased operational and maintenance costs. Conventionally, the method of prevention has been through the use of anti-biofouling paints and coatings which release biocides, such as cuprous oxide and tributyltin; however, due to the negative effects these chemicals have on the environment, the use of these systems is in decline.","Fluoropolymers, siloxanes and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) have been researched extensively as anti-biofoulers due to their unique chemical compositions. Fluoropolymers are of particular interest due to a low surface energy, low wettability and chemical stability. Siloxanes, specifically poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), have shown anti-biofouling attributes due to their inertness, stability, and pliability. Commercially, PDMS coatings are marketed as non-toxic marine coatings due to the release and rejection of fouling agents under suitable hydrodynamic conditions. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), has been used extensively in the field of marine applications, as well as in the medical field due to its ability to generate surfaces that resist non-specific protein adsorption.","Biofouling can result from a number of mechanisms but generally involves protein adhesion and deposition by microorganisms or organisms to surfaces exposed to, and typically in fluid communication with, an environment which harbors the microorganisms or organisms. In maritime applications alone, the costs associated with maintenance, increased vessel drag, and other consequences of biofouling are billions of dollars per year.","There is a need to reduce biofouling of susceptible surfaces. Fluoropolymers, siloxanes and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) have been researched as anti-biofoulers due to their unique chemical compositions. Fluoropolymers are of particular interest due to a low surface energy, low wettability and chemical stability. Siloxanes, specifically poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), have shown anti-biofouling attributes due to their inertness, stability, and pliability. Commercially, PDMS coatings are marketed as non-toxic marine coatings due to the release and rejection of fouling agents under suitable hydrodynamic conditions. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), has been used extensively in the field of marine applications, as well as in the medical field due to its ability to generate surfaces that resist non-specific protein adsorption. Previously, linear PDMS has been modified to include hydrophilic and fluorinated moieties. However, the chemistries involved incorporation of linear PDMS backbones with chemical variation achieved via side group modification. This approach is limited, as it does not address the topological influences of surfaces in preventing biofouling. Topological heterogeneity in conjunction with chemical heterogeneity can further improve anti-biofouling performance through the inhibition of adhesive proteins that settle on the surface. Therefore, there remains a need for anti-biofouling compounds possessing significant topological and chemical heterogeneity.","The disclosed subject matter provides terpolymers of hyperbranched fluoropolymers, PEG and PDMS to mitigate biofouling in various applications.

In other words, reference to a group being a polyethylene glycol group does not require that the group consist of 100% ethylene glycol monomers without any linking groups, substitutions, impurities or other substituents (e.g., alkylene substituents). Such impurities or other substituents can be present in relatively minor amounts so long as they do not affect the functional performance of the compound, as compared to the same compound containing the respective polymer substituent with 100% purity.","As used herein, a terpolymer is a polymer comprising at least three different polymer substitutents (such as PEG, PDMS, and HBFP).","Reference will now be made to various aspects of the disclosed subject matter in view of the definitions above.","In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, a terpolymer comprising a hyperbranched fluropolymer is provided.

Hydrophilic polymers have an affinity for water, as measured by a low water contact angle (<30\u00b0), and\/or swellability or solubility in water. The amount of hydrophilic polymer component may vary. For example, the hydrophobic component may vary between 0-75 wt %, calculated with respect to the weight of the HBFP-containing component.

For example, certain HBFP-PEG-PDMS terpolymers display heterogenous, patch-work patterns of hydrophobic (e.g., low surface energy) and hydrophilic (e.g., water soluble and swellable) domains. The combination of hydrophobic, or rigid, domains with hydrophilic, or dynamic, domains provides a material capable of, among other things, reducing or preventing biofouling, and\/or promoting foulant release and removal. In other examples, certain HBFP-PEG-PDMSs may be characterized by increased fluorine content at the surface of the material.","In certain embodiments, the HBFP-PEG-PDMS of the present disclosure may be characterized by a micro- and nanoscopically-resolved topography. Topographical heterogeneity at the nanoscale may, among other things, prevent or reduce protein and\/or polysaccharide adhesion. Topographical heterogeneity at the microscale may, among other things, prevent or reduce organism adhesion. Together nano- and microscale topographical heterogeneity may synergistically work to prevent biofouling.","In certain embodiments, the HBFP-PEG-PDMS of the present disclosure may be characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of structural domains. For example, certain HBFP-PEG-PDMSs display heterogeneous, patch-work patterns of hydrophobic (e.g., rigid or hard) and hydrophilic (e.g., soft, dynamic or swellable) domains. The combination of domains with these properties provides a material capable of, among other things, reducing or preventing biofouling. In certain embodiments, the HBFP-PEG-PDMS of the present disclosure may show dynamic surface reorganization upon immersion in water, as measured by static water contact angle.","In certain embodiments, the HBFP-PEG-PDMS of the present disclosure may comprise a raised region, wherein the raised region is characterized by a high modulus, a low deformation, a low surface energy, and low dissipation; a lattice region, wherein the lattice region is characterized by a moderate modulus, a moderate deformation, a low surface energy, and a moderate dissipation; and a deeper interstitial region, wherein the deeper interstitial region is characterized by a low modulus, a high deformation, a high surface energy, and a high dissipation.","The dynamic and heterogeneous topology of the disclosed compounds has significant functional consequences in biofouling mitigation applications. Any fouling that occurs upon a substrate involves balancing of particular molecular-level attractive and repulsive interactions between the foulant and the surface. Marine organisms initially probe surfaces, decide whether or not to settle on either a hydrophobic, hydrophilic, soft or hard substrate and adhere by the secretion of adhesin proteins. In biomedical applications of materials, many different types of biomolecules and biomacromolecules make contact with the substrate, depending on the particular mechanism and site of administration. In other applications of anti-fouling coatings, the foulants may be various biological or synthetic chemicals encountered in the environment. Different fouling species experience different binding interactions with different anti-fouling coatings components. By designing polymer networks that present compositionally, topographically and morphologically-heterogeneous surfaces, therefore, a complex profile of attractive and repulsive interactions is provided, to limit the dimensions over which adhesion may occur. Moreover, the characteristic of dynamic reorganization of the surface components is a mechanism by which to alter the composition, topography, morphology features that are presented from the surface and, thereby, detach any initially adhered species, or to intercept and prevent their adhesion before it occurs. The combination of a complex surface that is capable of in situ reorganization is a powerful and unique concept toward anti-fouling coatings that exhibit exceptional anti-foulant and foulant-releasing performance.","As disclosed herein, and with reference to Example 1 below, the various topographical characterizations of the embodiments disclosed herein support a varied and dynamic topology for biofouling mitigation applications. For example, static surface contact angle measurements before and after water equilibration of these ternary systems provide compelling evidence of dynamic reordering in these systems. Further, by varying the formulation (e.g. PDMS and PEG ratios to HBFP), the system can be tailored to express greater amounts of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity on exposure to water and sea water. These reordering events are indicative of a non-static surface that contributes to greater heterogeneity in a dynamic fashion, in addition to its intrinsic heterogeneity as cast, and is intended to further confuse and dissuade biologic entities for settling.","Additionally, environmental dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) shows the bulk effects of the system in submersion at in-ocean and in-body conditions by exposing the system to temperatures and solvents that are similar to the environments of both applications. While the kinetics of the mechanical response to solvation, swell and the onset of a solvated steady-state response are obtainable from such studies, the determination of the final steady state behavior is perhaps most critical, as this will ultimately determine film wear and mechanical matching to any substrate. Moreover, Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and surface force spectroscopy (SFS) explicitly show both topographic complexity on the nano and microscale, while also capturing the exact distribution of constituents at the surface by relating nanomechanical measurements to the known behavior of PEG, PDMS and HBFP.","Uses of the Additives and Compositions for Antifouling Applications","The additives of the disclosed subject matter can be used in compositions that mitigate biofouling. For purpose of example and not limitation, suitable compositions for the disclosed compounds include surface coatings, including anti-fouling coatings for any surface that is placed in contact with a marine environment, biological fluid, or the environment.

In addition to the additives of the disclosed subject matter, the compositions can further contain adhesion agents, such as epoxides, dispersants, and stabilizers.","The compositions of the disclosed subject matter can further include, for example, lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, and reduced-friction surface coatings.","Furthermore, the additives of the disclosed subject matter can be added with other compatible components that address other problems that can present themselves in an oil refining process known to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The compounds of the disclosed subject matter can be incorporated into surface coatings and surface adhesives for disposition over the surface of an article. According to one aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the compounds are applied by means of dropping, painting, or pouring a solution containing the compounds onto the surface. Additionally or alternatively, and with reference to Example 2 below, the compounds can be spray coated over the surface of an article susceptible to biofouling. Coatings incorporating the disclosed compounds can be applied before first exposure of a surface to biofouling or during the life of the surface after initial exposure to biofouling.","While not limited thereto, the compounds of the disclosed subject matter are particularly suitable in reducing or preventing biofouling fouling. Thus one aspect of the disclosed subject matter provides a method of reducing and\/or preventing, in particular, biofouling that includes adding at least one compound of the disclosed subject matter to a surface that is known to or believed to be susceptible to biofouling.","In some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, a method to mitigate biofouling is provided comprising adding any one of the above-mentioned compounds to a coating for a surface that is susceptible to biofouling.","The total amount of the compound to be added to a coating or applied directly to a surface can be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, substantially the entire surface susceptible to biofouling is coated with the compound.","The compounds of the disclosed subject matter can be added to a coating solution in a solid (e.g. powder or granules) or liquid form directly to the coating solution. Any suitable technique can be used for adding the compound to a coating solution, as known by a person of ordinary skill in the art in view of the process to which it is employed.","The disclosed subject matter is further described by means of the examples, presented below.

To a scintillation vial was added a selected HBFP (100 mg), 1500 Da bis(3-aminopropyl)-terminated PEG (25 mg, 0.017 mmol, 25 wt %), 1500 Da bis(3-aminopropyl)-terminated PDMS (25 mg, 0.010 mmol, 25 wt %), THF (2 mL) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (0.05 mL, 0.3 mmol) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until homogeneous. The solution was drop cast (0.5 mL per slide) onto pre-cleaned, pre-cut 1 cmglass microscope slides. A period of ca. 30 min allowed for the solvent to evaporate, which afforded a thick pre-gel that was cured at 110\u00b0 C. for 45 min under Natmosphere to afford the dry coatings.

In both the dry and wet AFM images, complex topography is seen on the submicrometer scale and surface rearrangement is seen upon water immersion. The dynamic reorganization of the surface chemistry during the water immersion was also probed through static water contact angle measurements. The contact angle data of the dry films () show an overall decrease in the hydrophobicity of the surface with increasing amounts of PDMS, displaying that the HBFP fraction plays an integral role in the surface complexity of the system. Upon water immersion (), a decrease in the contact angle is seen in films with 50 wt % PEG or greater, indicating dynamic surface reorganization occurring in these systems and that the PEG-rich regions are discrete enough for isolated regions of water uptake to occur (). Upon wetting the surfaces having 0 or 25 wt % PEG, an opposite effect was observed, with increases in the static water contact angles (). This behavior has been observed for some amphiphilic materials that are capable of dynamic surface reorganization, where PEG-rich hydrophilic regions absorb water and promote an increase in the fluorocarbon hydrophobic content at the surface, ultimately, resulting in a contraphilic effect, as supported by previous work using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and observed in other systems as well.","Surface Compositional Heterogeneity","We next focused attention on the one sample composition that gave the most peculiar behavior. Given the generally high surface topographic roughnesses and trends of either increased or decreased water contact angle, for a minority (0 or 25 wt %) vs. majority (50 or 75 wt %) of PEG content relative to HBFP, respectively, the one sample that was unique was that having 50 wt % of each PEG and PDMS, relative to HBFP, which exhibited no change in water contact angle. In order to determine the contribution of the three constituencies to the surface character of the network, surface force spectroscopy (SFS) mapping was performed to differentiate between HBFP-, PDMS- and PEG-rich regions on the surface of the HBFP-PEG-PDMS terpolymer network with 50 wt % PEG and 50 wt % PDMS (\u201cTP\u201d). A particular focus was placed on the qualitative differences in surface response as a function of topography. The results of the SFS study are provided as AFM micrographs, spectral maps and 3D renderings in . Surface topography reveals two sets of features, a raised \u201clattice\u201d of interconnected regions and a lower region interstitial to the \u201clattice\u201d with a 6.0 nm height differential between the two. However, topography alone tells little in regards to the innate composition of the two regions and would, in a less complex system, imply a biphasic material. To further our understanding of the system's surface, SFS was used to determine the relative difference in surface character from feature to feature. Modulus mapping shows that the raised \u201clattice\u201d is composed of two major variations in response, with islands of higher modulus material connected by lower modulus material. The deeper, interstitial material appears the softest. Deformation mapping at constant force provides an inverse relationship to that observed from modulus mapping, with the stiff island regions deforming 2 nm, the raised portions connecting the island regions deforming 4 nm and the soft, lowered interstitial regions deforming 10 nm at a constant tapping force. Adhesion force mapping provides similar phase information as what might be assumed from topography, while also suggesting that the height of the features may be directly related to the surface energy where the raised regions are lower energy and the lower regions are rich in higher surface energy material. Dissipation mapping provides information about the energy loss to non-restorative forces after deformation, and correlates with deformation. From what is known about fluoropolymer, PDMS and PEG surfaces in general, the following assignments are made:\n\n","Surface Spectroscopy","To further support the results of the SFS findings, attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the surface composition of \u201cTP.\u201d ATR-IR provides IR spectra only for the first 100 nm of the sample network surface, making it a viable method for tracking chemical changes in a polymeric surface. Assessment of the surface of \u201cTP\u201d pre- and post-water exposure was performed. The assessment was also done for a PDMS and PEG film and pure HBFP powder. These results are provided in  and . It can be seen that both the PEG and HBFP samples express water signals almost exclusively after swelling. These results are reasonable, as both the PEG coating and the raw HBFP possess glycol domains which readily uptake water when other constraints do not exist. The PDMS surface displayed only a very small water signature, which is also reasonable. Considering the effects on the surface chemistry of the terpolymer system after wetting, several changes become immediately apparent. From comparison to the PEG surface, it can be seen that the PEG contribution to the 974 cmand 1460 cmpeak signals are greatly diminished after wetting the terpolymer surface. It can also be observed that the HBFP signals at 1497 cmand 1734 cmare expressly present in the terpolymer surface after wetting.","Neither of these findings are, in themselves, unique to this system as other HBFP-PEG networks have shown similar behaviors. The uniqueness of this system is in the gross expression of PDMS character after wetting, where the 1010 cm, 1080 cmand 1258 cmPDMS peaks dominate the spectra, thus making the overall spectra for the terpolymer surface after wetting most closely mimic the PDMS surface spectral signature. The dominance of the PDMS signature is an important result, as is it implies that HBFP, in the presence of mobile PDMS after water incubation, does not dominate the surface as in other HBFP-PEG systems. This result presents an entirely new method for controlling surface reorganization in these amphiphilic heterogeneous systems, opening a full range of surface controls previously unrealized. XPS results clarify that the surface initially possessed all three functionalities in sufficient quantities to have comparable spectral signatures ().","Thermal Response","TP was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis to determine how crosslinking influences the thermal stability of the network (). From ambient temperature to 250\u00b0 C., 5% mass loss is seen in the network, consistent with a partial degradation of PDMS. There are then two degradation events that can be seen in the network, the first occurring from 250\u00b0 C. to ca. 350\u00b0 C. corresponding to a continued degradation of PDMS, and then from 350\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C. resulting in an 80% mass loss of the sample in total, corresponding to the decomposition of HBFP and PEG. It can be seen through this study that the crosslinks in the system do not infer any additional thermal benefit to the network, but overall, this finding should not detract from the intended uses for this material.","Differential scanning calorimetry was used to probe the phase transitions present in the terpolymer network (). Upon heating, a melting transition can first be seen at 33\u00b0 C. which can be attributed to the PEG in the network followed by a Tat 63\u00b0 C. which can be attributed to HBFP. A third phase transition, a T, is then seen at 113\u00b0 C. which is also attributed to HBFP. HBFP has two unique glass transition temperatures arising from the two units that comprise the framework of the polymer. The Tat 63\u00b0 C. is most likely from the branching in the polymer framework in HBFP, with the second Tarising from linear pentafluorostyrene units.","Mechanical Response","Response in Atmosphere.","The mechanical properties of TP were investigated with a combination of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), dynamic thermal mechanical analysis (DTMA) and static stress-strain analysis. Initial investigation of TP by DTMA at 1 Hz () showed two phase transitions via tan \u03b4 peaks at 89 (A1) and 129\u00b0 C. (A2), which were assigned to a glass transition of the PEGylated fluorostyrene branching subunits and of the pentafluorosytrene subunits of the HBFP respectively. Room temperature (A0) storage modulus (E\u2032) was found to be 7.1 MPa with a loss modulus (E\u2033) of 1.1 MPa. A quasi-steady state character was reached near 150\u00b0 C. (A3), resulting in post-phase transition values of 0.92 and 0.16 MPa for E\u2032 and E\u2033. A frequency sweep at room temperature displayed frequency dependence typical of an amorphous material without significant phase separations or low temperature phase transitions imminent. A summary of DMA and DTMA data can be found in Table 1. Static stress-strain measurements resulted in a characteristic Young's modulus of 37\u00b11 MPa for deformations of less than 1%.","Response in a Marine Environment.","In order to assess the response in a marine setting, one of the target application environments for these materials, TP was assessed by DTMA in synthetic sea water. Temperature was decreased from 20 (M0) to 0\u00b0 C. over a two and a half hour period and allowed to equilibrate (M2). The mechanical response of the system over this period is summarized in Table 1, below, including the E\u2032\/E\u2033\/tan \u03b4 inflection point (M1) observed at 10\u00b0 C. and the equilibration time constant after reaching 0\u00b0 C. Results of this portion of the mechanical assessment are presented in  with a plot of the change in E\u2032\/E\u2033 per degree change in temperature, as a function of temperature, to display that at temperatures below 15\u00b0 C. the effect of temperature on stiffness drops off linearly. The ultimate character of TP at 0\u00b0 C. was a 25% increase in stiffness over initial submersion response and was 50% more resistant to deformation when compared to the ambient condition response in air.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0179"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of DMA\/DTMA with Kinetics"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Temp.",{},"E\u2032","E\u2033",{},"time","\u03c4",{}]},{"entry":[{},"(deg.

Therefore assessment of the mechanical response of the TP was performed at conditions that simulate an in-body environment. DMA was performed in a submersion of PBS at 37\u00b0 C. (B0) and monitored to observe solvent uptake (B1 & B2), swelling (B3) and the steady state (B4) response of the film after reaching solvent equilibrium (). Two (relatively) fast phases of initial solvent uptake are observed with transition lifetimes of 0.03 and 0.12 h, and are assigned to rapid association of PEG domains and amphiphilic HBFP domains respectively. These processes resulted in a total loss of ca. 65% of film stiffness. After initial solvent intercalation into the matrix, a swell period of 1.3 h with a transformation lifetime of 0.32 h occurred before beginning an equilibration process resulting in storage and loss moduli similar to that observed in the steady state of the marine application experiment. The similarities are likely a coincidence, as the reasons for both having steady state submersed mechanical properties roughly twice as stiff as the ambient matrix are completely different (e.g. the warmer sample has many rotating bonds in the backbone resulting in a pre-glass transition tensing of the matrix which will dictate mechanical response, whereas rigidity is responsible for the character of the colder sample). However, it is an interesting observation as that TP can be expected to perform similarly in both environments in its current formulation.","Non-Specific Protein Resistance","In an attempt to assess the terpolymer network's surface resistance to non-specific protein binding, an assay was performed using bovine serum albumin (BSA) coupled to Alexa Flour-680. Both TP and a PDMS standard (Sylgard 184) were assessed after 45 min of incubation with a 0.1 mg\/mL BSA in PBS buffer via confocal fluorescence microscopy. Comparison of the two surfaces emission histograms from 650 nm to 750 nm after 635 nm excitation can be found in  along with the integrated z-stack images (). The change in relative intensities, with identical excitation and collection regimes, shows TP's surface to be ca. 60% less susceptible to BSA adsorption than the standard Sylgard 184 PDMS surface.","Conclusion","A series of amphiphilic coatings utilizing HBFP, PEG and PDMS with unique surface characteristics were synthesized and characterized. It was shown that heterocomplexity and surface energy are explicitly functions of chemical composition, and that these systems show promise for use as anti-biofouling coatings.","Differing from previous fluoropolymer-PEG systems through incorporation of PDMS, the synthesized terpolymer system expands on the current generation of coatings and displays distinctive topographical, compositional and morphological features, as seen specifically through the analysis of the surfaces by surface force and ATR-IR spectroscopies. The systems presented here provide enhanced surface complexity with no significant increase in the synthetic or cure conditions. This system also provides an entirely new mode of dynamic surface reorganization as shown by preferential emergence of PDMS character on the surface after water immersion and differing from the heavy fluoropolymer expression observed in previous HBFP-PEG formulations.","By varying the compositional ratios of the three constituents, a wide range of topographical, hydroscopic and swell-reorganization variations were displayed. Microscopic characterization revealed a highly disordered heterogeneous surface that varied both topographically and chemically at the micro- and nano-scale. Investigation of non-specific protein binding resistance of the terpolymer network is encouraging; with significantly better resistance to protein adsorption than a commercially available anti-biofouling PDMS standard.","Bulk thermal and mechanical characterization revealed the kinetics and degree of matrix change at both marine and in-body conditions. All of these features provide a new type of amphiphilic surface uniquely qualified for further investigation as a new branch of anti-biofouling material.","Anti-biofouling surfaces were produced by synthesis of terpolymer coatings composed of hyperbranched fluoropolymers crosslinked with bisamino-propyl poly(ethylene glycol) and bisamino-propyl polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This HBFP was chosen, due to its amphiphilic character, which enhances anti-biofouling performance while retaining the desired nanoscale surface heterogeneities. Crosslinking in this system occurred via a substitution reaction of the bromoacetyl and bromobenzyl groups of HBFP with the amine termini of both the linear PEG and PDMS crosslinkers. Nanoscale imaging and surface spectroscopy confirmed that this system possessed complex surface topographies and chemical compositions. Surface complexity was determined to be due to molecular interactions, phase segregation and compositional gradients arising between the three components. A clear difference in surface behaviour was observable before and after exposure to water. Anti-biofouling characteristics were investigated by bovine serum albumin (BSA) adhesion studies, displaying a 60% greater resistance to protein adsorption, in comparison to the fouling of a PDMS standard.","An array of HBFP-PEG-PDMS were produced to investigate the anti-biofouling performance of the coatings. The amounts of the crosslinkers were varied with respect to HBFP to create a 3\u00d73 array of coatings with varying weight percentages of PEG and PDMS (25 wt %, 50 wt % and 75 wt %) to determine which composition and properties afford the most promising characteristics for future anti-biofouling coatings.","A range of test coatings were prepared for evaluation. Coatings were mounted on an epoxy barrier coat (Interseal 670HS). Generally, the two component system of Interseal 670HS was mixed per the manufacturer's instructions (5.70 mL:1 mL of Part A:Part B) and was then diluted with 3 mL of THF. The system was applied to a glass microscope slides via an airbrush applicator (Central Pneumatic) using an application pressure of 50 psi. The system allowed to cure at ambient temperature for 18 hours. To a scintillation vial was added a selected HBFP (370 mg, 0.032 mmol)), 1500 Da bis(3-aminopropyl)-terminated PEG (92.5 mg, 0.062 mmol, 25 wt %), 1500 Da bis(3-aminopropyl)-terminated PDMS (92.5 mg, 0.037 mmol, 25 wt %), THF (20 mL) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (0.050 mL, 0.30 mmol) and the mixture was svortexed until homogeneous. The film was then applied to 8 coated glass microscope slides via an airbrush applicator using an application pressure of 50 psi. The film was then cured in an oven at 110\u00b0 C. for 45 min under N2 atmosphere to afford the dry coatings. Slides coated with only the barrier coat (under-coat) were supplied as a control to check that it was not affecting the attachment of the diatoms. Water contact angles for the coatings were evaluated to estimate hydrophobicity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0169","num":"0192"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"List of test coatings showing weight percentages of PEG and PDMS in"},{"entry":"the HBFP terpolymer coatings and associated water contact angles"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["No.","% PEG","% PDMS","Con Ang","Con Ang"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["U coat","Interseal under-coat",{},"dry","wet"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","25","25","83.7 + 3.7","107.4 + 2.8"]},{"entry":["2","25","50","80.7 + 2.5","\u200289.4 + 2.6"]},{"entry":["3","25","75","76.8 + 3.6","\u200283.6 + 3.5"]},{"entry":["4","50","25","109.2 + 6.2\u2002","101.8 + 4.2"]},{"entry":["5","50","50","100.9 + 5.5\u2002","108.9 + 4.0"]},{"entry":["6","50","75","73.5 + 4.4","\u200284.9 + 2.2"]},{"entry":["7","75","25","97.7 + 3.1","107.9 + 4.0"]},{"entry":["8","75","50","85.2 + 5.1","103.5 + 1.3"]},{"entry":["9","75","75","86.6 + 4.9","\u200279.3 + 2.8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Methods","Generally, standard methods were used.","Coating Equilibration in Seawater","All coatings were equilibrated in de-ionised water for 24 hours followed by 0.22 \u03bcm filtered artificial seawater for 2 hours prior to testing.","Initial Attachment (Density of Cells Attached after Gentle Washing)","N incerta cells were cultured in F\/2 medium contained in 250 ml conical flasks. After 3 days the cells were in log phase growth. Cells were washed 3 times in fresh medium before harvesting and diluted to give a suspension with a chlorophyll a content of approximately 0.25 \u03bcg ml\u22121. Cells were settled in individual dishes containing 10 ml of suspension at room temperature on the laboratory bench. After 2 hours the slides were exposed to a submerged wash in seawater to remove cells which had not attached (the immersion process avoided passing the samples through the air-water interface). Samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, air dried and the density of cells attached to the surface was counted on each slide using a fluorescence microscope. Strong autofluorescence from the samples meant that counting could not be automated and counts were made by eye. Counts were made for 10 fields of view (each 0.15 mm2) on each slide. Results are shown in .","Strength of Attachment","Slides with attached cells of N. incerta were exposed to a shear stress of 20 Pa in a water channel. Samples were fixed and the number of cells remaining attached was counted using the method described above. Results are shown in . The density of attached N. incerta on the test coatings after washing i.e. initial attachment density is illustrated in . Each point is the mean from 30 counts on 3 replicate slides. Bars show 95% confidence limits.","Settlement of Zoospores","Zoospores were obtained from mature plants of by the standard method. A suspension of zoospores (10 ml; 1\u00d7106 spores ml\u22121) was added to individual compartments of quadriperm dishes containing the samples. After 45 minutes in darkness at room temperature, the slides were washed by passing 10 times through a beaker of seawater to remove unsettled (i.e. swimming) spores. Slides were fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde in seawater. The density of zoospores attached to the surface was counted on each of 3 replicate slides using an image analysis system attached to a fluorescence microscope. Spores were visualised by autofluorescence of chlorophyll. Counts were made for 30 fields of view (each 0.15 mm) on each slide. Results are shown in .","Growth of Sporelings","Spores were allowed to settle on the coatings for 45 minutes and then washed as described above. The spores were cultured using supplemented seawater medium for 7 days to produce sporelings (young plants) on 6 replicate slides of each treatment. Sporeling growth medium was refreshed every 48 hours.","Sporeling biomass was determined in situ by measuring the fluorescence of the chlorophyll contained within the sporelings in a Tecan fluorescence plate reader. Using this method the biomass was quantified in terms of relative fluorescence units (RFU). The RFU value for each slide is the mean of 70 point fluorescence readings taken from the central portion. The sporeling growth data are expressed at  as the mean RFU of 6 replicate slides; bars show SEM (standard error of the mean).","Strength of Attachment of Sporelings","Strength of attachment of sporelings was initially assessed using a shear stress of 52 Pa in the water channel (52 Pa is the maximum achievable). There was negligible removal from any of the terpolymer coatings and consequently the apparatus was changed for the higher powered water jet. The relative attachment strength of sporelings on the terpolymer coatings was determined by exposure to a water jet producing an impact pressure of 112 kPa. Biomass remaining after exposure to the water jet was determined using the fluorescence plate reader (as above). The percentage removal as shown at  was calculated from readings taken before and after exposure to the water jet.","Results & Discussion","Initial Attachment of Diatoms:","Diatoms sink in the water column and land on the coating surfaces by gravity. Therefore, before washing, the cell density on all the test surfaces is the same, irrespective of chemistry. The process of washing removes unattached and weakly attached cells and thus differences in initial attachment density reflect differences in the ability of cells to attach firmly to the surfaces and resist the hydrodynamic forces of washing.","The initial attachment densities of diatoms were broadly similar on all the terpolymer test coatings (). Attachment densities were higher on the glass standard and on the Interseal undercoat.","Strength of Attachment of Diatoms","Diatom removal due to a shear stress of 20 Pa was higher from the three coatings containing PEG at 75 wgt % than from the other coatings (). Removal was exceptionally low from the coatings containing PEG at 25 and 50 wgt % in conjunction with PDMS at 50 wgt %.","The density of diatoms remaining on the terpolymer coatings was lowest on the coatings containing PEG at 75 wgt % in conjunction with PDMS at 50 and 75 wgt % ().","Settlement of Zoospores","Spore settlement density on the terpolymer coatings differed between formulations (). On the PEG 25 coatings, settlement density was similar at all PDMS loadings. However, on the PEG 50 coatings settlement density decreased with PDMS content, whilst on the PEG 75 coatings it increased.","Growth of Sporelings","Biomass generation on all coatings broadly reflected the spore settlement densities described above (). Sporeling growth appeared normal on all coatings with no signs of toxicity () (from left, the coatings illustrated in  are: Control; PEG 25+PD 25, 50, 75; PEG 50+PD 25, 50, 75; PEG 75+PD 25, 50, 75).","Strength of Attachment of Sporelings","The percent removal of sporelings is shown in . None of the coatings had a fouling-release performance that was as good as the PDMSe standard. Adhesion strength on the PEG 25 coatings was similar at all PDMS loadings. On the PEG 50 coatings adhesion strength decreased with PDMS content i.e. % removal increased as PDMS content increased. On the PEG 75 coatings adhesion strength was slightly higher (i.e. less removal) on the PDMS 50% loading than on the 25 and 75% loadings.","At a PEG content of 25%, neither antifouling (spore settlement) or fouling-release performance were affected by PDMS content. When the PEG content was increased to 50%, spore settlement density and adhesion strength both decreased as the PDMS content increased.","The disclosed subject matter is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.
