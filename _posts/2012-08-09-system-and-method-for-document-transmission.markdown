As a non-limiting example, tablet computer  can be configured to selectively show or hide a virtual keyboard . Other types of input devices can be provided on chassis , other than touch membrane , or in addition to touch membrane , can be used. For example, a physical keyboard, or touch-pad, or joystick or trackball or track-wheel, a microphone, or optical camera or any one or more of them can be provided, in addition to or in lieu of touch membrane . Such other components may, if desired, be \u201cslide-out\u201d components. In example implementation, tablet computer  also includes a speaker  for generating audio output.

(Generically, additional application , and collectively, additional applications . This nomenclature is used elsewhere herein.) Printer service , document manager  and additional applications  can be pre-stored in non-volatile storage  upon manufacture of tablet computer , or downloaded via network interface  and saved on non-volatile storage  at any time subsequent to manufacture of tablet computer .","Processor  is configured to execute printer service , accessing non-volatile storage  and volatile storage  as needed. As will be explained further below, printer service  is configured to emulate a traditional, paper-based printer such that tablet computer  can appear on a network as a printer to other devices connected to that network, so that documents can be virtually printed to tablet computer  and stored on non-volatile storage  or volatile storage  or both from other devices on the network.","Processor  is also configured to execute document manager , accessing non-volatile storage  and volatile storage  as needed. The implementation of document manager  is not particularly limited, but is generally configured to receive input instructions to browse and access any documents or files stored on tablet computer . In particular, virtually printed documents that are received via printer service  can be browsed and opened via document manager . Document manager  can be implemented as a file manager application, or can be part of a document reader or document editor application, or all of them.","Additional applications  can be any application that can be stored and executed according to the processor and other resources of tablet computer . Such additional applications  can also include their own document managers or can be document readers or can be any other type of application as well.","Tablet computer  is also configured to maintain a unique identifier  for identifying tablet computer  from other network devices, as will be discussed further below. Non-limiting examples of possible types of unique identifiers include a serial number for processor , or an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). Other types of unique identifiers will now occur to those skilled in the art.","Furthermore, tablet computer  is also configured to maintain a portable account identifier  for associating the tablet computer with a user, as will be discussed further below. Non-limiting examples of possible types of portable account identifiers include an email address, or an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). Other types of portable account identifiers will now occur to those skilled in the art.","As will be discussed in greater detail below, a relationship  can be established between portable account identifier  and unique identifier  which can be used to address print requests to tablet computer . The term relationship is used herein to refer to, in an example embodiment, a unique number that represents the pairing of portable account identifier  and unique identifier . Such a unique number may be a hash or a concatenation, or can be generated using any desired computing operation.","In , a document management system using printer emulation in accordance with another example embodiment is shown generally at . System  generally contemplates an enterprise configuration  that includes a plurality of tablet computers  that are all associated with an enterprise configuration .","Enterprise configuration  thus includes at least one computer , Computer , in example embodiments, is a computer that is not intended to be moved often, such as workstation computer, desktop computer or a server. However, in other example embodiments computer  may be portable and can include, without limitation, a cellular telephone, a portable email paging device, a camera, a portable music player, a portable video player, a personal digital assistant, a portable book reader, a portable video game player, a netbook computer, a laptop computer, or combinations of these devices.","Computer  is configured to execute a document application . The nature of document application  is not particularly limited, and can be, for example, a word processor, a spreadsheet editor, a web browser, a presentation creation application or any other application where a print function is included that permits generation of a document from documentation application  onto a printer (not shown).","The at least one computer  is also configured to maintain a virtual printer driver  respective to one or more of tablet computers . While  shows computer  maintaining a printer driver  respective to each tablet computer , computer  need not maintain a printer driver  for all tablet computers . Thus, document application  can also be used to send a print request to any tablet computer  that has its respective printer driver  installed on computer .","Printer driver  is generally configured to conform with specification for the operating system that is native to computer , thereby obviating the need to materially modify computer . By the same token output files generated using printer driver  are generally configured to conform with the computing environment of its respective tablet computer . Thus, printer driver  can be configured to include, the ability to define, on virtual-printing of a document from document application , various printing options, such as which pages to print, number of pages per sheet, watermarking, portrait vs. landscape mode, paper size, resolution, colour vs. grayscale vs. black-and-white, scaling, margins and the like. In certain implementations, the printer driver  could be configured to utilize a standard script such as Postscript. The options provided can also consider the computing environment of the destination tablet computer , such as screen size, screen resolution, available processing and memory resources, such that output file that is sent is optimized or otherwise consistent with that computing environment. Printer drivers  can also be configured to be processing-intensive such that output files generated at computer  are substantially completely rendered at computer  for display on the destination tablet computer . Alternatively, printer drivers  can be configured to consume as little processing resources as possible at computer  so that the majority of processing and rendering occurs at the destination tablet computer . Other aspects of printer drivers  will be discussed further below.","Enterprise configuration  also includes a private network  to which computer  can connect. Private network  also connects to an enterprise wireless base station  and an enterprise server , both of which are also associated with enterprise configuration . Private network  can also connect to various other computing devices (not shown), such as additional computers, or printers, or file servers, or print servers that are associated with the enterprise. Private network  also connects to a public network  through an enterprise firewall .","Private network  can be based on any known local area network architectures, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) network running over Ethernet. Wireless base station  is typically a wireless local area network (WLAN) base station utilizing IEEE standard 802.11 or one of its variants. Tablet computers  can all connect to private network  via wireless base station  using their respective network interfaces . In , only tablet computer - and tablet computer - are shown connected to wireless base station , but tablet computer -can also connect to wireless base station . Typically, a given tablet computer  will associate with wireless base station  when in range of wireless base station .","As will be discussed further below, enterprise server  is configured to manage a network printer address for tablet computer  that is used to route a print request from computer  (or another computer) based on relationship  between portable account identifier  and unique identifier .","Public network  typically includes the Internet as well as interconnections with other types of public networks such as cellular telecommunication networks or Wi-Fi hotspots. Accordingly, one or more base stations  are connected to public network . Base station  can thus be based on core mobile telecommunication network protocols (E.g. 3G, EDGE, as discussed above) or can be based on WLAN architectures such as public mobile hotspots. In an example embodiment, a plurality of base stations  can be typically provided, any one or more of which can be associated with a given tablet computer . In , only tablet computer -is shown connected to wireless base station , but tablet computer - or tablet computer - can also connect to wireless base station . Typically, a given tablet computer  will associate with wireless base station  when in range of wireless base station , and utilize that association when that tablet computer  is not within range of wireless base station .","In , a flowchart depicting a method for document management using printer emulation is indicated generally at . Method  is one example in which printer service  on the tablet computer  can be implemented. It is also emphasized that the method  can be varied and that the method  need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown. To assist in discussion of method , a specific example to its performance will be discussed in relation to tablet computer  and system .","Block  includes establishing a relationship in electronic memory between a portable account identifier and a unique identifier. In tablet computer , block  includes establishing relationship  between unique device identifier  and portable account identifier . Block  can be performed once when tablet computer  is originally provisioned with an account (not shown), such provisioning including associating the unique device identifier  of tablet computer  with the portable account identifier . Relationship  can subsequently be terminated, and that portable account identifier  can be associated with other tablet computers .","Block  includes receiving a print request over a network. In system , the print request originates from computer . The print request includes an output file. The print request is created from document manager  using the printer driver  maintained on computer  that is associated with its respective tablet computer . The network printer address for the tablet computer  that is used to route the print request is managed by server  based on the relationship between the portable account identifier and the unique identifier. The methods by which server  manages the network printer address is not particularly limited, and various non-limiting examples of such management will be discussed below.","In tablet computer , the print request is received at print service  of tablet computer .","Block  includes displaying the output file that was part of the print request at block . In tablet computer , block  can be effected by print service  transferring the output file received at block  to the document manager application  within tablet computer . When the document manager application  is executed on processor , then the output file is generated on display  under the control of processor . It will thus be apparent that block  need not occur immediately and that the output file can be stored on tablet computer  until such time as block  is invoked.","The methods by which server  manages the network printer address used to send print requests from computer  to a given tablet computer  is not particularly limited.  shows one example of how block  can be implemented. In , system  is shown with a print request  being sent from document application  directly to tablet computer - via printer driver - along a pathway . Pathway  thus contemplates that print request  is addressed directly to tablet computer -. Thus, in , printer driver - is equipped with the direct network printer address of tablet computer - by server .","In , a flowchart depicting a method for virtual printer driver installation is indicated generally at . Method  thus contemplates one example in which driver - that utilizes pathway  of  can be installed on computer . In example embodiments, method  can be varied and that the method  need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown.","Block  thus includes receiving a driver installation request. The driver installation request can be effected using printer driver installation wizards that are native to the operating system used on computer . For example, in a Windows XP\u2122 environment, the \u201cAdd Printer Wizard\u201d can be used can be used to browse for a network printer. This example implementation is useful because no third-party software or application needs to be installed on computer  in order to install the printer driver , thereby providing an implementation for system  without modifying computer  except to provide computer  with a printer driver that conforms with the operating system specifications for computer .","Server  is configured to host virtual representations of the print service  for each tablet computer  that are browsable by computer  over private network . (However, browsing is only one such example in which native printer driver installation wizards may be utilized.) Such browsing may be either directly to server , or via another server (not shown) that hosts a directory of printers available to computer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["204","405","248","248","1","248","2","248","212"],"i":"n "},"For discussion purposes, Table I provides an example initial relationship between the virtual printers as labeled in  and tablet computers , the contents of Table I being maintained by server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"First Example of Accounts, Identifiers and Relationships"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["ACCOUNT LAYER","DEVICE LAYER","RELATION-"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Account","Tablet","Unique","SHIP LAYER"]},{"entry":["Account","Identifier","Computer","Identifier","Relationship"]},{"entry":["Label 248","138","50","136","142"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Label 248-1","138-1","50-1","136-1","142-1"]},{"entry":"(\u201cJohn's"},{"entry":"Tablet\u201d)"},{"entry":["Label 248-2","138-2","50-2","136-2","142-2"]},{"entry":"(\u201cDave's"},{"entry":"Tablet\u201d)"},{"entry":["Label 248-n","138-n","50-n","136-n","142-n"]},{"entry":"(\u201cSteve's"},{"entry":"Tablet\u201d)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As emphasized above, Table I represents an initial relationship, but it is contemplated that such relationships can change and be dynamically accommodated such that the risk of a document being virtually printed to an incorrect tablet computer  is reduced or mitigated.

In example embodiments, various controls can be used to mitigate or reduce the likelihood of such unauthorized access occurring.","One technique contemplates that printer service  is configured to verify that its local relationship  is valid before accepting or processing print request . Thus a copy of relationship  can be included in print request  and then upon receipt of print request, printer service  will verify that the relationship  received in the print request  matches the relationship  stored locally on the tablet computer -. Thus, according to this technique, tablet computer - can be remotely wiped using existing techniques such that account identifier  and relationship  are deleted from tablet computer - during the remote wipe, so that printer service  will fail to validate the relationship and printer service  refuses to accept the print request. Another variation contemplates that the printer network address is itself managed by printer service , and thus the remote wipe will automatically render the tablet computer - unaddressable in the print request . A still further technique contemplates the use of an encryption methodology based on relationship , such that the printer driver  will utilize relationship  as part of encryption key to generate print request . Relationship  can be used as the encryption key itself, thus, the wiping of relationship  from tablet computer - will result in the wiping of the encryption key. Additional security can be provided by having relationship  be an index to an decryption key that is generated elsewhere (e.g. server ) and then stored on tablet computer -, (with the corresponding encryption key being incorporated directly into printer driver -), again such that the decryption key is wiped upon a remote wipe of tablet computer -.","In , another system for document management is indicated generally at . System is a variation on system  and thus like references bear like elements except followed by the suffix \u201ca\u201d. System can use another approach to implementing block , whereby print requests are always carried through server . In this manner, further security can be afforded without concern about the state of the printer driver as installed on computer , since the validity of all print requests are centrally administered by server . Indeed, when Table I changes to Table II, server can be configured to simply refuse print requests from computer and return an error to computer . Furthermore, when there is a change of one account to another tablet computer , then an installed printer driver need not necessarily be updated, but rather server will automatically route the print request associated with one account to the new tablet computer ","In a further variation, server can be configured to locally host a print service  for each tablet computer , and then to send the document to the document manager  on the destination tablet computer , thereby obviating the need for a print service  on each tablet computer and facilitating the use of example embodiments disclosed herein on legacy tablet computers or other legacy computer devices. In this example, the output file can be converted to an email attachment that is sent to the correct tablet computer as an email attachment (e.g. as a PDF, TIFF, JPG or other standard image file) to document manager  or other application within the destination tablet computer ","Usefully, the functionality of server can be incorporated directly into existing enterprise servers, such as an Microsoft Exchange Server, or a BlackBerry Enterprise Server, leveraging off of existing infrastructure in the existing enterprise server. Furthermore different layers of encryption can be provided between computer and server , or between server and tablet computers ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["200","200","200","200","220","204","50","50"],"i":["b","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b "]},"Certain other general features can be used in variations. For example, in a less secure context tablet  can be configured to advertise itself as an available printer on a network bypassing server  altogether. As another example, tablet  can be configured with near field communication apparatuses which can be detected by computer  and used to obtain and establish a printer driver .","As another example, tablet  can be configured to send an email or other electronic communication to computer . Such an electronic communication can be configured to include a dedicated printer driver , or a link to such a dedicated printer driver . Upon receipt of the electronic communication computer  can be configured to utilize the electronic communication to install the dedicated printer driver .","For added security, temporary public encryption keys can be used to install the printer, drivers . Alternatively, such encryption keys can be configured to permit a \u201csingle print\u201d from the computer  and thereafter be unusable for sending printed files directly to tablet . (E.g. the printer driver  expires after one print). In the case of the temporary key, printer driver  can be configured to remove itself from the list of printer devices after expiry.","Alternatively, once paired, the target appears as a printer on the source device until it is removed.","Alternatively, tablet computer  can be configured to require or automatically accept submitted files to include source signature authentication.","Tablet computer  can also be configured to send a notification warning that print request  is being sent. Alternatively, or in addition, tablet computer  can be configured to automatically accept or deny the print request  based on characteristics such as file size, format etc. Such a notification can be sent by email, text message or the like. Likewise a notification can also be sent to computer .","In another variation, server  can be configured to receive a print request  from computer , and then configured to in turn send that print request  to a plurality of different tablet computers , caching the print request  until a particular tablet computer  comes back on line. Most general case of this could be a print to email service","Computer  can also be configured to, via the printer driver  or other methods, to print the file with a hash of the file encoded with its private key so that tablet computer  can confirm that it does come from a known source via the public key for that computer . Computer  can also be configured to receive a fax on behalf of a given tablet computer  and then to send that fax as a print requests  to the tablet computer .","In a further example variation, the Wi-Fi Direct\u2122 or similar technology enabling Wi-Fi devices to connect directly, for operations such as printing, sharing, synching and displaying.","In yet a further example variation, Bluetooth\u2122 or similar technology enabling Bluetooth\u2122 enabled devices to connect directly can be used for operations such as printing, sharing, synching and displaying.","In yet further example variations, any other suitable technology for connecting devices can be used for operations such as printing, sharing, synching and displaying including, but not limited to, wired and wireless connections.

In an example embodiment, each of links , ,  can be implemented according to SIP (Session Initiation protocol) protocol. Link  can be implemented according to any suitable protocol.","Notification application  (also referred to herein as notification ) includes an application for implementing the printing process of method . For example, notification  can be enabled to provide notification to, for example print service , that server and\/or computer is waiting for tablet device to perform an action and hence cause tablet computer to perform an action such as pull print request from computer , as will presently be explained.","Similarly, file transfer application  (also be referred to herein as file transfer ) includes an application for receiving print request , such as a web server application and providing print request to print service ","In some implementations, print service includes one or more of notification  and file transfer , while in other implementations each of print service , notification  and file transfer  can include separate modules at tablet computer each enabled to interact with one another.

At , print driver at computer determines that a file is ready to be \u201cprinted\u201d (i.e. printed to tablet computer ), for example print request . In specific non-limiting implementations, at , computer causes a \u201cmini\u201d HTTP (Hypertext Transfer (or Transport) Protocol) server to be processed to assist in file transfer. At , computer generates a suitable security key, for example the encryption key described above.","At , computer posts a URL (uniform resource locator) of the mini HTTP server to server (e.g. via link ), as well as any suitable identifier of tablet computer (\u201cBBID\u201d), such as an identifier  described above, and information identifying the file to be printed. The post at  can include the security key generated at . At , server locates tablet computer via the identifier of tablet computer , and at  transmits an invite message to notification  at tablet computer , for example via link , which can also include the security key.

At , discovery notifies print service that a print event has been requested, and at print service causes PAUI to provide a prompt at a display of tablet computer as to whether or not to accept the incoming print request. For example, print service and PAUI can communicate via link , such that PAUI provides a prompt at the display of tablet computer such as \u201cIncoming print request\u201d with an option to \u201cAccept\u201d or \u201cDecline\u201d the request. The format and\/or wording of the prompt is not to be considered particularly limiting.","In any event, while tablet computer is waiting for a response to the prompt, at , print service notifies discovery that a prompt is being provided and that tablet computer is waiting for a response to the prompt. In turn, at , discovery notifies server (\u201c18x\u201d in SIP notation) that tablet is providing an alert to a print request. At , server creates a session and at provides a session identifier to computer , which responds at with a hanging \u201cGET\u201d request. In other words, at least a portion of computer enters a waiting mode until a response to the prompt is received.","In present implementations, it is assumed that a positive response to the prompt is received at : for example, PAUI received the positive response and communicates such to print service . In other implementations, a negative response to the prompt can be received, which point messages are exchanged between tablet device , server and computer indicating that the print request has been rejected. However, in present implementations, when a positive response to the prompt is received at , at , print service communicates with file transfer to create a file transfer session. File transfer starts a mini HTTP server at tablet device , similar to the mini HTTP server started by computer at . File transfer responds, at , by generating an address for receiving print request , which in these implementations can include but is not limited to an IP address, a file transfer URL, and the like. The address for receiving print request is then provided to print service at , and at  print service notifies discovery that the prompt has received a positive response along with the address for receiving the print request ","At , discovery notifies (\u201c200OK\u201d) server of the address for receiving print request , and acknowledges the notification at . In turn, at , server notifies computer of the address for receiving print request . Computer interprets message received at  as a response to the hanging \u201cGET\u201d at , and responds at  by posting print request to the address received at : in other words computer transmits print request to the file URL generated by file transfer at , for example via link . File transfer responds to receiving print request by: at  notifying computer that print request has been received; and at  notifying print service that print request has been received. At  print service notifies discovery that the session is to be terminated, and at  discovery notifies server that the session is to be terminated (e.g. using both a \u201c200OK\u201d message and a \u201cBYE\u201d Message).","In these implementations, server is enabled to negotiate the notification process and that computer pushes print request to tablet computer once tablet computer print request has been approved at tablet computer . In these example implementations, a web service is first offered (in a notification request) from a first computing device (e.g. computer ) to a second computing device (e.g. tablet computer ), and the second computing device returns a network address (e.g. an IP address and\/or a URL) to the first computing device once the web service is approved (e.g. by receiving a positive response to a prompt provided at a display device of the second computing device); a file associated with the web service is then pushed to the provided network address. Hence, a user associated with the second computer has an option to accept or decline a notification request.","However, in other example implementations, -can be omitted and print request is pushed to tablet computer without providing a prompt.","In further example implementations, print driver at computer invoke a RESTful interface on server (e.g. over HTTPS), to \u201cdiscover and communicate\u201d with its peer app component (e.g. discovery ) at target table computer . This is essentially a \u201cprint request\u201d from the computer to tablet computer ","Server authenticates the request, to verify the identity of the requestor. Server does this by verifying a \u201ctoken\u201d that server had issued to computer previously.","Server then locates tablet computer based on a device identifier and notify tablet computer about the event. If tablet computer is not found, or not \u201cin coverage\u201d at, server would return an error response back to print driver and an error message will be presented at work station ","At tablet computer , discovery receives the event (e.g. over SIP infrastructure) and notifies print service , which has previously subscribed to this event type. A prompt to accept the request can be included or omitted. In any event, once the request is accepted print service requests file transfer to setup and provide a file address (e.g. the URL referred to above) for file transfer. File transfer then sends back the file address to server which in turn responds back to computer . Print driver then transfers the file (i.e. print request ) directly tablet computer using the file address.","In some implementations, signaling and call flow can change to support session-based poke-and-pull notifications (e.g. using a SIP INVITE method) when prompting is supported and\/or to support printing to multiple devices simultaneously, canceling a print requests, etc. In an example embodiment, STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (network address translation)) [RFC (Request for Comments) 5389] protocol can be used by tablet computer to obtain its external IP address, and if a direct connection is not possible due to firewall and NAT traversal issues, a globally accessible media midpoint can be used, similar to TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) [RFC 5766) and ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) [RFC 5245].","Attention is next directed to  which depicts a diagram of communications between print driver at computer , server and print service , discovery and file transfer at tablet computer in implementation where a \u201cpush\u201d process is implemented, in which computer pushes print request to tablet computer .

While a similar step is not depicted in , a similar step can occur in the communication diagrams of .","At , computer posts to server : the identifier of tablet computer and information regarding the document to be printed, for example a file identifier and\/or file name. However, any suitable information can be posted which indicates that a document is to be printed to tablet computer and that the information posted is not to be considered particularly limiting.","At , server transmits an invite message to discovery similar to the invite message of . At , discovery notifies print service that a print event has been requested. At , print service communicates with file transfer to create a session, which returns a session address (\u201csessionURL\u201d) to print service . In some example implementations, a file location identifier is also passed from computer to server to tablet computer , which can be provided to file transfer ","At , print service acknowledges receipt of the notify message received at , and further provides the session address to discovery which transmits the session address to server  at , which in turn transmits the session address to computer at , as well as acknowledging receipt of session address at ","In addition to implementing , at , print service causes a prompt to be provided similar to described above. In other words, while the session addressed is being passed to computer , tablet provides a prompt as to whether or not accept the print request.","In any event, at , computer transmits a \u201cGET\u201d request to the session addressed provided at . The get request at is a hanging \u201cGET\u201d request, similar to that of , however transmitted to tablet computer rather than server . Hence, once server acknowledges receipt of the session address received at , server is no longer involved in the file transfer.","At , a positive response to the prompt is received, similar to described above, and at  print service transmits an \u201callow file\u201d message to file transfer , similar to .
