The clock buffering block  is inactivated in response to a buffer control signal BUF_EN that is enabled when the delay locked loop circuit enters a power down mode and, at this time, the input clock REF_CLK is disabled. The clock being disabled means that the clock is not toggled.","The phase comparing block  compares the input clock REF_CLK with a feedback clock FB_CLK outputted from the replica modeling block  and outputs a phase comparison signal CMP including information for a phase difference of the input clock REF_CLK and the feedback clock FB_CLK to the delaying block , wherein the feedback clock FB_CLK is obtained by modeling components of delaying a clock inside a semiconductor memory device.","The delaying block  determines a delay amount in response to the phase comparison signal CMP and outputs an internal clock CLK_OUT by delaying the input clock REF_CLK by the delay amount.","The internal clock CLK_OUT is coupled to the replica modeling block . If the phase of the input clock REF_CLK is consistent with that of the feedback clock FB_CLK through the above process, i.e., the delay locking, locking is achieved.","The pulse generating block  generates a plurality of pulse signals P_ to P_N enabled by being synchronized with the input clock REF_CLK to control operations of the phase comparing block  and the delaying block . Namely, the phase comparing block  and the delaying block  are enabled in response to a part or all of the pulse signals P_ to P_N. To perform the delay locking operation, a sequence of operations such as the operation of comparing the phases and the operation of delaying the input clock REF_CLK should be sequentially performed in combination with a clock. The pulse generating block  controls the delay locking operation to be sequentially performed.","For instance, the pulse generating block  generates a first pulse signal to a twelfth pulse signal, P_ to P_, and the phase comparing block  is activated in response to the second pulse signal P_ to output the phase comparison signal CMP. The delaying block  is activated in response to the sixth pulse signal P_ that is enabled after the second pulse signal P_ is enabled, thereby delaying the input clock REF_CLK. The number or kind of the pulse signals used in the phase comparing block  and the delaying block  may be changed according to the constitution of the phase comparing block  and the delaying block . For example, in case the delaying block  performs a coarse delay operation and a fine delay operation, the coarse delay operation may be performed in response to the sixth pulse signal P_ and the fine delay operation may be performed in response to the ninth pulse signal P_.

Each of the first and the second delay locking blocks  and  includes a phase comparing sector, a delaying sector and a replica modeling sector like the construction of the delay locked loop circuit in  and is controlled by a plurality of pulse signals P_ to P_N generated by the pulse generating block . Since the second delay locking block  inverts an input clock REF_CLK and outputs an inverted input clock in connection with a duty rate correcting operation performed in the duty rate correcting block , a phase of a rising edge of a first internal clock CLK_OUT is consistent with that of a second internal clock CLK_OUT and a duty rate of the first internal clock CLK_OUT is opposite to that of the second internal clock CLK_OUT.","The duty rate correcting block  corrects duty rates of the first and second internal clocks CLK_OUT and CLK_OUT by combining the phases of the first and second internal clocks CLK_OUT and CLK_OUT, thereby outputting a first and a second corrected clock CLK_CC and CLK_CC.

The pulse signals inputted to the pulse control sector  can be changed and the period of the first to the twelfth pulse signals can be adjusted according to the pulse signals inputted to the pulse control sector .
