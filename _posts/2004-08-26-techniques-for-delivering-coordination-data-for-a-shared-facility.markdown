title: Techniques for delivering coordination data for a shared facility
abstract: Techniques for delivering data for coordinating multiple party use of a facility include producing conditions data by measuring without human intervention current condition of a facility that is used by multiple human parties. Availability data that indicates present or future availability for the facility is generated based at least in part on the conditions data. Coordination data based at least in part on the availability data is presented for the parties. These techniques allow rapid dynamic adaptation to changing status of a high-value facility while being less reliant on varied and subjective human motivations for reporting status changes. Undue exposure of sensitive information can be avoided by deriving less detailed views from high-resolution images of the facility and its users. Coordination data can be projected directly onto, and manual input can be derived from, a magnetic white board currently used for coordination at many facilities.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to systems for coordinating the use of a high valued facility among many persons, and in particular to measuring conditions and deriving availability parameters without human intervention for integrated display, such as on a magnetic whiteboard with manually entered information.","2. Description of the Related Art","Hospital operating rooms (ORs) are valuable facilities. It has been estimated that in typical hospitals, the operating rooms account for about 40% to about 50% of revenue from patients. The operating rooms also account for a large share of the hospital resources and expenses. It is in the interest of the hospital administrators to make maximum use of the operating rooms in their hospital, such as by minimizing the time from the exit of one patient to the entry of the next patient. However, the use of each operating room in the hospital requires the coordinated efforts of a large number of persons or teams of persons, including for example, surgeons, anesthesiologists, surgical assistants, charge nurses, cleaning staff, equipment maintenance staff, and runners who bring patients and supplies into and out of the operating room. Each person or team must often complete the person's or team's own task before another person or team can use the facility.","For example, after a procedure on a patient is completed, the following sample actions may take place in sequence: the patient is prepared for removal by anesthesiologists and nurses, for example by disconnecting the patient from anesthesia delivery equipment and covering the patient; the patient is removed from the operating room by an anesthesia care provider; and the operating room and its operating table are cleaned by cleaning staff. Before the next procedure can begin, the following sample actions may take place in sequence: the cleaned operating room and table are prepared for the next patient by OR nurses and technicians; equipment and tools to be used in the next procedure are brought in, serviced or repaired by equipment maintenance staff; supplies are replenished by support staff; the next patient is brought in and transferred to the operating room table by nurses and anesthesia care providers; and the next patient is prepared for the procedure, for example, by receiving anesthesia from an anesthesiologist and by being connected to a fixed or mobile heart and blood oxygen level monitoring equipment by a OR nurse. Only then may the surgeon begin the next procedure. Charge nurses for surgical operating rooms connect multiple people, resources, and patients to ensure efficient and safe operation of the operating room. The various persons, alone or in teams, are often standing by\u2014ready to act when the room or patient is in a state to be acted upon.","The sequencing of actions by these personnel would be relatively easy to plan and execute if all procedures in an operating room were predictable with certainty. However, procedures performed in operating rooms can deviate in both number and temporal duration substantially from average or planned use. In contrast to most operating rooms, day-of-surgery case scheduling in a trauma center is especially dynamic. Much of the decisions on surgical case scheduling in trauma centers are made on the day of surgery, whereas in most other operating rooms the scheduling is usually determined days in advance. In either case, persons who act in the operating room are unable to determine exactly when their services are required. As a consequence, resources are wasted as person wait idly by for an operating room that is not ready for their activity, or are occupied in another operating room or area when their action is required next in a different operating room. For example, if a procedure finishes half an hour early, a doctor en route for the next operation expected to start at 10 AM may be unavailable when the room is ready. Thus valuable minutes of operating room availability are lost.","A charge nurse takes requests for surgery and translates them into a schedule of specific times or sequences, or both, in each of the individual operating rooms (e.g., six operating rooms in an illustrated example). If a case is not scheduled as the first case, its starting time cannot be accurately scheduled. The order of the case is then scheduled \u201cto follow\u201d the first case for the respective operating room. Charge nurses are attired in \u201cscrubs\u201d (sterile gloves and gown) typically to go inside the operating rooms. They do not have clinical duties ordinarily, although they often have extensive clinical experience working in the operating rooms. The charge nurses are mobile during their shift and do walk around; but the charge nurses primarily remain in the vicinity of a control desk typically located in or near a corridor through which surgical patients are brought in.","Examples of changes affecting the planned surgery schedule include cancelled surgeries; unexpected additional surgeries (which result from both newly admitted patients as well as deterioration of previously admitted patients necessitating re-visits to an operating room); multi-patient trauma situations in which demand exceeds resource supply, at least temporarily; and any external variables impacting operating room operational status (unavailable or malfunctioning equipment, lack of supplies, and changes in staffing patterns, such as caused by illness, attrition, and hiring delays).","Based on reports of patient exit from an operating room and next patient entry into the operating room, operating room use efficiency can be measured and compared. One measure of operating room (OR) efficiency is the percentage of operations that start on time\u2014so called \u201con-time OR starts.\u201d The industry average for on-time OR starts is 27%. The best performing operating rooms have on-time OR starts of 76%. Clearly, there is room for improvement at all hospitals.","In one approach, employed for a suite of operating rooms that exhibit good performance, the charge nurses use a large whiteboard (365\u00d7122 cm) in front of the control desk. The whiteboard is used in part to show surgical schedules. Different portions of the whiteboard are devoted to different operating rooms. A magnetic strip with case information is prepared for every case scheduled for the suite of operating rooms. The magnetic strips are arranged or updated to indicate the current status of the case, including the operating room where the case is to be handled and the sequence of the cases in that operating room and the state of readiness of the patient associated with the case. Other details can be written into the spaces on the whiteboard or the magnetic strips with markers, or typed or written on papers taped to the whiteboard. Magnetic strips or tokens are also prepared for various staff and positioned on the whiteboard according to their availability and assignment.","While providing a useful place for recording and exchanging information about the use of the operating rooms, the whiteboard has some shortcomings. Updating the whiteboard requires human interaction. Thus the whiteboard is subject to failures when information is not provided by the human users. For example, a human might not report new information due to forgetfulness; distraction by personal, emotional or urgent events; physical separation from the whiteboard; or motivation to delay reporting information (for example, to prevent the early termination of a rest break or meal break or to delay reporting an unusual absence by a favored coworker).","In another approach, video cameras and microphones were installed in surgical operating rooms to relay audio and video to remotely situated neurophysiologists. Prior to this approach, those neurophysiologists could access patient monitoring data remotely. With the addition of audio and video, the neurophysiologists could monitor the patient better by the supplemental audio and video information about the progress of a surgery and estimate when a procedure might likely be completed. Additionally, neurophysiologists could schedule their tasks better by utilizing low-workload periods better.","While improving the availability of information about the current use of a facility, the approach of transmitting video and audio was found to raise serious privacy issues, such as casual conversations in operating rooms being overheard by those remotely situated. In particular, participants were inhibited by the possibility of their work activities being broadcast to unseen and unknown observers.","Furthermore, while experienced neurophysiologists could determine a stage of a procedure by observing the video and audio data, other personnel using the facility were not appraised of the progress of the procedure or warned when a procedure was completed or a patient was being prepared for removal or given estimates of when their next action would likely be required. Thus other personnel still had to guess when they should report for their next action, wasting resources when they guessed incorrectly.","Clearly there is a need for a system to share status and availability information about operating rooms that does not suffer the disadvantages of previous approaches, such as subjective updating, loss of privacy and discretion, and lack of predictions for the time of subsequent actions for all concerned staff, among other deficiencies.","In general, there is a need for a system to share status and availability information about other high value facilities that are used by multiple persons in a coordinated interaction that does not suffer the disadvantages of previous approaches.","Techniques are provided for delivering data for coordinating multiple party use of a facility. These techniques remove one or more deficiencies of previous approaches, and can improve the efficient use of high valued facilities such as hospital operating rooms and emergency response resources.","In one set of embodiments, a method for delivering data for coordinating multiple party use of a facility includes producing conditions data by measuring without human intervention a current condition of a facility for which use is coordinated among multiple human parties. Availability data that indicates availability for the facility is generated based at least in part on the conditions data. Coordination data based at least in part on the availability data is presented for all the parties. These embodiments improve information flow by reducing reliance on subjective human input and providing information to all parties whose uses of the facility are to be coordinated.","In some embodiments of this set, the facility includes one or more trauma center operating rooms, surgical operating rooms, emergency room suites and cardiac catheterization laboratories, and the parties include medical doctors, nurses, medical technicians and orderlies.","In some embodiments of this set, the method further includes determining a party who has access to the coordination data at a particular time and a particular level of privilege associated with that party. The step of generating the availability data includes generating sensitive data and multiple views of the sensitive data with different levels of detail. A particular view is omitted from the coordination data based on the particular level of privilege of the party with access. These embodiments help protect privacy when utilizing highly revealing measurements of facility conditions.","In some embodiments of this set, the conditions data collected includes images of the facility. In some of these embodiments, generating availability data includes deriving from the image data a cartoon view with a solid filled shape to represent an object in the image data. The cartoon view is presented with the coordination data instead of the more detailed images of the facility.","In some embodiments of this set, generating availability data includes deriving from the conditions data a status value among multiple status values for one or more status parameters, such as table status parameter, patient status parameter, operating room activity status parameter, and an incision status parameter.z","In some embodiments of this set, schedule data that indicates a planned use for the facility is also received and the coordination data includes a display element that indicates a deviation from the planned use.","In another set of embodiments, a method for reducing image detail to protect sensitive information includes capturing an original image and low pass filtering it. A range of colors in the low passed image associated with a feature in the original image is mapped to a single color. A low detail \u201ccartoon\u201d image is generated with the single color at each location where a color of the low passed image falls within the range of colors.","In another set of embodiments, a method for presenting data representing actual use of a facility includes presenting a first bar that indicates time for planned use of a facility. A second bar is presented for elapsed time of actual use of the facility, which extends at least in part outside the first bar.","In another set of embodiments, a method for inputting data to a computer connected to a video input includes capturing a video image of a two dimensional surface including a manually positioned tangible token. Either a location or an orientation of the tangible token, or both, indicates one state among more than two possible states. A particular state of the possible states is determined based on the video image.","In other sets of embodiments, computer-readable media and systems perform the methods described above.","A method and apparatus are described for delivering data for coordinating multiple party use of a facility. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","In particular, embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of a whiteboard display in a control area of a suite of hospital operating rooms (including trauma center operating rooms or surgical operating rooms or both); however the invention is not limited to this context. Other embodiments of the invention are employed in other medical facilities, such as patient scanning and imaging laboratories, cardiac catheterization laboratories, emergency rooms, and veterinary facilities. Other embodiments of the invention are employed for facilities beyond the scope of a single hospital, such as emergency response facilities distributed among several hospitals, government buildings and mobile units (such as ambulances, fire trucks, rescue boats) utilized by emergency response personnel such as policemen, firemen, Coast Guard personnel, National Guard personnel and regular military personnel. Other embodiments of the invention are employed for non medical facilities used by multiple parties, such as aircraft utilized by various personnel such as aircraft preparation personnel including mechanics, baggage handlers, caterers, cleaning crew and a flight crew, and security staff, among others.","The generation and use of coordination data is illustrated for an approach using a centrally located whiteboard.  is a block diagram that illustrates a facility coordination system  based on human input to a magnetic whiteboard . The whiteboard  is magnetic in the sense that magnetic objects will adhere to the whiteboard. Embodiments of the invention are not limited to a centralized magnetic whiteboard for display of coordination data or user input or both, but may use any centralized or distributed input\/output (I\/O) system to display coordination data or to receive user input or both.","Whiteboard  is divided into different areas corresponding to different operating rooms within the purview of the control desk. In the illustrated example, whiteboard  is divided into areas , , corresponding to operating rooms OR , OR , OR , respectively. Each of these operating room areas , , is further divided into an \u201cin progress\u201d area , , (collectively referenced herein as in progress areas ) and an \u201cin queue\u201d area , , (collectively referenced herein as in queue areas ), respectively. The in progress areas , , are reserved for information related to cases that are in progress in the corresponding operating room OR , OR , OR , respectively. The in queue areas , , are reserved for information related to cases that are in line to be handled in the corresponding operating room OR , OR , OR , respectively. Whiteboard  is further divide into a staff area  where information related to operating room personnel is maintained. The staff area is further divided into an absent area  and a non-absent area. The absent area is reserved for information about staff members who are not available to perform actions in the operations rooms OR , OR , OR . In other hospitals a whiteboard may be divided into more or different areas.","Magnetic objects are attached to the whiteboard . For example, magnetic personnel objects  are attached for each person on the staff for the operating rooms. In some embodiments, the name of a staff member is printed or hand written on a magnetic personnel object . Magnetic case strips , , , , , , , collectively referenced herein as magnetic case strips , are attached for cases to be processed through one of the operating rooms OR , OR  and OR . Case information, such as case number, responsible doctor, type of operation, and description of the patient or procedure, is printed or hand written onto the magnetic case strips .","Staff members who are currently not available for actions in the operation rooms OR , OR , OR  are represented by magnetic personnel objects  in the absent area  of staff area . Staff members who are available for actions in the operation rooms OR , OR , OR  are represented by magnetic personnel objects  in the staff area  outside of the absent area . Staff members currently assigned to an operating room are represented by magnetic personnel objects in an OR area, such as magnetic personnel objects  in in progress areas , in . Staff members currently assigned to a particular case are represented by magnetic personnel objects on a case strip, such as magnetic personnel object  on case strip in . Other information related to staffing may be written manually with whiteboard markers or printed and taped to the corresponding staff areas ,  of the whiteboard .","Cases currently in progress in an operating room are represented by magnetic case strips  in the in progress area  of operating room area . In the illustrated embodiment, magnetic case strips in area holds information related to the case currently in progress in OR ; and magnetic case strips in area holds information related to the case currently in progress in OR . Cases scheduled for an operating room are represented by magnetic case strips  in the in queue area  of operating room area . In the illustrated embodiment, magnetic case strips , in area hold information related to the next two cases scheduled for OR ; magnetic case strip in area holds information related to the next case scheduled for OR ; and magnetic case strip in area holds information related to the next case scheduled for OR . Other information related to each OR or the cases scheduled for each OR may be written manually with whiteboard markers or printed and taped to the corresponding areas of the whiteboard .","The whiteboard and magnetic objects are easily manipulated by humans and can be adapted to provide other or subtle nuances in information. For example, magnetic case strip is positioned to substantially overlap both the in progress area and the in queue area for OR  to indicate that the patient for this case is currently being prepared for the OR procedure. Perhaps the patient is in the room and waiting to be connected to the vital signs monitors or anesthesia equipment, so the case is not yet in progress, but is more advanced than a case for which the patient is still in a holding room. Whether the left side or the right side of the magnetic case strip is in the in progress area may be used to further distinguish the degree of readiness to proceed with the case. A magnetic personnel object  placed on case strip may indicate a runner responsible for moving the patient for the case from a staging or holding room into the operating room, or a nurse responsible for connecting the patient to the vital signs monitor.","As described in the previous section, a system like the one depicted in  has many useful features. However, it suffers from a reliance on human input that is subjective and subject to oversight, error, or hidden motivations.","1. Functional Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","210","230","210"]},"In step , planned use of the facility is obtained. This information is obtained so that actual use deduced from steps described below can be compared to the planned use; and alerts may be sent if the actual use deviates too far from the planned use. For example, in some embodiments of step , schedule data is received from a scheduling database for a facility. Many facilities use computer applications called scheduling systems to manage schedules of persons or facilities or both. Such computer applications often use a central or distributed database with information about planned use of a facility. In an illustrated embodiment, charge nurses use a facility scheduling system to enter, hours or days ahead, information about planned used of the facility, such as, for each operating room in their facility, a date, a start time, or a sequence of cases to be performed, or some combination. In some embodiments, the expected duration time for the case based on statistics of prior cases of the same type may be entered. In some embodiments, a database is not used and step  includes deriving operating room, date, start time, and sequence of cases using optical character recognition (OCR) computer applications operating on data written onto a whiteboard or magnetic strips attached to the whiteboard. In some embodiments, step  is omitted and no planned use is input to the system.","In step , conditions data is produced based on measurements of the facility. At least some of these measurements are automatic and do not depend on human input. Human input, when available may also be used in step . For example, data from equipment in the operating rooms is collected. In some embodiments, sound and still or video data, or some combination, is also collected during step . For example, one or more video cameras are installed in each operating room and holding room and image data is collected. These embodiments improve information flow by reducing reliance on subjective human input.","In step , the data collected in step  is used to determine availability of the facility and produce availability data to describe that availability. Availability of the facility includes deductions of current status or predictions of status at particular times in the near future, or both. For example, in some embodiments, availability data is produced that indicates an operating room table is empty since a time two minutes earlier based on image processing of a sequence of video images of the operating room. In some embodiments that include predictions, availability data is produced that indicates an operating room table is empty since a time two minutes earlier and will become ready for the next patient at a time three minutes in the future. Such predictions may be performed using any known method; for example, using statistics of the average delay between a table becoming empty and first becoming ready for the next patient, for a particular operating room, suite of operating rooms, or industry averages. In some embodiments, the present or predicted status is accompanied by a measure of precision of the status, such as a probability of accuracy for table conditions derived from images or the standard deviation of delays about the average delay between empty status and ready status.","For example, in some embodiments, the availability data generated in step  includes producing an operating table (also called an operating room bed) status. In this embodiment, the values for the operating room table status are \u201cempty,\u201d \u201cready,\u201d \u201cpatient on the table,\u201d \u201cdrapes-off,\u201d \u201cdrapes-on,\u201d and \u201cdrapes off, after-on.\u201d The \u201cempty\u201d status value indicates an operating room table is not occupied and is not prepared for a new occupant. The \u201cready\u201d status value indicates the operating room table is not occupied and is prepared for new occupant. The \u201cpatient on the table\u201d status value indicates the patient is on the OR table. The \u201cdrapes-off\u201d status value indicates the operating room table is occupied and the occupant is not covered with a surgical drape. The \u201cdrapes-on\u201d status value indicates the operating room table is occupied and the occupant is covered with a surgical drape. Surgery is performed only after a surgical drape is positioned over the patient. The \u201cdrapes off, after-on\u201d status value indicates surgery close to the end and patient is getting ready to be moved out of the OR.","The status value is determined in step  by image processing of camera images that depict the operating room table. Based on color and texture data derived for locations associated with the known position of the table, and subtracting out the effects of people moving in the operating room between the camera and the table, the status can be usefully detected. For example, in some embodiments the live video images of red, green, blue values for each pixel (RGB code) or hue, level of saturation and brightness values (HSV code) are used with inter-image variance compensated for lighting changes to identify the \u201cempty status.\u201d Edge detection routines (such as available in MATLAB of MathWorks, Natick, Mass.) are used to determine the size and orientation of the table, and texture characteristics deduced from RGB or HSV histogram value ranges in the table location are compared with the previous texture characteristics obtained from bed ready conditions to identify the \u201cready\u201d or \u201cnot ready\u201d status values. \u201cDrapes-on\u201d or \u201cdrapes-Off\u201d status is determined in some embodiments by identifying the bed area first, then comparing the standard drape texture and color with the values in the bed area. For example, in a sequence of test derivations, the image processing procedure correctly identified the \u201cempty\u201d status 76% of the time, the \u201cready\u201d status 80% of the time, the \u201cdrapes-on\u201d status 67% of the time and the \u201cdrapes-off\u201d status 57% of the time.","In embodiments that include step , availability of the facility includes information about how far the actual status deviates from planned use. For example, availability data is produced that indicates the operating room table is ready for the next patient as of a certain time that is eight minutes later than the planned time for that operating room table to be ready.","In some embodiments, the data collected in step  is considered sensitive and not for general consumption among all parties that coordinate use of the facility. For example, full resolution video images of the operating room during a procedure or preparation for a procedure are considered sensitive. In such embodiments, step  includes producing one or more less detailed views of the sensitive data, such as a lower resolution image one fourth (\u00bc) the height and width of the full resolution picture and having one sixteenth ( 1\/16) the number of pixels and no audio, or cartoon images described in a later section.","In step , the privileges of persons who have current access to data displays are determined. For example, in various embodiments, a user types in a personal identification number (PIN) at a keypad; a user swipes an identification (ID) card through a card reader or shows the ID card to a camera; or a user gives a sample to a detector for a system that identifies a human based on a unique physical characteristic such as a fingerprint, handprint, or retinal image. In some embodiments all parties who have access to displayed data may view any data collected and displayed; in such embodiments, step  may be omitted.","In step  coordination data based on the availability data is made available to all parties. For example, not just surgeons, but anesthesiologists, nurses, orderlies, runners, technicians and others whose use of the facility is coordinated may view the coordination data. These embodiments improve information flow by providing information to all parties whose use of the facility are to be coordinated. In some embodiments, the coordination data includes only views of sensitive data that depend on the persons having access to the coordination data at a particular time. For example, if a person with high levels of privilege has been identified as having current access in step , then a high detailed view of the sensitive data is displayed for a short period of time. In some embodiments, it is assumed as a default condition that all persons have access to the display and only the low detailed views for the lowest levels of privilege are displayed. If a person with a higher level of privilege is detected, then a view with greater detail is displayed. In some embodiments, the greater detail is displayed automatically when the person with higher privilege indicates his or her presence. In some embodiments, the person with higher privilege must also indicate a desire for the greater detail view, such as by keying input or moving a token on the whiteboard.","In some embodiments the system includes a communication link to a remote site. In such embodiments, step  includes forming a remote display image based at least in part on an image of the coordination board (such as an image of the white board  and the magnetic elements on it) and the coordination data. Step  also includes sending the remote display image over the communications link to a remote display device at the remote site for displaying the remote display image.","2.

Any cameras may be used. In some embodiments analog video cameras are used. An American convention for analog video signals, designated NTSC, provide three analog signals representing hue, saturation and brightness values (HSV code) for scanning across a display area of a cathode ray tube. In other geographical regions, a different convention for analog video signals may be used. In some embodiments digital cameras are used, which typically provide three bytes (24 bits) of data representing red, green and blue values (RGB code) for each picture element (pixel) of an image comprising a number N rows and a number M columns. Digital imagery is often stored in as a bitmap of red, green, blue bytes in BMP format. In some embodiments compressed RGB data is produced, using a compression scheme. Any compression scheme may be used; some well known compression schemes include digital formats designated by the names: graphics interchange format (GIF); tagged image file format (TIFF), and joint photographic experts group (JPEG) for individual images and motion picture experts group (MPEG) for video (which is sequences of related images).","In an illustrated embodiment, the cameras  include four cameras: one camera in each of three operating rooms and one camera directed to produce images of a whiteboard near the control desk.

In some embodiments, a camera is pointed at each bed location in a holding or staging area, where patients are taken before they are brought into one of the operating rooms.","The video image hub is connected to each camera to receive the video signals as input and allows electronic control of which video signals are output on one or more communication channels. Any known video hub may be used. The video switch\/router provides control signals to the video image hub to determine which input signal is to be output for how long and which destination on the network is to receive the video output. Any known network switch or router may be used as video switch\/router . The video switch\/router is controlled by the image capture server  on host , as described in more detail below.","The vital signs monitors  include monitors of heart activity (electrocardiogram, EKG), blood oxygen saturation (SaO), non-invasive blood pressure (NBP), and body temperature (TEMP) in each operating room. Any equipment may be used to measure these vital signs. In an illustrated embodiment, the EKG data, including heart rate (HRATE) data, SaOdata, NBP data and TEMP data are produced by DASH-Patient Vital Signs Monitor (model Marquette\/Solar) of General Electric Corporation's GE Healthcare company of Chalfont St. Giles, United Kingdom.

The selected video output is transmitted to the image capture server . In some embodiments, the image capture server performs pre-processing or image processing on the transmitted video data. Pre-processing includes converting from one coding type to a different coding type, color separation, clipping, filtering, digitizing, decompression or other processing steps. The image capture server  communicates with the availability and coordination data server  on host to determine what images to capture and what processing to perform and to send the processed results to the availability and coordination data server .","In the illustrated embodiment, the vital signs capture server  checks (\u201csniffs\u201d) the data packets transmitted on network  to detect data packets carrying vital signs data, copies the data and stores the data in a temporary buffer for subsequent analysis, as described in more detail below.

In an illustrated embodiment, the projector  can cover a large portion of whiteboard  with a large number of rows and columns of pixels. A subset of these rows and columns of pixels are dedicated to each presentation item (i-widget). For example, the projector covers most of the whiteboard  with 2400 rows and 3200 columns, and reserves one subset of 300 rows and 400 columns for image data , one subset of 100 rows and 400 columns for progress data , and another subset of 100 rows and 400 columns for forecast data ","Each image data for an operating room, e.g., image data for OR , includes coordination data based on conditions data collected from a camera for OR , including a camera directed onto a staging area or holding area for OR . The detail apparent in image data depends upon the privilege level of a person viewing the interface . For example, the image data depicts a low resolution or cartoon image derived from one camera in OR . If a doctor presents identification to the system, such as by swiping an ID card in card reader , a higher resolution image is shown in image data . In one embodiment, a non-cartoon image is presented in image data . In another embodiment, the size of image data is increased, for example to 600 rows and 800 columns of pixels, so that four times the detail is presented in image data .

In an illustrated embodiment, facility coordination system  presents information in progress data that indicates the current state of the use of the OR. For example, progress data indicates that OR  is empty, or is ready for the next patient, or is occupied, or that a procedure is underway that started forty minutes earlier. In some embodiments, progress data also includes a statement of accuracy for the data. For example, progress data includes data that indicates a probability that the status is incorrectly deduced from the image data, e.g., the progress data indicates that the table status is \u201cempty\u201d and that there is a probability of 10% that the status value is not correct. Any method may be used to present this information.","The forecast data for each operating room, e.g., forecast data for OR , includes forecast data included in availability data determined by the facility coordination system. In an illustrated embodiment, facility coordination system  presents information in forecast data that indicates a future time for a subsequent stage of use of the OR. For example, progress data indicates that OR  is occupied but forecast data indicates that OR will be ready for the next patient at a particular time 1 hour and 35 minutes in the future. For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that this forecast is based on the start time for the current procedure and a typical duration for such procedures, and typical delays to remove the patient and ready the table for the next patient. Any method may be used to determine and present this information. In some embodiments, forecast data also includes a statement of accuracy for the forecast. For example, forecast data includes a time error associated with two standard deviations about the forecast time based on a Gaussian or Poisson error distribution around the predicted time.

In some embodiment, the tokens  have unique markings and a token with markings designating image data for OR , or image data for a staging room for OR  is moved to in queue area . In some embodiments, the tokens are not distinguished from each other. In some such embodiments, a token  is first moved to image data to associate the token with the image, and then the token is moved to in queue area to drag the image data with the newly associated token.

Tokens not currently used to provide input or position presentation items are parked in a particular area of the whiteboard, for example the upper right of whiteboard , as shown in .","In some embodiments, switch tokens that indicate more than two states are used to provide input on the interface  to a facility coordination system. For example, token  is a switch token that indicates any one of several states based on a direction of a line bisecting one angle of the triangular shaped token. The bisected angle indicates a direction, e.g., upper left as depicted in . By pointing the bisected angle in different directions, different states can be indicated. This switch token may be used in any way on the interface . For example, in some embodiments, the switch  token is used with each of image data , , , to switch between a first camera in an operating room, to a second camera, to a third camera in a staging area for the operating room, to a recovery room for a patient currently in the operating room by pointing the bisected angle left, right, up and down, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["600","650","600","610","620","622","612","613","610","622","600","12","613"]},"Switch token , depicted in , includes a triangular anchor piece  and a circular relative position piece  independently moveable from the anchor piece. The two dimensional distances from the relative position piece  to the short base of the triangular anchor piece  (distances perpendicular and parallel to the axis of symmetry of the anchor piece) are used by image processing techniques to determine which state of multiple states the switch is in.

Method  is an embodiment of method  in which step  includes step , step  includes step , step  includes step , and step  includes step .","In step , raw image data for an operating room is captured. Any method may be used to capture the raw image data. An example of a raw image of an operating room is depicted in .  is a black and white version of a color image that illustrates a sensitive, detailed view  of an operating room, according to an embodiment. As can be seen in , the operating room includes supplies along the visible walls, an operating table in the middle of the room, and equipment. Also visible in this view are persons acting within the operating room during a process to clean the room. These persons are dressed in operating room garb called \u201cscrubs.\u201d Three persons are dressed in green scrubs , , . Three persons are dressed in pink scrubs , , . All persons are wearing hairnets, including a blue hairnet  worn by person wearing pink scrubs . The operating table is partly covered in white cloths , . The detail visible in view  exceeds what is needed to determine that the room is being cleaned, and is considered an invasion of the privacy due the personnel involved.","In step  a cartoon image view  is derived based on the raw detailed view .  is a black and white version of a color image that illustrates a less sensitive, cartoon view  of the operating room, according to an embodiment. In the cartoon view  certain objects visible in the detailed view  and considered sensitive for reasons of privacy are represented by solid colored shapes. The three persons dressed in green scrubs , , are represented as solid green shapes , , , respectively. The three persons dressed in pink scrubs , , are represented as solid pink shapes , , , respectively. The blue hair net  is represented as solid violet shape . The white cloths , are apparent as solid white shapes , , respectively. No other shapes are included in this cartoon image. Lighting and shading and nuances of color changes that indicate details of a person's weight and conditioning and other distinctive features are eliminated in the cartoon image. Faces are excluded. The invasion of privacy is significantly reduced. Step  includes steps , , , .","In step , the raw image is low passed filtered to eliminate fine grained details on the order of about ten pixels and less.","In step , the RGB coded pixels are converted to HSV coded pixels. HSV code is convenient for the purpose of cartooning because a single color with varying shades of brightness has a relatively constant hue value and saturation value, e.g., all of the green scrubs have nearly the same hue and saturation values, with the shading of folds indicated by relatively large swings in brightness values. In some embodiments step  is omitted. For example, in some embodiments, cartooning is done on RGB coded pixels. In some embodiments, the raw image data is received in HSV coded analog or digital (pixel) signals. In some embodiments, step  includes digitizing analog HSV values to HSV coded pixels. In some embodiments, step  includes digitizing analog HSV values to RGB coded pixels.","In step , ranges of coded values that represent sensitive objects are mapped to a single color for the solid filled shapes. For example, in some embodiments, ranges of hue values and saturation values associated with pink scrubs are mapped to a single pink color defined by a particular red value a particular green value and a particular blue value (a particular RGB set of values). Similarly, ranges of hue and saturation values associated with various other sensitive objects (such as green scrubs, blue hair nets and white table cloths) are mapped to corresponding single colors (such as green, violet and white).","In some embodiments using RGB codes, ranges of red, green and blue values in pixels associated with pink scrubs are mapped to a single pink color defined by a particular red value a particular green value and a particular blue value. Similarly, ranges of red, green and blue values in pixels associated with various other sensitive objects (such as green scrubs, blue hair nets and white table cloths) are mapped to corresponding single colors (such as green, violet and white). In some embodiments this mapping is retrieved from computer storage based on ranges and solid colors predetermined by analysts examining sample images. In some embodiments this mapping is retrieved from computer storage based on ranges and solid colors predetermined by image processing of sample images. In some embodiments this mapping is performed dynamically and adaptively by image processing of recent past images.","In step , a cartoon view image is generated by combining the solid color objects onto a base image. In the illustrated embodiment depicted in , the base image is a blank (black) image. In some embodiments, the base image is the original high detailed image, so that the sensitive objects are replaced by cartoons while other less sensitive objects are left substantially unchanged to provide more context for the cartoon view.","In the illustrated embodiment, the single cartoon image depicted in black and white in  is difficult to interpret without  for reference. In practice, a sequence of cartoon views derived from a sequence of images in a video clip provide a moving carton that is more easily interpreted to represent humans moving about an operating table in an operating room.","In step , it is determined that the persons with access to the interface  have low privileges to view the operating room details. For example, it has been more than five minutes since a doctor or nurse with a high privilege has swiped an ID card in card reader .","In step  the cartoon view image is presented to the parties coordinating the use of the operating rooms.

In an illustrated embodiment, a hospital where the operating rooms are located uses General Electric (GE) vital signs monitors that report their output over a hospital real-time GE vital signs internal network (intranet). The vital signs information in data packets transmitted over this intranet are gathered and translated into records of vital signs for each operating room. Sniffing network traffic is an advantage because step  does not interfere with or require any changes to the operation or communications with the equipment, e.g., does not modify communications of the GE vital signs monitors and GE data reporting network. In the illustrated embodiment, none of the patient identification information is used or displayed, except for a patient or case number.","In step , availability data indicating patient status \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d is generated along with future availability for at least one operating room. In some embodiments, a vital-signs status of \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d corresponding to a patient status \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout,\u201d respectively, is used. In some embodiments, the future availability is omitted. For example a patient status parameter is filled with a value indicating \u201cin\u201d or a value indicating \u201cout,\u201d e.g., variable patientStatus=1 for \u201cin\u201d and patientStatus=0 for \u201cout.\u201d Step  includes steps , , , , , , , .","In step , real time vital signs data collected from the network is fed into an array that represents a moving temporal window. Any method may be used to fill the array with the vital signs data.","In step , text strings in the vital signs data are used to determine values of a set of vital signs parameters, called a record of vital signs, including values for the parameters representing heart rate (HRATE) derived by the monitor from data along five leads from the electrocardiograph, blood oxygen saturation (O2SAT), non-invasive blood pressure (NBP) and body temperature (TEMP). Multiple records of values for these parameters are included in the moving temporal window. For example, for purposes of illustration it is assumed that the moving temporal window is five minutes long and a record is obtained every 10 seconds, so there are 30 records included in the moving window array.","In step , a tentative patient status is determined based on the data in the moving window array.  is a flow diagram that illustrates a method detail for step  of the facility coordination method of , according to an embodiment. Control passes to step  from step .","In step , it is determined whether the electrocardiogram data for the current record is in a valid range. For example, it is determined that the heart rate HRATE value is greater than a minimum heart rate of a living person and less than maximum heart rate of a living person.","If it is determined that the electrocardiogram data is in a valid range, then it is determined that the current record indicates that a patient is \u201cin\u201d and control passes to step . If it is determined that the electrocardiogram data is not in a valid range, then control passes to step  to check data from the other monitors to determine whether the patient is \u201cin.\u201d This is done because the patient might not yet be hooked to the electrocardiograph, or the electrocardiograph might be malfunctioning.","In step  it is determined whether data for the oxygen saturation monitor can be trusted. If not, the determination of patient status will be based on one of the other monitors. For example, in the GE vital signs data reporting system, when the oxygen saturation sensor is producing suspicious or sporadic readings, the TEMP value is reported before the O2SAT value. Some suspicious readings may be in a valid range for blood oxygen saturation levels in a living patient. In some embodiments, therefore, the oxygen saturation sensor is not considered trustable if the TEMP value precedes the O2SAT value in the data record. The O2SAT value is also not trusted if the status based on the O2SAT values disagrees with the previous status. This decision is made because the status should change once and remain in the same state for an extended period involving many records (on the order of tens of minutes). If it is determined in step  that the O2SAT value is trustable, then control passes to step  to determine whether the value is in range for a living patient.","In step , it is determined whether the O2SAT value is in range for a living patient, e.g, it is determined whether the O2SAT value is within the range from about 50% to 100% saturation. If so, then it is determined that the current record indicates that a patient is \u201cin\u201d and control passes to step . If the O2SAT value is outside this range, or if it is determined in step  that the O2SAT value is not trustable, control passes to step  to check the TEMP value.","In step , it is determined whether the temperature sensor is trustable. The TEMP value is also not trusted if the status based on the TEMP values disagrees with the previous status. If it is determined in step  that the TEMP value is trustable, then control passes to step  to determine whether the value is in range for a living patient.","In step , it is determined whether the TEMP value is in range for a living patient, e.g., it is determined whether the TEMP value is above some minimum temperature. In some embodiments, the GE vital signs monitors provide two body temperature sensors, TEMP and TEMP. In these embodiments it is determined whether either the TEMP or TEMP value is above some minimum temperature. In some embodiments, the minimum temperature for passing TEMP is different from the minimum temperature for passing TEMP. If either temperature value is above the appropriate minimum, then it is determined that the current record indicates that a patient is \u201cin\u201d and control passes to step . If the TEMP value is below the appropriate minimum, or if it is determined in step  that the TEMP value is not trustable, control passes to step  to check the NBP data.","In step  it is determined whether a non-invasive blood pressure (NBP) measurement is recent, i.e., was taken within a specified time before the present time. Operating room protocol calls for taking the patient's blood pressure periodically (e.g., on the order of every 10 minutes). Therefore, in this example, if no blood pressure has been taken in the last 10 minutes, then it is determined that a patient is not \u201cin.\u201d If a blood pressure measurement has been taken within the specified time, then it is determined that the current record indicates that patient is \u201cin\u201d and control passes to step .","In step , the patient status for the record is set to \u201cin\u201d and control passes to step .

If so, there is no change to the status and control passes to step .","In step , the server waits for the next signal from the vital signs monitor. Control passes back to step  to feed the new signal into the moving window.","If it is determined in step  that the value of the variable for the moving temporal window is not the same as the previous value stored in the parameter variable patientStatus, control passes to step  to respond to the change.","In step , it is determined whether the previous value was constant for a specified period of time, e.g., ten minutes. In this embodiment, not only is the value of the status stored in the variable patientStatus, but also a start time for the status is stored, e.g., in a variable called patientStatusEventTime. If the previous value was not constant for the specified period, e.g., if the patientStatusEventTime is more recent than the specified period of time before the present time, then control passes to step . In step , the change is considered a false alarm because patient status should remain constant for at least the specified period of time. Control then passes to step  to wait for the next signal from the vital signs monitoring equipment.","If it is determined in step  that the previous value was constant for the specified period of time, then control passes to step . In step  the value for the parameter varaible patientStatus is changed to the newly determined status and the parameter variable patientStatusEventTime is set to the present time.","In the illustrated embodiment, a predicted time for the next event is also determined during step .

For example, in an illustrated embodiment, a Bovie knife operation is detected if a spectral peak exceeding certain impedance is found centered on an appropriate frequency. The frequency of the peak, the width of the peak and the peak level above background noise are easily determined through routine experimentation. In an illustrated embodiment, the Bovie unit works in a pre specified radio frequency. By focusing on the known frequency range the effects of noise are reduced or eliminated and a distinguishable and reliable signature is produced.

For example, in an illustrated embodiment the incision status value is projected onto whiteboard  in progress data, e.g., in progress data for OR . In the illustrated embodiment, step  includes projecting the predicted time for the completion of the current procedure, for the drapes off stage, for the table empty stage, or for the table ready stage, or some combination, onto the whiteboard  in forecast data, e.g., in forecast data for OR .","3.4 Plan Deviation Display","The progress data displayed, for example the progress data for OR  projected onto whiteboard , may be presented in any form. Progress is often reported with a progress bar, in which a variable length bar represents progress between 0% and 100%. However, such a progress bar fails to indicate to users of a facility how far actual uses are deviating from planned uses. What is needed is a way to display plan deviations in the progress data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0150"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10","FIG. 10A"],"i":"c ","b":["1000","1010","1020","1012","1014","1022","1012","1024"]},"In , a deviation display  includes the planned bar  from  and an actual progress bar . The actual progress bar  begins at an actual start time  and ends at the latest actual progress time , which is the current time for a procedure still underway in the facility and is the actual stop time for procedure that has finished. Deviation from the planned use is displayed by an actual progress bar with a start time  that does not align with the planned start time  and a latest actual progress time  that does not align with the planned stop time .","Unlike usual progress bars in which progress is indicated by a bar that begins at 0% and ends at or before 100%, the deviation displays ,  include an actual progress bar ,  that extends beyond the limits of a second bar indicating the planned use.","In deviation displays , , the actual progress bars ,  are narrower than the planned progress bar . In other embodiments, the actual progress bars ,  are wider than the planned progress bar.","In , a deviation display  includes the planned bar  and an actual progress bar  that are the same width. For comparison purposes, planned bar  and the actual progress bar  have the same start and stop times as planned bar  and actual progress bar , respectively, depicted in . The actual progress bar  begins at the actual start time  and ends at the latest actual progress time , which is the current time for a procedure still underway in the facility and is the actual stop time for procedure that has finished.","Deviation is indicated by color or shading differences for different sections of the overlapping bars. Where the planned bar  does not overlap the actual progress bar  the display has one color or shading type. Where the planned bar  and the actual progress bar  overlap in section , the actual progress is within the plan and the display has a second color or shading type. Where the actual bar  does not overlap the planned progress bar  in section , the actual progress extends outside the plan and the display has a third color or shading type. In some embodiments, different colors or shading is used for actual progress that occurs before the planned start time than is used for actual progress that extends after the planned stop time. For example, in an embodiment, a green color is used to indicate an early start and a red color is used to indicate a late finish.","In any of the deviation displays , , , the length of the planned bar may be fixed and the actual progress may extend as far outside the planned bar  as needed to indicate actual progress. In some embodiments, the extent outside the planned bar is presented on logarithmic or other non-linear scale to prevent the display from becoming too big. In some embodiments, the actual progress bar is allowed to extend only to a predefined maximum length. For example, the maximum length is matched to fit within a progress data area  of a projection on a whiteboard. In such embodiments, as the actual progress continues in time, the planned bar is reduced in length proportionately to demonstrate the difference between the actual and planned use. As described above, in some embodiments the either or both bars, of portions of bars, in the display are plotted on a logarithmic or non-linear scale.","4.

The memory , such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, stores information including computer instructions. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory  is also used by the processor  to store temporary values during execution of computer instructions. The computer system  also includes a read only memory (ROM)  or other static storage device coupled to the bus  for storing static information, including instructions, that is not changed by the computer system . Also coupled to bus  is a non-volatile (persistent) storage device , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, for storing information, including instructions, that persists even when the computer system  is turned off or otherwise loses power.","Information, including instructions, is provided to the bus  for use by the processor from an external input device , such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user, or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into signals compatible with the signals used to represent information in computer system . Other external devices coupled to bus , used primarily for interacting with humans, include a display device , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD), for presenting images, and a pointing device , such as a mouse or a trackball or cursor direction keys, for controlling a position of a small cursor image presented on the display  and issuing commands associated with graphical elements presented on the display .","In the illustrated embodiment, special purpose hardware, such as an application specific integrated circuit (IC) , is coupled to bus . The special purpose hardware is configured to perform operations not performed by processor  quickly enough for special purposes. Examples of application specific ICs include graphics accelerator cards for generating images for display , cryptographic boards for encrypting and decrypting messages sent over a network, speech recognition, and interfaces to special external devices, such as robotic arms and medical scanning equipment that repeatedly perform some complex sequence of operations that are more efficiently implemented in hardware.","Computer system  also includes one or more instances of a communications interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors, such as printers, scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link  that is connected to a local network  to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example, communication interface  may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus (USB) port on a personal computer. In some embodiments, communications interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments, a communication interface  is a cable modem that converts signals on bus  into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data. Such signals are examples of carrier waves.","The term computer-readable medium is used herein to refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media include, for example, dynamic memory . Transmission media include, for example, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic cables, and waves that travel through space without wires or cables, such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves, including radio, optical and infrared waves. Signals that are transmitted over transmission media are herein called carrier waves.","Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, a magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a compact disk ROM (CD-ROM), or any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), a FLASH-EPROM, or any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Network link  typically provides information communication through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet . A computer called a server  connected to the Internet provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server  provides information representing video data for presentation at display .","The invention is related to the use of computer system  for implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in memory . Such instructions, also called software and program code, may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hardware, such as application specific integrated circuit , may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.","The signals transmitted over network link  and other networks through communications interface , which carry information to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves. Computer system  can send and receive information, including program code, through the networks ,  among others, through network link  and communications interface . In an example using the Internet , a server  transmits program code for a particular application, requested by a message sent from computer , through Internet , ISP equipment , local network  and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in storage device  or other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to an infra-red signal, a carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.
