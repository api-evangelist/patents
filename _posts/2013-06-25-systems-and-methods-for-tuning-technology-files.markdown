{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61,781,294 filed on Mar. 14, 2013, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The disclosed system and method relate to semiconductor integrated circuits (\u201cICs\u201d) and, more particularly, to electronic design automation (\u201cEDA\u201d) and simulation tools for tuning technology files, such as RC techfiles.","Integrated circuits (\u201cICs\u201d) are incorporated into many electronic devices and the design process for a new IC includes several steps by using, for example, automated electronic design automation (\u201cEDA\u201d) tools. The design process can include (1) determining an initial design of the IC; (2) generation of a layout of the design; and (3) verification of the design. During the initial design, a user (of the EDA tool) or designer can identify a set of functions to include in the design, along with their standard delays. The user can also use computer implemented tools to perform functional simulation to ensure that the design performs a pre-simulation. If the design meets circuit performance requirements in the pre-simulation, the user can then initiate floorplan and layout phases to generate an actual layout. For example, the user can generate at least one GDS file that includes the layout of the IC.","Following the layout process, the user can verify the design by using the EDA tools to perform design rule checks (\u201cDRC\u201d), layout versus schematic (\u201cLVS\u201d) checks, and RC extraction. In cooperating with RC technology file, the RC extraction tool takes into account the layout of the conductive (e.g., metal) lines of the interconnecting layers generated by the router and computes parasitic resistance and capacitance elements associated with each conductive line. Then a post-simulation verifies circuit performance. The accuracy of post-simulation requires an accurate RC technology file.","In at least some known RC technology file accuracy tuning processes, the user can conduct accuracy tuning of the 2.5 dimensional RC technology file. In at least some known RC techfile tuning methods, the user may tune-up the input profile used for RC technology file generation. For example, the user may change actual parameters, such as the vertical height, width, or dielectric constant of the newly designed IC and\/or of the components therein. However, such a method is very time consuming for application programming interface (API) RC techfile generation flow because a three dimensional characterization on every tuned-up profile can take up to approximately one day for each change. Moreover, tuning of a three dimensional profile of, for example, a Fin field effect transistor (\u201cFinFET\u201d), can be complex because of the number of parameters involved. Further, such a method can be difficult to model or take into account silicon effects.","The exemplary system and method described herein speed up the known tuning methods by providing an efficient mathematical approach to characterizing shift parameters of a lookup table of patterns that are characterized by 3D RC extraction tools. More specifically, some embodiments described herein generate at least one 2.5-dimensional RC technology file. During the generation, a plurality of layers for an IC are created and being characterized by 3D RC extraction tool. The three-dimensional patterns include a plurality of layer combinations from the layers for the IC. The layer combinations are arranged into a plurality of groups such that each of the layer combinations is assigned to at least one group. Parameter shift(s) for each of the groups are identified and a shifting analysis is performed for each of the groups based, at least in part, on the identified corresponding parameter shift. A plurality of tuning vector values are calculated for the groups based, at least in part, on the shifting analysis performed for each of the groups, wherein each tuning vector value corresponds to a separate group. Each of the groups is then shifted by the corresponding tuning vector value. Thus, based on the results of the calculations, the lookup table are updated (tuned) and the 2.5D RC technology file now have a more accurate extraction results. By using this modeling technique, an actual input profile change, such as a change to the vertical height, width, or dielectric constant of the IC, is not necessary. Moreover, this modeling technique can even be used to account for silicon effects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","104","104","106","104"]},"Moreover, in the exemplary embodiment, system  includes a presentation interface  that presents information, such as input events and\/or validation results, to the user.

A shift is applied on each of the groups by the tuning vector value and a technology file, such as a 2.5 dimensional RC techfile, is regenerated. In some embodiments, a system includes a non-transient machine readable storage medium storing at least one technology file generated by an EDA tool. The system also includes an RC tool within the EDA tool. The EDA tool is configured to arrange a plurality of layer combinations into a plurality of groups such that each of the layer combinations is assigned to at least one group. The EDA tool is also configured to perform a shifting analysis on a plurality of benchmark circuits for each of the groups and to calculate at least one tuning vector value based, at least in part, on a plurality of criteria vectors of the benchmark circuits. Moreover, the EDA tool is configured to apply a shift on each of the groups by the tuning vector value and to regenerate the technology file.","In some embodiments, at least one non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon, wherein, when executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to arrange a plurality of layer combinations into a plurality of groups such that each of the layer combinations is assigned to at least one group. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to perform a shifting analysis on a plurality of benchmark circuits for each of the groups and to calculate at least one tuning vector value based, at least in part, on a plurality of criteria vectors of the benchmark circuits. Moreover, the computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to apply a shift on each of the groups by the tuning vector value and to regenerate the technology file.","The methods described herein can be at least partially embodied in the form of computer-implemented processes and apparatus for practicing those processes. The disclosed methods can also be at least partially embodied in the form of computer program code embodied in tangible, non-transient machine readable storage media, such as RAMs, ROMs, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, BD-ROMs, hard disk drives, flash memories, or any other non-transient machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the method. The methods can also be at least partially embodied in the form of computer program code, whether loaded into and\/or executed by a computer, such that, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the methods. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the computer program code segments configure the processor to create specific logic circuits. The methods can alternatively be at least partially embodied in a digital signal processor formed of application specific integrated circuits for performing the methods.","Although the system and method described herein have been described in terms of exemplary embodiments, they are not limited thereto. Rather, the appended claims should be construed broadly, to include other variants and embodiments of the disclosed system and method, which can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and range of equivalents of the system and method."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
