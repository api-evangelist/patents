title: Schema-based services for identity-based data access
abstract: A schema-based service for Internet access to per-user services data, wherein access to data is based on each user's identity. The service includes a schema that defines rules and a structure for each user's data, and also includes methods that provide access to the data in a defined way. The services schema thus corresponds to a logical document containing the data for each user. The user manipulates (e.g., reads or writes) data in the logical document by data access requests through defined methods. In one implementation, the services schemas are arranged as XML documents, and the services provide methods that control access to the data based on the requesting user's identification, defined role and scope for that role. In this way, data can be accessed by its owner, and shared to an extent determined by the owner.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The invention relates generally to computer network data access, and more particularly to systems, methods and data structures for accessing data and data-related services over a network.","There are many types of data that users need to manage and otherwise access. For example, users keep word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, calendars, telephone numbers and addresses, e-mail messages, financial information and so on. In general, users maintain this information on various personal computers, hand-held computers, pocket-sized computers, personal digital assistants, mobile phones and other electronic devices. In most cases, a user's data on one device is not accessible to another device, without some manual synchronization process or the like to exchange the data, which is cumbersome. Moreover, some devices do not readily allow for synchronization. For example, if a user leaves his cell phone at work, he has no way to get his stored phone numbers off the cell phone when at home, even if the user has a computing device or similar cell phone at his disposal. As is evident, these drawbacks result from the separate devices each containing their own data.","Corporate networks and the like can provide users with remote access to some of their data, but many users do not have access to such a network. For many of those that have access, connecting to a network with the many different types of devices, assuming such devices can even connect to a network, can be a complex or overwhelming problem.","Moreover, even if a user has centrally stored data, the user needs the correct type of device running the appropriate application program to access that data. For example, a user with a PDA that runs a simple note taking application program ordinarily will not be able to use that program to open documents stored by a full-blown word processing program at work. In general, this is because the data is formatted and accessed according to the way the application program wants it to be formatted.","What is needed is a model wherein data is centrally stored for users, with a set of services that control access to the data with defined methods, regardless of the application program and\/or device. When accessed, the data for each service should be structured in a defined way that complies with defined rules for that data, regardless of the application program or device that is accessing the data.","Briefly, the present invention provides a set of services for central (e.g., Internet) access to per-user data, based on each user's identity, wherein each service includes a schema that defines rules and a structure for the data, and also includes methods that provide access to the data in a defined way. Note that while \u201cuser\u201d is generally employed herein for simplicity, as used herein the term \u201cuser\u201d is really a substitute for any identity, which may be a user, a group, another entity, an event, a project, and so on. Because the structure of the data is defined from the perspective of the data, not from that of an application program or a device, programs can communicate with the services to access the data, with existing knowledge of the format. In one implementation, the schemas are arranged as XML documents, and the services provide methods that control access to the data based on the requesting user's identification, defined role and scope for that role. In this way, data can be accessed by its owner, and shared to an extent determined by the owner. Extensibility is defined into the schemas.","In one implementation, core services are provided for managing access of various types of data, each service corresponding to a defined schema for the type of data it manages. In addition to defined schemas for the data, the various services implement standard methods that application programs can call in order to obtain access to the data, and also may include custom methods that facilitate access, referred to as domain-specific methods. Core services include myServices, to allow applications to find another service, myApplicationSettings, to allow a user to centrally store settings for the user's various applications, and myCalendar, which manages access to data regarding scheduled events. Other core services include myCategories, to provide a generic classification model, myContacts, to manage access to a user's list of contacts, and myDevices, to manage a user's devices. Other, core services include myDocuments, myFavoriteWebSites, myInbox, myLists, myLocation, myAlerts, myProfile, myPresence and myWallet, as described below. Note that each of these services are alternatively and interchangably referred to herein by \u201c.NET\u201d followed by their name, e.g., myInbox may be referred to as .NET Inbox, or simply Inbox, myContacts as .NET Contacts, or simply Contacts, and so on. Note that this is only one exemplary set of core services, and that other core services implementations may include a different combination of these services (i.e. a subset) and\/or additional services which may be considered as \u201ccore\u201d services.","Extended (or optional) services are also allowed. The extended services need not be provided by the provider of the core services, e.g., there may be a number of users who subscribe to one companies core services but only subscribe to third party extended services. Likewise, there may be a number of services providers who provide core services or extended services but not both. Thus, it should be understood that a core services provider may also provides extended services, or providers of core or extended services, or both, may be different entities.","Other benefits and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to: personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, tablet devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and so forth, that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in local and\/or remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer . Components of the computer  may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","The computer  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, and removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by the computer . Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optic al disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media, discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers herein to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a tablet, or electronic digitizer, , a microphone , a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices not shown in  may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . The monitor  may also be integrated with a touch-screen panel or the like. Note that the monitor and\/or touch screen panel can be physically coupled to a housing in which the computing device  is incorporated, such as in a tablet-type personal computer. In addition, computers such as the computing device  may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface  or the like.","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet. For example, in the present invention, the computer system  may comprise source machine from which data is being migrated, and the remote computer  may comprise the destination machine. Note however that source and destination machines need not be connected by a network or any other means, but instead, data may be migrated via any media capable of being written by the source platform and read by the destination platform or platforms.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface  or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Data Access Model","The present invention generally operates in an architecture\/platform that connects network-based (e.g., Internet-based) applications, devices and services, and transforms them into a user's personal network which works on the user's behalf, and with permissions granted by the user. To this end, the present invention is generally directed to schema-based services that maintain user, group, corporate or other entity data in a commonly accessible virtual location, such as the Internet. The present invention is intended to scale to millions of users, and be stored reliably, and thus it is likely that a user's data will be distributed among and\/or replicated to numerous storage devices, such as controlled via a server federation. As such, while the present invention will be generally described with respect to an identity-centric model that enables a user with an appropriate identity and credentials to access data by communicating with various core or other services, it is understood that the schema-based services described herein are arranged for handling the data of millions of users, sorted on a per-user-identity basis. Note that while \u201cuser\u201d is generally employed herein for simplicity, as used herein the term \u201cuser\u201d is really a substitute for any identity, which may be a user, a group, another entity, an event, a project, and so on.","As generally represented in , a data access model  includes a generic navigation module  through which applications  and the like may access a wide variety of identity-based data, such as maintained in an addressable store . To access the data, a common set of command methods may be used to perform operations on various data structures that are constructed from the data in the addressable store , even though each of those data structures may represent different data and be organized quite differently. Such command methods may describe generic operations that may be desired on a wide variety of data structures, and include, for example, insert, delete, replace, update, query or changequery methods.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention and as described in detail below, the data is accessed according to various schemas, with the schemas corresponding to identity-based services through which users access their data. As used herein, a \u201cschema\u201d generally comprises a set of rules that define how a data structure may be organized, e.g., what elements are supported, in what order they appear, how many times they appear, and so on. In addition, a schema may define, via color-coding or other identification mechanisms, what portions of an XML document (that corresponds to the data structure) may be operated on. Examples of such XML-based documents are described below. The schema may also define how the structure of the XML document may be extended to include elements not expressly mentioned in the schema.","As will be understood below, the schemas vary depending on the type of data they are intended to organize, e.g., an email-inbox-related schema organizes data differently from a schema that organizes a user's favorite websites. Further, the services that employ schemas may vary. As such, the generic navigation module  has associated therewith a navigation assistance module  that includes or is otherwise associated with one or more schemas . As will be understood, a navigation assistance module  as represented in  corresponds to one or more services, and possesses the information that defines how to navigate through the various data structures, and may also indicate which command methods may be executed on what portions of the data structure. Although in  only one navigation assistance module  is shown coupled to the generic navigation module , there may be multiple navigation assistance modules that may each specialize as desired. For example, each navigation assistance module may correspond to one service. Moreover, although the navigation assistance module  is illustrated as a separate module, some or all of the operations of the navigation assistance module  may be incorporated into the generic navigation module , and vice versa. In one embodiment, the various data structures constructed from the schema and addressable store data may comprise XML documents of various XML classes. In that case, the navigation assistance module  may contain a schema associated with each of the classes of XML documents.","The present invention provides a number of schema-based services that facilitate data access based on the identity of a user. Preferably, the user need not obtain a separate identity for each service, but rather obtains a single identity via a single set of credentials, such as with the Microsoft\u00ae Passport online service. With such an identity, a user can access data via these services from virtually any network connectable device capable of running an application that can call the methods of a service.","Services and Schemas","\u201c.NET My Services\u201d comprises identity-centric services which may be generally implemented in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) Message Interfaces (XMIs). While the present invention will be described with respect to XML and XMI, it can readily be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular language or set of interfaces. The .NET My Services model essentially corresponds to one implementation of the generic data access model  of .","As generally represented in , .NET My Services  is implemented as a set of Web services -, each bound to a .NET Identity (PUID, such as a Passport\u00ae unique identifier similar to a globally unique indentifier when Passport\u00ae is the authentication service). The services - can communicate with one another via a service-to-service communications protocol (SSCP), described below. As also described below, each service presents itself as a set of XML documents that can be manipulated from an application program  () or the like using a set of standard methods and domain-specific methods. To this end, a user device  (endpoint) running such application programs connects a user's applications to the services, and the data controlled by those services, such as over the Internet or an Intranet, such as over the Internet or an Intranet. Note that endpoints can be client devices, applications or services. In keeping with the present invention, virtually any device capable of executing software and connecting to a network in any means may thus give a user access to data that the user is allowed to access, such as the user's own data, or data that a friend or colleague has specified as being accessible to that particular user.","In general, a .NET Identity is an identifier assigned to an individual, a group of individuals, or some form of organization or project. Using this identifier, services bound to that identity can be located and manipulated. A general effect is that each identity (e.g., of a user, group or organization) has tied to it a set of services that are partitioned along schema boundaries and across different identities. As will be understood, the XML-document-centric architecture of .NET My Services provides a model for manipulating and communicating service state that is very different from prior data access models. The XML-document-centric approach, in conjunction with loose binding to the data exposed by the services, enables new classes of application programs. As will also be understood, the .NET My Services model  presents the various services - using a uniform and consistent service and method model, a uniform and consistent data access and manipulation model, and a uniform and consistent security authorization model.","In a preferred implementation, the .NET My Services model  is based upon open Internet standards. Services are accessed by means of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) messages containing an XML payload. Service input and output is expressed as XML document outlines, and each of these document outlines conform to an XML schema document. The content is available to a user interacting with the .NET My Services service endpoint .","One aspect of the present invention is that a schema essentially describes a web service. More particularly, a service author begins to write a web service by defining a schema (e.g., in XML) that defines what the data model looks like, e.g., the supported elements, their relative ordering, how many times they appear, and other similar definitions, as will become apparent below. This service definition also applies to an author determining what roles and methods are supported, e.g., which operations are supported, and the extent of the data that can be returned for each method. Another way of stating this concept is that the author starts by building a complete definition of a service, such as in XML, and specifies the verbs (methods) that an application will use to talk to it.","At this point, the service author has an XML definition that has been declared, and this declarative definition may be run through a compilation process, resulting in a fully operational service. It should be noted that a general purpose interpreter-like mechanism may be fed one of these declarative XML definitions, and result in a service that is capable of operating. In a simple service (e.g., with no domain-specific methods or complex logic), no new code needs to be written to provide such an operational service. As will be understood, such authoring of a service without coding is possible due to the data driven model of the present architecture. As will be understood, however, code can also be written to influence and or work with the service generation process to add value to a service, and\/or provide specific, runtime business logic that is not expressible in a declarative way.","Turning to , in the .NET My Services model, an application  requests performance of a method that operates on data structures. The application may make a request that is generic with respect to the type of data structure being operated upon and without requiring dedicated executable code for manipulating data structures of any particular data type. To this end, the application first contacts a myServices service  (which may be referred to as .NET Service) to obtain the information needed to communicate with a particular service , through a set of methods  of that service . For example, the needed information received from the myServices service  includes a URI of that service . Note that the service  may correspond to essentially any of the services represented in . The myServices service  is further described below with respect to .","The service  includes or is otherwise associated with a set of methods  including standard methods , such as to handle requests directed to insert, delete, replace, update, query or changequery operations on the data. The set of methods of a particular service may also include service specific methods . In general, the only way in which an application can communicate with a service are via that service's methods.","Each service includes service logic  for handling requests and providing suitable responses. To this end, the service logic performs various functions such as authorization, authentication, and signature validation, and further limits valid users to only the data which they are permitted to access. The security aspect of a service is not discussed herein, except to note that in general, for otherwise valid users, the user's identity determines whether a user can access data in a requested manner. To this end, a roleMap  comprising service-wide roleList document templates  and scopes (e.g., part of the overall service's schema ), in conjunction with user-based data maintained in an addressable store , determines whether a particular requested method is allowed, e.g., by forming an identity-based roleList document . If a method is allowed, the scope information in the roleMap  determines a shape of data to return, e.g., how much content is allowed to be accessed for this particular user for this particular request. The content is obtained in accordance with a content document  in the service's schema  and the actual user data corresponding to that content document in the addressable store . In this manner, a per-identity shaped content document  is essentially constructed for returning to the user, or for updating the addressable store, as appropriate for the method. Note that  includes a number of ID-based roleList documents and ID-based content documents, to emphasize that the service  is arranged to serve multiple users. Also, in , a system document  is present as part of the schema , as described below.","Returning to , in one implementation, access to .NET My Services  is accomplished using SOAP messages formatted with .NET My Services-specific header and body content. Each of the services will accept these messages by means of an HTTP POST operation, and generate a response by \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d on the HTTP Response, or by issuing an HTTP POST to a .NET MyServices response-processing endpoint . In addition to HTTP as the message transfer protocol, .NET My Services will support raw SOAP over TCP, a transfer protocol known as Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (or DIME). Other protocols for transferring messages are feasible.","Because each of the .NET My Services services are accessed by protocol, no particular client-side binding code, object models, API layers, or equivalents are required, and are thus optional. The .NET My Services model will support Web Services Description Language (WSDL). It is not mandatory that applications wishing to interact with .NET My Services services make use of any particular bindings, and such bindings are not described herein. Instead, the present invention will be generally described in terms of messages that flow between requestors of a particular service and the service endpoints. In order to interact with .NET My Services, a service needs to format a .NET My Services message and deliver that message to a .NET My Services endpoint. In order to format a message, a client needs to manipulate XML document outlines, and typically perform some simple, known (public-domain) cryptographic operations on portions of the message.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, and as described in  and below, in one preferred implementation, each .NET My Services service presents three logical XML documents, a content document , roleList document  (of the roleMap ), and a system document . These documents are addressable using .NET My Services message headers, and are manipulated using standard .NET My Services methods. In addition to these common methods, each service may include additional domain-specific methods. For example, as described below, the myCalendar service  might choose to expose a \u201cgetFreeBusy\u201d method rather than expose free\/busy as writeable fragments in the content document.","Each .NET My Services service thus logically includes a content document , which in general is the main, service-specific document. The schema for this document  is a function of the class of service, as will become apparent from the description of each service's schema below. For example, in the case of the myCalendar service , the content document presents data in the shape dictated by the myCalendar schema, whereas in the case of the myFavoriteWebSites service , the content document presents data in the shape dictated by a myFavoriteWebSites schema.","Each service also includes a roleList document  that contains roleList information, comprising information that governs access to the data and methods exported by the service . The roleList document is manipulated using the .NET standard data manipulation mechanisms. The shape of this document is governed by the .NET core schema's roleListType XML data type.","Each service also includes a system document , which contains service-specific system data such as the roleMap, schemaMap, messageMap, version information, and service specific global data. The document is manipulated using the standard .NET My Services data manipulation mechanism, although modifications are limited in a way that allows only the service itself to modify the document. The shape of this system document  may be governed by the system document schema for the particular service, in that each service may extend a base system document type with service specific information. For purposes of simplicity herein, the base system document is described once, rather than for each service, with only those services having extended service specific information separately described. Notwithstanding, it should be understood that each service includes at least the base system portion in its system document.","As is understood, the present invention is generally directed to schemas, which in general comprise a set of rules or standards that define how a particular type of data can be structured. Via the schemas, the meaning of data, rather than just the data itself, may be communicated between computer systems. For example, a computer device may recognize that a data structure that follows a particular address schema represents an address, enabling the computer to \u201cunderstand\u201d the component part of an address. The computer device may then perform intelligent actions based on the understanding that the data structure represents an address. Such actions may include, for example, the presentation of an action menu to the user that represents things to do with addresses. Schemas may be stored locally on a device and\/or globally in a federation's \u201cmega-store.\u201d A device can keep a locally-stored schema updated by subscribing to an event notification service (in this case, a schema update service) that automatically passes messages to the device when the schema is updated. Access to globally stored schemas is controlled by the security infrastructure.","General Schema Commonality","The .NET My Services data is defined using annotated XSD (eXtensible or XML Structure Definitions) schema files. The XSD files accurately type the data, but since XSD is a verbose and complex language, it is not a particularly efficient way to convey structure and meaning. Thus, for purposes of simplicity herein, the schemas are described below in terms of schema outlines with accompanying element\/attribute descriptions. These document outlines accurately show the structure of the data contained within a service. However, because the present application is not viewable in color, the nodes, elements and\/or attributes of the schema outlines (which may be described as bold blue, or blue), are represented in the schema outlines as boldface type. Those described as underlined red, or red, are represented as underlined type, while others referred to as black are represented in normal type.","The meaning of these bold (blue), underlined (red) and normal (black) items has significance with respect to the data model and to the data language that accesses and manipulates the data (e.g., via the insert, delete, replace, update, query, changequery or other methods). For example, each document described below contains a root element having an element name that matches that of the service, e.g., the myApplicationsSettings service has a root element named myApplicationsSettings. The .NET My Services name for this item is the root.","Documents contain elements that resemble first-class top-level objects, including, for example, <catDef\/>, <myApplicationsSettings\/> (other another name as appropriate) and <order\/>. Such items are denoted in the outlines as bold (blue), and may be identified using an <xdb:blue\/> tag. Bold (blue) items define major blocks of data within a service. These node sets are directly addressable by an identifier attribute, and their change status is tracked through a changeNumber attribute. Top-level bold blue items may be considered objects. As seen below, some bold (blue) objects contain nested bold blue objects. They usually contain frequently changing underlined (red) properties, which reduces the amount of synchronization traffic. Nested bold (blue) items may be considered property groups.","Each bold blue item contains one or more underlined (red) items which are elements or attributes. These items may be identified using the <xdb:red\/> tag. These items are special in that they may be used within predicates (filters) to aid in xdb:bold blue selection. These items are also directly addressable and may be manipulated directly by the data manipulation language.","Each colored red element may contain one or more non-colorized elements and attributes, which are valid and semantically meaningful XML items in the service document. Such items are opaque to the data language. These uncolored (i.e., non-bold or underlined) elements and attributes may not be addressed directly, may not be selected in a node selection operation, and may not be used in a predicate node test. Note that if one of these items is in the path to an underlined red item, it may be used in a location step to the underlined red item, but may not be used as the selected node. Note that being opaque does not mean that the item is not considered during schema validation, but rather means that the item may not be used in a predicate, may not be directly addressed, and may not be inserted by itself. As can be readily appreciated, in this manner, the .NET My Services thus limits the granularity of access to nodes within the service document, since only xdb:bold blue and xdb:underlined red marked items are directly addressable, and only those elements and attributes tagged with the xdb:underlined red annotation may be used in predicates to influence node selection. Using this technique, the .NET My Services storage system can efficiently manage indexes, increase the performance of node selection, partially shred the document data, and in general (because the node selections are well defined) fine-tune the node selection logic on a per-xdb:blue basis. The primary purpose of the xdb:blue is to define a base-level XML object that is designed to be operated on as a unit. The primary purpose of the xdb:red items is to aid in the selection of xdb:bold blues. The xdb:red items may be changed by the data language primitives so some level of fine-grained manipulation of the data is available, but only in very limited ways.","Bold blue items have unique IDs, which are usually assigned by .NET My Services, and are returned from update operations within the new blueId node. In all cases, the order of xxxBold blue follows the pre-order traversal of the document XML tree. Item IDs are UUIDs in the following format (h stands for a hexadecimal digit): hhhhhhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhh.","In addition to identifiers, names and change numbers, nodes and especially red nodes may include creator identifiers, category information, and {any} fields. Category information enables data to be grouped and\/or distinguished in some way, such as to share certain calendar information with golf buddies, send an email to immediately family, designate things such as which telephone number is the user's primary number, e.g., if a user has a second home, and so on. Fields of type \u201cany\u201d may comprise fully-typed, namespace-qualified fields that contain any type of content (e.g., free-form XML) therein. Such \u201cany\u201d fields thus allow extensibility of the schema, yet maintain the defined structure of a schema.","In one implementation, the core data-manipulation language implemented by the .NET My Services includes an insertRequest, or insert message. This primitive inserts any schema-valid XML fragment into a selected context, thereby changing the existing state of the document. A queryRequest, or message, retrieves data, such as to retrieve a document. Multiple queries may be specified in one request, and queries that select nothing are considered successful. It is possible to assert that the number of nodes in the selection falls in a given range. This is expressed using minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes. If a minOccurs\/maxOccurs test fails on any node, the request is considered unsuccessful. Note that this is different from a failure code, which would be returned, for example, for a malformed request.","A deleteRequest primitive deletes the selected nodes and all their children. Note that, just like for other requests, attributes may be selected as well as elements. Empty selections result in successful operations, similar to Query. The minOccurs\/maxOccurs tests are supported wherever select is allowed.","A replaceRequest primitive (replace message) is designed to replace the content of each of the selected nodes with the specified new content. Selected nodes themselves are not affected in any way. This may be considered as an atomic delete of the content of the selected node, followed by an insert. The content (text, attributes, elements) in the selected nodes are replaced with the new item specified in this message. The node type of the selected node and of the replacement node are thus required to be the same. The changequery request essentially returns result comrpising data that has changed.","As mentioned above, each of the services includes a RoleList document and scope information that describes which users have what type of access to which data. For example, a data owner will have read\/write access to his or her own data, and can provide various types of rights to that data to other users based on their IDs, (e.g., read only to some users, read write to others). Each role list identifier may be associated with a scope, by which the kinds of data stored according to a given schema can be controlled per user. For example, a user can give a friend (with one identity) access via a service to a home telephone number, home address and so forth, but can give other users (with other identities) access only to a business telephone number. In general, a scope can be defined such that that it includes everything except any specifically listed items, or excludes everything except any specifically listed items.","Base System Document Items","The system document is a global document for each service, having content and meaning that is independent of the puid used to address the service. The document is read only to all users. Each system document contains a set of base items common to each .NET My Services service described herein, and is optionally extended by each service to include service-specific global information. Throughout the following examples, an \u201chs\u201d as in <hs: scope . . . > represents the namespace or schematic that may be used to interpret the corresponding element.

Alternatively, the value may be protocol:\/\/service, whereby this URI indicates that generated subscription messages are delivered to the specified service at the domain of the creator's platformId. For example, a platformId indicating microsoft.com, and a value in this element of http:\/\/subscriptionResponse would cause delivery of the subscription message to http:\/subscriptionResponse.microsoft.com.

Other services, referred to as extended services , will also employ schemas in the same manner, but are more likely to be desirable to certain users and not others. Examples of extended schemas include services such as myPortfolio, myPhotos, myTravel, myMusic, myMovies, myTV, myWishlist, mySchool, myGroceries, myNews, mySports, myTopScores and so on. As will be understood, although the present invention will focus on the core schemas, the present invention is not limited to any schema in particular, but rather is directed to all such schemas. For purposes of organization, the various services and schemas will be described alphabetically by service name, with the one exception being that the \u201cmyServices\u201d service will be described first, since applications typically call the myServices service first, in order to communicate with the other services. Note that this is only one exemplary set of core services, and that other core services implementations may include different services, a different combination of these services (i.e. a subset), and\/or additional services which may be considered as \u201ccore\u201d services. Also, note that the extended services need not be provided by the provider of the core services, e.g., there may be a number of users who subscribe to one companies core services but only subscribe to third party extended services. Likewise, there may be a number of services providers who provide core services or extended services but not both. Thus, it should be understood that a core services provider may also provides extended services, or providers of core or extended services, or both, may be different entities.","myServices","The myServices schema is an XML schema that describes the list of available other myServices for a given identity (i.e. person, organization, business). The myServices schema essentially serves a directory of what and where each of the myServices logically resides, as well as additional information used to identify the service in the use of general communication. Note that the myServices service that provides the URI (and other needed information) should not be confused with the general concept of \u201c.NET My Services\u201d as described above.","Issuing a query request to myServices is part of every application's initial responsibility to figure out where a desired service resides. More particularly, the myServices service  () generally allows an application program to obtain the information (e.g., including a URI) needed to connect to another service. It should be noted that there are multiple instances of each such service, e.g., a provider such as MSN.com will have a different myInbox service instance than XYZ.com will have for its myInbox service, and indeed a single provider may have multiple instances of a service. Moreover, a single user may have email accounts at both MSN.com and XYZ.com, and different users may use the same application program to communicate with possibly many other instances of the myInbox service. As a result, an application program normally does not have URIs hard coded therein or initially cached for the many possible instances of the various services, so the application program contacts the myServices service  to determine the URI of a service for the current user. The application will of course know or otherwise be able to determine the URI of the myServices service . The information returned by the myServices service  can be cached thereafter, whereby the application can talk directly to the service desired. However, at any point in time, a given service may respond to the application with a \u2018not found here\u2019 type of error, which the application should respond to by again contacting the myServices service, as the user's service may have been moved.","An application program's query to myServices may result in multiple sets of information (e.g., multiple XML documents) being returned. For example, a user may have different email addresses and get information on different myInbox services returned in response to a single query. An application that can deal with such multiple sets, such as by prompting the user to select one, can use some or all of the information returned. One of the sets of information may be marked as a primary set, whereby applications that can only work with a single set may simply select the primary.","Thus, the application program  queries the myServices service , represented in  by the arrow labeled with circled numeral one (1). In addition to the URI of the desired service instance, (e.g., the MyCalendar service ), in order to communicate with the service  the application program  needs an identity license, for example a Kerberos ticket that identifies the user, application and credential type. To this end, the myServices service  returns the URI, a service principal name (spn), and realm information that corresponds to a Kerberos domain controller (KDC) , as represented in  by the arrow labeled with circled numeral two (2). The application program  uses the spn to obtain the identity license from the KDC  based on the realm information, as represented via the arrows labeled three (3) and four (4), wherein a KDC  issues tickets for services in a particular realm . The application program  may then properly communicate with the myCalendar service  (arrow labeled five (5)).","In an alternative implementation, represented in , for efficiency, an instance of the myServices service  may be part of a realm  having a KDC . In response to the query (the arrow labeled one (1)), if the realm that the myServices service is part of is the same as the realm that would be returned to the application program , the myServices service  will instead automatically obtain the ticket for the application program , as represented in  via the arrows labeled two (2) and three (3). The license ticket is then directly returned, (arrow labeled four (4)), whereby the application program  may then properly communicate with the myCalendar service  (arrow labeled five (5)). Note that it is typically far faster for the myServices service to communicate with the KDC in its realm (e.g., in the same datacenter) than for an application program to do so over an Internet connection. It should be noted that a myServices instance can also be associated with multiple KDCs, and does not have to belong to any one realm. For example, a myServices service may be able to communicate with a Passport KDC, an MSN.com KDC, a hotmail.com KDC, and so forth. When an application program query results in a realm that corresponds to one of these KDCs, the myServices service can obtain the license ticket directly, as described above.","In most cases, the myServices entry serves as the definitive information for a given user and the service information. However, one possibility is that a myServices instance will not know the specifics of a particular user's needed information, e.g., the desired service's URI, realm and\/or spn. In such an event, the myServices instance can refer the application program to another myServices instance by returning referral information (in a refer field) to the application program in response to the query. To this end, when a <refer> tag is found within a service entry, this means that the entry is a referral, and the <to> element actually points to another second tier myServices service. This capability is important for the ability to distribute the lookup information instead of having one centralized logical point of failure and updates. Ultimately the application program will obtain the address and other information of the desired .NET MyServices service. Note that it is possible for a response to include a referral and also include a license ticket, since a myServices instance may be connected to the appropriate KDC, but not have the URI of the desired service.","myServices\/Roles","The myServices service controls access by using the roleTemplates, rt, rt, rt, rt, and rt, using the following

This particular service uses an XML schema to describe Alerts, and the methods by which Alerts can be sent and received. In general, the myAlerts service processes alerts (also referred to as notifications and\/or events).","In keeping with the present invention, an alert is defined as embeddable XML, specifying both standard schema and extensible problem-domain schema, using the problem-domain schema as alert typing. The standard schema is generally directed to conveying alerts, regardless of what the alert is trying to convey. The problem-domain schema extension is used in a dynamically programmable Alert processing mechanism to control alert routing. Like other .NET My Services, .NET Alerts is designed to service the user instead of a particular device or application. Although alerts are posted to a single location, the messages are transparently routed to one or more of the user's applications or devices. The logic for deciding how, where, and when a message is delivered can be customized to meet the needs of a particular user, device, or application.","The myAlerts service includes mechanisms to deliver alerts, comprising a basic model mechanism that provides the baseline functionality of sending and receiving alerts. A streams model mechanism includes more robust features, such as filtering, buffering, and persistence, as well as more refined control over the routing of alerts.","As used herein, a client is any entity that can issue an XMI request to the .NET Alerts service. Clients can send or receive alerts, wherein an alert typically comprises a short XML message delivered to one or more users by .NET Alerts. A receiver is a .NET My Services user who has one or more applications that can receive alerts. Such an application is referred to herein as a userAgent. A userAgent includes any code on any device that can communicate with .NET Alerts.","The myAlerts service provides a variety of ways to communicate with userAgents. For example, as generally represented in , a sender  may send an alert  by issuing an XMI request to the myAlerts service . The sender  can send alerts to the sender's own user, or to another user. Senders and most userAgents are clients because they issue XMI requests to the myAlerts service to send or receive alerts. Because myAlerts supports non-XMI protocols to deliver alerts to userAgents, some userAgents are not clients.","UserAgents - create connections -, respectively, to receive alerts. Each connection (e.g., ) has a query that selects which alerts the connection  will forward to its respective userAgent . The connection  will use a particular protocol to deliver alerts to the userAgent ; different connection types may provide different protocols for a userAgent. As the .NET Alerts service receives alerts, it routes them to zero or more connections, depending on the queries for each connection.","To send an alert , a client sender  issues a notify method request to a user's myAlerts service . To receive alerts, a userAgent (e.g., ) issues an insert method request to create a connection  in the myAlerts content document, and then processes the resulting connection protocol to receive incoming alerts. Different connection types can support different alerts and userAgent protocols (for example, SOAP\/XMI over HTTP, TCP\/DIME, and UDP), and can also include SIP or other non-XMI protocols. Connections generally fall into Push Connections, wherein the myAlerts service proactively pushes an alert to a userAgent, or Pull Connections, wherein the userAgent proactively pulls an alert from the myAlerts service. This requires some alert buffering.","In general, each alert  is a snippet of XML passed to and from the myAlerts service  embedded within XMI method request and response packets. The lifetime (and position) of an alert is transitory. Therefore, alerts are not part of the user content document. Alerts are proactively sent to the myAlerts service or to userAgents with the notify method, described below. Alerts are proactively pulled from the myAlerts service with the poll method, also described below.","Argots  are XML blobs (e.g., strongly-named {any} fields) that may be placed in an alert to convey problem domain-specific data. The outer element name defines the argot; the inner contents of the argot are opaque to general myAlerts processing. At present, argots may be represented formally and informally. An argot is formally declared through an outer argot element, and its name is specified through the argotURI attribute. The actual content of the argot is specified in sub-elements. The formal representation of argots may change to the informal representation in future versions. Informally declared argots are simply declared as an XML element. In this case, the argot name is the name of that element. Such an argot can have sub-elements, as appropriate.","The myAlerts service expects informal argots within the contents element of an alert. The xpQuery element for both streams and connections defines a query against the argot names within the contents element. For example, an xpQuery value of \u201chumanReadable\u201d in a connection causes that connection to get only alerts that contain the humanReadable argot in their contents. To match all argots, an asterisk (\u201c*\u201d) may be specified in the xpQuery value.","The myAlerts service expects formal argots in some of the stream and connection document methods. For example, the push connection requires the pushConnectionParameters formal argot in insert and replace methods, and generates it for query methods.","As generally represented in , a streams model is also provided. Unlike the basic model, the streams model provides a mechanism to filter, buffer, persist, or intelligently control the routing of alerts. A stream of alerts is a set of alerts that match an argot query. The argot query specifies a relation of argot types; an alert is in the stream if it contains argots that match the stream query. To include alerts in a stream, an asterisk (\u201c*\u201d) may be used, or a set of argot types (for example, \u201chumanReadable\u201d) can be specified to include a subset.","A stream (e.g., ) is an object inside a user's myAlerts service  that defines and manages a stream of alerts as they are routed to the user's connections. Clients can create and provision one or more streams to control the alert routing for a user. A user may have multiple streams - to control different streams of alerts. Multiple streams are supported because a user will often receive different types of alerts, each requiring its own filtering, buffering, and so on. For example, the myAlerts service  may focus on human-oriented alerts to implement a stream that controls alerts containing the humanReadable argot. Other services or applications will define their own argots, and will want to control the processing of their alerts.","Clients create, manage, and delete streams through XMI requests to a user's .NET Alerts content document. Generally, a stream operates in four steps:\n\n","These steps are formalized in three objects inside the alert routing, namely streamFork , stream (e.g., the stream ) and connectionFork (). When an alert  is received by the myAlerts service , the streamFork  decides the order in which to invoke streams - on the alert . When invoked, each stream will determine whether to handle the alert and whether to continue or stop the streamFork processing. A stream (e.g., the stream ) can handle or ignore an alert, and can also allow or inhibit later streams from handling the alert.","Each of the streams - then applies its processing algorithm and state to the alerts they handle. A stream can reroute the alert to other streams by continuing or restarting the streamFork process. A stream can deliver an alert by passing it on to the connections through the connectionFork .","The connectionFork  controls communication between streams and connections -, processing and optimizing execution of the connection queries to match alerts to the appropriate connections. Conceptually, as represented in , alerts (e.g., the alert ) moves forward from the sender , through the streamFork , through zero or more streams -, through the connectionFork , through zero or more connections -, to connected userAgents -. Streams - can push alerts to connections - or connections - can pull alerts from streams -. This will match the type of connections (that is, push or pull).","Stream types provide different alert handling algorithms. Five possible stream capabilities includes:\n\n","The myAlerts architecture declares the ordering and non-ordering of alert delivery through a connection. However, alert buffering, multiple streams, and intra-user federation can make it difficult to guarantee ordering, and arbitrary rerouting of alerts by routing streams can make ordering impossible. A virtual stream is the aggregate set of alerts delivered through a particular connection. The order in a virtual stream will be defined by the set of streams contributing alerts to the virtual stream. Simple, buffering, and privacy streams are required to maintain a standard ordering of oldest to newest alerts in a virtual stream. Routing and external streams are also required to maintain that order. Alerts that are inserted into the stream need to be new; an old alert cannot be reinserted out of order or multiple times.","One implementation of myAlerts provides a streamDefault stream class, which always exists and is not reflected in the user's content document, and a streamBuffer stream class. This stream will buffer up to one-hundred of the alerts it selects in memory. Note the number one-hundred is arbitrary, and was just selected as a suitable number for this implementation.","Two connection classes are implemented in one current implementation of myAlerts, namely a pushConnection, wherein the connection will push an alert to an URL by issuing an XMI notify method request, and a pullConnection, wherein the userAgent will issue XMI poll method requests to the connection to retrieve alerts.","The alert schema contains both standard and problem-domain specific portions. The present invention types the problem-domain portions as argots and allows that typing to define the essential semantic naming shared between alert senders and receivers.","The schema for the alert processing mechanism contains both stream objects which control alert processing within our service and connection objects which control delivery and protocol to external user agents. Both types of objects select and process alerts based on the argots contained in each alert, through the argotQuery element that specifies a standing query against received and persisted alerts.","In addition, new methods are provided, described below, including:\n\n","The myAlerts service controls access by using the rt, rt and rt roleTemplates, using the following

Attempts to write this attribute are silently ignored, e.g., without an error being generated.","The \/myApplicationSettings\/@instanceId (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute is a unique identifier typically assigned to the root element of a service. It is a read-only element and assigned by the .NET My Services system when a user is provisioned for a particular service. The \/myApplicationSettings\/applicationSetting (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) element defines the basic unit of storage within this service which is the applicationSetting. An applicationSetting is cacheable and replicable through normal .NET My Services caching and replication techniques. An applicationSetting is identified by a single and stable id (the @id) attribute. An applicationSetting may also be known by a number of applicationSettingNames which are defined as URIs. The substance part of an application setting is represented by an {any} entry, which essentially is a shorthand notation for any, free-form, namespace qualified XML.","The \/myApplicationSettings\/applicationSetting\/@changeNumber (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) changeNumber attribute is designed to facilitate caching of the element and its descendants.

Normally, .NET My Services will generate and assign this ID during an insertRequest operation, or possibly during a replaceRequest. Application software can override this ID generation by specifying the useClientIds attribute in the request message. Once an ID is assigned, the attribute is read-only and attempts to write it are silently ignored. The \/myApplicationSettings\/applicationSetting\/@creator (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute identifies the creator in terms of userId, appId, and platformId of the node.","The \/myApplicationSettings\/applicationSetting\/cat (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) element is used to categorize the element that contains it by referencing a global category definition in either the .NET Categories service system document or an external resource containing category definitions, or by referencing an identity centric category definition in the content document of the .NET Categories service for a particular puid.

one or many are possible.","The \/myCalendar (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) element encapsulates the content document for this service. This element establishes a global cache scope for the service and contains other root level system attributes for this instance of the service. The \/myCalendar\/@changeNumber (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) changeNumber attribute is designed to facilitate caching of the element and its descendants.

The {startTime, endTime] time window can define any interval: 24 hr period, week, month, or any other user-defined period.","The getCalendarDays method returns the calendaring info of any puid that is specified for which the caller has sufficient privileges. The user's own puid must be specified to retrieve their own information. The getCalendarDays method may be used to retrieve multiple calendar data from other users using <h:key instance=\u201c0\u201d cluster=\u201c0\u201d puid=\u201cxyz\u201d\/> in the SOAP headers provided that puid \u201cxyz\u201d is provisioned on the .NET Calendar server, and provided that the user has been granted access in puid \u201cxyz\u201d's rolelist.","The \/getCalendarDaysRequest\/calendarType (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optionally specifies the calendar type to return, as set forth in the calendar-types table above.

This dateTime also contains the timeZone to retrieve the calendar information in.","The \/getCalendarDaysRequest\/endTime (dateTime minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) field contains the ending time window to retrieve calendar objects. This dateTime also contains the timeZone to retrieve the calendar information in, and needs to be the same timeZone as startTime.","Normally, the recurrence sub-schema, (minus modifiedException and minus deletedExceptionDate components) is returned with each instance of a recurring event, like \u201crecurring-instance\u201d and \u201crecurring-exception\u201d. This allows clients to properly render the recurrence pattern without having to explicitly query the recurring-master. However, because it is heavy on bandwidth, .NET Calendar includes the option to not return this data, via \/getCalendarDaysRequest\/removeRecurrence (boolean minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1).","Upon successful completion of the above method, a response message, myCalendar\/getCalendarDaysResponse, is generated. In the response, calendar events are returned with their recurrence rules expanded into first-class events. These events have aliased PUIDs, logically as part of the same event.

can be seen from the descriptions above, this user has two events in a calendar. One event is recurring every Monday at 8:00 am, and the other is an upcoming event at 1:20 pm.","myCategories","The .NET myCategories service is designed to support a classification model for data within the .NET My Services universe. The classification model is generic and makes very few assumptions about application usage. As a result, the design is minimal and open. This model of categorization will be used by a wide spectrum of applications, without burdening the developer of the service.","The .NET myCategories service manages a list of category definitions. Examples of category definitions include child, anniversary, and employee. Each category definition has a human readable name and a description which contains hints about the meaning of that category. For example, one given category may imply a more general category, while \u201cfriends\u201d implies acquaintances. A category may be classified by using other categories. For example, anniversary and birthday are categorized as specialDate.","Like other .NET My Services, the .NET Categories service exposes a global system document, and an identity centric content document. The global system document is an extension of the standard system document which contains global category definitions available to all .NET My Services applications. The identity-centric content document contains category definitions local to the identity.","Within other .NET My Services, category references are used to mark an XML element as belonging to the group represented by the category definition. The schema of each service defines which nodes (if any) can be categorized. For example, .NET Contacts\/contacts\/address can be categorized, but .NET Calendar\/event\/eventBody cannot. The roleList and system schemas also define nodes that can be categorized. For example, roleList\/role can be categorized.","Categories use a declarative syntax for encoding relationships that an application deems as important. .NET My Services neither provides nor requires any consistency checks or enforcements implied by the semantics of these relationships.","There are two primary elements used to define and reference categories. The catDef element is used to define a category, and the cat element is used to refer to a category. .NET My Services allows the catDef element to appear in the system document of the .NET Categories service, the content document of the .NET Categories service and\/or an arbitrary XML file located by a URI.","The cat element refers to a category definition by absolute or relative URI. The linkage between the two is through the catDef\/@idName attribute and the cat\/@ref attribute. The catDef\/@idName attribute specifies the local id for the category definition, and the cat\/@ref attribute is the value of that reference.","The value of the cat\/@ref attribute may take the following form:\n\n","The category definition being referenced is located in the system document of the .NET Categories service, and its catDef\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-category\u201d. For example, the category reference of <cat ref=\u201csystem#public\u201d\/> is a reference to the category definition whose catDef\/@idName value is \u201cpublic\u201d, and that this category definition is located in the system document of the .NET Categories service i.e. <catDef idName=\u201cpublic\u201d\/>.","The value of the cat\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\n","The category definition being referenced is located in the content document of the .NET Categories service, and its catDef\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-category\u201d. The instance of the .NET Categories service (i.e., the puid of the service) is implied by the context of the reference. This may be made explicit by inserting ?puid=puid-value to the URI, and when this is done, it means the content document of the .NET Categories service whose puid is \u201cpuid-value\u201d holds the category definition. For example, the category reference of <cat ref=\u201ccontent#LaQuintaHouse\u201d\/> is a reference to the category definition whose catDef\/@idName value is \u201cLaQuintaHouse\u201d, and that this category definition is located in the content document of the .NET Categories service for the current puid i.e. <catDef idName=\u201cLaQuintaHouse\u201d\/>.","The value of the cat\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\n","The category definition being referenced is located in an external (to .NET My Services) resource. The \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference refers to a resource containing the catDef element whose @idName attribute matches the \u201cname-of-category\u201d. The mapping between the \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference and an XML document containing the catDef elements is a function of the \u201cany-uri\u201d. By convention, this uri is the name of an XML document containing those elements. The purpose of this reference form is to allow and support a free form set of extended categorizations that are global and available to all. For example, the category reference of <cat ref=\u201chttp:\/\/schemas.cpandl.com\/im\/globalCategories.xml#imBuddy\u201d\/> is a reference to the category definition whose catDef\/@idName value is \u201cimBuddy\u201d, and that this category definition is located in an external resource located at \u201chttp:\/\/schemas.cpandl.com\/im\/globalCategories.xml\u201d. Note that it is expected that category definitions will exist in the appropriate locations, but there is no requirement or enforcement of this.","In the various cases, the mapping between a category reference and the category definition is very simple.\n\n","The myCategories service controls access by using the rt, rt, rt, rt and rt roleTemplates, using the following

To this end, each .NET My Services user has access to a logical contacts document which may contain multiple contact records. In general, the .NET Contacts service thus forms the foundation for an electronic address book, or a set of electronic relationships. This service contains a list of contacts, organized by category, wherein a contact is a schema element containing an identifier (id) for the contact in the .NET My Services id space. A contact has a local name for that contact, a set of categories that the contact belongs to, (distribution list's, groups, and classifications), an address, as defined by the .NET Address schema, and a set of profile information (as defined by a corresponding .NET Profile schema). To this end, the .NET Contacts schema includes at least some of the .NET Profile service information including, but not limited to, name, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, as well as allowing the owner to control how the contacts are categorized.","Contact information stored within .NET Contacts can be derived from the owner's .NET Address and .NET Profile services. For example, if a user X wishes to add someone named Y as a contact in the user's .NET Contacts service, the information used to populate this contact can be queried from user Y's .NET Address and .NET Profile services. User Y's access control mechanisms determine how much information from his or her .NET Address and .NET Profile services are allowed to be seen. From the user's perspective, the user can similarly control visibility of individual contacts and grant various levels access to their list of contacts to applications and other users based on the role templates with respect to each user's relative role. Thus, for example, with the user's consent, an application could populate a selection box with the user's contacts. From this box, the user could select a contact and the application could fill out the \u201cShip To:\u201d fields (name, address, city, state and zip) for the contact automatically, such as when making a gift purchase.","The .NET Contacts service is designed to support live contacts. In this mode of operation, the queries described above that populate a contact happen automatically each time a change occurs in a subscribed-to to contact. This synchronization can be enabled or suppressed on a contact-by-contact basis. Users and applications can negotiate a subscription to another user's Profile document via the LiveContacts mechanism. When subscribed, the informational nodes become read-only for that contact and automatically update when changed by the Profile owner. The user can still control categorization, and notes for the LiveContact entry. The service-to-service communications protocol (SSCP) provides a highly efficient, robust mechanism for such automatic updates, as described below.","myContacts\/Roles","The myContacts service

For instance, a device is classified as a cellPhone through the \u201csystem#callPhone\u201d categorization. Additionally, a device is marked as a primary device through categorization using the \u201csystem#primary\u201d category reference.","A validated device is one that has been digitally signed and certified by some entity. .NET My Services accommodates this by allowing the use of extension elements holding certified digital signatures, or holding references to verification services that may validate a node on the fly.","The \/myDevices\/device\/@changeNumber (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) changeNumber attribute is designed to facilitate caching of the element and its descendants.

References always refer to a specific folder. This means that documents conceptually \u201cexist\u201d within one or more Folders. The traditional \u201cfile name\u201d for the document is unique per reference. References can also specify a time to live. This allows other services to post data to a user's store in a temporary fashion. For example, they can use the user's store to create temp files. If all references have expired, then the document is automatically deleted. However, if any reference exists that has not expired, then all references, including ones that have expired, remain valid. When adding a reference to an existing document, the reference must refer to an existing folder ID, and the name given must be unique within that folder. Updates to references require that any update will leave the name unique within the referencing folder. If the final reference to a document is deleted, then the deletion of the reference results in the deletion of the document and all associated streams.","The \/myDocuments\/document\/ref\/@folderId (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) contains the ID of the folder object that holds this reference to this object.","The \/myDocuments\/document\/ref\/@name (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) contains the name of this document within this reference (folder).","The \/myDocuments\/document\/ref\/@expires (dateTime minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1), when this attribute exists, specifies the number of minutes this reference is valid relative to the last access time for the document.","The \/myDocuments\/document\/ref\/delete (int minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) element, if it exists, specifies an HTTP GET operation to be performed to cleanly delete the reference (this would be placed here by another service which stored data in the .NET Documents service).","The \/myDocuments\/document\/ref\/show (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) element, if it exists, specifies a URL that can be used to render HTML to display the referenced object.

Documents support multiple streams of data. Each stream is stored as a separate object from the document in the .NET My Services content document. Streams have names that must be unique to a given document. When adding a stream, stream names must be unique for a given document. When updating a stream, stream names must be unique within a given document. The null stream can not be renamed. The null stream may not be deleted, while any other stream may be deleted.","The \/myDocuments\/document\/stream\/@name (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute specifies a name for the stream which is unique within this document.

The \/myInbox\/folder (minOccurs=4 maxOccurs=unbounded) folder element in myInbox are containers for messages, although not directly. Messages are related to folders via the \/myInbox\/message\/messageStatus\/folder ref=\u201c\u201d attribute. Folders can be organized hierarchically, although again not directly. Instead, folder containment is modeled using the \/myInbox\/folder\/parentFolder ref=\u201c\u201d attribute. If a folder is deleted, all associated messages, folders and their messages are deleted. It is recommended that instead of deleting a folder directly, it should be moved to the type=\u201cdeleted\u201d folder first. There are four built in types of folders, and these can be identified by four special type element values: \/folder\/type=\u2018inbox\u2019 is the Inbox folder. \/folder\/type=\u2018sent\u2019 is the Sent Items folder. \/folder\/type=\u2018drafts\u2019 is the Drafts folder. \/folder\/type=\u2018deleted\u2019 is the Deleted Items folder. These four special folders will always exist in a provisioned .NET Inbox account, and cannot be deleted or modified. To create user defined folders, the standard .NET My Services insert method can be used, with the type set to \u2018custom\u2019.

Like other .NET My Services, the .NET Lists service allows free-form, name-space qualified extensions to be added to a list, or an item within a list. This mechanism is useful to add semi-structured information to the service with a downside that the service is unable to schema-validate these extensions.","The .NET Lists service breaks down a list into two major components which are the list defined by the list element, and an item defined by the item element.","The list element is designed to contain the definition of a list and serves as an anchor location to which items that belong to that list may refer. Lists may also refer to lists. In any event, the linkage is designed to be a soft linkage so that list definitions may be defined within the confines of the .NET Lists service as well as external to the service. This linkage pattern is that same as the linkage pattern used between element categorization and category definitions as defined in the .NET Category section, above. With this linkage model, the service is able to support personal list definitions in the per-user content document, global list definitions in the shared system document, and external list definitions stored in other addressable resources. The .NET Lists service defines a number of pre-defined lists in the system document. An xpQuery of \/\/sys:list from the .NET Lists service's system document will return these lists.","The item element is designed to represent something that belongs to one or more lists. An item may be categorized (personal, private, sports, and so on) using standard .NET My Services categorization techniques, must have a title, an optional full description, may contain external references via the URL namespace, may be associated or \u201cassigned\u201d to another user, and so on. As noted above, an item refers to a list element, and may in fact refer to multiple list elements. There are however no referential integrity checks made through these references because as will be seen, some will likely use the reference itself as an implicit definition of a list element and in some cases, that element may not exist or may be inaccessible.","An item associates itself with one or more lists by using the listRef element and specifying a relative or absolute URI in the listRef\/@ref attribute. The URI is able to refer to a list element by name where the list element is physically stored in the system document of the .NET Lists service, the content document of the .NET Lists service and\/or an arbitrary XML file located by URI containing list elements.","The listRef element refers to a list definition by absolute or relative URI. The linkage between the two is through the list\/@idName attribute and the listRef\/@ref attribute. The list\/@idName attribute specifies the local id for the list definition, and the listRef\/@ref attribute is the value of that reference.","The value of the listRef\/@ref attribute may take the form:\n\n","The list definition being referenced is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201csystem#todo\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201ctodo\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service i.e. <list idName=\u201ctodo\u201d\/>.","The value of the listRef\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\n","The list definition being referenced is located in the content document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. The instance of the .NET Lists service (i.e., the puid of the service) is implied by the context of the reference. This may be made explicit by inserting ?puid=puid-value to the URI, and when this is done, it means the content document of the .NET Lists service whose puid is \u201cpuid-value\u201d holds the list definition. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201ccontent#bellSqaureShopping\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the content document of the .NET Lists service for the current puid i.e. <list idName=\u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d\/>.","The value of the listRef\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\n","The category list being referenced is located in an external (to .NET My Services) resource. The \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference refers to a resource containing the list element whose @idName attribute matches the \u201cname-of-list\u201d. The mapping between the \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference and an XML document containing the list elements is a function of the \u201cany-uri\u201d.

The \/myLists\/item\/description\/@dir (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute specifies the base direction of directionally neutral text. Possible values include rtl (right to left), or ltr (left to right).","The \/myLists\/item\/url (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) optional element specifies a URL associated with this list item.","The \/myLists\/item\/listRef (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=unbounded) element specifies the lists that this item is considered contained within.","The \/myLists\/item\/listRef\/@ref (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute contains the name of a list element encoded as a URI. The URI follows encoding rules similar to those used in cat\/catDef linkage:\n\n","The list (definition) being referenced is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. For example, the listRef of <listRef ref=\u201csystem#todo\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201ctodo\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service i.e. <list name=\u201ctodo\u201d\/>.\n\n","The list definition being referenced is located in the content document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. The instance of the .NET Lists service (i.e., the puid of the service) is implied by the context of the reference. This may be made explicit by inserting ?puid=puid-value to the URI, and when this is done, it means the content document of the .NET Lists service whose puid is \u201cpuid-value\u201d holds the list definition. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201ccontent#bellSqareShopping\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the content document of the .NET List service for the current puid i.e. <list name=\u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d\/>.\n\n","The list definition being referenced is located in an external (to .NET My Services) resource. The \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference refers to a resource containing the list element whose @idName attribute matches the \u201cname-of-list\u201d. The mapping between the \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference and an XML document containing the list elements is a function of the \u201cany-uri\u201d. By convention, this uri is the name of an XML document containing those elements. The purpose of this reference form is to allow and support a free form set of extended list definitions that are global and available to all. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201chttp:\/\/schemas.xyz.com\/im\/globalLists.xml#xyzStuff\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201cxyzStuff\u201d, and that this list definition is located in an external resource located at \u201chttp:\/\/schemas.xyz.com\/im\/globalLists.xml\u201d. Note that it is expected that list definitions will exist in the appropriate locations, but there is no requirement or enforcement of this.","The \/myLists\/item\/listRef\/@order (int minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute contains an optional numeric order for the containing item relative to this list. Since an item (or even a list) may logically be contained within multiple lists, the order of the item is attached to the list reference so that an item's order can vary based on the list that it is contained within.","The \/myLists\/item\/date (dateTime minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) optional element specifies a categorized date\/time for this item. A single optional category reference may be attached to the date. It is expected that system defined dates like \u201csystem#dueDate\u201d will be used, but this is not meant to be limiting.","The \/myLists\/item\/date\/@ref (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute is a reference to an existing category for this date. For instance, a value of \u201csystem#dueDate\u201d implies that this date is a due date.","The \/myLists\/item\/status (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) status value for an item indicates the optional status of that item. This element's value is coded as a category reference and follows the same rules as found in the usage of cat\/@ref. The value may reference a category in the myCategories system document, a private status value in the user's myCategories content document, or an external category definition. It is expected that pre-defined system category values in the \u201csystem#status\u201d category will be used and this would mean that expected values for this element include system#notStarted, system#inProgress, system#completed, system#waiting and system#defered.","A node select of \u201c\/\/sys:catDef[hs:cat[@ref=\u2018system#status\u2019]\u201d will locate all definitions for system defined status values.","The \/myLists\/item\/priority (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) contains a priority value for an item indicates the optional importance, or priority of that item. This elements value is coded as a category reference and follows the same rules as found in the usage of cat\/@ref. The value may reference a category in the myCategories system document, a private priority value in the user's myCategories content document, or an external category definition. It is expected that pre-defined system category values in the \u201csystem#priority\u201d category will be used and this would mean that expected values for this element include system#lowest, system#belowNormal, system#normal, system#aboveNormal and system#highest.","A node select of \u201c\/\/sys:catDef[hs:cat[@ref=\u2018system#priority\u2019]\u201d will locate all definitions for system defined priority values.","The \/myLists\/item\/assignedTo (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) optional element may be repeated and specifies who the item is \u201cassigned\u201d to. It is most useful when sharing a list in myLists.","The \/myLists\/item\/assignedTo\/name (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional element specifies the name for the enclosing element. The \/myLists\/item\/assignedTo\/name\/@xml:lang (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) required attribute is used to specify an ISO 639 language code or an ISO 3166 country code as described in RFC 1766. The value of this attribute indicates the language type of the content within this element. The \/myLists\/item\/assignedTo\/name\/@dir (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute specifies the default layout direction for the localized string. Valid values are rtl (right to left), and ltr (left to right).","The \/myLists\/item\/assignedTo\/puid (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional element specifies the name for the enclosing element. The \/myLists\/item\/assignedTo\/email (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional name specifies an email address for the enclosing element. The \/myLists\/item\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) and \/myLists\/list\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) allows for extensibility of this schema.","The \/myLists\/subscription (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) element defines a subscription node as described above in the subscription section.","The following table illustrates the structure and contents of a simple \u201ctripList\u201d list.

The \/system\/list\/listRef (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) element specifies the lists that this item is considered contained within. Note that it is valid to have a free-form list item that is not considered to be in part of any list which is why this element is minOccurs=0.","The \/system\/list\/listRef\/@ref (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute contains the name of a list element encoded as a URI. The URI follows encoding rules similar to those used in cat\/catDef linkage:\n\n","The list (definition) being referenced is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. For example, the listRef of <listRef ref=\u201csystem#todo\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201ctodo\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service i.e. <list name=\u201ctodo\u201d\/>.\n\n","The list definition being referenced is located in the content document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. The instance of the .NET Lists service (i.e., the puid of the service) is implied by the context of the reference. This may be made explicit by inserting ?puid=puid-value to the URI, and when this is done, it means the content document of the .NET Lists service whose puid is \u201cpuid-value\u201d holds the list definition. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201ccontent#bellSqareShopping\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the content document of the .NET List service for the current puid i.e. <list name=\u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d\/>.\n\n","The list definition being referenced is located in an external (to .NET My Services) resource. The \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference refers to a resource containing the list element whose @idName attribute matches the \u201cname-of-list\u201d. The mapping between the \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference and an XML document containing the list elements is a function of the \u201cany-uri\u201d. By convention, this uri is the name of an XML document containing those elements. The purpose of this reference form is to allow and support a free form set of extended list definitions that are global and available to all. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201chttp:\/\/schemas.xyz.com\/im\/globalLists.xml#xyzStuff\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201cxyzStuff\u201d, and that this list definition is located in an external resource located at \u201chttp:\/\/schemas.xyz.com\/im\/globalLists.xml\u201d. Note that it is expected that list definitions will exist in the appropriate locations, but there is no requirement or enforcement of this.","The \/system\/list\/listRef\/@order (int minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute contains an optional numeric order for the containing item relative to this list. Since an item (or even a list) may logically be contained within multiple lists, the order of the item is attached to the list reference so that an item's order can vary based on the list that it is contained within.","The \/system\/list\/title (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) element specifies the title of the list. The \/system\/list\/title\/@xml:lang (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) required attribute is used to specify an ISO 639 language code or an ISO 3166 country code as described in RFC 1766. The value of this attribute indicates the language type of the content within this element. Te\/system\/list\/title\/@dir (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute specifies the default layout direction for the localized string. Valid values are rtl (right to left), and ltr (left to right).","The \/system\/list\/description (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) element specifies a more detailed description of the list. The \/system\/list\/description\/@xml:lang (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) required attribute is used to specify an ISO 639 language code or an ISO 3166 country code as described in RFC 1766. The value of this attribute indicates the language type of the content within this element. The \/system\/list\/description\/@dir (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute specifies the base direction of directionally neutral text. Possible values include rtl (right to left), or ltr (left to right).","The \/system\/list\/status (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) contains a status value for a list the optional status of that list. This elements value is coded as a category reference and follows the same rules as found in the usage of cat\/@ref. The value may reference a category in the myCategories system document, a private status value in the user's myCategories content document, or an external category definition. It is expected that pre-defined system category values in the \u201csystem#status\u201d category will be used and this would mean that expected values for this element include, system#notStarted, system#inProgress, system#completed, system#waiting and system#defered.","A node select of \u201c\/\/sys:catDef[hs:cat[@ref=\u2018system#status\u2019]\u201d will locate all definitions for system defined status values.","The \/system\/list\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) and \/system\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) fields provide extensibility as discussed above.","myPresence","The .NET Presence service (myPresence) provides a generalized framework for clients to publish and subscribe to presence information about the endpoint of a specific user, wherein a client is any entity that can issue an XMI request to myPresence. The myPresence service also provides for a way of classifying the information in multiple contexts. Note that subscriptions (described above) may be made on endpoints, which will generate a notification whenever a change occurs that satisfies the query of the notification.","An endpoint has no strict semantics within .NET Presence. It is a typology for classifying different forms of presence information, but .NET Presence is not aware of the semantics of endpoints, so any restrictions and classifications are outside the scope of the service itself. Some of the potential types of endpoints include instant messaging presence services (e.g., MSN Messenger), device-oriented presence (mobile phones, pagers), physical location presence (GPS, directory, and so on), and integrated presence (obtained by joining other endpoints). Again, no semantics are exposed for any of these endpoints at the core level of .NET Presence.","The semantics of a given endpoint are exposed through one or more argots. An argot identifies a type of domain-specific schema through which the presence of an endpoint is represented. Since the presence semantics are entirely contained within argots, consumers of presence information can only understand presence information to the extent that they understand the argots in which that information is represented. In other words, argots are tagged blobs of information that applications know how to interpret, at least in part, so as to exchange presence-related data, (although a given application may not know anything about a particular argot and will simply not interpret that argot). Note that in an alternative implementation, argots may be implemented in tagged \u201cany\u201d fields of XML blobs.","In general, argots can be application-specific. With an application-specific argot, the argot's schema is understood by a limited set of applications, containing data that is only meaningful to those applications. Argots can instead be common, wherein the argot's schema is known by many applications. Common argots contain more generalized presence and communications data. An argot can also be integrated, wherein the argot's schema is common and expresses information about multiple endpoints.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1219","num":"1261"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","602","604","606","608","608","606"]},"Likewise, a Messenger endpoint  is using a Messenger argot  and a common Presence argot , as well as expressing its data in a standardized (e.g., SIP) argot .","The myPresence service employs the above-described subscription schema to allow users of the schema to receive timely updates on changes to presence information.
