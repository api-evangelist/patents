{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/922,700, filed Dec. 31, 2013, and entitled \u201cRESTRAINT SYSTEM PRETENSIONERS,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The following disclosure is directed generally to the field of personal restraints for use in vehicles and, more particularly, to the field of restraint system pretensioners for use in military land vehicles, air vehicles, and other vehicles.","Military land vehicles generally have a three-, four-, or five-point seat\/shoulder belt or harness in one or more of the vehicle seats. Civilian vehicles generally have a three-point shoulder belt\/lap belt harness. To minimize or reduce injury during a collision or rollover, both military and civilian vehicles have used seat harness pretensioners. In a typical pretensioner, sensors on the vehicle detect the acceleration and\/or deceleration forces of a collision or rollover, causing the pretensioners to actuate. The pretensioners then tighten up the seat harness around the seated passenger or driver milliseconds before the actual full impact or rollover. The tightened harness holds the passenger securely into the seat, reducing impact and rebound injuries. These existing pretensioners can be relatively complicated designs because they rely on pyrotechnic devices or electric motors operating a belt retractor, each controlled by an electronic trigger.","Many military land vehicles are designed to resist the destructive forces of mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). These explosive devices create unique risks for military land vehicles. Detonation of a large explosive device can generate forces on the vehicle exceeding 100 g, causing the vehicle to accelerate violently upwardly. To reduce the forces on the vehicle crew during a detonation, some military vehicles, such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle (MRAP), have blast attenuating seats. Blast attenuating seats are often supported on shock absorbing materials or are mounted on a shock absorbing structure, such as a stroking device, that allows the seat to move downwardly during a blast.","Conventional harness pretensioning techniques are generally impractical with these types of blast attenuating seats, because the seats move relative to the vehicle body during the blast and the acceleration is largely vertical, rather than horizontal. In addition, conventional harness pretensioning systems typically use pyrotechnic devices, electric retractor motors, or electronic sensors, which can be complicated and costly.","In addition to land vehicles, passengers in helicopters are subjected to similar types of extreme forces during crashes or hard landings. Some helicopters also have seats mounted on a stroking device. The challenges presented in harness pretensioning with blast attenuation seats are also present in helicopter seats mounted on stroking devices.","The present disclosure describes various embodiments of restraint system pretensioners for use with personal restraint systems in land, air, and sea vehicles. In one embodiment, for example, a seat unit for use in a land vehicle or helicopter includes a stroking device that enables the seat to move relative to the vehicle in response to an explosion or hard landing. The seat unit also includes a tensioning web or belt that is integral with a harness that extends around the seat occupant. Movement of the seat relative to the vehicle in response to sudden movement of the vehicle caused by an explosion or hard landing causes the tensioning belt to automatically pretension the seat harness. The various embodiments described herein can include devices, components or features that are at least generally similar to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,469,401, entitled \u201cSEAT HARNESS PRETENSIONER,\u201d filed May 17, 2011; U.S. Pat. No. 8,649,400, entitled \u201cSEAT HARNESS PRETENSIONER,\u201d filed Feb. 23, 2010; and U.S. Patent Application No. 61\/154,731, entitled \u201cSEAT HARNESS PRETENSIONER,\u201d filed Feb. 23, 2009; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","Certain details are set forth in the following description and in  to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Other details describing well-known structures and systems often associated with vehicle seats, seat stroking devices, web retractors, seat harnesses, and other personal restraint devices. have not been set forth in the following disclosure to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the present disclosure.","Many of the details, dimensions, angles, and other features shown in the Figures are merely illustrative of particular embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly, other embodiments can add other details, dimensions, angles, and features without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that further embodiments of the invention can be practiced without several of the details described below. In the Figures, identical reference numbers identify identical, or at least generally similar, elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","100","110","10","110","112","110","10","10"]},"As discussed above, stroking devices generally allow a seat to move downwardly during an impact. In some embodiments, however, stroking devices such as the stroking mechanism  can be configured to permit the seat  to be movable in other directions, such as fore and aft, side to side, or any combination thereof. The stroking mechanism  accordingly may be attached to the back, the bottom, or even the sides of the seat . In addition, some blast resistant seats configured in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure can be suspended within the vehicle . The pretensioners shown in the drawings and described herein may be used with virtually any such type of blast resistant seat.","The pretensioner assembly  can include a loading mechanism  and locking retractors  (identified individually as a first locking retractor and a second locking retractor ), all of which can be mounted to the seat . Although referred to herein as the locking retractors , as further described below, the locking retractors  can provide for pretensioning and\/or locking. The assembly  can also include a restraint harness  having shoulder straps . The restraint harness  can be mounted to the seat  and operably coupled to the retractors . The harness  extends upward from the retractors  and the shoulder straps  pass over a top of the seat . In several embodiments, the shoulder straps  can be integrated with other portions of the harness . For example, in some embodiments, the shoulder straps  can be coupled to a lap belt portion  of the harness .","The assembly  can also include pretensioning cable assemblies  and locking cable assemblies  that can operably couple the loading mechanism  to the retractors . The pretensioning cable assemblies  and the locking cable assemblies  can be constructed in a variety of suitable manners to transmit motion from the loading mechanism  to the retractors . In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the pretensioning cable assemblies  and the locking cable assemblies  are Bowden cable assemblies that each include an outer cable guide or housing and an internal cable. The loading mechanism  includes a pivotable arm  having a first end portion  and a second end portion . The arm  rotates about a pivot  having an axis B that is generally parallel with a base of the seat  and perpendicular to the stroking motion of the seat . The first end portion  is positioned to contact a fixed portion  of the vehicle , and the second end portion  is coupled to a pulley  that is in operable engagement with the pretensioning cable assemblies . The fixed portion  does not move relative to the vehicle  when the seat  moves up and down via the stroking mechanism .","As described in greater detail below, when the seat  moves downward relative to the vehicle , the fixed portion  urges the first end portion  to pivot upwardly, and the second end portion  moves downwardly with the pulley . The downward motion of the pulley  pulls on the pretensioning cable assemblies  causing retraction of the shoulder straps  into the retractors . The downward motion of the second end portion  transmits a pushing force on the locking cable assemblies , locking the retractors  and preventing outward extension of the shoulder straps .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B"],"b":["110","100","110","100","110","10","130","10","110","130","126","124","124","134","124","128","132"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIGS. 3B and 3C","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3C"],"b":["114","132","302","120","3","3","3","3","114","304","124","128","124","304","305","307","304","122","122","116","116","118"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["116","116","406","408","116","408","406","118","118","118","116","402","404","404","116","122","116","122"]},"The pretensioning portion  can include a hub  that can be rotatably positioned on the shaft . A plurality of ratchets  having pins  are positioned at least partially within the hub  and can releasably engage with teeth  of a gear  on the shaft , as described in more detail below. The pretensioning cable assemblies  () can include an internal pretensioning cable , a portion of which wraps around the hub . The shaft  extends through a locking plate  having a tab . A portion of the internal cable  can extend downward through a cable opening  in the tab  and into the external guide of the pretensioning cable assembly  (). In response to downward motion of the pulley  (), a portion of the internal cable  is pulled downward through the cable opening , unwinding at least a portion of the internal cable  from the hub , and thereby rotating the hub  and the associated ratchets  about the axis E in the direction of arrow G. The rotation of the ratchets  around the shaft  in the direction of arrow G causes the ratchets  to engage with the shaft , resulting in corresponding rotation of the shaft  in the direction of arrow G to retract the shoulder straps , as described in more detail below. A cover  can be positioned to at least partially enclose several of the components of the pretensioning portion .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["410","414","410","502","502","506","414","410","408","412","502","414","413","414","504","413","414","508","502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":["418","418","602","408","602","606","408","602","602","604","602","604","608","610","410","408","414","502","416","414","604","606"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7A","FIG. 4"],"b":["116","414","408","502","10","414","416","604","504","413","502","702","508","414","702","414","502","408","406","118"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIGS. 2B, 4, 5, 7A and 7B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 7A"],"b":["116","10","110","10","424","426","410","414","408","414","416","608","416","606","414","502","414","502","504","413","410","408","416","606","414","502","504","413","410","424","416","606","504","413","408","406","406","118","117"]},"In some embodiments configured in accordance with the present technology, the pretensioner assembly  can be reset to allow for pretensioning in a second event that follows a first or initial pretensioning event. For example, after a first event that pretensions the restraint harness , and when the retractor  is no longer locked via the locking cable assemblies , the shoulder straps  can be paid out via rotation of the shaft  in the direction of arrow F. In particular, when the ratchet teeth  are engaged with the gear teeth  (as shown in ), rotation of the shaft  in the direction of arrow F can push the gear teeth  against the ratchet teeth . The exertion of the gear teeth  includes a component of force that pushes the ratchets  outwardly, pushing the pins  against the sidewalls of the opening . While the pins  are in between the recesses , the pins  are maintained in the track  by the sidewalls of the opening . When the pins advance to a position adjacent to the recesses , the pins  move outwardly and are caught by the catch portions . The catch portions  engage the pins  (as shown in ), rotating the ratchets  within the ratchet pockets  () to disengage the teeth  from the gear . These and\/or other steps may be performed to prepare the pretensioner assembly  and the seat  for a subsequent or second pretensioning event.","Although the components and features of the embodiments illustrated in  are shown in various arrangements and positions, other configurations of the components and features of the present technology are within the scope of the disclosure. For example, although particular embodiments described herein include three ratchets arranged around a shaft, alternative embodiments may include more or fewer ratchets. Similarly, the shapes and sizes of the ratchets, the ratchet pockets, and\/or other components can be altered and still fall within the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, the positioning of components described with respect to particular embodiments herein may be altered in alternative embodiments. For example, locking retractors in accordance with the present technology may have gears that are positioned internal to a shaft. Moreover, the gears may be integral with a shaft, or they may be operably coupled to a shaft. While the pretensioner assemblies described herein include ratchets, hubs, and various other components, pretensioner assemblies in accordance with the present technology can include additional and\/or fewer components arranged in a variety of suitable configurations.","From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the various embodiments of the invention. Additionally, aspects of the invention described in the context of particular embodiments may be combined or eliminated in other embodiments. Furthermore, while various advantages associated with certain embodiments of the invention have been described above in the context of those embodiments, other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages, and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages to fall within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited, except as by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIGS. 3B and 3C","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
