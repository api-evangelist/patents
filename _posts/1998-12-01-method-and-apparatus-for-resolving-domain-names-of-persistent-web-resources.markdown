title: Method and apparatus for resolving domain names of persistent web resources
abstract: A method and apparatus are disclosed for providing persistent storage of Web resources. Uniform Resource Locators (“URLs”) that identify Web resources are augmented to include a time stamp. A web browser and a web server are disclosed that accommodate a time stamp parameter and allow a user to refer to any Web address with a precise target date. The disclosed Web browser can optionally include a mechanism to facilitate the specification of the desired date and time, or the user can manually append the time stamp to the URL indicated in the “Location” window of the browser. The persistent Web servers (i) receive URLs containing a time stamp, (ii) extract the time stamp, (iii) retrieve the correct Web page from the archive, and (iv) return the requested page to the client. The persistent Web servers include a persistent archive for storing all of the versions of Web resources that will be persistently available to Web users. A persistent domain name server (PDNS) allows a user to refer to historical Web resources. The persistent domain name server (PDNS) utilizes the dated URL to determine where the historical information of a given company is located following a domain name change for the requested time period and translates the request to a new machine containing the historical information of the company.

No. 09\/201,752, entitled \u201cA Method And Apparatus For Persistent Storage of Web Resources,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/201,751, entitled \u201cA Method And Apparatus For Persistent Access to Web Resources,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/201,750, entitled \u201cA Method And Apparatus For Persistent Access to Web Resources Using Relative Time-Stamps,\u201d each filed contemporaneously herewith, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to Internet resource access techniques, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for ensuring persistent access to Internet resources.","The World Wide Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d) provides a dynamic way to present and distribute a vast amount of information. Anyone who is connected to the Internet and has a browser, such as Netscape Navigator Communicator\u2122, commercially available from Netscape Communications Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., can access information on the Web. The Web provides users with many media options and is becoming ubiquitously available in an expanding variety of personal electronic devices, far beyond its initial limited availability to users via computer terminals. In addition, as display technologies continue to improve, the Web may ultimately replace traditional paper-based media altogether.","Paper-based media generally have an associated time stamp, and permit an easy determination of the information that was available at a given time. For example, a newspaper article can be cited as an authoritative reference, provided that the particular date of the newspaper publication is specified. Due to the dynamic nature of Web content, however, a Web document is generally not a reliable reference source. Currently, Web content cannot reliably be expected to be available in the same form and addressed by the same Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) at a future time. While some Web sites may provide access to some archived Web documents, the historical Web documents may not be accessed by users in a consistent and predictable manner, if at all.","The Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (\u201cOCLC\u201d), a nonprofit computer library service and research organization, provides a software tool, referred to as OCLC PURL (\u201cPersistent Uniform Resource Locator\u201d), for managing Internet addresses and aliases for general Internet resources. A Persistent Uniform Resource Locator provides flexible naming and name resolution services for Internet resources to ensure reliable, long-term access to Internet resources with minimal maintenance. Generally, OCLC PURL assists Internet users in locating Web resources. As previously indicated, the Internet is constantly expanding and changing. Once a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) changes, all previous references to that URL become invalid, thereby preventing users from accessing the Internet resource. The management of these changes often becomes burdensome.","While a URL points directly to the location of an Internet resource, a PURL points to an intermediate resolution service, which translates the PURL into the actual URL. Once a Web resource has been registered with the OCLC and assigned a PURL, the Web resource may be accessed by means of the PURL. A PURL assigns a persistent name to a resource even if the location of the resource changes. In this manner, PURLs referenced in Web documents and other resources can remain viable over time without having to update the references each time the Web resource is moved. The PURL \u201cforwarding\u201d address maintained by OCLC, however, must be kept up-to-date. In other words, each time the document is moved, OCLC must be notified of the new address for the document.","Generally, a method and apparatus are disclosed for providing persistent access to Web resources. According to an aspect of the invention, the Uniform Resource Locators (\u201cURLs\u201d) that identify Web resources are optionally augmented to include a time stamp. The time stamp can be specified in the Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) in any suitable format. The present invention allows the Web to be an organized and reliable reference source, much like paper-based media.","A web browser and a web server are disclosed that accommodate a time stamp parameter and allow a user to refer to any Web address with a precise target time. The disclosed Web browser can optionally include a mechanism to facilitate the specification of the desired date and time, or the user can manually append the time stamp to the URL indicated in the \u201cLocation\u201d window of the browser. The persistent Web server (i) receives URLs containing a time stamp, (ii) retrieves the correct Web page from an archive, and (iii) returns the requested page to the client. The persistent Web server interprets the extracted URL in accordance with the selected time stamp format. In addition, the persistent Web servers include a persistent archive for storing all of the versions of Web resources that will be persistently available to Web users.","According to a farther aspect of the invention, a persistent domain name server (PDNS) allows a user to refer to historical Web resources, for example, following a corporate merger or domain name change. If company A is merged into company B, all the web pages referred through \u201cwww.A.com\u201d may no longer be valid. In accordance with the present invention, the persistent domain name server (PDNS) utilizes the dated URL to determine where the historical information of company A is located for the requested time period and translates the request to a new machine containing the historical information of company A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","140","150","130","100","140","150"]},"The time stamp can be included in the Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) in any suitable format, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill. For example, to refer to the web page, www.Lucent.com, as it existed on Feb. 2, 1998, the URL can be represented as:","http:\/\/www.lucent.com?time=2+2+1998.","In a further variation, additional time granularity can be indicated by including the time-of-day in the URL. For example, the web page, www.Lucent.com, as it existed at 1:23 p.m. on Feb. 2, 1998, the URL can be represented as:","http:\/\/www.lucent.com?time=13+23+2+2+1998.","Unless otherwise specified, the time zone is assumed to be the user's default time zone. The illustrative time stamp format described above is a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) search argument. Of course, the month, day and year (or other time units) can be expressed in any order. For a URL without a time stamp, the default value will be the most recent version.","In addition, relative time stamps can be utilized. For example, to refer to the web page, www.Lucent.com, as it existed yesterday, the URL can be represented as:","http:\/\/www.lucent.com?time=yesterday.","Furthermore, if an embedded hyperlink contains a relative time stamp, the relative time stamp is based on the current web page. Thus, if a current web page has a URL in the form:","http:\/\/www.lucent.com?time=1998110","and this page contains an embedded hyperlink in the form:","http:\/\/www.lucent.com?time=yesterday","The browser and server will interpret and translate the URL as","http:\/\/www.lucent.com?rtime=199819.","Other relative time stamps can include time offsets from the time of the current web page, such as plus or minus a specified period of time. For example, \u201c+10D\u201d can indicate plus ten days to the time of the currently viewed web page.","In order to refer to the previous or subsequent archived version of a document (relative to the time stamp of the current document), the URL can be represented using the labels \u201cnext_archive,\u201d or \u201cprevious_archive.\u201d The server will search through the archive to find the required document. For example, if a currently viewed document has a URL in the form:","http:\/\/www.lucent.com\/doc.html?rtime=1997512","and there are different versions of the same document archived on Jul. 2, 1997, Jun. 1, 1997, Apr. 1, 1997 and Mar. 1, 1997. The following link can be used in the current document to refer to one of these archives:","doc.html?rtime=next_archive","These relative archive time stamps make moving between different version of the same documents more efficient.","In an alternate implementation, referred to herein as the \u201crequest-header scheme,\u201d the time stamp can be indicated as one of the HTTP request headers, such as:","Time-Stamp: Jun. 9, 1998.","In another embodiment, referred to herein as the \u201cspecial character scheme,\u201d special characters can be utilized to indicate the inclusion of a time stamp in the URL, such as:","http:\/\/www.cnnfn.com;time=2+2+1998&timezone=server.","The Web browser  may be embodied as a conventional browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122 or Netscape Navigator\u2122, as modified herein to incorporate the features and functions of the present invention. As discussed further below, the Web browser  only needs to incorporate a new options selection panel to permit the user to specify the desired date and time. In fact, a conventional Web browser  can be utilized, with the user manually appending the time stamp to the URL indicated in the \u201cLocation\u201d window of the browser .","In one implementation, the user has the option to turn the time stamp on or off. If the time stamp is activated, the browser  will change the URL accordingly before sending the URL out to the Web . Since there is no guarantee that the corresponding web server ,  recognizes a time stamp, the document returned by the server ,  might contain embedded hyperlinks that do not contain time stamps. Thus, in this situation, the web browser  can automatically convert the URL associated with an embedded hyperlink to add an appropriate time stamp when the user clicks on the hyperlink if the time stamp option is activated. The Web browser  should convert the URL in accordance with the selected time stamp format. In a request-header-scheme implementation, the browser  should be modified to send the special request header (\u201cTime-Stamp: Jun. 9, 1998\u201d). In addition, the HTML should be modified to include a new time stamp tag for any embedded hyperlink with a specific time stamp. For example, for a hyperlink such as:","<A HREF=\u201cwww.lucent.com\u201d>Lucent Web Site<\/A>","the HTML should be modified to indicate the time stamp of Feb. 2, 1998 as follows:","<A HREF=\u201cwww.lucent.com\u201d><TIMESTAMP TIME=\u201c2+2+1998\u201d","TIMEZONE=server><\/TIMESTAMP>Lucent Web Site<\/A>.","The persistent Web servers ,  may be embodied as conventional hardware and software, as modified herein to carry out the functions and operations described below. Specifically, the persistent Web servers ,  need to know how to (i) receive URLs containing a time stamp, (ii) extract the time stamp, (iii) retrieve the correct Web page from the archive, and (iv) return the requested page to the client. The persistent Web servers ,  should interpret the extracted URL in accordance with the selected time stamp format. If a version of the Web resource corresponding to the requested time does not exist, the present invention assumes the Web resource has not changed from the previous archived version, and the version of the Web resource with the most recent time preceeding the requested time is provided.","In addition, the persistent Web servers ,  need to preserve all the information in their history of serving the Web. Thus, as shown in , each persistent Web server, such as the servers , , includes a persistent archive , , respectively, for storing all of the versions of Web resources that will be persistently available to Web users. The persistent archives ,  may be embodied as any storage device, although a persistent (non-erasable) storage device such as CD-ROM, CR-R, WORM or DVD-ROM may be preferred.","For the persistent Web servers ,  to support dated URLs, the persistent Web servers ,  need to store all of their contents in a chronicle fashion to enable the retrieval of timely information. In one implementation, shown in , the persistent archives ,  store the entire web site contents on permanent storage devices according to some sort of chronological directory structure.  shows a directory structure  that arranges the contents of the Web site chronologically. Thus, each leaf, such as the leaf , in the directory structure  corresponds to a dated URL. For example, a dated URL such as:","http:\/\/www.nytimes.com?time=24+2+1998","is conceptually equivalent to:","http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/archive\/1998\/2\/24\/.","Of course, storing the entire web site contents is inefficient in terms of storage usage. Many Web pages exhibit few, if any, changes from day to day. Thus, significant storage efficiencies can be achieved by simply removing redundancy in the archive. Once the redundancy is removed, the storage requirement in addition to the regular web site storage is usually not very large.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","145","155","220","200","300","310","310","145","155","330"]},"If, however, it is determined during step  that there exists a subdirectory B that is created earlier and has identical contents as subdirectory A, then subdirectory A becomes an alias during step  pointing to subdirectory B. For example, as shown in , if the current contents of a Web site is identical to the contents of the previous day, an alias is created for today pointing to yesterday's subdirectory. Likewise, as shown in , if the current month's content is the same as the contents of the previous month, an alias is created for this month pointing to last month's subdirectory.","Thereafter, a test is performed during step  for each file, such as file A, to determine whether there exists a file B that is created earlier and has identical contents as file A. If it is determined during step  that there is no file B created earlier and having identical contents as file A, then it is not possible to reduce the redundancy of the persistent archive ,  on the file level. Thus, program control terminates during step .","If, however, it is determined during step  that there exists a file B that is created earlier and has identical contents as file A, then file A becomes an alias during step  pointing to file B. Thereafter, program control terminates during step .","The archival process  may be impractical, since it needs to search for match files or directories. The run time increases exponentially with the number of entities in the archive. Many sub-optimal solutions are possible, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. A very simple solution is just checking what you want to archive today against the most recently added archive (like yesterday's contents). Since most of the web sites only differ from their previous archived ones slightly, this approach is quite reasonable. This approach is similar to the well-known incremental backup of a file system.","If a Web server is not persistent, it should only have minimal impact. In one embodiment, if a request includes a time stamp that is not recognized by a Web server, the server should deliver the most recent version of the requested Web resource.","Another way to reduce storage requirements of the persistent archive is to make the Web server smarter in terms of searching the correct archived data. For example, persistent storage of a web resource can be limited to versions that have some difference relative to previously saved versions of the web resource. For example, if an illustrative archive contains the following five different versions of a web resource: Jun. 4, 1996, Jun. 12, 1996, Mar. 23, 1997, Feb. 1, 1998 and Feb. 3, 1998, the web server assumes that if the requested date does not equal any of the archived versions, then the requested date is identical to the version with the closest earlier date. In addition, a special symbolic link (or alias on MacOS, short cut on MS Windows) can be used in a directory to represent where to looks for files or directories that are not found under the current directory. In this manner, only the changed parts are stored under appropriate directories. All the unchanged data can be referred through a chain of such special links.","The persistent domain name server (DNS) may be embodied as conventional hardware and software, as modified herein to carry out the functions and operations described below. Conventional DNS servers will reject any domain name reference which is not in the DNS database. One benefit of dated URL in accordance with the present invention is that it can be used to refer to historical Web resources. For example, if company A is merged into company B, all the web pages referred through \u201cwww.A.com\u201d may no longer be valid. For users who want to access some documents from company A, they need to change all the reference to some place in company B's web site.","The historical information of company A can still be accessed if the DNS server does not reject the name reference, but instead consults an archive service company that knows where the historical information of company A is located. The DNS server itself can also store some historical data to resolve the name to IP address process faster.  provide examples of data stored in a DNS server database before and after the merger of companies A and B, respectively. As shown in , if a user wants to find www.A.com after the merger, the DNS server has enough information to redirect the user's request to a new IP address associated with company B. The dates listed in the database are the valid periods for the corresponding domain name. Thus, a dated domain name reference like \u201cwww.A.com 2\/2\/1999\u201d is invalid, while \u201cwww.A.com 2\/2\/1992\u201d is valid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","600","610","620","620","630"]},"If, however, it is determined during step  that the domain name request is dated, the DNS server process  searches the DNS database for the domain name with the date constraint during step . A further test is performed during step  to determine if the dated domain name is found. If it is determined during step  that the dated domain name is not found, then the DNS server consults with an archive service company during step  for further searching before program control proceeds to step .","If, however, it is determined during step  that the dated domain name is not found, then the searching result and indication, if redirect, are returned during step , before program control terminates.","After the domain name is resolved by the DNS server, the Web browser  needs to send the request to the web server ,  according to what is returned from the DNS server. For example, a request from the user for the following URL, \u201chttp:\/\/www.A.com?time=2+2+1992,\u201d will cause the browser  to send a domain name resolving request to the DNS server in a format such as \u201cwww.A.com 2\/2\/1992.\u201d Since company A is now part of company B, the results will look like \u201c123.2.3.222 redirect.\u201d The Web browser  now has the IP address of the server and also knows it is a redirect one. Thus, the Web browser  will effectively send a request to the Web server ,  of Company B in a form such as \u201chttp:\/\/123.2.3.222?http:\/\/www.A.com&time=2+2+1992.\u201d The Web server ,  of Company B will know how to map this old address of company A's to the appropriate place and get the correct information.","One side benefit of this new DNS server is that some names can be reused once they are history. For example, another company named Company A can utilize the www.A.com domain name after a predefined period, by updating the DNS database with the following entries:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"STARTING","ENDING","IP","REDIRECTED"]},{"entry":["URL","DATE","DATE","ADDRESS","URL"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["WWW.A.COM","13\/2\/1980","1\/5\/1998","123.2.3.222","WWW.B.COM"]},{"entry":["WWW.A.COM","1\/1\/2000","PRESENT","234.2.2.12","\u2014"]},{"entry":["WWW.B.COM","23\/1\/1985","PRESENT","123.2.3.222","\u2014"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In this manner, domain names can be reused without wasting them forever.","The Web is now full of dynamic content, including real time video, for example, from a WebCam, and audio streams, for example, from a WebCast event, as well as Java, Javascript or Active-X enabled web pages. Depending on the application, it may not be necessary or desirable to archive the continuous dynamic content. In addition, it may not be necessary or desirable to archive all the advertising portions of a web pages.","For chronological data, such as bank or stock broker transactions, it is easy to extract part of the record for a given time stamp restriction. For example, to check the account balance of a give date, the browser  can send a request in the form:","http:\/\/bank.com\/?id=12345&time=2+3+1998.","The server ,  only needs to retrieve or recalculate the data up to Mar. 2, 1998 and return the results. Since all the transactions in such application environments have time stamps anyway, it is straightforward to add this function to the service.","For real time contents, the only restriction in appending a time stamp is the storage requirement. If a lot of storage space is available compared to the amount of information to be archived, the Web site administrator can choose to archive the real time contents or to archive some of them such as one day, one week or one year's worth of data.","For dynamically created advertisements, the Web site administrator must decide whether it is reasonable to \u2018reshow\u2019 the old advertisement (for some special reason) or whether the old advertisement can be replaced with a new, up-to-date commercial which is not relevant to the \u2018real\u2019 archived web contents.","For a dynamically executed script on a Web page, there are two possible situations. If the script is not related to any time function, then the script can be archived safely. If, however, the script will change its behavior according to some time function, such as a clock or calendar display, then the script needs to be modified to deal with dated URL, requiring modifications to Java, Javascript or Active-X standards, as appropriate. Web pages generated dynamically by CGI applications are treated in a similar manner.","It is to be understood that the embodiments and variations shown and described herein are merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and that various modifications may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
