{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61\/887,259, filed Oct. 4, 2013, 61\/888,958, filed Oct. 9, 2013, and 61\/938,026, filed Feb. 10, 2014, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. (2007) 14:2214-2234).","Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and\/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine\/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and\/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorC1, mTorC2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and\/or threonine residues.","Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide(s) kinases (e.g., PI3-kinases, PI4-kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases.","The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.","PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3\u2032\u2014OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation. The class I PI3Ks (p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, p110\u03b4, and p110\u03b3) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt\/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. The PI3Ks are protein kinases that control cell growth (mTORC1) or monitor genomic integrity (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and hSmg-1).","The delta (\u03b4) isoform of class I PI3K has been implicated, in particular, in a number of diseases and biological processes. PI3K-\u03b4 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T-cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B-cells, and macrophages. PI3K-\u03b4 is integrally involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T-cell function, B-cell activation, mast cell activation, dendritic cell function, and neutrophil activity. Due to its integral role in immune system function, PI3K-\u03b4 is also involved in a number of diseases related to undesirable immune response such as allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, inflammation mediated angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and auto-immune diseases such as lupus, asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases. Other class I PI3K involved in immune system function includes PI3K-\u03b3, which plays a role in leukocyte signaling and has been implicated in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus. For example, PI3K-\u03b3 and PI3K-\u03b4 are highly expressed in leukocytes and have been associated with adaptive and innate immunity; thus, these PI3K isoforms can be important mediators in inflammatory disorders and hematologic malignancies.","The gamma (\u03b3) isoform of class I PI3K consists of a catalytic subunit p110\u03b3, which is associated with a p101 regulatory subunit. PI3K-\u03b3 is regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) via association with the \u03b2\/\u03b3 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. PI3K-\u03b3 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells and cardiomyocytes and is involved in inflammation and mast cell function Inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b3 are useful for treating a variety of inflammatory diseases, allergies, and cardiovascular diseases, among others.","Unlike PI3K-\u03b4, the beta (\u03b2) isoform of class I PI3K appears to be ubiquitously expressed. PI3K-\u03b2 has been implicated primarily in various types of cancer including PTEN-negative cancer (Edgar et al. (2010) 70(3):1164-1172), and HER2-overexpressing cancer such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer.","Described herein are compounds capable of selectively inhibiting one or more isoform(s) of class I PI3K without substantially affecting the activity of the remaining isoforms of the same class. For example, in some embodiments, non-limiting examples of inhibitors capable of selectively inhibiting PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3, but without substantially affecting the activity of PI3K-\u03b1 and\/or PI3K-\u03b2 are disclosed. In one embodiment, the inhibitors provided herein can be effective in ameliorating disease conditions associated with PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 activity. In one embodiment, the compounds are capable of selectively inhibiting PI3K-\u03b3 over PI3K-\u03b4.","In one aspect, provided herein are compounds of Formula (I\u2033) or (A\u2033):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"99.31mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09359365-20160607-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["3a","1c","2c","1","d "]},"In one aspect, provided herein are compounds of Formula (I\u2032) or (A\u2032):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"99.48mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09359365-20160607-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","d "]},"In one aspect, provided herein are compounds of Formula (I) or (A):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"99.48mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09359365-20160607-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","d "]},"In one embodiment, the compound of Formula (I\u2033), (I\u2032), (I), (A\u2033), (A\u2032), or (A) is predominately in an (S)-stereochemical configuration.

A \u201cmodulator\u201d of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator can augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule.","The term \u201cselective inhibition\u201d or \u201cselectively inhibit\u201d as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or indirect interaction with the target. For example, a compound that selectively inhibits one isoform of PI3K over another isoform of PI3K has an activity of at least greater than about 1\u00d7 against a first isoform relative to the compound's activity against the second isoform (e.g., at least about 2\u00d7, 3\u00d7, 5\u00d7, 10\u00d7, 20\u00d7, 50\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, 500\u00d7, or 1000\u00d7).

In one embodiment, the selectivity of a first PI3K isoform over a second PI3K isoform is measured by the ratio of the ICvalue against the second PI3K isoform to the ICvalue against the first PI3K gamma isoform. For example, a delta\/gamma selectivity ratio of a compound can be measured by the ratio of the compound's inhibitory activity against the delta isoform in terms of ICor the like to the compound's inhibitory activity against the gamma isoform in terms of ICor the like. If the delta\/gamma selectivity ratio is larger than 1, the compound selectively inhibits the gamma isoform over the delta isoform.

As used herein, the term \u201csolvate\u201d refers to compounds that further include a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. The solvate can be of a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Where the solvent is water, the solvate is a \u201chydrate\u201d.

It will be understood that the term \u201ccompound\u201d as used herein encompasses the compound and solvates of the compound, as well as mixtures thereof.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a prodrug. As used herein, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to yield a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound. A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis (e.g., hydrolysis in blood). In certain cases, a prodrug has improved physical and\/or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically designed to enhance pharmaceutically and\/or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent compound. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d , Vol. 14, and in , ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. Exemplary advantages of a prodrug can include, but are not limited to, its physical properties, such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent compound, or it enhances absorption from the digestive tract, or it can enhance drug stability for long-term storage.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like. Other examples of prodrugs include compounds that comprise \u2014NO, \u2014NO, \u2014ONO, or \u2014ONOmoieties. Prodrugs can typically be prepared using well-known methods, such as those described in 172-178, 949-982 (Manfred E. Wolff ed., 5th ed., 1995), and (H. Bundgaard ed., Elsevier, New York, 1985).","For example, if a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylamino(C-C)alkyl (such as \u03b2-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C-C)alkyl, N,N-di(C-C)alkylcarbamoyl-(C-C)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C-C)alkyl.","Similarly, if a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl (C-C)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N\u2014(C-C)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C-C)alkanoyl, \u03b1-amino(C-C)alkanoyl, arylacyl and \u03b1-aminoacyl, or \u03b1-aminoacyl-\u03b1-aminoacyl, where each \u03b1-aminoacyl group is independently selected from naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH), \u2014P(O)(O(C-C)alkyl), and glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).","If a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR\u2032-carbonyl where R and R\u2032 are each independently (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)cycloalkyl, benzyl, a natural \u03b1-aminoacyl or natural \u03b1-aminoacyl-natural \u03b1-aminoacyl, \u2014C(OH)C(O)OYwherein Yis H, (C-C)alkyl or benzyl, \u2014C(OY)Ywherein Yis (C-C)alkyl and Yis (C-C)alkyl, carboxy(C-C)alkyl, amino(C-C)alkyl or mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylaminoalkyl, \u2014C(Y)Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is an isomer. \u201cIsomers\u201d are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. \u201cAtropisomers\u201d are stereoisomers from hindered rotation about single bonds and can be resolved or isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, certain B substituents of a compound of Formula (I) provided herein with ortho or meta substituted phenyl may form atropisomers, where they may be separated and isolated.","\u201cStereoisomers\u201d are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. As used herein, the term \u201cisomer\u201d includes any and all geometric isomers and stereoisomers. For example, \u201cisomers\u201d include geometric double bond cis- and trans-isomers, also termed E- and Z-isomers; R- and S-enantiomers; diastereomers, (d)-isomers and (l)-isomers, racemic mixtures thereof; and other mixtures thereof, as falling within the scope of this disclosure.","In certain embodiments, the symbol  denotes a bond that can be a single or double as described herein.","In certain embodiments, provided herein are various geometric isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the arrangement of substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond or arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic ring. Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond are designated as being in the \u201cZ\u201d or \u201cE\u201d configuration wherein the terms \u201cZ\u201d and \u201cE\u201d are used in accordance with IUPAC standards. Unless otherwise specified, structures depicting double bonds encompass both the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d isomers.","Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond alternatively can be referred to as \u201ccis\u201d or \u201ctrans,\u201d where \u201ccis\u201d represents substituents on the same side of the double bond and \u201ctrans\u201d represents substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. The arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic ring can also be designated as \u201ccis\u201d or \u201ctrans.\u201d The term \u201ccis\u201d represents substituents on the same side of the plane of the ring, and the term \u201ctrans\u201d represents substituents on opposite sides of the plane of the ring. Mixtures of compounds wherein the substituents are disposed on both the same and opposite sides of the plane of the ring are designated \u201ccis\/trans.\u201d","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A mixture of a pair of enantiomers in any proportion can be known as a \u201cracemic\u201d mixture. The term \u201c(\u00b1)\u201d is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. \u201cDiastereoisomers\u201d are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry can be specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R-S system. When a compound is an enantiomer, the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (\u2212) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry at each asymmetric atom, as (R)- or (S)-. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically substantially pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers can be prepared, for example, using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques.","The \u201cenantiomeric excess\u201d or \u201c% enantiomeric excess\u201d of a composition can be calculated using the equation shown below. In the example shown below, a composition contains 90% of one enantiomer, e.g., an S enantiomer, and 10% of the other enantiomer, e.g., an R enantiomer.\n\n=(90\u221210)\/100=80%.\n","Thus, a composition containing 90% of one enantiomer and 10% of the other enantiomer is said to have an enantiomeric excess of 80%.

As used herein, the term \u201ctautomer\u201d is a type of isomer that includes two or more interconvertable compounds resulting from at least one formal migration of a hydrogen atom and at least one change in valency (e.g., a single bond to a double bond, a triple bond to a double bond, or a triple bond to a single bond, or vice versa). \u201cTautomerization\u201d includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. \u201cPrototropic tautomerization\u201d or \u201cproton-shift tautomerization\u201d involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g., in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. Tautomerizations (i.e., the reaction providing a tautomeric pair) can be catalyzed by acid or base, or can occur without the action or presence of an external agent. Exemplary tautomerizations include, but are not limited to, keto-enol; amide-imide; lactam-lactim; enamine-imine; and enamine-(a different) enamine tautomerizations. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers.","Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms.

Formulations for Oral Administration","In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing a compound as disclosed herein, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing: (i) an effective amount of a disclosed compound; optionally (ii) an effective amount of one or more second agents; and (iii) one or more pharmaceutical excipients suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and\/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water can be added (e.g., about 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.","An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the pharmaceutical compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. In some embodiments, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.","Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as , sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof.","Disintegrants can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant can produce tablets which can disintegrate in the bottle. Too little can be insufficient for disintegration to occur and can thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) can be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used can vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and can be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.","Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.","When aqueous suspensions and\/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient therein can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, for example, emulsifying and\/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.","The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.","Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants can be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants can be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant can be employed.","A suitable hydrophilic surfactant can generally have an HLB value of at least about 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants can generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (\u201cHLB\u201d value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable.

In some embodiments, the use of a controlled release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the disease, disorder, or condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased subject compliance. In addition, controlled release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects.","In some embodiments, controlled release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of a compound as disclosed herein that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of the compound in the body, the compound should be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active agent can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (see, Sefton, 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in a subject at an appropriate site determined by a practitioner of skill, e.g., thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, 115-138 (vol. 2, 1984). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer, 249:1527-1533 (1990). The one or more active agents can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene\/propylene copolymers, ethylene\/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene\/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene\/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene\/vinyl acetate\/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene\/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The one or more active agents then diffuse through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active agent in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the needs of the subject.","2. Dosage","A compound described herein can be delivered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds described herein and\/or one or more additional therapeutic agents such as a chemotherapeutic, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In some instances, the compound described herein and the additional therapeutic agent are administered in separate pharmaceutical compositions and can (e.g., because of different physical and\/or chemical characteristics) be administered by different routes (e.g., one therapeutic is administered orally, while the other is administered intravenously). In other instances, the compound described herein and the additional therapeutic agent can be administered separately, but via the same route (e.g., both orally or both intravenously). In still other instances, the compound described herein and the additional therapeutic agent can be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition.","The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including, for example, the activity of the particular compound employed, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and\/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.","In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound described herein and\/or a chemotherapeutic will be that amount of the compound which, in some embodiments, can be the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described herein. Generally, doses of the compounds described herein for a patient, when used for the indicated effects, will range from about 0.0001 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.0001 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about 0.001 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about 0.01 mg to 1000 mg, or about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about 1 mg to 50 mg per day, or about 5 mg to 40 mg per day. An exemplary dosage is about 10 to 30 mg per day. In some embodiments, for a 70 kg human, a suitable dose would be about 0.05 to about 7 g\/day, such as about 0.05 to about 2.5 g\/day. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range can be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses can be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g., by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.","In some embodiments, the compounds can be administered daily, every other day, three times a week, twice a week, weekly, or bi-weekly. The dosing schedule can include a \u201cdrug holiday,\u201d e.g., the drug can be administered for two weeks on, one week off, or three weeks on, one week off, or four weeks on, one week off, etc., or continuously, without a drug holiday. The compounds can be administered orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, topically, transdermally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally, sublingually, or by any other route.","In some embodiments, a compound as provided herein is administered in multiple doses. Dosing can be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing can be about once a month, about once every two weeks, about once a week, or about once every other day. In another embodiment, a compound as disclosed herein and another agent are administered together from about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment, the administration of a compound as provided herein and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment, the administration continues for more than about 6 days, about 10 days, about 14 days, about 28 days, about two months, about six months, or about one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.","Administration of the pharmaceutical compositions as disclosed herein can continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent as disclosed herein is administered for more than about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 14, or about 28 days. In some embodiments, an agent as disclosed herein is administered for less than about 28, about 14, about 7, about 6, about 5, about 4, about 3, about 2, or about 1 day. In some embodiments, an agent as disclosed herein is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects.","Since the compounds described herein can be administered in combination with other treatments (such as additional chemotherapeutics, radiation or surgery), the doses of each agent or therapy can be lower than the corresponding dose for single-agent therapy. The dose for single-agent therapy can range from, for example, about 0.0001 to about 200 mg, or about 0.001 to about 100 mg, or about 0.01 to about 100 mg, or about 0.1 to about 100 mg, or about 1 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose is about 1 mg\/kg, about 5 mg\/kg, about 7.5 mg\/kg, about 10 mg\/kg, about 15 mg\/kg, about 20 mg\/kg, about 25 mg\/kg, about 50 mg\/kg, about 75 mg\/kg, or about 100 mg\/kg per day. In some embodiments, the dose is about 1 mg\/kg, about 7.5 mg\/kg, about 20 mg\/kg, or about 50 mg\/kg per day.","When a compound provided herein, is administered in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises one or more agents, and the agent has a shorter half-life than the compound provided herein unit dose forms of the agent and the compound provided herein can be adjusted accordingly.","3. Kits","In some embodiments, provided herein are kits. The kits can include a compound or pharmaceutical composition as described herein, in suitable packaging, and written material that can include instructions for use, discussion of clinical studies, listing of side effects, and the like. Such kits can also include information, such as scientific literature references, package insert materials, clinical trial results, and\/or summaries of these and the like, which indicate or establish the activities and\/or advantages of the pharmaceutical composition, and\/or which describe dosing, administration, side effects, drug interactions, or other information useful to the health care provider. Such information can be based on the results of various studies, for example, studies using experimental animals involving in vivo models and studies based on human clinical trials.","In some embodiments, a memory aid is provided with the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows \u201cFirst Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . etc. . . . Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . \u201d etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A \u201cdaily dose\u201d can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day.","The kit can further contain another agent. In some embodiments, the compound as disclosed herein and the agent are provided as separate pharmaceutical compositions in separate containers within the kit. In some embodiments, the compound as disclosed herein and the agent are provided as a single pharmaceutical composition within a container in the kit. Suitable packaging and additional articles for use (e.g., measuring cup for liquid preparations, foil wrapping to minimize exposure to air, and the like) are known in the art and can be included in the kit. In other embodiments, kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active agents. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, syringes, drip bags, patches, and inhalers. Kits described herein can be provided, marketed and\/or promoted to health providers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, formulary officials, and the like. Kits can also, in some embodiments, be marketed directly to the consumer.","An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. The strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.","Kits can further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active agents. For example, if an active agent is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration, the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active agent can be dissolved to form a particulate-free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water can be added (e.g., about 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.","Therapeutic Methods","Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are members of a conserved family of lipid kinases that regulate numerous cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, cell survival and metabolism. Several classes of PI3Ks exist in mammalian cells, including Class IA subgroup (e.g., PI3K-\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), which are generally activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs); Class IB (e.g., PI3K-\u03b3), which is activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), among others. PI3Ks exert their biological activities via a \u201cPI3K-mediated signaling pathway\u201d that includes several components that directly and\/or indirectly transduce a signal triggered by a PI3K, including the generation of second messenger phophotidylinositol, 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) at the plasma membrane, activation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling, and generation of further second messengers such as cAMP, DAG, and IP3, all of which leads to an extensive cascade of protein kinase activation (reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck, B. et al. (2001) 70:535-602). For example, PI3K-\u03b4 is activated by cellular receptors through interaction between the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85) SH2 domains, or through direct interaction with RAS. PIP3 produced by PI3K activates effector pathways downstream through interaction with plextrin homology (PH) domain containing enzymes (e.g., PDK-1 and AKT [PKB]). (Fung-Leung W P. (2011) 23(4):603-8). Unlike PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3 is not associated with a regulatory subunit of the p85 family, but rather with a regulatory subunit in the p101 family. PI3K-\u03b3 is associated with GPCRs, and is responsible for the very rapid induction of PIP3. PI3K-\u03b3 can be also activated by RAS.","In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of modulating a PI3 kinase activity (e.g., selectively modulating) by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound as provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, isomers, prodrugs, and isotopically labeled derivatives) thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. Modulation can be inhibition (e.g., reduction) or activation (e.g., enhancement) of kinase activity. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound as provided herein in solution. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting the kinase activity by contacting a cell, tissue, organ that express the kinase of interest, with a compound provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity in a subject by administering into the subject an effective amount of a compound as provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form thereof. In some embodiments, the kinase activity is inhibited (e.g., reduced) by more than about 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%, when contacted with a compound provided herein as compared to the kinase activity without such contact. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting PI3 kinase activity in a subject (including mammals such as humans) by contacting said subject with an amount of a compound as provided herein sufficient to inhibit or reduce the activity of the PI3 kinase in said subject.","In some embodiments, the kinase is a lipid kinase or a protein kinase. In some embodiments, the kinase is selected from a PI3 kinase including different isoforms, such as PI3 kinase \u03b1, PI3 kinase \u03b2, PI3 kinase \u03b3, PI3 kinase \u03b4; DNA-PK; mTOR; Abl, VEGFR, Ephrin receptor B4 (EphB4); TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE2); FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3); Platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR); RET; ATM; ATR; hSmg-1; Hck; Src; Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); KIT; Inulsin Receptor (IR); and IGFR.","As used herein, a \u201cPI3K-mediated disorder\u201d refers to a disease or condition involving aberrant PI3K-mediated signaling pathway. In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K mediated disorder in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K-\u03b4 or PI3K-\u03b3 mediated disorder in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein is a method for inhibiting at least one of PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3, the method comprising contacting a cell expressing PI3K in vitro or in vivo with an effective amount of a compound or composition provided herein. PI3Ks have been associated with a wide range of conditions, including immunity, cancer and thrombosis (reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck, B. et al. (2010) , DOI 10.1007\/82_2010_65). For example, Class I PI3Ks, particularly PI3K-\u03b3 and PI3K-\u03b4 isoforms, are highly expressed in leukocytes and have been associated with adaptive and innate immunity; thus, these PI3Ks are believed to be important mediators in inflammatory disorders and hematologic malignancies (reviewed in Harris, S J et al. (2009) 10(11):1151-62); Rommel C. et al. (2007) 7(3):191-201; Durand C A et al. (2009) 183(9):5673-84; Dil N, Marshall A J. (2009) 46(10):1970-8; Al-Alwan M M et al. (2007) 178(4):2328-35; Zhang T T, et al. (2008) 2008; 122(4):811-819.e2; Srinivasan L, et al. (2009) 139(3):573-86).","PI3K-\u03b3 is a Class 1B PI3K that associates with the p101 and p84 (p87PIKAP) adaptor proteins, and canonically signals through GPCRs. Non-cononical activation through tyrosine kinase receptors and RAS can occur. Activated PI3K-\u03b3 leads to production of PIP3, which serves as a docking site for downstream effector proteins including AKT and BTK, bringing these enzymes to the cell membrane where they may be activated. A scaffolding role for PI3k-\u03b3 has been proposed and may contribute to the activation of the RAS\/MEK\/ERK pathway. The interaction with the RAS pathway explains activities attributed to kinase dead PI3K-\u03b3 in cells or in animals. PI3K-\u03b3 is essential for function of a variety of immune cells and pathways. Chemokine responses (including IL-8, fMLP, and C5a), leading to neutrophil or monocyte cell migration, is dependent on PI3K-\u03b3 (HIRSCH et al., \u201cCentral Role for G Protein-Coupled Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase \u03b3 in Inflammation,\u201d 287:1049-1053 (2000); SASAKI et al., \u201cFunction of PI3K\u03b3 in Thymocyte Development, T Cell Activation, and Neutrophil Migration,\u201d 287:1040-1046 (2000); L I et al., \u201cRoles of PLC-\u03b22 and -\u03b23 and PI3K\u03b3 in Chemoattractant-Mediated Signal Transduction,\u201d 287:1046-1049 (2000)). The requirement for PI3K-\u03b3-dependent neutrophil migration is demonstrated by failure of arthritis development in the K\/B\u00d7N serum transfer arthritis model in PI3K-\u03b3 knockout mice (Randis et al., 2008, 38(5), 1215-24). Similarly, the mice fail to develop cellular inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness in the ovalbumin induced asthma model (Takeda et al., 2009; 123, 805-12). PI3K-\u03b3 deficient mice also have defects in T-helper cell function. T-cell cytokine production and proliferation in response to activation is reduced, and T helper dependent viral clearance is defective (Sasaki et al., 2000, 287, 1040-46). T cell dependent inflammatory disease models including EAE also do not develop in PI3K-\u03b3 deficient mice, and both the T-cell activation defect and cellular migration defects may contribute to efficacy in this model (Comerfold, 2012, 7, e45095). The imiquimod psoriasis model has also been used to demonstrate the importance of PI3K-\u03b3 in the inflammatory response. Using PI3K-\u03b3deficient mice in this model, the accumulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the skin is blocked, as well as dendritic cell maturation and migration (ROLLER et al., \u201cBlockade of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)\u03b4 or PI3K\u03b3 Reduces IL-17 and Ameliorates Imiquimod-Induced Psoriasis-like Dermatitis,\u201d 189:4612-4620 (2012)). The role of PI3K-\u03b3 in cellular trafficking can also be demonstrated in oncology models where tumor inflammation is important for growth and metastasis of cancers. In the Lewis Lung Carcinoma model, monocyte activation, migration, and differentiation in tumors are defective. This defect results in a reduction in tumor growth and extended survival in PI3K-\u03b3 deficient mice (Schmid et al., 2011, 19, 715-27) or upon treatment with inhibitors that target PI3K-\u03b3. In pancreatic cancer, PI3K-\u03b3 can be inappropriately expressed, and in this solid tumor cancer or others where PI3K-\u03b3 plays a functional role, inhibition of PI3K-\u03b3 can be beneficial Inhibition of PI3K-\u03b3 shows promise for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. In a T-ALL model employing a T cell directed knockout of P-Ten, PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 are both essential for the appropriate development of disease, as shown with genetic deletion of both genes (Subramaniam et al. 21, 459-472, 2012). In addition, in this TALL model, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of both kinases leads to extended survival of these mice. In CLL, chemokine networks support a pseudo-follicular microenvironment that includes Nurse like cells, stromal cells and T-helper cells. The roles of PI3K-\u03b3 in the normal chemokine signaling and T cell biology suggest the value of inhibiting this target in CLL (BURGER, \u201cInhibiting B-Cell Receptor Signaling Pathways in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,\u201d 7:26-33 (2012)). Accordingly, PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitors are therapeutically interesting for diseases of the immune system where cell trafficking and T cell or myeloid cell function is important. In oncology, solid tumors that are dependent on tumor inflammation, or tumors with high levels of PI3K-\u03b3 expression, can be targeted. For hematological cancers a special role for PI3K-\u03b3 and PI3K-\u03b4 isoforms in TALL and potentially in CLL suggests targeting these PI3Ks in these diseases.","Without being limited by a particular theory, PI3K-\u03b3 has been shown to play roles in inflammation, arthritis, asthma, allergy, multiple sclerosis (MS), and cancer, among others (e.g., Ruckle et al., 2006, 5, 903-18; Schmid et al., \u201cMyeloid cells in tumor inflammation,\u201d 2012, doi:10.1186\/2045-824X-4-14). For example, PI3K-\u03b3 functions in multiple signaling pathways involved in leukocyte activation and migration. PI3K-\u03b3 has been shown to drive priming and survival of autoreactive CD4 T cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. When administered from onset of EAE, a PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor has been shown to cause inhibition and reversal of clinical disease, and reduction of demyelination and cellular pathology in the CNS (Comerford et al., 2012, 7, e45095). PI3K-\u03b3 also regulates thymocyte development, T cell activation, neutrophil migration, and the oxidative burst (Sasaki et al., 2000, 287, 1040-46). In addition, it is shown that allergic airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation, and remodeling do not develop in PI3K-\u03b3 deficient mice (Takeda et al., 2009; 123, 805-12). PI3K-\u03b3 is shown to be required for chemoattractant-induced production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and has an important role in chemoattractant-induced superoxide production and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils and in production of T cell-independent antigen-specific antibodies composed of the immunoglobulin \u03bb light chain (Li et al., 2000, 287, 1046-49). PI3K-\u03b3 is reported to be a crucial signaling molecule required for macrophage accumulation in inflammation (Hirsch et al., 2000, 287, 1049-53). In cancers, pharmacological or genetic blockade of p110\u03b3 suppresses inflammation, growth, and metastasis of implanted and spontaneous tumors, suggesting that PI3K-\u03b3 can be an important therapeutic target in oncology (Schmid et al., 2011, 19, 715-27). For example, it is shown that PI3K-\u03b3 has a tumor-specific high accumulation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in human, signifying a role of PI3K-\u03b3 in pancreatic cancer (Edling et al., 2010, 16(2), 4928-37).","PI3K-\u03b4 has roles in impairments of B-cell signaling and development, antibody production, T-cell function, Th1 and Th2 differentiation, and mast and basophil degranulation. Without being limited by a particular theory, PI3K-\u03b3 has roles in T-cell function, neutrophil and macrophage recruitment, macrophage activation, neutrophil oxidative burst, and dendritic cell migration. Inhibition of PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 isoforms can result in efficacy against inflammation and cancer, e.g., in arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis (MS), and tumor models. For example, deficiency in PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 can result in efficacy in K\/B\u00d7N arthritis model (Kyburz et al., 2003, 25, 79-90) or K\/B\u00d7N serum transfer model of arthritis (Randis et al., 2008, 38(5), 1215-24), where it is shown that recognition of the immune complexes depends on both PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3, whereas cell migration is dependent on PI3K-\u03b3. Deficiency in PI3K-\u03b4 or PI3K-\u03b3 can also result in efficacy in murine ovalbumin (OVA) induced allergic asthma model (Lee et al., 2006, 20, 455-65; Takeda et al., 2009; 123, 805-12), where it is shown that inhibition of either PI3K-\u03b4 or PI3K-\u03b3 inhibits ovalbumin induced lung infiltration and improves airway responsiveness. Deficiency in PI3K-\u03b4 or PI3K-\u03b3 can also result in efficacy in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (model for MS), where it is shown that PI3K-\u03b3 deletion may provide better efficacy as compared to PI3K-\u03b4 deletion (Haylock-Jacob et al., 2011, 36, 278-87; Comerford et al., 2012, 7, e45095), including reduction in T-cell receptor induced CD4 T cell activation, leukocyte infiltration and Th1\/Th17 responses, and dendritic cell migration (Comerfold, 2012, 7, e45095). Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K-\u03b3 can also result in decreased tumor inflammation and growth (e.g., Lewis lung carcinoma model, Schmid et al., 2011, 19(6), 715-27). PI3K-\u03b3 deletion combined with PI3K-\u03b4 deletion results in increased survival in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (Subramaniam et al., 2012, 21, 459-72) Inhibitors of both PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 are also shown to be efficacious in PTEN-deleted T-ALL cell line (MOLT-4). In the absence of PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor function, PI3K-\u03b4 or PI3K-\u03b3 alone can support the development of leukemia, whereas inactivation of both isoforms suppresses tumor formation. Thus, inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 can be useful in treating inflammation, such as arthritis, allergic asthma, and MS; and in treating cancer, for example, due to effects such as reductions in solid tumor associated inflammation, angiogenesis and tumor progression.","The importance of PI3K-\u03b4 in the development and function of B-cells is supported from inhibitor studies and genetic models. PI3K-\u03b4 is an important mediator of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, and is upstream of AKT, calcium flux, PLC\u03b3, MAP kinase, P70S6k, and FOXO3a activation. PI3K-\u03b4 is also important in IL4R, S1P, and CXCR5 signaling, and has been shown to modulate responses to toll-like receptors 4 and 9 Inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b4 have shown the importance of PI3K-\u03b4 in B-cell development (Marginal zone and B1 cells), B-cell activation, chemotaxis, migration and homing to lymphoid tissue, and in the control of immunoglobulin class switching leading to the production of IgE.

In PI3K-\u03b4 deletion or kinase-dead knock-in mice, or in inhibitor studies, T-cell defects including proliferation, activation, and differentiation have been observed, leading to reduced T helper cell 2 (TH2) response, memory T-cell specific defects (DTH reduction), defects in antigen dependent cellular trafficking, and defects in chemotaxis\/migration to chemokines (e.g., SIP, CCR7, CD62L).

Given the key role for PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 in immune function, inhibitors of the PI3K-6 and\/or \u03b3 have therapeutic potential in immune-related inflammatory or neoplastic diseases.","PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 are central to the growth and survival of B- and T-cell malignancies and inhibition of these isoforms may effectively limit these diseases. See, e.g., SUBRAMANIAM et al., \u201cTargeting Nonclassical Oncogenes for Therapy in T-ALL,\u201d 21:459-472 (2012); LANNUTTI et al., \u201cCAL-101 a p110\u03b4 selective phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, inhibits PI3K signaling and cellular viability,\u201d 117(2):591-594 (2011). PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 support the growth and survival of certain B-cell malignancies by mediating intracellular BCR signaling and interactions between the tumor cells and their microenvironment.

Increased BCR signaling is a central pathologic mechanism of B-cell malignancies and PI3K activation is a direct consequence of BCR pathway activation. See, e.g., BURGER, \u201cInhibiting B-Cell Receptor Signaling Pathways in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,\u201d Curr. 7:26-33 (2012); HERISHANU et al., \u201cThe lymph node microenvironment promotes B-cell receptor signaling, NF-\u03baB activation, and tumor proliferation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia,\u201d 117(2):563-574 (2011); DAVIS et al., \u201cChronic active B-cell-receptor signaling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,\u201d 463:88-92 (2010); PIGHI et al., \u201cPhospho-proteomic analysis of mantle cell lymphoma cells suggests a pro-survival role of B-cell receptor signaling,\u201d .

Interactions between malignant B-cells and supporting cells (eg, stromal cells, nurse-like cells) in the tumor microenvironment are important for tumor cell survival, proliferation, homing, and tissue retention. See, e.g., BURGER, \u201cInhibiting B-Cell Receptor Signaling Pathways in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,\u201d 7:26-33 (2012); HERISHANU et al., \u201cThe lymph node microenvironment promotes B-cell receptor signaling, NF-\u03baB activation, and tumor proliferation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia,\u201d 117(2):563-574 (2011); KURTOVA et al., \u201cDiverse marrow stromal cells protect CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis: development of a reliable and reproducible system to assess stromal cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance,\u201d 114(20): 4441-4450 (2009); BURGER et al., \u201cHigh-level expression of the T-cell chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 by chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells in nurselike cell cocultures and after BCR stimulation,\u201d 113(13) 3050-3058 (2009); QUIROGA et al., \u201cB-cell antigen receptor signaling enhances chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell migration and survival: specific targeting with a novel spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, R406114(5):1029-1037 (2009) Inhibiting PI3K-\u03b4,\u03b3 with an inhibitor in certain malignant B-cells can block the BCR-mediated intracellular survival signaling as well as key interactions with their microenvironment that are critical for their growth.","PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 also play a direct role in the survival and proliferation of certain T-cell malignancies. See, e.g., SUBRAMANIAM et al., \u201cTargeting Nonclassical Oncogenes for Therapy in T-ALL,\u201d 21:459-472 (2012). Aberrant PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 activity provides the signals necessary for the development and growth of certain T-cell malignancies. While BTK is expressed in B-cells, it is not expressed in T-cells, and therefore BTK is not a viable target for the treatment of T-cell malignancies. See, e.g., NISITANI et al., \u201cPosttranscriptional regulation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase expression in antigen receptor-stimulated splenic B cells,\u201d 97(6):2737-2742 (2000); DE WEERS et al., \u201cThe Bruton's tyrosine kinase gene is expressed throughout B cell differentiation, from early precursor B cell stages preceding immunoglobulin gene rearrangement up to mature B cell stages,\u201d 23:3109-3114 (1993); SMITH et al., \u201cExpression of Bruton's Agammaglobulinemia Tyrosine Kinase Gene, BTK, Is Selectively Down-Regulated in T Lymphocytes and Plasma Cells,\u201d 152:557-565 (1994). PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or \u03b3 inhibitors may have unique therapeutic potential in T-cell malignancies.","In neutrophils, PI3K-\u03b4, along with PI3K-\u03b3, contribute to the responses to immune complexes, FC\u03b3RII signaling, including migration and neutrophil respiratory burst. Human neutrophils undergo rapid induction of PIP3 in response to formyl peptide receptor (FMLP) or complement component C5a (C5a) in a PI3K-\u03b3 dependent manner, followed by a longer PIP3 production period that is PI3K-\u03b4 dependent, and is essential for respiratory burst. The response to immune complexes is contributed by PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3, and PI3K-\u03b2, and is an important mediator of tissue damage in models of autoimmune disease (Randis T M et al. (2008) 38(5):1215-24; Pinho V, (2007) 179(11):7891-8; Sadhu C. et al. (2003) 170(5):2647-54; Condliffe A M et al. (2005) 106(4):1432-40). It has been reported that in certain autoimmune diseases, preferential activation of PI3K-\u03b2 may be involved (Kulkarni et al., (2011) 4(168) ra23: 1-11). It was also reported that PI3K-\u03b2-deficient mice were highly protected in an Fc\u03b3R-dependent model of autoantibody-induced skin blistering and partially protected in an Fc\u03b3R-dependent model of inflammatory arthritis, whereas combined deficiency of PI3K-\u03b2 and PI3K-resulted in near complete protection in inflammatory arthritis (Id.).","In macrophages collected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), glucocorticoid responsiveness can be restored by treatment of the cells with inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b4. Macrophages also rely on PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 for responses to immune complexes through the arthus reaction (FC\u03b3R and C5a signaling) (Randis T M, et al. (2008) 38(5):1215-24; Marwick J A et al. (2009) 179(7):542-8; Konrad S, et al. (2008) 283(48):33296-303).","In mast cells, stem cell factor\u2014(SCF) and IL3-dependent proliferation, differentiation and function are PI3K-\u03b4 dependent, as is chemotaxis. The allergen\/IgE crosslinking of FC\u03b3R1 resulting in cytokine release and degranulation of the mast cells is severely inhibited by treatment with PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors, suggesting a role for PI3K-\u03b4 in allergic disease (Ali K et al. (2004) 431(7011):1007-11; Lee K S, et al. (2006) 20(3):455-65; Kim M S, et al. (2008) 29(10): 493-501).","Natural killer (NK) cells are dependent on both PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 for efficient migration towards chemokines including CXCL10, CCL3, S1P and CXCL12, or in response to LPS in the peritoneum (Guo H, et al. (2008) 205(10):2419-35; Tassi I, et al. (2007) 27(2):214-27; Saudemont A, (2009) 106(14):5795-800; Kim N, et al. (2007) 110(9):3202-8).","The roles of PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 in the differentiation, maintenance, and activation of immune cells support a role for these enzymes in inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis) to allergic inflammatory disorders, such as asthma, and inflammatory respiratory disease, such as COPD. Extensive evidence is available in experimental animal models, or can be evaluated using art-recognized animal models. In an embodiment, described herein is a method of treating inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis) to allergic inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and COPD using a compound described herein.","For example, inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3 have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in several autoimmune animal models for rheumatoid arthritis (Williams, O. et al. (2010) Chem Biol, 17(2):123-34; WO 2009\/088986; WO2009\/088880; WO 2011\/008302; each incorporated herein by reference). PI3K-\u03b4 is expressed in the RA synovial tissue (especially in the synovial lining which contains fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and selective PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in inhibiting synoviocyte growth and survival (Bartok et al. (2010) 62 Suppl 10:362). Several PI3K-\u03b4 and -\u03b3 inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate arthritic symptoms (e.g., swelling of joints, reduction of serum-induced collagen levels, reduction of joint pathology and\/or inflammation), in art-recognized models for RA, such as collagen-induced arthritis and adjuvant induced arthritis (WO 2009\/088986; WO2009\/088880; WO 2011\/008302; each incorporated herein by reference).","The role of PI3K-\u03b4 has also been shown in models of T-cell dependent response, including the DTH model. In the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the PI3K-\u03b3\/\u03b4-double mutant mice are resistant. PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors have also been shown to block EAE disease induction and development of TH-17 cells both in vitro and in vivo (Haylock-Jacobs, S. et al. (2011) 36(3-4):278-87).","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease that at different stages requires memory T-cells, B-cell polyclonal expansion and differentiation into plasma cells, and the innate immune response to endogenous damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS), and the inflammatory responses to immune complexes through the complement system as well as the Freceptors. The role of PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 together in these pathways and cell types suggest that blockade with an inhibitor would be effective in these diseases. A role for PI3K in lupus is also predicted by two genetic models of lupus. The deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) leads to a lupus-like phenotype, as does a transgenic activation of Class 1A PI3Ks, which includes PI3K-\u03b4. The deletion of PI3K-\u03b3 in the transgenically activated class 1A lupus model is protective, and treatment with a PI3K-\u03b3 selective inhibitor in the murine MLR\/lpr model of lupus improves symptoms (Barber, D F et al. (2006) 176(1): 589-93).","In allergic disease, PI3K-\u03b4 has been shown by genetic models and by inhibitor treatment to be essential for mast-cell activation in a passive cutaneous anaphalaxis assay (Ali K et al. (2008) 180(4): 2538-44; Ali K, (2004) 431(7011):1007-11). In a pulmonary measure of response to immune complexes (Arthus reaction) a PI3K-\u03b4 knockout is resistant, showing a defect in macrophage activation and C5a production. Knockout studies and studies with inhibitors for both PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 support a role for both of these enzymes in the ovalbumin induced allergic airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness model (Lee K S et al. (2006) 20(3):455-65). Reductions of infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes as well as TH2 cytokines (IL4, IL5, and IL13) were seen with both PI3K-\u03b4 specific and dual PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitors in the Ova induced asthma model (Lee K S et al. (2006) 118(2):403-9).","PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 inhibition can be used in treating COPD. In the smoked mouse model of COPD, the PI3K-\u03b4 knockout does not develop smoke induced glucocorticoid resistance, while wild-type and PI3K-\u03b3knockout mice do. An inhaled formulation of dual PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor blocked inflammation in a LPS or smoke COPD models as measured by neutrophilia and glucocorticoid resistance (Doukas J, et al. (2009) 328(3):758-65).","Class I PI3Ks, particularly PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 isoforms, are also associated with cancers (reviewed, e.g., in Vogt, P K et al.

(2010) 116(9):1460-8).","In hematological cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), overexpression and constitutive activation of PI3K-\u03b4 supports the model that PI3K-\u03b4 inhibition would be therapeutic Billottet C, et al. (2006) 25(50):6648-59; Billottet C, et al. (2009) 69(3):1027-36; Meadows, S A, 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Ikeda H, et al. (2010) 116(9):1460-8; Herman S E et al. (2010) 116(12):2078-88; Herman S E et al. (2011). 117(16):4323-7.","In one embodiment, described herein is a method of treating hematological cancers including, but not limited to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).","A PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor (CAL-101) has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with haematological malignancies, and showed activity in CLL in patients with poor prognostic characteristics. In CLL, inhibition of PI3K-\u03b4 not only affects tumor cells directly, but it also affects the ability of the tumor cells to interact with their microenvironment. This microenvironment includes contact with and factors from stromal cells, T-cells, nurse like cells, as well as other tumor cells. CAL-101 suppresses the expression of stromal and T-cell derived factors including CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL13, as well as the CLL tumor cells' ability to respond to these factors. CAL-101 treatment in CLL patients induces rapid lymph node reduction and redistribution of lymphocytes into the circulation, and affects tonic survival signals through the BCR, leading to reduced cell viability, and an increase in apoptosis. Single agent CAL-101 treatment was also active in mantle cell lymphoma and refractory non Hodgkin's lymphoma (Furman, R R, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Hoellenriegel, J, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Webb, H K, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Meadows, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Kahl, B, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Lannutti B J, et al. (2011) 117(2):591-4).","PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors have shown activity against PI3K-\u03b4 positive gliomas in vitro (Kashishian A, et al. Poster presented at: The American Association of Cancer Research 102Annual Meeting; 2011 Apr. 2-6; Orlando, Fla.). PI3K-\u03b4 is the PI3K isoform that is most commonly activated in tumors where the PTEN tumor suppressor is mutated (Ward S, et al. (2003) 10(3):207-13). In this subset of tumors, treatment with the PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor either alone or in combination with a cytotoxic agent can be effective.","Another mechanism for PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors to have an effect in solid tumors involves the tumor cells' interaction with their micro-environment. PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3, and PI3K-\u03b2 are expressed in the immune cells that infiltrate tumors, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors can modify the function of these tumor-associated immune cells and how they respond to signals from the stroma, the tumor, and each other, and in this way affect tumor cells and metastasis (Hoellenriegel, J, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.).","PI3K-\u03b4 is also expressed in endothelial cells. It has been shown that tumors in mice treated with PI3K-\u03b4 selective inhibitors are killed more readily by radiation therapy. In this same study, capillary network formation is impaired by the PI3K inhibitor, and it is postulated that this defect contributes to the greater killing with radiation. PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors can affect the way in which tumors interact with their microenvironment, including stromal cells, immune cells, and endothelial cells and be therapeutic either on its own or in conjunction with another therapy (Meadows, S A, et al. Paper presented at: 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Geng L, et al. (2004) 64(14):4893-9).","In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating or preventing a cancer or disease, such as hematologic malignancy, or a specific type or sub-type of cancer or disease, such as a specific type or sub-type of hematologic malignancy, with a PI3K-\u03b3 selective inhibitor, wherein the adverse effects associated with administration of inhibitors for other isoform(s) of PI3K (e.g., PI3K-\u03b1 and\/or PI3K-\u03b2) are reduced. In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating or preventing a cancer or disease, such as hematologic malignancy, or a specific type or sub-type of cancer or disease, such as a specific type or sub-type of hematologic malignancy, with a PI3K-\u03b3 selective inhibitor, at a lower (e.g., by about 10%, by about 20%, by about 30%, by about 40%, by about 50%, by about 60%, by about 70%, or by about 80%) dose as compared to treatment with a PI3K-\u03b3 non-selective or less selective PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor (e.g., a PI3Kpan inhibitors, e.g., inhibiting PI3K-\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03b3).","The role of PI3K-\u03b3 pathway in promoting myeloid cell trafficking to tumors and the role of blockade of p100\u03b3 in suppression of tumor inflammation and growth in breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer are reported, for example, in Schmid et al. (2011) 19, 715-727, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating or preventing pancreatic cancer with a PI3K inhibitor. In another embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating or preventing breast cancer with a PI3K inhibitor. In yet another embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating or preventing lung cancer with a PI3K inhibitor. In one embodiment, the PI3K inhibitor is a PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor, selective or non-selective over one or more other PI3K isoform(s). In one embodiment, the PI3K inhibitor is a PI3K-\u03b3 selective inhibitor.","In certain embodiments, provided herein is a method of treating a disorder or disease provided herein, comprising administering a compound provided herein, e.g., a PI3K \u03b3 selective inhibitor, a PI3K \u03b4 selective inhibitor, or a PI3K \u03b3\/\u03b4 dual inhibitor. Without being limited by a particular theory, in some embodiments, selectively inhibiting PI3K-\u03b3 isoform can provide a treatment regimen where adverse effects associated with administration of a non-selective PI3K inhibitor are minimized or reduced. Without being limited by a particular theory, in some embodiments, selectively inhibiting PI3K-\u03b4 isoform can provide a treatment regimen where adverse effects associated with administration of a non-selective PI3K inhibitor are minimized or reduced. Without being limited by a particular theory, in some embodiments, selectively inhibiting PI3K-\u03b4 and \u03b3 isoform can provide a treatment regimen where adverse effects associated with administration of a non-selective PI3K inhibitor are minimized or reduced. Without being limited by a particular theory, it is believed that the adverse effects can be reduced by avoiding the inhibition of other isoforms (e.g., \u03b1 or \u03b2) of PI3K.","In one embodiment, the adverse effect is hyperglycemia. In another embodiment, the adverse effect is rash. In another embodiment, the adverse effect is impaired male fertility that may result from inhibition of \u03b2 isoform of PI3K (see, e.g., Ciraolo et al., 21: 704-711 (2010)). In another embodiment, the adverse effect is testicular toxicity that may result from inhibition of PI3K-\u03b2 (see, e.g., Wisler et al., Amgen SOT, Abstract ID #2334 (2012)). In another embodiment, the adverse effect is embryonic lethality (see, e.g., Bi et al., 274: 10963-10968 (1999)). In another embodiment, the adverse effect is defective platelet aggregation (see, e.g., Kulkarni et al., 287: 1049-1053 (2000)). In another embodiment, the adverse effect is functionally defective neutrophil (id.).","In certain embodiments, the PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor selectively modulates phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3 kinase) gamma isoform. In one embodiment, the PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor selectively inhibits the gamma isoform over the alpha, beta, or delta isoform. In one embodiment, the PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor selectively inhibits the gamma isoform over the alpha or beta isoform. In one embodiment, the PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor selectively inhibits the gamma isoform over the alpha, beta, and delta isoforms. In one embodiment, the PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor selectively inhibits the gamma isoform over the alpha and beta isoforms. In one embodiment, the PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor selectively inhibits the gamma isoform over the alpha and beta isoforms, but not the delta isoform. By way of non-limiting example, the ratio of selectivity can be greater than a factor of about 10, greater than a factor of about 50, greater than a factor of about 100, greater than a factor of about 200, greater than a factor of about 400, greater than a factor of about 600, greater than a factor of about 800, greater than a factor of about 1000, greater than a factor of about 1500, greater than a factor of about 2000, greater than a factor of about 5000, greater than a factor of about 10,000, or greater than a factor of about 20,000, where selectivity can be measured by ratio of ICvalues, among other means. In one embodiment, the selectivity of PI3K gamma isoform over an other PI3K isoform is measured by the ratio of the ICvalue against the other PI3K isoform to the ICvalue against PI3K gamma isoform. In certain embodiments, the PI3 kinase gamma isoform ICactivity of a compound as disclosed herein can be less than about 1000 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 10 nM, or less than about 1 nM. For example, a compound that selectively inhibits one isoform of PI3K over another isoform of PI3K has an activity of at least 2\u00d7 against a first isoform relative to the compound's activity against the second isoform (e.g., at least about 3\u00d7, 5\u00d7, 10\u00d7, 20\u00d7, 50\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, 500\u00d7, or 1000\u00d7).","In other embodiments, inhibition of PI3K (such as PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3) can be used to treat a neuropsychiatric disorder, e.g., an autoimmune brain disorder. Infectious and immune factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including, but not limited to, Sydenham's chorea (SC) (Garvey, M. A. et al. (2005) 20:424-429), Tourette's syndrome (TS), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (Asbahr, F. R. et al. (1998) 155:1122-1124), attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (AD\/HD) (Hirschtritt, M. E. et al. (2008) 1:1-16; Peterson, B. S. et al. (2000) 57:364-372), anorexia nervosa (Sokol, M. S. (2000) 10:133-145; Sokol, M. S. et al. (2002) 159:1430-1432), depression (Leslie, D. L. et al. (2008) 47:1166-1172), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Hollander, E. et al. (1999) 156:317-320; Margutti, P. et al. (2006) 3:149-157). A subset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorders and tic disorders has been grouped as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococci (PANDAS). PANDAS disorders provide an example of disorders where the onset and exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms is preceded by a streptococcal infection (Kurlan, R., Kaplan, E. L. (2004) 113:883-886; Garvey, M. A. et al. (1998) 13:413-423). Many of the PANDAS disorders share a common mechanism of action resulting from antibody responses against streptococcal associated epitopes, such as GlcNAc, which produces neurological effects (Kirvan. C. A. et al. (2006) 179:173-179). Autoantibodies recognizing central nervous system (CNS) epitopes are also found in sera of most PANDAS subjects (Yaddanapudi, K. et al. (2010) 15:712-726). Thus, several neuropsychiatric disorders have been associated with immune and autoimmune components, making them suitable for therapies that include PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 inhibition.","In certain embodiments, a method of treating (e.g., reducing or ameliorating one or more symptoms of) a neuropsychiatric disorder, (e.g., an autoimmune brain disorder), using a PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor is described, alone or in combination therapy. For example, one or more PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitors described herein can be used alone or in combination with any suitable therapeutic agent and\/or modalities, e.g., dietary supplement, for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Exemplary neuropsychiatric disorders that can be treated with the PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitors described herein include, but are not limited to, PANDAS disorders, Sydenham's chorea, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, anorexia nervosa, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is an exemplary class of autism spectrum disorders that includes Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), Rett's Disorder and PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Animal models for evaluating the activity of the PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor are known in the art. For example, a mouse model of PANDAS disorders is described in, e.g., Yaddanapudi, K. et al. (2010) supra; and Hoffman, K. I. et al. (2004) 24:1780-1791.","In some embodiments, provided herein is a method for treating rheumatoid arthritis or asthma in a subject, or for reducing a rheumatoid arthritis-associated symptom or an asthma-associated symptom in a subject, comprising administering an effective amount of a PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor to a subject in need thereof, wherein one or more of the adverse effects associated with administration of inhibitors for one or more other isoforms of PI3K are reduced.

Scleroderma may be localized (e.g., affecting only the skin) or systemic (e.g., affecting other systems such as, e.g., blood vessels and\/or internal organs). Common symptoms of scleroderma include Raynaud's phenomenon, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and skin changes (e.g., swollen fingers and hands, or thickened patches of skin). In some embodiments, the scleroderma is localized, e.g., morphea or linear scleroderma. In some embodiments, the condition is a systemic sclerosis, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis, diffuse systemic sclerosis, or systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.","Localized scleroderma (localized cutaneous fibrosis) includes morphea and linear scleroderma. Morphea is typically characterized by oval-shaped thickened patches of skin that are white in the middle, with a purple border. Linear scleroderma is more common in children. Symptoms of linear scleroderma may appear mostly on one side of the body. In linear scleroderma, bands or streaks of hardened skin may develop on one or both arms or legs or on the forehead. En coup de sabre (frontal linear scleroderma or morphea en coup de sabre) is a type of localized scleroderma typically characterized by linear lesions of the scalp or face.","Systemic scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) includes, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis (also known as limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, or CREST syndrome), diffuse systemic sclerosis (also known as diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis), and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma. CREST stands for the following complications that may accompany limited scleroderma: calcinosis (e.g., of the digits), Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias. Typically, limited scleroderma involves cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands, arms, and face. Limited and diffuse subtypes are distinguished based on the extent of skin involvement, with sparing of the proximal limbs and trunk in limited disease. See, e.g., Denton, C. P. et al. (2006), 2(3):134-143. The limited subtype also typically involves a long previous history of Raynaud's phenomenon, whereas in the diffuse subtype, onset of Raynaud's phenomenon can be simultaneous with other manifestations or might occur later. Both limited and diffuse subtypes may involve internal organs. Typical visceral manifestations of limited systemic sclerosis include isolated pulmonary hypertension, severe bowel involvement, and pulmonary fibrosis. Typical visceral manifestations of diffuse systemic sclerosis include renal crisis, lung fibrosis, and cardiac disease. Diffuse systemic sclerosis typically progresses rapidly and affects a large area of the skin and one or more internal organs (e.g., kidneys, esophagus, heart, or lungs). Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma is a rare disorder in which patients develop vascular and fibrotic damage to internal organs in the absence of cutaneous sclerosis.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating, preventing and\/or managing inflammatory myopathies.
