The home base station is a small-sized base station provided in a house or in a company and may be called a femto cell base station.","LIPA is a function of performing communication by an LIPA connection (LIPA PDN connection) which is established between a user terminal and a local device within an IP network of the house (or company) where the user terminal is located, via a home base station and not via a core network of an operator. The LIPA does not feed user data to the core network, and thus, it is possible to reduce a traffic load of the core network.","The 3GPP Release 10 does not support a mobility of the LIPA connection. Therefore, when a user terminal having the LIPA connection moves from a home base station to another base station, the connection is always released. As a result, when resuming communication between the user terminal and the local device to which the user terminal had been connected, a reconnection process is needed, and thus, the communication is interrupted.","[NPL 1] 3GPP Technical Specification TS 23.401 V10.3.0, \u201c4.3.16 Local IP Access (LIPA) function\u201d","[NPL 2] 3GPP Technical Specification TS 36.300 V10.3.0, \u201c4.6.5 Support of LIPA with HeNB\u201d","Release 11, of which the specification will be developed in the future following the 3GPP Release 10, is expected to support the mobility of the LIPA connection between the home base stations that support the LIPA, that is, enable handover while maintaining the LIPA connection.","However, the current specification defines that when the user terminal having the LIPA connection moves from the home base station to another base station, the LIPA connection is always released, and thus, there is a problem that it is not possible to support the mobility of the LIPA connection.","Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a communication control method capable of supporting a mobility of an LIPA connection and to provide a home base station thereof.","The first feature of a communication control method according to the present invention is summarized as follows. A communication control method in a home base station (source HeNB -) that supports LIPA (Local Internet Protocol Access) defined in the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) standards, comprises: a step (step S) of transmitting information indicating that a user terminal (UE ) has an LIPA connection in a handover request, to a target base station, by including the information in the handover request, when a handover procedure from the home base station to the target base station is started for the user terminal having the LIPA connection; and a step (steps S, ) of continuing the handover procedure without releasing the LIPA connection when the target base station permits the handover request.","The first feature of a home base station according to the present invention is summarized as follows. A home base station (source HeNB -) that supports LIPA (Local Internet Protocol Access) defined in the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) standards, is configured to: transmit information indicating that a user terminal (UE ) has an LIPA connection, to the target base station, by including the information in a handover request, when a handover procedure from the home base station to the target base station is started for the user terminal having the LIPA connection; and continue the handover procedure without releasing the LIPA connection when the target base station permits the handover request.","The second feature of a communication control method according to the present invention is summarized as follows. A communication control method in a home base station (target HeNB -), comprises: a step (step S) of receiving a handover request transmitted from another home base station that supports LIPA (Local Internet Protocol Access) defined in the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) standards, the handover request including information indicating that a user terminal (UE ) has an LIPA connection; and a step (step S) of permitting the handover request from the another home base station when the home base station supports the LIPA.","The second feature of a c home base station according to the present invention is summarized as follows. A home base station (target HeNB -) is configured to: receive a handover request transmitted from another home base station (source HeNB -) that supports LIPA (Local Internet Protocol Access) defined in the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) standards, the handover request including information indicating that a user terminal (UE ) has an LIPA connection; and permit the handover request from the another home base station when the home base station supports the LIPA.","With reference to the drawings, the embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the drawings of the following embodiments, the same or similar reference signs are applied to the same or similar portions.","(Configuration of Mobile Communication System)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , the mobile communication system according to the present embodiment includes a home base station (Home evolved Node B: HeNB) , a user terminal (User Equipment: UE) , local devices (Local Entities: LEs)  to , and a gateway (GW) . In the present embodiment, each of the HeNB , the UE , the LEs  to , and the GW  is located on an IP network in the same house R.","The HeNB  forms a small-sized cell, and performs radio communication with the UE  located within the cell. The cell is a minimum unit of a radio communication area.","In the HeNB , a function of a local gateway (L-GW) for implementing LIPA is provided. The LIPA is a function that enables the IP-compatible UE  connected via the HeNB  to access another IP-compatible entity within an IP network of the same house\/company without a user plane crossing an operator network (core network ) other than an HeNB subsystem.","The HeNB  (more particularly, L-GW provided in the HeNB ) establishes or releases the LIPA connection. A solid arrow in  represents user data transmitted via the LIPA connection between the UE  and the LE . Whereas, a dotted arrow in  represents user data transmitted via the core network  when the LIPA is not implemented. When the LIPA is implemented, the user data will be transmitted not via the core network , and thus, it is possible to reduce a traffic load of the core network .","The UE  is a portable radio communication device carried by a user, and is configured to be capable of IP communication. In the present embodiment, the UE  includes an LIPA connection via the HeNB , between with the LE . The UE  communicates with the LE  by using the LIPA connection.","Each of the LEs  to  is a device capable of IP communication. In the present embodiment, the LE  is a PC (Personal Computer), the LE  is a server, and the LE  is a printer.","The GW  relays data transmitted and received within the IP network in the house R, and performs a protocol conversion between the IP Network within the house R and an Internet .","The core network  includes a serving gateway (S-GW) , a mobility management entity (MME) , and a PDN gateway (P-GW) .","The S-GW  is provided to correspond to a user plane, and is configured to perform transfer control on the user data.","The MME  is provided to correspond to a control plane, and is configured to perform various types of mobility managements on the UE .","A transmission path between the HeNB  and the S-GW \/MME  is called an S1 interface. It is noted that an inter-base station transmission path between the HeNB  and another HeNB is called an X2 interface.","The P-GW  functions as an entrance from the core network  to the Internet , and an exit from the Internet  to the core network .","It is noted that although not shown in , an HeNB gateway (HeNB GW) that houses a plurality of HeNBs  may be provided between the HeNB  and the S-GW \/MME .","(Configuration of UE)","Next, the configuration of the UE  according to the present embodiment will be described.  is a block diagram of the UE .","As shown in , the UE  includes an antenna , a radio communication unit , a user interface unit , a storage unit , a control unit , and a battery .","The radio communication unit  is configured to perform radio communication via the antenna . For transmission, the radio communication unit  performs up-conversion, amplification, etc., on a baseband signal input from the control unit , and outputs a radio signal from the antenna . For reception, the radio communication unit  performs amplification, down-conversion, etc. on a received signal input from the antenna , and then outputs a baseband signal to the control unit .","The user interface unit  includes a microphone to which voice is input, a speaker that outputs voice, a display that displays an image, and a button pressed by a user, for example.","The storage unit  is configured by using a memory, for example, and stores various types of information used for control, for example, by the control unit .","The control unit  is configured by using a CPU, for example, and controls various types of functions provided in the UE .","The battery  stores power to be supplied to each block of the UE .","In the UE  thus configured, when the control unit  is in a state of being executing communication (called a connected mode), the control unit  measures a reception state (reference signal received power or reference signal received quality) of a reference signal received by the radio communication unit  for each cell, and controls so that a measurement result for each cell is reported to the serving base station.","Such a report is called measurement report. The serving base station decides whether to perform handover of the UE  on the basis of the measurement report. The handover is an operation that the UE  in a connected mode switches the serving cells. It is noted that the measurement report has two settings, i.e., a setting (Periodic) that is periodically transmitted and a setting (Event trigger) that is not transmitted until a trigger condition for permitting handover is satisfied.","(Configuration of HeNB)","Next, the configuration of the HeNB  according to the present embodiment will be described.  is a block diagram of the HeNB .","As illustrated in , the HeNB  includes an antenna , a radio communication unit , a network communication unit , a storage unit , and a control unit .","The radio communication unit  is configured to perform radio communication through the antenna . For transmission, the radio communication unit , performs up-conversion, amplification, etc., on a baseband signal input from the control unit , and outputs a radio signal from the antenna . For reception, the radio communication unit  performs, amplification, down-conversion, etc., on a received signal input from the antenna , and then outputs a baseband signal to the control unit .","The network communication unit  uses the S1 interface to communicate with the S-GW , the MME , or the HeNB GW. Furthermore, the network communication unit  performs communication (inter-base station communication) with another HeNB by using the X2 interface. Further, the network communication unit  communicates with the LEs  to  via the GW  in the house R.","The storage unit  is configured by using a memory, for example, and stores various types of information used for control, for example, by the control unit .","The control unit  is configured by using a CPU, for example, and controls various functions provided in the HeNB . The control unit  includes an HeNB function control unit  for controlling an original function of the HeNB and an L-GW function unit  for implementing the function of the L-GW. It is noted that when the LIPA is not supported, the HeNB  does not include the L-GW function unit .","The HeNB function control unit  controls radio communication with the UE  and controls network communication using the S1 interface and the X2 interface. Further, the HeNB function control unit  decides whether to perform handover of the UE  to a target base station on the basis of the measurement report received by the radio communication unit  from the UE . The HeNB function control unit  starts a handover procedure when it is decided to perform handover. It is noted that the handover procedure includes a handover preparation stage, a handover execution state, and a handover completion stage.","The L-GW function unit  performs various types of controls for implementing the LIPA, for example, establishes or releases the LIPA connection. As described later, the L-GW function unit  is controlled by Intra-node Signaling from the HeNB function control unit .","In the HeNB  thus configured, the HeNB function control unit  controls the network communication unit  to transmit information indicating that the UE  has the LIPA connection, to the target base station, by including the information in a handover request, when starting a handover procedure of the UE  having the LIPA connection from the HeNB  (self station) to the target base station. Then, the HeNB function control unit  continues the handover procedure without releasing the LIPA connection, when the target base station permits the handover request. In contrast, when the target base station rejects the handover request, the HeNB function control unit  requests the L-GW function unit  to release the LIPA connection by using Intra-node Signaling.","On the other hand, when the HeNB  is to receive the handover request, the network communication unit  receives the handover request including information indicating that the UE  has the LIPA connection. The HeNB function control unit  confirms whether or not the HeNB  (self station) supports the LIPA (that is, whether or not the L-GW function unit  is provided) and permits the handover request received by the network communication unit  when the LIPA is supported. In particular, the network communication unit  is controlled to return an acknowledgement to the handover request received by the network communication unit .","(Operation of Mobile Communication System)","Next, by using  to , the operation of the mobile communication system according to the present embodiment will be described.","As shown in , the UE  positioned in the communication area of HeNB - moves in the communication area of HeNB - while establishing the LIPA connection with the LE  via the HeNB -.","An operation pattern  described later is an operation of the mobile communication system when the HeNB - that supports the LIPA is a source (handover source) and the HeNB - that supports the LIPA is a target (handover target).","In contrast, an operation pattern  described later is an operation of the mobile communication system when the HeNB - that supports the LIPA is a source and the HeNB - that does not support the LIPA is a target.","(1) Operation Pattern ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"1"},"As shown in , in step S, the radio communication unit  of the source HeNB - receives a measurement report from the UE .

Request) and transmit the handover request to the target HeNB -. In this case, the handover request is transmitted on the X2 interface when the X2 interface is present between the source HeNB - and the target HeNB -, and transmitted on the S1 interface when the X2 interface is not present. As a result of the handover request being transmitted, the preparation stage of the handover is started.","The network communication unit  of the target HeNB - receives the handover request from the source HeNB -.","In step S, the HeNB function control unit  of the target HeNB - confirms that the handover request received in step S includes the information indicating that the UE  has the LIPA connection, and confirms whether or not the target HeNB - (self station) supports the LIPA.
