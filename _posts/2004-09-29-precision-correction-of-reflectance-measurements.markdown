No. 60\/508,830, entitled Method For Increasing Precision Of Reflectance Measurements, filed Oct. 3, 2003.","The present inventive concepts relate to the field of reflectance-based systems, and more particularly to optimizing results and performance of reflectometers.","Reflectance-based instruments have long been in use in a variety of applications. One type of reflectance-based system is referred to as a \u201creflectometer\u201d, used to perform tests in certain medical and laboratory applications. In a typical form, a reflectometer includes one or more light sources configured to generate one or more light signals at given wavelengths. An object under test receives the signal and reflects a portion thereof\u2014referred to as \u201creflectance\u201d. Reflectance is typically considered to be unit-less because it is defined as the ratio of the light actually leaving a sample to the amount that would leave if none were absorbed. In recent years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined reflectance in terms of this kind of mathematical model, rather than provide a physical reflectance standard. One or more detectors or sensors are oriented to receive the reflected signals. A processor analyzes the characteristics of the received reflected signals and produces a test result.","Such reflectometers are sometimes used for performing tests on a reagent test strip. In such a case, the test pads on the test strip may be incrementally tested to determine the presence of analytes in a liquid test sample absorbed into the test pads. Such systems may be used for performing urinalysis tests, as one example. That is, the level or presence of an analyte in a liquid test sample can be determined by causing a given test pad to absorb some of the liquid test sample, (e.g., a sample of urine) and then by reading associated reflectance values for the test pad with a reflectometer. Based on the reflectance characteristics of the signal reflected by the test pad, the reflectometer determines the presence or level of the analyte in a given test pad. As an example, a test pad changes color to indicate the level or presence of the analyte in response to absorption of urine from a urine sample. The characteristics of a reflected signal are a function of the make-up and color of the test pad and the wavelength of the light source. Consequently, a change in color of a test pad causes a corresponding change in the characteristics of the reflected signal.","Test strips are typically produced according to industry accepted formats. In the case of urinalysis reflectometers, test strips can come in formats having different lengths, such as, for example, 3.25 inch lengths or 4.25 inch lengths. Within each format, a test strip is defined according to its configuration, i.e., the number, types and order of test pads included on the test strip. Generally, each test strip configuration is uniquely identified. Implicit in a test strip identification and\/or confirmation, therefore, is the test strip format and the test pad configuration. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such test pads may include, for example, pH, ketone, nitrite, and glucose test pads. In order for the reflectometer to produce valid results, the test strip must be identified by format and configuration, so that the reflectometer has a proper context to evaluate the received reflected signals, or reflectance values derived therefrom. That is, a reflectometer needs to know that a received reflected signal is produced by, for example, a glucose test pad or a ketone test pad.","Reagent cassettes can also be tested using a reflectometer, in a manner very similar to that used for the test strip. Such reagent cassettes include a test region that provides visual indications of test results, similar to the test pads of the test strips. The test region can produce a series of lines that embody the test results.","There are numerous rapid test assays in the market utilizing immunochromatography devices. Most are limited to YES\/NO answers because of their poor quantitation (i.e., poor ability to measure or estimate quantity with precision). To achieve a higher level of quantitation, reflectometers can be used to subjectively examine the colored bands formed on a test product. However, reflectance measurements in a reflectometer are prone to many sources of error because the positioning and height of the test strip or reagent cassette can greatly alter the amount of photons that reach the detector. Even slight differences in the height of a test product can alter the reflectance value obtained, thus becoming a source of error when measuring analyte concentration by reflectance measurements.","Some systems attempt to address these circumstances with a straightforward ratio-ing of wavelengths. The problem with just rationing the wavelengths is that there is great difficulty in associating meaning to such numbers and they do not lend themselves to processes or algorithms that utilize the related reflectance measurements for generating subsequent information or test results. For example, one process that uses reflectance values is the \u201cK\/S\u201d transformation for linearizing reflectance measurements, which is given by the equation:\n\n()=(1)\/(2*)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nHere, a ratio of wavelengths would not result in a reflectance value R useful in such an equation. Similar problems would be realized in other functions that rely on the use of R.\n","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, provided is a method of correcting reflectance comprising determining a reflectance constant for a test product at a first wavelength for which reflectance does not substantially change with the presence of a test substance, with the test product loaded with the test substance, determining a reflectance at a second wavelength for which signal-to-noise ratio is maximized and determining a measured reflectance at the first wavelength, and determining a corrected reflectance as the product of the reflectance with a ratio of the reflectance constant to the measured reflectance.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, provided is a reflectance-based system including reflectance correction, the system comprising transmitters for transmitting signals at different wavelengths to a test product and detectors configured for detecting reflectance at the different wavelengths from the test product, a set of storage devices configured for storing reflectance values, a set of processors configured to execute a program configured to implement a method of correcting reflectance. The method comprises determining a reflectance constant for a test product at a first wavelength for which reflectance does not substantially change with the presence of a test substance, with the test product loaded with the test substance, determining a reflectance at a second wavelength for which signal-to-noise ratio is maximized and determining a measured reflectance at the first wavelength, and determining a corrected reflectance as the product of the reflectance with a ratio of the reflectance constant to the measured reflectance.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, provided is a computer program code embodying instructions for execution by at least one processor to perform a method for correcting reflectance in a reflectance-based device comprising transmitters for transmitting signals at different wavelengths to a test product and detectors configured for detecting reflectance at the different wavelengths from the test product, a set of storage devices configured for storing reflectance values.

In the preferred embodiment, improved intra-assay precision results are achieved by correcting reflectance readings of a colored particle or substance by using a ratio of a predetermined reflectance constant to the actual measured value at a wavelength removed from the colored particle and substance and unaltered by changes in concentration of that particle or substance.","Representative Reflectance-Based Instrument",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","120","140","100","100","110","120","130"]},"Referring to , a collection of test product insertion components  for use with reflectometer  is shown. A carriage  is configured for insertion in input port  of the reflectometer , with a test product. Carriage  includes an insert region  within which a test product insert  configured to hold a test product (e.g., a reagent test strip  or cassette ) may be placed. In the preferred form, insert  includes a first side  configured to hold the reagent test strip  within a slot . Representative test strip  includes a plurality of test pads , the configuration of which depends on the particular test strip type. Once test strip  is positioned within slot , the insert  may be loaded into carriage  with side  available for testing. Carriage  may be configured to accommodate a test strip  of any of a variety of lengths, such as test strips of the 3.25\u2033 and 4.25\u2033 length formats, as examples.","A region of interest to be tested may include one or more of test pads . In order for the test pads  to be tested, those pads must be disposed to receive light from the LEDs and to reflect light for detection by light detectors, as described with respect to  and  below. Accordingly, in the embodiment of , test strip  is disposed within carriage  such that the test strip pads  are visible to such components.","Insert  may optionally include a second side  configured to accept reagent cassette . Such reagent cassettes are known in the art. For instance, reagent cassette  may be a disposable, single-use hCG amino cassette for performing a pregnancy test. The reagent cassette , as with the test strip , includes a region of interest that may include a test area defined by a window  and also include identification markings, such as bar codes . The reagent test area is viewable and capable of being tested when the carriage is loaded into reflectometer .","The reagent cassette  has an opening or well  into which a test substance, e.g., a body fluid sample such as urine, is deposited. The fluid sample propagates to the test area defined by window . The reagent cassette test area comprises a test line area, reference line area and control line area, as is known in the art. Test results can take the form of one or more lines displayed in these areas in response to the introduction (or loading) of the test substance. With introduction of a fluid sample, the reagent cassette test area may change color, for example, at least one colored stripe may appear in window .","As an example, the various components of  may take the form of those more fully described in co-owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/821,441, entitled TRAY ASSEMBLY FOR OPTICAL INSPECTION APPARATUS, filed Apr. 9, 2004.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["100","302","302"]},"In this embodiment, the signals transmitted by the LEDs are:\n\n","Test signals from LEDs  are transmitted through a guide  in the direction of arrow A. The test signals from guide  impinge on test product  (e.g., reagent cassette  or test strip  housed within carriage ) at an angle of about 45\u00b0, in the illustrative embodiment. Light reflected from the test product  in the direction of arrow B passes through aperture , after which it impinges on convex mirror  (not shown in ), which redirects and focuses the reflected signals in the direction of arrow C. In this arrangement, due to the orientation of mirror , the path of the reflected signals takes about a 90\u00b0 turn after leaving the test product . The reflected signals propagating in the direction of arrow C pass through aperture  and converge at aspheric lens . Aspheric lens  diverges the reflected signals and the diverged reflected signals continue to propagate in the direction of arrow C. The reflected signals impinge on detector . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the shapes and arrangement of mirrors and lenses need not specifically conform to or be limited to those shown in the illustrative embodiment of .","Upon receipt of the reflected signals, detector  translates those signals into an image comprised of data representing reflectance values associated with the test product , and tests results are derived therefrom. In this embodiment, detector  is a charge coupled device (CCD) comprised of a matrix of 2048 pixels configured to receive the reflected signals. Data from the reflected signals are recorded pixel-by-pixel as the reflectance values. Pixel data are grouped and associated with portions of the test product . As a result, reflectance values for test portions of the test product  are stored.","Reflectance Correction","The present invention achieves increased precision in the reflectance measurements of a reflectance-based device, such as the reflectometer  described above in . In such a reflectometer, test results may be determined by processing measurements of the reflectance of test areas comprised of particles or substances that become colored in response to the introduction of a test substance to the test product, such as an analyte. Differences in parameters having no relationship to the concentration of the analyte can causes differences in the reflectance values, and thus errors in the test results. The correction provided by the present invention allows for better calibration of such reflectometers, and thus better results. For example, a reagent cassette may include a white band having particles that respond to the analyte by turning red and blue. In such a case, as an example, the red particles may form a red line in the presence of the analyte. In a test strip, a certain area may be similarly configured.","In accordance with the present invention, reflectance readings of the colored particle or substance are corrected using a ratio of a known reflectance constant (R), to a measured reflectance value (R), both determined at the same wavelength (\u03bb). The wavelength \u03bb is chosen to be a wavelength for which reflectance is substantially unaltered by the introduction or concentration of the analyte to be tested. This wavelength would typically be removed spectrally from that used to obtain test results for the colored particle or substance. Choosing the wavelength \u03bb in this way ensures that any differences between the known reflectance constant Rand the measured reflectance value Rwill not be a function of the analyte, but rather a function of one or more other error causing factors previously discussed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","402","302","360","404","406","410","404"]},"A correction module  may also be included in the functional modules  of . In the illustrative embodiment, correction module  implements a method for correcting reflectance values in accordance with the present invention. A method in accordance with the embodiment is provided in the flowchart  of . Using such a method, intra-instrument error caused by inaccurate reflectance measurements is reduced. The method implements reflectance correction according to the following equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere\n\n","Returning to step B, in step  the wavelength \u03bb is determined for which reflectance is relatively unaltered by the concentration of the analyte, i.e., has substantially no reflectance due to binding chemistry with the test product. Thus, any changes in the reflectance are presumed to be due to variations in the membrane, instrument, or test product orientation (e.g., test strip height), and not as a function of the concentration of an analyte. Variations in reflectance caused by these factors are often observed at all LED wavelengths, so regardless of the wavelength, reflectance correction is appropriate. In the illustrative embodiment, the source is an IR LED source having a wavelength of about \u03bb=850 nm, for which the reflectance of the white band of the test product is substantially unaltered, regardless of the introduction or concentration of an analyte. As an example, for gold sol labeled conjugate this IR wavelength is appropriate because little or no IR reflectance is associated with this label. The reference wavelength chosen can be a wavelength other than the IR, so long has it does not exhibit any substantial signal changes associated with increasing analyte concentration.","Ris determined in step , and may be referred to as the wavelength constant. In the illustrative form, this value is determined by averaging numerous runs and obtaining the average reflectance over those runs for the wavelength \u03bb Thus, the wavelength constant may be experimentally determined as an average reflectance across several measurements. It could also be determined over several reflectometers. Otherwise, the wavelength constant could be determined using predictive techniques or, in some cases, the wavelength constant could be based on information generally known. For wet nitrocellulose membrane affixed to a polystyrene test strip, as an example, Rmay be assigned the value of 75%. By using this known value for the IR, variations at all of the measured wavelengths can be corrected by using the ratio shown in Equation 2. Raw reflectance values used in any algorithm are adjusted in this manner, before they are incorporated into any specific algorithm or function  (also see step  of ).","R is determined in step , as the reflectance value measured using the wavelength with the highest signal to noise (SNR), here represented by \u03bb\u2032. Choosing the wavelength where SNR is the highest is preferred because doing so allows the noise to be most easily distinguished from the actual reflected signal. Thus, such a wavelength allows for the best calibration of the reflectometer using the correction of the present invention. In this embodiment, \u03bb\u2032 is chosen to be about 525 nm, which is the wavelength for which the SNR for reflectance of the red particles embedded within the white band of the test product is maximized. Alternatively, a wavelength could have been chosen that maximized reflectance of the blue particles. In this embodiment, Ris determined by sending a pulse scan from an LED at wavelength of \u03bb\u2032=525 nm.","Ris determined in step  as the reflectance observed at the wavelength \u03bb, which is the wavelength for which Rwas determined. It is, therefore, the wavelength that demonstrates no significant signal changes due to increased analyte concentration. Since \u03bb=850 nm in this embodiment, Ris the reflectance determined through the IR filter of the reflectometer when the IR source transmits a signal at a wavelength of about 850 nm. In this embodiment, Ris determined by sending a pulse scan of IR at a wavelength of 850 nm. This pulse scan is sent immediately after the \u03bb\u2032=525 nm pulse scan, or at least close enough in time so that there is no significant change in conditions relative to the conditions at the time of the \u03bb\u2032=525 nm pulse scan. If conditions between scans are allowed to change significantly, Equation 2 above may not continue to be valid for a given calculation.","Rand Rcan both be stored in the set of storage devices  of ; the measured value R can also be stored in this set of storage devices. With Rand Rknown, a ratio can be determined as is shown in Equation (2) above, i.e., as [R\/R]. From these known values, the corrected reflectance Rcan be determined for the wavelength \u03bb\u2032 by correction module  of , and as is shown in step  of .","In , decision box  indicates that the steps  through  can be carried out numerous times during operation\u2014as a continuous or periodic calibration. That is, if the answer to the question in box  is yes, then the process could continue to box . If the answer is no, then the process could continue to step  where Rcould be used by the processing functions module . The corrected reflectance Rcould then, for example, be used in K\/S linearization algorithm depicted by the following equation:\n\n()=(1)\/(2)\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nIn some embodiments, the test box  could be omitted and the process would go from box  directly to box .\n","To illustrate an example of results using the above aspects of the present invention, a 7 sample, 3 replicate run of a rapid PSA (Prostate specific antigen) immunochromatography strip gave the reflectance's before and after the correction shown below in Table 1. Here the Capture Band is a monocloncal anti-PSA striped onto the nitrocellulose and the Collection Band is rabbit anti-goat antibody.
