The government may have certain rights in the present invention.","The present invention provides a method for treating diseases caused by either an excess or diminution of Vitamin D. In another embodiment, it provides a method for testing the activity of both 24-hydroxylase [24(OH)ase] and C\/EBP\u03b2 as well as for testing the effect of a compound on said activity. In a further embodiment, a method is provided for the selective induction of CCAATT\/Enhancer Binding Protein \u03b2 (C\/EBP\u03b2).","Vitamin D is a prohormone of several active metabolites that behave as hormones. Serious diseased states have been associated with the deficiency of vitamin D, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. The most biologically reactive metabolite of vitamin D is 1,25(OH)D.","Vitamin Dis a secosteroid responsible for a diverse array of biological responses that include maintenance of calcium homeostasis, immunomodulation and selected cell differentiation. It is formed in human skin by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. In the skin, previtamin Dis synthesized photochemically from 7-dehydrocholesterol and is slowly isomerized to vitamin D. Vitamin Denters the circulation and binds to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) for transport. DBP-bound vitamin Dis biologically inert. It is converted in the liver, at the C-25 position by a cytochrome P-450 enzyme, into 25-hydroxyvitamin D(monohydroxyvitamin D), the major circulating form of vitamin D. In the kidney and in other tissues, 25-hydroxyvitamin Dis further hydroxylated to a more metabolically active form known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D[1,25(OH)D] which functions to increase calcium absorption from the intestine and promote normal bone formation and mineralization. Hence, Vitamin D is an important substance required for calcium homeostasis in the human body.","The biologically active metabolite 1,25(OH)Dinteracts with the cell to evoke various biological responses in at least two distinct ways. One way that 1,25(OH)Dmay interact with the cell is via a nuclear receptor for the regulation of gene transcription. ((2:65\u2013109 (1992), 11:189\u2013216 (1991), -, Norman, A. W, Bouillon, R., and Thomasset, M., Eds., pp. 146\u2013154, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, Germany (1991)). The nuclear receptor for 1,25(OH)Dis the Vitamin DReceptor (VDR). It is a member of family II of the hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors. VDR has been fully characterized and is primarily localized in the nuclear compartment of the cell.","In the cell nucleus, VDR, in the presence of 1,25(OH)D, heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This dimeric complex binds to a vitamin D responsive element (VDRE, characterized by direct repeats of the hexamer AGGTCA spaced by three nucleotides) and activates vitamin D responsive genes. 1,25(OH)Dbinds to its intracellular receptor, the VDR, with high affinity and specificity resulting in transcriptional activation of vitamin D target genes such as those for the bone proteins osteocalcin and osteopontin. The nuclear receptor for 1,25(OH)Dhas been shown to be present in 30 different tissues and it belongs to the same super family of proteins that includes receptors for the steroid hormones, retinoic acid and thyroxin (2:65\u2013109 (1992), 2:3043\u20133053 (1988), 3:331\u2013366 (1982)).","The 1,25(OH)D-VDR complex also regulates a key metabolic enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase [24(OH)ase]. Activation of this enzyme occurs through receptor binding to discrete regulatory regions within the promoter of this gene. Once activated, transcription levels of 24(OH)ase increase and a greater quantity of the protein is produced. The 24(OH)ase protein then functions, in a negative feed back loop, to metabolize 1,25(OH)Dto the biologically inert trihydroxy vitamin D[1,24,25(OH)D] by hydroxylating C24. This inert intermediate is later metabolized to calcitroic acid.","In addition to the cell nuclear response evoked by 1,25(OH)D, it has been recently discovered that 1,25(OH)Dalso mediates biological responses by a rapid non-nuclear mechanism (-, Norman, A. W., Bouillon, R., and Thomasset, M., Eds., pp. 146\u2013154, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, Germany (1991); and 115:1476\u20131483 (1984)). Recent discoveries have identified a series of rapid cell-surface signaling effects of 1,25(OH)Dthat occur within seconds to minutes of exposure of cells to this steroid hormone (1,25(), pp. 233\u2013256, Feldman D. M, Glorieux, F. H., Pike, J. W., Eds., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., (1997)). Evidence supporting the existence of a membrane receptor for 1,25(OH)Dthat mediates the initiation of rapid responses in some cells is described in 264:20403\u201320406 (1989); and 269:23750\u201323756 (1994). An example of cell-surface 1,25(OH)Devoked responses include the opening of voltage-gated Ca.sup.2+ channels in rat osteosarcoma cells, as described in 127:2253\u20132262 (1990) and 249:F117\u2013F123 (1985), as well as other rapid effects in kidney, as described in 259:205\u2013208 (1989).","The 1,25(OH)Dmetabolite functions to enhance intestinal absorption of dietary calcium and it plays a key role in the mobilization of calcium stores from bone. A disruption in calcium homeostasis can lead to many diseased states including rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, osteopenia, osteosclerosis, renal osteodystrophy; skin diseases, such as psoriasis; thyroid diseases, such as medullary carcinoma; brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease; parathyroid diseases, such as hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, pseudoparathyroidism or secondary parathyroidism; liver and pancreas diseases, such as diabetes, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice or drug-induced metabolism; intestine diseases, such as glucocorticoid antagonism, idiopathic hypercalcemia, malabsorption syndrome, steatorrhea, or tropical sprue; kidney disease, such as chronical renal disease, hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets or vitamin D-dependent rickets; and lung diseases, such as sarcoidosis.","The treatment of these diseased states requires a fundamental balancing of Calcium homeostasis that, if not monitored appropriately, can lead to hypercalcemia, that may cause soft tissue calcification which can also lead to death. There is therefore a need to both reduce and\/or prevent the risk of hypercalcemia, which is a potential threat in the treatment of vitamin D3 deficiency associated diseases, and to treat those who suffer from high calcium serum levels.","The present invention provides a method for treating diseases caused by either an excess or diminution of Vitamin D. In another embodiment, it provides a method for testing the activity of both 24(OH)ase and CCAATT\/Enhancer Binding Protein \u03b2 (C\/EBP\u03b2) as well as for testing the effect of a compound on said activity. In a further embodiment, a method is provided for the selective induction of C\/EBP\u03b2. In particular embodiments, is provided a method for reducing the risk of hypercalcimia when administering 1,25(OH)Dor its analogs for the treatment of vitamin D diseases.","The present invention is primarily based on the discovery that the 24-hydroxylase gene contains two putative binding sites (one proximal and one distal) for C\/EBP\u03b2 and that C\/EBP\u03b2 binding to these sites increases the transcription rate of 24(OH)ase by binding to these sites (i.e., the proximal binding site is the important site for the enhancement of transcription), and therefore it enhances 1,25(OH)Dinduction of 24(OH)ase transcription. Further, C\/EBP\u03b2 mRNA is upregulated in the presence of 1,25(OH)D, which is indicative of the activation of 24(OH)ase transcription. mRNA induction and 24(OH)ase production are sensitive markers of vitamin D activity in vivo. Hence, both C\/EBP\u03b2 and 24(OH)ase mRNA levels can be used to measure vitamin D activity. Thus, by controlling the cellular concentration of C\/EBP\u03b2 the rate of 24-hydroxylase transcription can be increased or decreased thus affecting vitamin D activity in vivo. Additionally, it has been determined that C\/EBP\u03b2 enhances vitamin D receptor transcription by activation of protein kinase A.","In particular, the current invention relates to the molecular action of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D[1,25(OH)D], 24(OH)ase and C\/EBP\u03b2 and concerns the therapeutic properties of C\/EBP\u03b2 for the regulation of cellular responses affecting Vitamin Dconcentration. More specifically, the present invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising C\/EBP\u03b2 for the enhancement of 24(OH)ase transcription and the maintenance of calcium homeostasis. A method for the reduction of 24(OH)ase transcription activity by the administration of a test compound found to block C\/EBP\u03b2 activity is also provided.","The methods of the invention are useful for treatment of hypercalcemia, elevated serum calcium, that may cause soft tissue calcification, which can be life threatening. Other diseased states for which the methods of the invention may be used in conjunction with the administration of vitamin Dand\/or its analogs include rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, osteopenia, osteosclerosis, renal osteodystrophy; skin diseases, such as psoriasis; thyroid diseases, such as medullary carcinoma; brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease; parathyroid diseases, such as hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, pseudoparathyroidism or secondary parathyroidism; liver and pancreas diseases, such as diabetes, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice or drug-induced metabolism; intestine diseases, such as glucocorticoid antagonism, idiopathic hypercalcemia, malabsorption syndrome, steatorrhea, or tropical sprue; kidney disease, such as chronical renal disease, hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets or vitamin D-dependent rickets; lung diseases, such as sarcoidosis; and for treatment of any other disease in which vitamin Dor its pro-drugs are involved.","In a first embodiment the invention is a pharmaceutical composition that includes an effective amount of a C\/EBP\u03b2 protein, or the nucleotide sequence coding for the protein, or a fragment coding for the active region of the protein, for the treatment of diseases associated with excess 1,25(OH)D, such as hypercalcemia. Methods for the treatment of such diseases, using the C\/EBP\u03b2 protein, or the nucleotide sequence coding for the protein, are also described.","In a further embodiment a method is described for reducing the risk of hypercalcemia when administering 1,25(OH)Dor its analogs for the treatment of vitamin D deficient disease, which involves the administration of a composition containing the C\/EBP\u03b2 protein, or the nucleotide sequence coding for the protein, along with the administration of 1,25(OH)Dor its analogs.","In another embodiment is provided a method for testing both the activity of C\/EBP\u03b2 and 24(OH)ase for determining whether a possible compound exhibits inhibitory effects on 1,25(OH)Dactivity in a cell (e.g., LLCKL cells, kidney cells, COS monkey cells, UMR Osteoblastic cells or even skin) which method includes applying the test compound to a viable cell, determining the amount of C\/EBP\u03b2 mRNA or C\/EBP\u03b2 in the cell following the delivery of the test compound (e.g., by microinjection, etc.), and comparing the concentration determined (of mRNA or the C\/EBP\u03b2) to a control; an increase in the amount of C\/EBP\u03b2 mRNA or C\/EBP\u03b2 in the cell relative to the control indicates the compound has an inhibitory effect on the concentration of 1,25(OH)Din the cell, where as a decrease would mean that it has an enhancing effect.","In still another aspect, the invention provides a method for determining whether a candidate compound increases or inhibits C\/EBP\u03b2 activity, which comprises inducing C\/EBP\u03b2 activity in vivo in a cell (such as LLCKL Kidney Cells, COS monkey cells, UMR Osteoblastic or skin cells), biopsying cells in which the C\/EBP\u03b2 was induced, dividing the biopsied cells into two groups, adding a tagged monohydroxyvitamin Dto a first group of cells and thereafter measuring the amount of tagged dihydroxyvitamin D, adding a tagged monohydroxyvitamin Dplus the candidate compound to a second group of cells and thereafter measuring the amount of tagged dihydroxyvitamin D, wherein a lesser amount of tagged dihydroxyvitamin Din the second group tested indicates activation and a greater amount indicates inhibition of C\/EBP\u03b2 activity or induction thereof.","In yet another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition containing a mutated C\/EBP\u03b2 protein is provided. As an example, the mutated C\/EBP\u03b2 protein may contain a defective 24(OH)ase binding region, i.e., caused by a mutation(s) in the nucleotide sequence coding for the C\/EBP\u03b2 protein between basepairs \u2212395 to \u2212388 and basepairs \u2212964 to \u2212955 of SEQ. ID. 1. These mutations can be generated by standard procedures well known to those skilled in the art, such as by causing a point mutation. (i.e., by U.V. light) or by gene rearrangement. The pharmaceutical composition includes an acceptable biological carrier, wherein an effective amount it is suitable for treatment of a disease associated with diminished calcium absorption, such as osteoporosis. A method for the treatment of a disease associated with diminished calcium absorption in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition that comprises an effective amount of a mutated C\/EBP\u03b2 protein, is also provided.","A pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a protein that inhibits C\/EBP\u03b2 activity, with a biologically acceptable carrier, is also described, along with a method for the treatment of a disease associated with a vitamin D3 deficiency. This method includes administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition that has an effective amount of a compound that inhibits C\/EBP\u03b2 activity. A method for the selective induction of C\/EBP\u03b2 involving the administration of a pharmaceutical composition that includes 1,25(OH)Dor its analogs is also described.","In the studies herein described, using gene chip arrays a gene heretofore unknown to be induced by 1,25(OH)D, was found to be activated by 1,25(OH)Dby a factor greater than 50% in kidney. The protein was isolated, verified by Northern Blot analysis of kidney as well as osteoblastic mRNAs, and found to be a CCAATT enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C\/EBP\u03b2). The C\/EBPs are a family of transcription factors that regulate genes of the acute phase response as well as genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and cell type specific genes. Previous studies have indicated that C\/EBP family members are expressed in kidney and osteoblasts and are involved in the regulation of IGF, prostaglandin G\/Hsynthase 2 and osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts.","Through the herein described studies, the inventors have discovered two putative C\/EBP\u03b2 binding sites in the 24(OH)ase promoter and have marked the enhancement of VDR mediated 24(OH)ase transcription in the presence of C\/EBP\u03b2. These sites are located at positions \u2212395 to \u2212388 and \u2212964 to \u2212955, in the promoter region of the 24(OH)ase gene. For a description of the 24(OH)ase gene and reporter region see: Ohyama, Y, Ozono, K et al 269 10545\u201310550,1994 (24()), Zierold, C, Darwish, H M and DeLuca, H. F. 91: 900\u2013902 (1994), Kerry, D. M., Dwivedi, P. P et al 271: 29715\u201329721 (1996) and for the Human 24(OH)ase promoter\u2014Chen K. S. and DeLuca H. F. 1263: 1\u20139 (1995) herein incorporated by reference.","Since C\/EBP\u03b2 is induced by protein kinase A activation in different cell types including osteoblasts, it is indeed possible that the cross-talk of the PKA signaling pathway, and PTH with 1,25(OH)Dmay converge on changes in C\/EBP\u03b2 expression. Thus, studies have been conducted to examine the mechanisms involved in the modulation of VDR mediated 24(OH)ase transcription by C\/EBP\u03b2 as well as the role of C\/EBP\u03b2 in the cross talk we have observed between the protein kinase A signaling pathway and PTH and 1,25(OH)Dinduced 24(OH)ase transcription.","These studies have established C\/EBP\u03b2 as a novel 1,25(OH)Dtarget gene and that it is a key factor in the regulation of 24(OH)ase as well as in the cross talk between PTH and 1,25(OH)Daction. A greater understanding of this novel cofactor and target protein involved in 1,25(OH)Daction will provide important new insight in our understanding of the mechanism of 1,25(OH)Daction in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis. See Example 1, herein.","Relatively few 1,25(OH)Dregulated genes are known in target tissues maintaining calcium homeostasis. Our results using Gene Chip array (which are the first to apply Gene Chip arrays to the study of 1,25(OH)Daction (Peng et al. abstract ASBMR meeting, October 2001), confirmed that the gene expressed in highest concentrations in the kidney in response to 1,25(OH)Dis 24(OH)ase (43 fold induction). Another gene besides 24(OH)ase activated by a factor greater than 50% by 1,25(OH)Dand verified by Northern blot analysis was C\/EBP\u03b2 (, A\u2013C). There are two putative C\/EBP\u03b2 sites, in the rat 24(OH)ase promoter and in our results we have observed markedly enhanced 1,25(OH)Dinduced 24(OH)ase transcription in the presence of C\/EBP\u03b2 (). Thus, by applying Gene Chip arrays to the study of 1,25(OH)Daction, we identified a novel 1,25(OH)Dtarget genes and have used this information to begin providing new insight into the mechanism of 1,25(OH)Dtranscriptional regulation in the kidney.","The identification of C\/EBP\u03b2 by Gene Array as a transcription factor induced by 1,25(OH)D, which we have found enhances 24(OH)ase transcription, has provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating 1,25(OH)Dtarget gene expression and represents an extension of current understandings related to VDR mediated 24(OH)ase transcription.","C\/EBP\u03b2 has been demonstrated in the kidney. Our results represent the first evidence of 1,25(OH)Dupregulation of C\/EBP\u03b2 in kidney as well as of C\/EBP\u03b2 mediated enhanced VDR mediated 24(OH)ase transcription (, A\u2013D). We found that in addition to kidney the regulation of C\/EBP\u03b2 also contributes to the effects of 1,25(OH)Din osteoblastic cells (, B). See Examples 2 and 3, herein. These findings establish C\/EBP\u03b2 as a novel 1,25(OH)Dtarget gene and indicate for the first time a role for C\/EBP\u03b2 in the regulation of 1,25(OH)Dinduced 24(OH)ase transcription. These findings have led to the specific embodiments of the present invention.","Although specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described, it should be understood that such embodiments are by way of example only and merely illustrative of but a small number of the many possible specific embodiments that can represent applications of the principles of the present invention. Various changes and modifications obvious to one skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the present invention as further defined in the appended claims.","The term \u201csubstantially identical\u201d refers to nucleic acid or amino acid sequences having sequence variation that do not materially affect the nature of the protein (i.e. the structure, stability characteristics, substrate specificity and\/or biological activity of the protein). With particular reference to nucleic acid sequences, the term \u201csubstantially identical\u201d is intended to refer to the coding region and to conserved sequences governing expression, and refers primarily to degenerate codons encoding the same amino acid, or alternate codons encoding conservative substitute amino acids in the encoded polypeptide. With reference to amino acid sequences, the term \u201csubstantially identical\u201d refers generally to conservative substitutions and\/or variations in regions of the polypeptide not involved in determination of structure or function.

A method for the treatment of a disease associated with a vitamin Ddeficiency, which involves administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition that includes an effective amount of such a compound that inhibits C\/EBP\u03b2 activity, is also within the scope of the present invention.","The present invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions prepared for storage or administration that comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of the present invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will be in the range of about 1 mu.g\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg. The particular dosage will depend on the route of administration, the type of mammal being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific mammal under consideration, as well as the characteristics of the specific compound: for example, potency, bioavailability, metabolic characteristics, etc. These factors and their relationship to determining this amount are well known to skilled practitioners in the medical arts.

The present invention further provides for a polypeptide which comprises an amino acid sequence which has at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95% identity, most preferably at least 97\u201399% identity, to that of SEQ ID NO:2 over the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2.","In another aspect of the present invention methods for the competitive and selective inhibition of the 24(OH)ase promoter sequence is provided. By using recombinant techniques well known to those skilled in the art, mutated forms of the C\/EBP \u03b2 gene\/protein can be obtained that contain mutations in the coding region that allows C\/EBP \u03b2 to bind to the 24(OH)ase promoter sequence, e.g., using site directed mutagenesis targeted to positions \u2212395 to \u2212388 or \u2212964 to \u2212955 of the C\/EBP \u03b2 gene (i.e., SEQ. ID. No. 1). The mutated forms of the C\/EBP \u03b2 protein can be screened to determine potential competitive inhibitors of 24(OH)ase enhancement, such screening mechanisms are well known to those skilled in the art.","A potential expression system allowing for the screening of competitive inhibitors of C\/EBP \u03b2 enhancement, would be to ligate the 24(OH)ase promoter to the Chloramphenical Acetyl Transferase (CAT) reporter gene using an appropriate plasmid and to transfect that plasmid into a suitable cell (such as LLCKL Kidney Cells, COS monkey cells or UMR Osteoblastic cells). The ability of a given C\/EBP \u03b2 mutated protein to inhibit 24(OH)ase enhancement can then be tested by introducing the mutated protein into the cell (e.g., by microinjection or co-transfecting a vector coding for the C\/EBP \u03b2 along with or without an inducible promoter) and determining its effect via CAT activity. Those C\/EBP \u03b2 mutated proteins which reduce or inhibit 24(OH)ase enhancement (i.e., by binding to the gene but not affecting enhancement) can then be selected and used for the treatment of calcium deficient diseases. This expression system can also be slightly modified and used to screen for small molecules that have an inhibitory effect on C\/EBP \u03b2 enhancement, as well. Selective inhibition can be achieved using recombinant nucleotides which encode an antisense sequence targeted to the C\/EBP \u03b2 binding site of the 24(OH)ase promoter. These sites are located at positions \u2212395 to \u2212388 and \u2212964 to \u2212955, in the promoter region of the 24(OH)ase gene.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1263: 1\u20139 (1995) herein incorporated by reference. Methods for generating antisense sequences are well known in the recombinant arts and standard protocols can be used. See the examples below for further details.","Hence, in another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition containing a mutated C\/EBP\u03b2 protein is provided. As an example, the mutated C\/EBP\u03b2 protein may contain a defective 24(OH)ase binding region, i.e., caused by a mutation(s) in the nucleotide sequence coding for the C\/EBP\u03b2 protein between basepairs \u2212395 to \u2212388 and basepairs \u2212964 to \u2212955 of SEQ. ID. 1. These mutations can be generated by standard procedures well known to those skilled in the art, such as by causing a point mutation. (i.e., by U.V. light) or by gene rearrangement. The pharmaceutical composition includes an acceptable biological carrier, wherein an effective amount it is suitable for treatment of a disease associated with diminished calcium absorption, such as osteoporosis. A method for the treatment of a disease associated with diminished calcium absorption in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition that comprises an effective amount of a mutated C\/EBP\u03b2 protein, is also provided.","Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, the spirit and scope of the invention is by no means restricted to what is described above. For example, within the general framework of: SEQ. ID. 1 and 2 there is a very large number of permutations and combinations possible, all of which are within the scope of the present invention. The examples should not, therefore, be construed as specifically limiting the invention and variations of the invention, now known or later developed, are considered to fall within the scope of the present invention as hereinafter claimed.","Genechip Array Analysis","Studies were done using Affymetrix Gene Chip Array (Peng et al. , October 2001) to study 1,25(OH)Daction in the kidney. Poly (A+) RNA was prepared from kidneys of vitamin D deficient mice (\u2212D) or \u2212D mice injected with 1,25(OH)D. cDNA was synthesized from poly(A+)RNA using Superscript. cRNA prepared using T7RNA polymerase, was purified and biotin labeled. The labeled probe was then hybridized by the staff of the Center for Applied Genomics, DNA Microarray Care facility UMDNJ\u2014New Jersey Medical School to the corrected mouse Gene Chip probe array from Affymetrix and analyzed by Gene Chip 3.0 software. Most array hybridization signals did not change significantly upon 1,25(OH)Dtreatment. Our results using Gene Chip array confirmed that the gene expressed in highest concentration in the kidney in response to 1,25(OH)Dis 24(OH)ase (43 fold compared to the kidneys of vehicle treated mice). Other genes activated by a factor greater than 50% by 1,25(OH)Dinclude C\/EBP\u03b2, an important activator of transcription and FK506 binding protein which has been reported to be important in steroid receptor trafficking as well as in modulating the steroid response.","The induction by 1,25(OH)Dof C\/EBP\u03b2 was verified by Northern analysis not only in kidney but also in osteoblastic cells (). Western blot analysis also indicated induction by 1,25(OH)Dof C\/EBP\u03b2 protein in primary murine osteoblasts (). In addition, we have noted enhanced transcriptional response of 24(OH)ase in the presence of C\/EBP\u03b2 (). Thus by using this technology we have identified a novel 1,25(OH)Dtarget gene, C\/EBP\u03b2, and have used this information to provide new insight into the mechanism of 1.25(OH)Dinduced 24(OH)ase transcription via C\/EBP\u03b2 induction and activation. These findings establish C\/EBP\u03b2 as a novel 1,25(OH)Dtarget gene that plays a key role in 24(OH)ase transcription.","Time Course\/Dose Response Analysis","In time course (0\u201324 h) and dose response (10\u2212101,25(OH)D) studies we examined the induction by 1,25(OH)Dof C\/EBP\u03b2 mRNA in UMR osteoblastic cells, as well as in C\/EBP\u03b2 kidney cells by Northern blot analysis, using C\/EBP\u03b2 cDNA (pMEX C\/EBP\u03b2 expression vector (from Dr. Simon Williams, Texas Tech University School of Medicine). cDNA is removed using Ncol and HindIII. The 400 bp fragment is the N terminal, which is not conserved among the isoforms and therefore is specific for C\/EBP\u03b2 and therefore used for the Northern blot analysis. The time course of induction of C\/EBP\u03b2 is compared to the time course of induction of 24(OH)ase and VDR mRNAs [24(OH)ase cDNA is from K. Okuda and the rat VDR cDNA is from J. W. Pike]. The first significant induction of 24(OH)ase and VDR mRNAs in UMR cells is at 9 h after 1,25(OH)Dtreatment, compared to 3 h for C\/EBP\u03b2 mRNA, . Induction of C\/EBP\u03b2 protein is examined by Western blot using nuclear extracts (antibody from Santa Cruz).","Whether 1,25(OH)Dcan induce other isoforms of C\/EBP\u03b2 can be determined using a 1000 bp Ncol fragment for C\/EBP\u03b1 and a 200 bp Nco I fragment for C\/EBP\u03b4 as isoform specific cDNA probes (pMEX C\/EBP\u03b2 and pMEX C\/EBP\u03b2 have been obtained from Simon Williams).","To determine whether the effect of 1,25(OH)Dis at the level of transcription, studies are done using the rat C\/EBP\u03b2 promoter (nested deletion constructs of the C\/EBP\u03b2 gene promoter ligated into PGL-2 luciferase were obtained from Drs. Centrella and McCarthy). Transfections are done in LLCPK1 cells and UMR cells treated with 1,25(OH)D(10\u221210M). At least 3 separate experiments are done using each cell type. For all studies related to VDR mediated 24(OH)ase transcription, significance is determined by Student's test or analysis of variance. Identification of a VDRE by deletion analysis may be performed to determine if regulation by 1,25(OH)Dis transcriptional.","The Determination of the Specificity of C\/EBP\u03b2 for the Enhancement of 24(OH)ase Transcription","Activation by 1,25(OH)Dof 24(OH)ase transcription (using the rat 24(OH)ase promoter (\u22121367\/+74 phCAT) in the presence of C\/EBP\u03b2 (using 0\u20138 \u03bcg pMEX C\/EBP\u03b2 expression vector) is examined in LLCPK1 renal, in COS cells transfected with hVDR and osteoblastic cells. Two C\/EBP\u03b2 sites are present in the rat 24(OH)ase promoter [at \u2212395\/\u2212388 (TTGGCAAG) and at \u2212964\/\u2212955 (TTCCAGCAAT)]. To determine the involvement of each site in the C\/EBP\u03b2 observed enhancement, rat 24(OH)ase promoter deletion mutants (671\/+74 phCAT contains both VDREs at \u2212151\/\u2212137 and \u2212259\/245 but not the distal C\/EBP\u03b2 site; \u2212291\/+74 contains both VDREs but neither C\/EBP\u03b2 site) can be used. Loss of C\/EBP\u03b2 enhancement using the mutant constructs indicates the involvement of C\/EBP\u03b2 binding sites in the 24(OH)ase promoter. Then, gel shift studies are done using both sites and GST C\/EBP\u03b2 (from Drs. Centrella and McCarthy) to verify C\/EBP\u03b2 binding to the putative site(s). The specificity of C\/EBP\u03b2 for the enhancement of 24(OH)ase transcription is determined using the OPN promoter construct (\u2212777\/+79) from Dr. David Denhardt).","The Role of C\/EBP\u03b2 in the Cross Talk Between PTH and the PKA Signaling Pathway and 1,25(OH)D","Since C\/EBP\u03b2 is induced by protein kinase A activation in different cell types including osteoblasts and CREB binding sites are present in the C\/EBP\u03b2 promoter it is indeed possible that the cross-talk of the PKA signaling pathway and PTH with 1,25(OH)Dmay converge on changes in C\/EBP\u03b2 expression. These studies determine whether pretreatment of osteoblastic cells with PTH (10 nM for 4 h) followed by treatment with 1,25(OH)D(10 nM for a further 6 h) will result in enhanced C\/EBP\u03b2 mRNA levels over the levels observed with PTH alone or 1,25(OH)Dalone. (The expression of VDR and 24(OH)ase mRNAs under the same conditions is also be examined.)","1,25(OH)D+PTH or 8-bromo cAMP has been shown to result in a 2\u20135 fold enhancement of 24(OH)ase and VDR mRNA levels in osteoblastic cells, above the levels observed with 1,25(OH)Dalone. C\/EBP\u03b2 protein levels are examined by Western blot analysis. Studies are done in UMR cells, in MC-3T3E1 cells as well as in primary osteoblasts. Blots are probed for C\/EBP\u03b1 and C\/EBP\u03b2 to determine the specificity for the \u03b2 isoform and \u03b2 actin is used as a control. At least 3 separate experiments are done per cell line or using primary osteoblasts. Cells are pretreated with 1,25(OH)Dfollowed by treatment with PTH and various time and dose relationships are examined.","cAMP or PTH induced enhancement of 24(OH)ase transcription is due at least in part to an upregulation of VDR. Since two putative C\/EBP\u03b2 sites have been reported in the hVDR promoter (at \u22121490 and at \u2212920; 143) the determination of the effect of C\/EBP\u03b2 on VDR promoter activity is important. We have isolated the hVDR promoter fragment \u22121500\/+60 by PCR and ligated it into the PGL-2 luciferase vector and found in our studies that C\/EBP\u03b2 enhances PKA mediated transcription of the VDR ().","These studies are repeated using the VDR promoter (2\u20134 \u03bcg) in the presence of C\/EBP\u03b2 expression vector (0\u20138 \u03bcg), the catalytic sub-unit of PKA expression vector (1 \u03bcg, MTCEV\u03b1 from G. S. McKnight), or treatment with PTH (10 nM) or 8-bromo cAMP (1 mM) or 1,25(OH)D(10 nM). Transfection is done using JEG cells (which are highly responsive to PKA activation and express VDR) or osteoblastic cells and the specificity for C\/EBP\u03b2 using C\/EBP\u03b1 and C\/EBP\u03b2 expression vectors is determined.","Transcriptional regulation of VDR is not well characterized. The CRE sites (putative sites are at \u2212570 and at \u2212361; 143) are identified by site directed mutagenesis (using the Stratagene site directed mutagenesis kit) and gel shift analysis (purified CREB is available from Robert Rehfuss, Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, N.J.). In addition, whether one or both C\/EBP\u03b2 sites (at \u22121490 and \u2212920; 142) is\/are needed for the enhancement of PKA mediated transcription of VDR is determined using deletion analysis [Nco I site is at \u22121021 of the hVDR promoter (one-C\/EBP\u03b2 site would remain) and an Eco RV site is at \u2212590 (both C\/EBP\u03b2 sites would be deleted but both CRE sites would be retained)] as well as gel shift analysis using both sites and GST C\/EBP\u03b2. From this it can be established that C\/EBP\u03b2 is not only a novel 1,25(OH)Dtarget gene involved in the regulation of 24(OH)ase, but also is a key factor that plays an important role in the cross talk between PTH and 1,25(OH)Daction."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Referring particularly to the drawings for the purpose of illustration only and not limitation, there is illustrated:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["2","3 ","2","3 ","2","3 ","2","3 "],"sup":["\u22123","\u22123"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
