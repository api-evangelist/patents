{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to computer\/telephony integration, and more particularly to an architecture and related method for obtaining computer\/telephony integration (such as value-added voice services, convergent voice-data services, etc.) with certain improved properties.","The concepts of \u201cIntelligent Networks\u201d and \u201cAdvanced Intelligent Network\u201d are known as involving an architecture to implement services such as intelligent call routing on a public telephony network. This technology comprises basically a routing database coupled in a quite direct manner to the telephone network. However, these services are mostly limited to voice telephony and have little or no interaction with the user's information systems.","There are also known so-called \u201cWeb Intelligent Networks\u201d which have the purpose of solving some of the disadvantages of the classical intelligent network architecture by affording greater interactivity. It allows interaction between a subscriber's information system and a service control point (SCP) of an intelligent network via the Internet. By means of such interaction, the subscriber has control over the service execution. (see \u201cIntegrating the Intelligent Network and the Internet\u201d, O'Connell et al, ICIN 96).","Further, so-called computer telephony integration (CTI) technologies offer a wide range of solutions to integrate telephony with computers. CTI applications are numerous and include call-centers, unified messaging (basically text messages available together with voice messages through a single interface), interactive voice response systems, voice browsing systems, automatic call distribution, real time data fetch according to caller identification etc. However all standard CTI solutions are operated on customer premises equipment (CPE). Therefore, they require the subscriber to connect their computer equipment to the telephone network via PBXs or via special telephony interface cards.","A major drawback of such CTI applications is that the function of flexible call routing permitted by the intelligent network technologies is not available when such applications are CPE-based. The reason is that CTI processing is always done after the call has been delivered by the network.","Another known technology is the so-called network or virtual call centers, which provide network-based CTI solutions for call centers. Such technology allows the subscriber to globally control the routing functions of the network (including automatic call distribution) e.g. for routing calls among different sites of the subscriber.","Still another prior art is constituted by a tentative project by a consortium named \u201cParlay\u201d (See parlay white papers at the Internet address www.parlay.org). Such project defines programming interfaces to implement services that control the network behavior. Such interfaces have the purpose of allowing to control the network behavior from software located in the subscriber's information system. However, this Parlay project only defines a programmatic API (Application Programming Interface, and implies that a suitable pre-existing intelligent network infrastructure is available that is capable of providing gateways between the network and the subscriber information system.","A main objective of the present invention is to combine the generic and flexible character of CTI-based solutions to integrate telephony services with computer equipment and information systems, while enabling to deliver advanced telephony functions in a similar way as intelligent network techniques.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a very cost-effective alternative to the deployment of classical intelligent network infrastructure, specially for small and medium-sized telecom service providers.","Still another objective of the present invention is to eliminate the need for costly CPE-based equipment, like PABXs or CTI platforms, and to provide subscribers with greater flexibility while minimizing costly and therefore risky financial investments.","In brief, this is achieved by a communication platform for providing computer\/telephony integration services to remote subscribers, comprising:\n\n","Preferred aspects of embodiments of this communication platform are as follows:\n\n","According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a method for providing computer telephony integration to a subscriber, comprising the following steps:\n\n","Preferred aspects of embodiments of the above method are as follows:\n\n","I\u2014Architecture Description",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"1. Communication Platform","The present invention is mainly embodied by a communication platform  for providing telecommunication value added services to subscribers.","The communication platform comprises the following elements:","a) Hosted Switch ","This is a computer-based node connected to a set of interconnected telephony networks  through interconnection trunks , in a manner known per se. The basic function of the hosted switch is to process and switch incoming calls that are routed to its switching array  via the telephony trunks. Action on the switching array  is performed by a User Telephony Agent , as will be described in the following, via a call control unit .","b) Voice Processing Resources ","These are additional computer resources which can be used in combination with the hosted switch to perform advanced voice processing functions such as voice synthesis, automatic voice recognition, etc.","c) Billing System ","This is a computer system that collects resource usage per subscriber and generates billing information.","d) Subscriber Management Database ","This is another computer-based system that stores subscription information for each subscriber of the services afforded by the communication platform.","e) Access Control Management System ","The basic function of this system is to supervise resource allocation control to user telephony agents, as they will be described in the following, and to track resource usage. This system can physically belong to the hosted switch hardware or it can be implemented on a separate computer system and control several hosted switches.","f) Operational Support System","This is a computer system that provides management and supervision information to the communication platform operators in order to insure the proper operations of the whole platform.","2. Operating Environment","a) Interconnection","The communication platform is interconnected to the telecommunication networks  at the hosted switch level using telephony voice trunks , as indicated above. Regarding the trunk technology, conventional, state-of-the-art TDM (time division multiplexing) trunks can be used together with SS7 signaling or Voice over Internet Protocol (IP) trunks, using H323 or signaling according to the standard Session Invitation Protocol (SIP).","The communication platform  can either be deployed as a telephony network of its own, e.g., it is operated by a competitive local extension carrier (CLEC) that handles the interconnection with a separate, e.g. national network. Alternatively, it can be deployed as a sub-network or a Service Node. In the latter case, it may be connected as an adjunct node to classic switching systems or as an overlay of several nodes, in a manner known per se.","b) User Access","Reference  globally designates the subscriber's computer and telephone system including a number of conventional computers  connected together via an Intranet-type network . Reference  globally designates the telephony system of the subscriber, which is connected to the telephone network  via one or several lines . The computer system ,  of the subscriber is connected to the hosted switch platform  of the communication platform  via a multiplexer  connected to one end of a so-called virtual private network (VPN) data channel (link) , the other end of which is connected to the hosted switch  as will be described in greater detail below.","It can be seen that the hosted switch  has no access to the telephony local loop of the subscriber. Instead it has a data communication to the user over the Internet via said VPN link .","This VPN link is used for data communication between a user telephony agent  hosted by the hosted switch  and the subscriber information system , .","It should be noted that, when the hosted switch needs to establish a voice communication (e.g. an outside call redirection) towards a called party in the subscriber system  (as will be described below in greater detail), the hosted switch has two options:\n\n","\u201cIntelligent Agents\u201d are a recent concept in software engineering. Detailed information about such agents is available e.g. on the Web site www.agent.org.","Agents are generally described as software entities that:\n\n","An important feature of the present invention is that the communication platform  uses User Telephony Agents (UTAs)  to provide network-based CTI services to subscribers (typically one UTA per subscriber).","From a hardware standpoint, each UTA is hosted by the hosted switch platform  to handle calls on behalf of the subscriber.","From the standpoint of software components, UTAs are logically part of the respective subscribers' information systems , . This is performed by a Telephony Agent hosting service provider  included in the hosted switch platform  and which provides a secured remote extension of the user's Intranet  via the above described VPN link  and multiplexer .","The main function of an UTA is to handle incoming telephone calls on behalf of the respective subscriber, using as necessary the call processing and voice processing resources available in the communication platform . The basic call control is performed by a call control unit  connected to the switching array .","Advantageously standard computer telephony application and programming interfaces (APIs), for instance interfaces such as Java Telephony Application and Programming Interfaces (JTAPI) or Java Intelligent Network (JAIN) interfaces, known per se, are provided in the hosted switch's telephony agent hosting service provider  and used for ensuring suitable interface between the agents  and the hosting service provider .","The voice processing resources  available in the communication platform  can be used by an UTA to interact with the caller in various ways, for instance to play or record announcements, to recognize DTMF signals, synthesize or recognize live voice, etc.","Another important aspect of the present invention is the ability of the hosting service provider  to control resource access and track resource usage for each UTA .","More particularly, each hosted UTA has corresponding resource allocation information stored in correspondence therewith in the subscriber management database , so that the UTA, via the access control management system , is prevented from using more resources than the user subscription permits.","Additionally, detailed records of resource usage (logging) by each UTA  are kept by the access control management system , e.g. for billing purposes by the billing system .","II\u2014Services Description","First of all, each user telephony agent is a piece of software that must have been developed according to the subscriber requirements, and tested. This step involves standard software engineering activities that is outside the scope of the present invention. The starting point of the services provision is the UTA software code of a given subscriber.","Service provisioning involves the following steps:","1. UTA Packaging","Each time a new subscriber wants his UTA to be hosted by the communication platform , a process designated as UTA packaging is executed for combining the UTA code with authentication information so that the communication platform can perform appropriate security checking before safely letting the UTA use the communication platform resources.","UTA authentication has a double goal:\n\n","In association with the installation of the UTA  of a new subscriber, the communication platform's subscriber database  must be configured with corresponding subscription information so that the access control manager  can let the UTA use call-processing or voice-processing resources within the limits of the subscription.","This subscription information includes for instance the following information:\n\n","When the steps described above have been successfully completed, the UTA is activated and the communication platform can start delivering and emitting calls to and from this UTA. These operations include the following:","a) incoming calls","Incoming calls are routed through the interconnection trunks  to the hosted switch which is in charge of handling the call (it should be noted in this regard that a communication platform may include several hosted switch platforms  each hosting several UTAs , so that an incoming call from network  first has to be routed to the appropriate platform ).","The access control management system  then checks that the UTA of the subscriber to which this incoming call is intended has sufficient authorized resource capabilities to handle this incoming call in addition to other calls currently handled. If so, the call is delivered to the UTA.","The UTA then requests the appropriate resource allocation to handle the call. The UTA may choose to:\n\n","Again, for each resource consumed by the UTA, the access control manager system  checks whether the UTA's allowed resources are sufficient.","When the call is complete, all the resources allocated to this call are released. The access control management system  then issues a report to the billing system  that keeps a history of resource consumption.","It should be noted here that, since the access control management system has real-time knowledge of resource usage for each UTA, prepaid billing schemes can be easily implemented.","As the UTA operates within the subscriber's information system  from the logical standpoint, it may interact in real time or close to real time with other agents or data (or more generally software components) located within anywhere in this information system. Of course, such interaction during the handling of an incoming call should be performed with sufficient speed to avoid any undesirable latency in providing vocal information to the caller after hanging off.","For avoiding such risk of latency without being dependent from e.g. abnormally low bandwidth at the VPN link  The communication platform can also provide local, caching storage to the UTA to satisfy latency requirements when serving large numbers of callers.","b) Outgoing Calls","The UTA  can also issue outgoing calls. Such calls are either handled by automatic voice processing resources  or connected to live agents through Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). An example of such application is the management of outgoing\u2014outgoing to the telephone network, that is\u2014marketing calls, preferably with predictive dialing techniques known per se.","Resource allocation and billing for outgoing calls is preferably similar or identical to the ones for incoming calls.","III\u2014Practical Comparative Example","A comparison between a standard CTI architecture and a CTI agent-based set-up according to the present invention will now be made with particular reference to  in a practical application of voice browsing. In , identical or similar parts as those of  are designated as far as possible by the same reference signs.","1. Voice Browsing Application Using Classic CTI","The basic purpose of a voice browsing application is to provide information stored in electronic form to callers. It allows the caller to navigate in the available information using the DTMF tones generated by his telephone keyboard or automatic voice recognition.","Voice is one medium to access information amongst many others (such as PC-based navigators, WAP telephones, Personal Digital Assistants, etc.), and a voice browsing application is typically designed using the well-known multi-tiered IP architecture as shown in .","Such architecture, entirely located at the subscriber premises, includes a first tier  of voice access services, a middle tier  of information services (typically business application services) and an final tier  of storage information services (typically data servers). The first tier  includes the voice browsing application itself , CTI middleware  and CTI hardware  for connection to the public telephone network .","More precisely, the first tier  houses the whole CTI hardware and software, with the following (known per se) features:\n\n","The communication platform  as described with reference to  allows a service provider to virtualize the voice front-end part of the voice browsing applications, as shown in .","The hosted switch , located in the network, hosts the voice browsing front-end and can access the needed specialized voice processing resources located in the communication platform (not shown in its entirety in ).","Telephony lines are no longer terminated at the user site. Instead, the VPN link  extends the User's Intranet () to the remote hosted switch .","For callers, there is no difference between the two architectures. In both cases, the voice services can be provided using for instance geographic numbers, 800-type free phone numbers, shared revenue numbers, etc. . . .","It is understood from the foregoing that the communication platform according to the present invention is suitable for providing network based, hosted CTI services.","More particularly, the communication platform allows to combine the values of:\n\n","Practical examples are numerous. For instance, the present invention allows an Internet service provider to provide, in addition to data services, vocal services (e.g. for unified messaging) which will be handled at the communication platform level, i.e. without major investments and with effective costs for the provider that will be substantially proportional to resource usage.","Another example is the capacity of the communication platform to allocate to a given User Telephony Agent different resources (including the number of available lines for incoming or outgoing calls) as a function of time."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the appended drawings, in which",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
