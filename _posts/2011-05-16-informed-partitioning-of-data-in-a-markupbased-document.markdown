title: Informed partitioning of data in a markup-based document
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are provided for displaying a first portion of a markup language document on a first device and displaying a second portion of the markup language document on a second device for interaction with the first portion (e.g., allowing a smart phone to control a video playing on a separate monitor). A markup language document can be created by a developer, where first and second portions of the document are delineated by a remote device tag. The remote device tag can be used to instruct a first device parsing the document to send the second portion to a second (e.g., remote) device. The first portion of the document can be rendered by the first device, and displayed on a display coupled with the first device; and a rendered version of the second portion can be displayed by a display coupled with second device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In a computing environment, a markup language can be used by an author to create a document that is displayed based at least in part on text provided in the document and accompanying annotations that generally describe how the text is to be displayed. For example, text characters may be included in the document, along with annotations comprising formatting instructions, presentation instructions, procedural instructions, and\/or descriptive markings. In this example, the text and annotations can be used to create a viewable or processable version of the document, which may comprise text, images, media, links, and other viewable components. Markup language can be used for a variety of document types, such as in word processing documents (e.g., using a presentational markup), macro or subroutine documents (e.g., using procedural markup), and web-based documents (e.g., using descriptive markup).","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","It can be appreciated that in some instances it may be desirable to display a first portion of a markup language document on a first device and a second portion of the markup language document on a second device. For example, it may be desirable to display interactive content (e.g., a video) on a monitor, while presenting one or more controls for the content (e.g., play, stop, pause, rewind, etc.) on a smart phone. In this manner, a user can view content corresponding to the first portion of a markup language document on a first device and a control corresponding to the second portion of the markup language document on a second device, where second\/first portion can interact with the first\/second portion.","This can be problematic to achieve in some scenarios, however, such as where a web browser attempts to render a first portion of a web-based document hosted on a first device and second portion of the web-based document hosted on a second device. For example, current web browsers typically require various portions of a markup language web-based document to coexist within in a same web browser, either as sub regions within a top-level document (e.g., as frames), or as separate top-level windows (e.g., \u201cpopup(s)\u201d). However, inefficiencies can arise when attempting to make such portions coexist, and additional computing and\/or networking resources may resultantly be unnecessarily consumed. Additionally, it may not be possible for a single markup language document to provide content for different devices. For example, conventional techniques generally require respective markup language documents for different devices, even where the content is related. It can be appreciated that this requires additional development and other resources at least because there may be substantial overlap between documents that have to nonetheless be created separately.","Accordingly, one or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed that allow a first portion of a markup language document to be displayed on a first device and a second portion of the markup language document to be displayed on a second device, where the first\/second portion can interact with the second\/first portion. In one embodiment for displaying a first portion of a markup language document on a first device and displaying a second portion of the markup language document on a second device for interaction with the first portion, the markup language document is parsed using the first device. Further, the first portion of the markup language document, indentified at least in part by the parsing, can be rendered using the first device, where the rendering can be used for displaying the first portion on a display coupled with the first device. Additionally, the second portion of the markup language document can be sent to the second device, using a remote device tag in the markup language document identified, at least in part, by the parsing. The remote device tag can delineate the second portion, which can be sent for displaying by the second device.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised that provides for using merely one document to display portions of the document on two different devices. For example, instead of needing to write two separate documents in order to display desired content on two separate devices, a web-page developer can merely write a single document, comprising a remote device tag, to partition the document's contents. In this way, one portion of the document's contents can be displayed on one device, and another portion of the contents can be displayed on another device, for example. By partitioning the contents of just one document, for example, it may be easier and more efficient for the web-developer to create content that allows one device to interact with content on another device (e.g., like a remote control).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104"]},"At , the first portion of the markup language document is rendered, based at least in part upon the parsing, for displaying on a display that is coupled with the first device. For example, a rendered first portion of the markup language document can comprise one or more rasterized or vector-based images, which may be sent to a display coupled with the first device. As an illustrative example, a computer, such as a console type component (e.g., gaming console, Internet-based component), can be connected to a television or monitor, for example, for viewing web-based content. In this example, the computer, comprising the first device, can render portions of the markup language document and send images of the rendered content to the television. The television can display the images comprising the first portion of the document on its screen for viewing by a user, for example.","At , the second portion of the markup language document is sent to the second device, using a remote device tag in the markup language document. The second portion is sent so that is can ultimately be displayed by the second device. For example, the second device can be communicatively connected to the first device (e.g., using a network connection), and the second portion can be sent by the first device to the second device so that the second device may render if necessary and display the second portion. As an illustrative example, a console-based computer may be connected to the Internet. In an embodiment, the console-based computer may be wired or wirelessly connected to a router connected with the Internet. The second device may comprise a handheld computing device (e.g., a smart-phone), for example, which can also be connected to the Internet (e.g., using a wireless connection, cellular connection, etc.). Further, in this example, the remote device tag in the markup language document may identify the second device to where the second content is to be sent, or may merely identify that the second content is to be sent to a remote device connected with and\/or within range of the first device.","Having sent the second portion of the markup language document to the second device, the exemplary method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202"]},"In one embodiment, the developer can write merely one document in a markup language that comprises content for two different displays. In an embodiment, the markup language may comprise hypertext markup language (HTML). For example, the remote device tag in the document can comprise an HTML tag with instructions to direct content marked by the tag to be sent to a second device (e.g., off-screen, and\/or remote device), while the non-tagged content (e.g., remaining content in the document) can be further processed by the first device. In one embodiment, the document author may write an HTML document and mark up one or more frames for remote display, for example, using the remote device tag.","As an illustrative example,  illustrates an example embodiment of a markup document  comprising a first and second portion. For example, in the example document , an HTML tag  in the document informs a browser reading the document to render a <span> element  on a remote control device. Further, in this example embodiment , a first portion , comprising the head and body elements, of the document  can be rendered and displayed on a local display coupled with the device comprising the browser, where the browser may be reading the document . As an example, the span element  may comprise an iframe that comprises JavaScript code for rendering an image of a remote control, which can be forwarded to a remote device comprising a display. As an illustrative example, the first portion  may provide for content to be displayed on a television monitor, while the second portion  may provide one or more controls for the content to be displayed on a smart phone. In this example, a user may thus be able to watch a video on their television while controlling the video (e.g., play, pause, rewind, etc.) using their smart phone.","Returning to , at , using a first device, a user may navigate to the document written by the developer. For example, the first device may comprise a computer that utilizes a browser to navigate, such as over the Internet, to a web-document authored by the developer. As an illustrative example, the user may navigate to a website that allows the user view movies, where a movie can be viewed on a large attached display and a connected handheld device may be used as a type of remote control for interacting with the movie. In one embodiment, the markup language document can be received (e.g., downloaded) by the first device from a remote server (e.g., hosting the document).","At , the document can be parsed by the first device. For example, the browser resident on the first device can comprise a browser engine used to read the markup language document. A markup language document can comprise portions of text and annotations, as well as links to images, and other media, for example, that are displayed on a rendered representation of the page. Further, the markup language document can comprise \u201cmarkups\u201d and programming code that may be used to format the rendered portions of the document, and\/or run a program on the page (e.g., using a scripting code). Examples of markup language used to write documents, such as for display on the Internet, for example, can comprise: hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), and\/or derivatives or related languages thereof. In one embodiment, the browser engine can read the markup language document to identify the elements of the document.","At , a remote device tag is identified in the document delineating the second portion of the document. For example, as described in  above, the browser engine reading the example document  can identify the remote device tag  delineating the second portion, comprising the span . In one embodiment, the second device can be identified using the remote device tag in the markup language document. As illustrated in , the remote device tag  identifies the device \u201cmediaremote\u201d as the intended second device. In this example, the \u201cmediaremote\u201d may merely comprise a remote device that is connected in some way to the first device (e.g., over a remote or local network, a router, using a near-field radio connection, etc.).","In one embodiment, the \u201cid\u201d of the second device in the remote device tag may comprise a universal resource identifier (URI), a network address, an internet protocol (IP) address, a Bluetooth ID, or some other locator that identifies an intended second device. In one embodiment, the second device may be identified in the vicinity of the first device, such that the user of the second device can view both a display connected to the first device and a display coupled with the second device at a same time (e.g. substantially concurrently). In this embodiment, for example, the second device may be used as a type of controller for the first portion displayed by the first device, where the user can see the first and second portions at the same time.","As an illustrative example,  illustrates an example embodiment  of an environment where one or more or the techniques described herein may be implemented. In this example , a first device  can be connected with a first display , which may comprise a large screen monitor (e.g., television, computer monitor, etc.); and the second device  may comprise a small handheld computing device (e.g., a smart-phone, handheld console, etc.) with its own integrated (or coupled) display. Further, in this embodiment, a user may be standing in the vicinity of the first display  holding the second device , such that they can view both the first display  and the display of the second device .","In one embodiment, identifying the remote device tag can also comprises identifying the second portion, and consequently identifying the first portion. In this embodiment, for example, the first portion can comprise the portions of the document that are not the second portion, delineated by the remote device tag. The second portion of the document can comprise a section of the document that is intended to be viewed on a (display of a) second device (e.g., remote device), for example, separately from the first portion of the document, which is intended to be viewed on the first device, or rather a display operatively coupled thereto. Further, for example, the second portion may be viewed merely on the second device and the first portion may merely be viewed on the first device (e.g., although other arrangements, configurations, etc. are contemplated).","Returning to , at , the document can be rendered on the first device. As described above, the document may be read by the browser engine and rendered, where rendering can comprise creating a displayable layout of the document using the markup language in the document. For example, the marked-up content of the document (e.g., HTML, XML, XHTML, or other components) can be read and combined with formatting information (e.g., cascading style sheets (CSS), extensible stylesheet language (XSL), or some other stylesheet language) to generate\/render a displayable layout version of the document, to be displayed to a user.","In one embodiment, the rendering can comprise rendering of both the first and second portions of the document by the first device. In another embodiment, merely the first portion may be rendered by the first device. For example, the remote device tag may comprise instructions (e.g., either explicitly, or using a library element) that tell the browser engine what to do with the second portion of the document.","In one embodiment, the remote device tag may comprise instructions that tell the first device to render a displayable layout of the second portion, for sending to the second device. In another embodiment, the remote tag may inform the first device to merely send the second portion, for example, as a markup language portion, to the second device. In another embodiment, the remote device tag may initiate a request to a remote server (e.g., a cloud-based server comprising content) to send instructions (e.g., markup language or scripting code, and\/or a viewable layout) to the second device.","At  in the example embodiment , the first portion of the document is displayed by the first device. For example, as illustrated in , the first device  may be coupled with a first display , such as locally, and the rendered first portion  can be displayed on the first display . It will be appreciated that the first display is not limited to being locally coupled with the first device. For example, the first and second displays may both be remotely coupled with the first device, such as over a network connection (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, or a remote network system). In the example embodiment  of , the first display may comprise a monitor or television connected by wire, or a display that connects remotely to the first device, such as over the Internet. Further, the first display may connect to the first device using a wireless local network connection (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, near-field radio, etc.).","Returning to  at , the user can view the first portion displayed by the first device, and may decide to create or initiate a connection between the first device and a second device. As an example, the rendered first portion of the document displayed to the user may notify the user that they can interact with the first portion using a second device. As an illustrative example, the document may comprise a webpage where the first portion of the webpage comprises interesting content, such as a movie, game, or interactive website. Further, in this example, the webpage can inform the user to connect a second device to use as a type of interactive control for the content.","Often, interaction with web-based content on a television or monitor using typical television remote controllers or console controllers can be frustrating. For example, web-pages are usually optimized to be interacted with using typical input controls (e.g., a keyboard and mouse). Further, some web-pages may wish to develop customized controls, such as for interactive media, gaming, etc. In one embodiment, the second portion can be customized by the document author to provide interactive controls particular to the document contents (e.g., of the first portion). Therefore, when the user sees a message to connect a second device, for example, they may choose to connect a handheld computing device (e.g., smartphone) to interact with the first portion of the document so that the second portion that is ultimately provided to a user is provided in a manner that is suitable for the handheld computing device (e.g., smartphone).","It will be appreciated that the connections and interaction of the first and second devices are not limited to the embodiments described. It is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate embodiments for connections and interactions between the first and second devices to share content from a same document. For example, the second portion may comprise particular information that is intended to merely be viewed by the user of the second device (e.g., an online trivia game sending questions to one or more second devices). Further, as another example, the first and second portions (e.g., and third, fourth, etc.) may comprise different parts of the document, intended to be viewed by different connected devices (e.g., to allow multiple participants to control respective characters concurrently displayed on a monitor, television, etc.).","In one aspect, the user may connect the second device with the first device upon being provided an indication to do so, as described above. In an alternate embodiment, in this aspect, the user may already have connected the second device to a network. In this embodiment, for example, the first device may direct the second portion to the second device using an identifier for the network, such as using a URI for the network, for example.","Additionally, as another embodiment, both the first and second devices may be connected to a network (e.g., locally or remotely) and the first device may merely send the second portion to a \u201cclosest\u201d connected device. For example, the network service (e.g., a cloud-based service) may be able to identify one or more devices that are proximate to the first device. In this example, the network service may find a closest device (e.g., or indicate a choice of devices to the user) with which to connect to send the second content.","At  in the example embodiment , the first device can package the second portion, and send the second portion to the second device, at . For example, if the second portion comprises a rendered version, such as a lay-out view of an image, the rendered version of the second portion can be packaged and sent to the second device. As another example, if the second portion comprises markup language, or some code, it can be packaged and sent to the second device (e.g., for rendering by the second device). As another example, if the second portion comprises a request to a remote server to provide content to the second device, the request can be packaged and sent to the remote server, which in turn can send the second portion to the second device (e.g., as a rendered version, and\/or as code to be rendered).","In one aspect, as described above, the first and second devices may be communicatively connected in a variety of ways, for example, thereby providing a variety of ways to send the second portion to the second device (e.g., and communicate back and forth). In one embodiment, a wireless connection (e.g., WiFi, near-field radio, Bluetooth, etc.) between the first device and the second device may be used to communicate, which can comprise sending the second portion, and\/or receiving input into the second device, for example. In one embodiment, a local network connection between the first device and the second device may be used for communication (e.g., a local area network, either wired or wireless, etc.). In one embodiment, a remote network connection (e.g., Internet, intranet, wide area network, etc.) between the first device and the second device may be used to communicate. In one embodiment, a wired connection (e.g., a direct wire, such as a USB, network cable, etc.) between the first device and the second device may be used for communication.","At , the second device can receive the second portion, and display it on a coupled display for viewing by the user. In one embodiment, the second device may comprise an incorporated display (second display) which may be used to display the second portion. In another embodiment, the second device may be coupled with a separate display (second display), such as a monitor or television to display the second portion. Further, in one embodiment, the second device may merely display the rendered version sent by the first device, such as in a lay-out view, for example. In another embodiment (e.g., where the first device does not render the second portion), the second device may locally render the second portion, comprising markup language and\/or script code, for example, to generate a lay-out view for display on the second display.","In one aspect, the second portion sent to the second device can represent content with which the user may wish to interact. For example, the user interacting with the content provided by the second portion may affect the first portion displayed on the first display. As an illustrative example, a video game can provide interactive controls in the second portion that allows the user to use the second device as a game controller (e.g., to input commands). As another illustrative example, a console device may be connected to a television for viewing media, such as TV shows and movies. In this example, the second portion may comprise a TV remote control-type device that allows the user to control watching of the media content (e.g., play, pause, fast forward, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"At , an indication of the input interaction by the user can be sent from the second device to the first device. In one embodiment, the indication of the input interaction can be sent using one or more communication connections between the first and second devices described above. The indication of an input interaction with the second portion of the markup language document can be received at the first device, from the second device.","In one embodiment, the indication of an input interaction with the second portion received from the second device can comprise one or more coordinates of the input interaction with an image displayed by the second device. For example, the second portion may comprise a lay-out of elements comprising controls, which may be respectively identified by coordinates in the lay-out (e.g., pixel grid coordinates). In this example, when the user activates an element, such as by clicking, pressing, swiping, or some other action intended to activate the element (e.g., and thereby activating an underlying control), one or more coordinates comprising the users action can be used for the input interaction indication (e.g., sent to the first device).","In another embodiment, the indication of an input interaction with the second portion received from the second device can comprise one or more vectors for the input interaction. For example, moving an element, or interacting with an element in a particular direction may generate a vector comprising a direction and\/or speed for the movement interaction (e.g., causing a character displayed on the first display to run faster, jump higher, etc.).","In another embodiment, the input interaction may activate a control element that generates (e.g., or continues) a code (e.g., script code or markup language code) comprised in the second portion displayed on the second device. For example, where the second device renders markup language code comprising the second portion, as described above, the input interaction may generate an action in the underlying code, portions of which can be sent to the first device as the indication of the input interaction. As an illustrative example, the second portion may be configured to receive data input from the user, such as alphanumeric characters (e.g., text). In this example, when the user inputs the characters using the second device, the input characters can be sent as markup language code (e.g., describing the characters and display characteristics) to the first device.","At , input data, comprising the indication of the input interaction, can be used to update one or more portions of the markup language document. In one embodiment, the indication of the input interaction can be used to update the rendered first portion on the first device at , which can then be displayed on the display operatively associated with the first device at . For example, if the second portion comprises a game controller for a game being displayed on the first display, the input data may change an element of the game (e.g., move a game character). As another example, the input data may be used to activate content in the first portion, such as to activate an element in the first portion to retrieve content (e.g., using the controller displayed on the second display to activate a control on the first display).","In one embodiment, the indication of input interaction received by the first device may also (or alternately) update the second portion of the document. For example, the users input to the second device may change how the second portion is displayed for the second device. In one embodiment, where the markup language code comprising the second portion resides locally on the second device, for example, the second device may render an updated version of the second portion locally.","In another embodiment, at , if the indication of the interaction input received at the first device calls for the second portion to be updated (YES at ), the second portion may be updated at the first device and the updated second portion can be sent to the second device at . For example, the first device may use the received indication of the interaction input to render an updated lay-out view of the second portion, or may use the indication of the interaction input to update a request to a remote server. In this example, the updated lay-out view of the second portion can be sent to the second device, or the updated request can be sent to the remote server to send an updated second portion to the second device.","At , the updated second portion of the document can be displayed on the display operatively associated with the second device, such as on the second display, and the first device may wait for another interaction with the display of the second portion on the second device, at . If the second portion of the document is not updated by the indication of the input interaction at the first device (NO at ), the first device may wait for another interaction with the display of the second portion on the second device, at . In this way, for example, the user may interact with the second portion of the markup language document displayed by the second device to interact with at least the first portion displayed by the first device.","A system may be devised for partitioning portions of a document, for example, such that different portions can respectively be displayed by different devices. For example, a developer writing a markup language-based document (e.g., a web document) can merely write one document, where a first portion of the document can be rendered for display on a first device, and a second portion can be rendered for display on a second connected device (e.g., connected by a network such as the Internet). In this way, for example, the developer has a simplified way to provide a user with an ability to use the second device to interact with the second portion to control elements of the first portion of the document displayed by the first device (e.g., without having to write separate markup documents for respective devices).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","550","558","550","500","502","558","558","502","552","554","558","552","554"]},"A first rendering component  is operably coupled with the document parsing component . The first rendering component  is configured to render the first portion  of the markup language document  for displaying on a first display , based at least in part upon the parsing by the document parsing component . For example, the remote device tag  identified by the document parsing component  may delineate the first portion  from the second portion . In this example, the first rendering component  can then render the identified first portion creating a rendered version (e.g., a lay-out view comprising images, text, animation, video, other media, etc.) from the markup language in the first portion, which may be displayed by the first display . In one embodiment, the first display may be communicatively coupled (e.g., wired or wirelessly) with the exemplary system .","A sending component  is operably coupled with the document parsing component .

As an illustrative example, the remote device  may be a handheld console, smart-phone, or a type of media player comprising an integrated display screen (e.g. touch sensitive for input) wherein a rendered representation of the second content  can be displayed.","A second document rendering component  is configured to render the second portion  of the markup language document  for the remote device  (e.g., where the second portion  is not received by the second device in a rendered version). In one embodiment, the second portion  sent to the remote device can comprise markup language code identified in the markup language document  by the remote device tag . In this embodiment, for example, the second rendering component  can create a rendered version (e.g., a lay-out view) of the second portion  for displaying on the second display . In one embodiment, the second portion , comprising markup language code, may be sent from the sending component . In another embodiment, the second portion , comprising markup language code, may be sent from a remote server (not shown) at a request of the sending component .
