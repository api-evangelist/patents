title: Business method for aggregation and presentation of the media data
abstract: A method for aggregation and presentation of media data, includes the following steps: launching the application registered for interacting with internet community; authorizing the application in the external systems of the internet community using external Application Programming Interfaces; obtaining the permit from a media data keeper to access his/her media data in the internet community; retrieving the media data from the internet community through the application registered in that particular internet community to allow both the media data keeper and the registered application to access and use the aggregated data; selecting potentially presentable (supported) media data from the previously formed media data bank; presenting a series of the aggregated media data to an individual or corporate user (the recipient). The aggregation and presentation of the media data from the internet community is implemented through computer or telecommunication systems that provide the functioning of the application which obtains media data from various sources, aggregates it, filters, identifies the possibility of presenting the particular media data, sorts it out and implements its presentation.

Areas of Application","The presented invention could be widely used in various areas or spheres of human activity, in particular, in all internet community groups such as business, science, sport, art, culture, music and many others.","2. Background","There is hardly any need in the media data used nowadays in the majority of social networks, blogs or microblogs to be arranged. However, what is really needed is to find a method of accessing and processing this data by its users in a most efficient way. All the news, messages, video clips or any other types of data created by users or third parties could be presented as a specially structured progression of automatic visualizations, which would allow its recipients to access and process the target information in a much more efficient way by significantly reducing the time on such routine computer operations as clicking, filtering, browsing web pages, adjusting the quality or on any similar time-consuming actions.","The Application presented by this invention aggregates the media data from various sources, such as media data feeds belonging to users, their friends or their internet communities, filters the media data, then sorts it out in a particular sequence and, finally, automatically presents the series of target media data as a visualized progression, without users' further interference.","In the presented invention, the process of aggregation and presentation of media data is implemented in the following way:\n\n","In the presented invention, the process of aggregation of media data is implemented by:\n\n","In the presented invention, the internal algorithm of the Application makes a decision of selecting\u2014either including or excluding\u2014and sorting out the media data in a particular sequence by its automatic processing. If, while working with a particular internet community, it is possible to acquire the media data keeper's internal contacts with other users of that internet community, the Application is able to obtain the media data of the third parties, providing the latter give their permission to perform such actions.","In the presented invention, the presentation of the target media data, which had been selected in the process of aggregation, to its recipient is implemented in such a way that there is no need for the recipient to perform such actions as searching for, retrieving or arranging this media data.","Next, the embodiment of the presented invention\u2014the business method of aggregation and presentation of media data, \u2014illustrated in the accompanying drawing (), will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]},"The core of the presented invention is a newly developed Application that aggregates media data from various sources, such as media data feeds belonging to individual users, their friends or their internet communities, filters it, then sorts out the filtered media data in a particular sequence and automatically presents (demonstrates) the series of target media data as a visualized progression, without users' further interference.","In the presented invention, the created Application allows its user (an individual or the internet community):\n\n","To illustrate the employing of the Application and the business method described above, the authors developed the IT Application TvOnFly\u00a9 which is located at http:\/\/tvonfly.com and could be used as an example.","The process of operating the created Application TvOnFly\u00a9 and applying the algorithm of the suggested business method is described in the case-study below.","The user opens the Application web page http:\/\/tvonfly.com. He\/She is informed that the Application could only present media data from his\/her account on the FaceBook social network. He\/She is also informed that the information about either the user or the media data content will not be used for any other but a presentation purpose.","At the initial stage of operating the TvOnFly\u00a9 Application, its user is required to have a registered account with the Facebook and to grant his permission for retrieving the media data from its feed. In case the user has no account, he is offered to register with the Facebook and open one. If he\/she refuses to grant his\/her permission to TvOnFly\u00a9, the latter closes down. The Application TvOnFly\u00a9 is created using open-source technologies, such as HTML, JavaScript and jQuery, therefore, its user is guaranteed confidentiality and protection of any information obtained while operating the Application. The FaceBook API allows any applications registered in its catalogue of checked applications to obtain the data from the Facebook network, providing its user, or a group of users, granted their permission, though with certain restrictions.","The user is authorized in the Facebook social network through the TvOnFly\u00a9 Application. However, the latter, in its turn, does not use the authorized data, but just retrieves the FaceBook authorization interface. Once the authorization is completed and the permission to retrieve the FaceBook user's media content is received successfully, the TvOnFly\u00a9 Application requests the FaceBook network to retrieve its media data, depending on the type of the order the user sends:\n\n","If at least one video clip is submitted as a result of the request, one of the following types of video players, based on the flash technology, is launched:\n\n","The retrieved video clips are collected in the playlist which could be restricted to a certain number of video links, for example, 10. After all the first 10 video clips have been played, the TvOnFly\u00a9 Application sends a request for 10 more video clips. In case, no new clips are received, the TvOnFly\u00a9 Application repeats the initial order.","The TvOnFly\u00a9 Application also allows to view the latest comments to a particular video clip while it is being played.","The TvOnFly\u00a9 Application allows to follow the latest 5 additions from its FaceBook feed as a news line. By clicking on a particular piece of news, the user can open its corresponding web page on the Facebook network.","The TvOnFly\u00a9 Application does not allow its user to switch between the video clips while one of them is being played. However, the user has an opportunity of adding a comment to that particular video clip informing the TvOnFly Application that this video clip is blocked for future viewing in the TvOnFly\u00a9 Application. This command is performed by a set of the following actions:\n\n","the video players involved in the process of viewing have no media controls to allow the user to change the sequence of the video content. The user can only regulate the sound volume by operating a certain switch.","In this way, the TvOnFly\u00a9 Application allows its user to automatically view the latest video clips, news and comments on the same screen while freeing him\/her from performing any traditional computer operating routines. At the same time, the user is given an opportunity to access all the latest data in the media data tape and switch to its viewing when required.","Forming media communities within the FaceBook network would allow those communities to quickly create their own media channels at http:\/\/tvonfly.com, which would further expand their opportunities for developing communication, education and solving any tasks vital for those media communities."],"heading":["DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","A DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","CONCLUSION","EXAMPLE"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
