title: Method and apparatus for generating electric fields and flow distributions for rapidly separating molecules
abstract: A method and apparatus for generating tunable, uniform electric fields in fluidic applications for rapid separation of molecules, such as DNA, is provided. A region receives the molecules to be separated, the molecules being injected into the region by an injection channel connected thereto. Fluidic microchannels or resistor arrays connected to sides of the region inject currents into the region and produce electric fields in the region that can be oriented at any angle. The electric fields can separate the molecules according to size, and can be used to move or manipulate the molecules within the region. Further, the molecules can be separated by controlling fluid flows within the region to manipulate the molecules. One or more reservoirs can be attached to the fluidic microchannels for collecting the molecules after separation, movement, or manipulation.

No. 60\/343,150 filed Oct. 19, 2001, the entire disclosures of which are both expressly incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. MDA 972-00-1-0031. The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to molecule separation techniques, and more specifically, to a method and apparatus for rapidly separating molecules, such as genomic DNA, using electric fields and flow distributions.","2. Related Art","The control of electric fields over large areas in fluidic systems is crucial for the accurate delivery and manipulation of biologically important molecules, such as DNA. Most biologically important molecules, including proteins, are electrically charged. Previous attempts at controlling such molecules involved manipulating same on a microscopic scale using electric fields. For example, in a method known as electrophoresis, charged molecules are migrated through a fluid under the influence of an applied electric field. In pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (\u201cPFGE\u201d), DNA of different sizes can be separated by alternating between uniform fields in different directions across a two-dimensional area of typically 30 cm\u00d730 cm.","In principle, one can use two pairs of electrodes to create tunable fields in a two-dimensional area, one pair for each field component (i.e., vertical or horizontal directions). However, the resulting field is highly distorted, because the electrodes perturb the fields generated thereby. In conventional PFGE systems, this problem is solved by a method that uses many electrodes to clamp the electric potential along a closed contour, known as a contour-clamped homogenous electric field (\u201cCHEF\u201d) method. Fundamentally, this is equivalent to imposing a Dirichlet boundary condition to the Laplace equation governing the electric field. However, the CHEF method is inappropriate for fluidic applications where the array is only \u02dc1 cm\u00d71 cm, because electrodes thereof can interfere with other functions of the array, such as sample loading and extraction. Further, such systems are not effective\u2014even with the 24 electrodes typically used in commercial PFGE apparatuses, the field near the electrodes is not uniform. Additionally, microelectrodes inside fluidic channels are susceptible to erosion and bubble generation.","In the area of fluidic devices, and more particularly, in systems used in electrophoresis, it is desirable that the applied electric field in a layer of electrolyte be uniform. This is particularly true in traditional gel electrophoresis, which is used to assay proteins or nucleic acids, wherein many test samples are run simultaneously and\/or in parallel. Non-uniformity of the electric field in a gel slab of such systems can cause a detrimental \u201csmile effect,\u201d which makes analysis of samples difficult and\/or unreliable. Further, in PFGE, which can be used to fractionate large nucleic acids, not only does the electric field have to be homogenous, but the direction of the field must alternate with respect to the gel slab. Therefore, the ability to generate uniform electric fields in two-dimensional arrays, in addition to the ability to change the direction of such fields, is of paramount importance.","In CHEF systems, such as the system shown in , complex electric fields having no divergence or curl can be generated in the layer of electrolyte using the plurality of electrodes to define an electric potential along a contour. Once the electric potential at each point of the boundary is set (i.e., at each of the electrodes), a Dirichlet boundary condition is established, with the electric potential \u03a6 and the electric field E in the enclosed region of the electrolyte determined by the equations \u2207\u03a6=0 and E=\u2212\u2207\u03a6 when there is no current source (i.e., no electrode) inside the region.","Such an application, however, is not practical for small array applications, because different voltages must be applied to different locations and\/or electrodes. Further, this approach requires numerous electrodes, electrolyte reservoirs, and complex driving circuits. Additionally, the method of is inappropriate for micro-electrophoretic applications, because microfluidic devices are vulnerable to bubbles generated at the electrolyte\/electrode interface inside the device.","Also in the area of fluidic devices, it is desirable to control the flow distribution of a layer of liquid contained therein. A common characteristic of such devices is that the Reynold's number of the fluid inside the device is so small that the flow is always laminar, i.e., non-turbulent. Also, because the layer of fluid is very thin, flow profiles that are usually parabolic can be ignored, and flow can be described in terms of its average flow velocity as a function of two position coordinates, for example, x and y. In addition, it can be assumed that the thickness of the fluid layer is so small that the overall shear force on each fluid element is dominated by the viscous shear between the fluid and the walls of the device. Viscous shear between any two fluid elements that are in different positions can be neglected. Therefore, the current J of the liquid flow is proportional to the negative gradient of the pressure P; that is, J=\u2212\u03c3\u2207P, wherein \u03c3 is the conductance tensor. Because liquid is incompressible, the current has no divergence, and the equation that describes the flow distribution is \u2207P=0.","In flow distribution systems presently used in the art, such as the system shown in , a plurality of contact holes connected to exterior pressure regulators are provided near the perimeter of a region containing, for example, a fluid. This methodology allows for the control of flow distributions of the fluid, because Dirichlet boundary conditions thereof determine the solutions to Laplace equations. Such a system, however, is not practical for fluidic applications, because different pressures have to be applied to different locations, and numerous pressure sources are required.","What would be desirable, but has not yet been provided, is a technique that solves the above shortcomings while providing rapid separation of molecules. What would also be desirable, but has not yet been provided, is a method and apparatus for generating uniform electric fields and flow distributions for rapidly separating molecules.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for generating electric fields using current injectors for rapidly separating molecules.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for generating flow distributions using fluidic microchannels for rapidly separating molecules.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a current injection method for rapidly separating and\/or moving molecules by applying tunable, uniform, alternating electric fields to two dimensional arrays.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a molecule separation and movement device capable of producing uniform fields without requiring the presence of electrodes in fluidic microchannels or regions of the device.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a molecule separation and movement method and apparatus that includes microchannels for sample injection and extraction.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a molecule separation and movement device that can be microfabricated.","The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for generating electric fields and flow distributions in fluidic arrays for rapid separation and movement of molecules, such as DNA molecules. Electric fields generated in a two-dimensional region (i.e., a chamber, matrix, array, or structure having microposts, etc.) allow for the separation and\/or movement of the molecules according to size. In one embodiment of the invention, arrays of resistors connected in parallel to voltage sources on each side of the region allow for the injection of current therein, creating uniform electric fields in the region that can be oriented at any desired angle to separate the molecules. In another embodiment, fluidic channels, such as fluidic microchannels, that act as resistors are connected in parallel along sides of the region to voltage sources for injecting current into the region, the current establishing the uniform electric fields and separating and\/or moving the molecules at the desired angle. In another embodiment, the fluidic microchannels produce uniform flow distributions of fluids in the region which are capable of being oriented at any desired angle. In this case, molecule movement and\/or separation can take place without electric fields. One or more injection channels can be provided for injecting molecules into the region, and the fluidic microchannels surrounding the region can extract molecules from the region and deliver same to one or more reservoirs when separation and\/or movement of the molecules occurs. A device according to the invention can be microfabricated from a fused silica substrate in one lithographic step, and operates at orders of magnitude faster than conventional systems.","The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for generating electric fields and flow distributions in fluidic arrays for rapid separation of molecules, such as DNA.

The fields are established by current injection using arrays of resistors or fluidic channels connected to sides of the region. Flow distributions can be generated in the region using fluidic microchannels without an electric field to move and\/or separate molecules. Optionally, the separated molecules can be channeled into one or more reservoirs connected to the region via the fluidic microchannels.

It is to be understood that fewer or greater that the number of current sources shown in  can be utilized without departing from the scope of the present invention. Each of the current sources controls only the normal component (with respect to the boundary) of the current that is injected into or extracted from the region , thereby satisfying the requirements of a Neumann boundary condition.","In order to generate a uniform electric field, it is necessary to determine the normal component of the current at each point of the boundary of region . A superposition principle can then be used to determine the field distribution of region . Such a process is described in .","As shown in , current sources at the right and left sides of region  are turned off, constant current is injected from the top of region , and the same amount of constant current is extracted from the bottom of region . According to this arrangement, a uniform electric field will be developed in a generally vertical or downward direction, as indicated by the arrows. Since the electric field is proportional to the current, the field will also be uniform and pointing generally downward.","As depicted in , an electric field can be developed in a generally rightward, horizontal direction, by turning current sources on the top and bottom of region  off, and by applying constant current to current sources on the left of region  and extracting same from current sources to the right thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["10","10","10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6","i":["a ","a","b","c","d ","a","d ","a","d ","a","d "],"b":["20","20","20","20","20","20","10","20","20","10","20","20"]},"The total resistances of each of resistor arrays -can be set to a value n times greater than the sheet resistance of region , where n is usually much larger than 1.

Rather, the width of the band can be determined by electric fields lines and\/or stream lines that go through the openings. Therefore, electric fields lines and\/or stream lines can be generated to create narrow bands, wherein the fields lines and\/or stream lines are generated in parallel to each other asymptotically. The current source method of the present invention can achieve such a result, because the fluidic microchannels thereof provide suitable openings for sample injection having uniform flows and electric fields.","In order to provide narrow-band sample injection, fluidic microchannels of the present invention can be grouped into bundles, and each bundle connected to a separate fluid reservoir and\/or electrode.

Additional sizes are considered within the scope of the invention. Under direct current (DC) fields, DNA molecules do not interact with the microposts of sieving matrix , and migrate at a constant mobility, independent of their molecular weights. It has been shown that when fields introduced to such DNA molecules alternate between two directions about 120 degrees apart, the average migration mobility becomes dependent on molecular weight, providing a basis on which to separate DNA of different sizes. Such a phenomenon occurs when DNA molecules become stretched and interact with the microposts.
