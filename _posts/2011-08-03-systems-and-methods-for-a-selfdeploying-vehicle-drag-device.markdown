The government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates generally to vehicles, and more particularly to systems and methods for a self-deploying vehicle drag device.","The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires CubeSats and other picosatellites to be designed to re-enter the atmosphere within 25 years of the end of their useful lifetimes. Without an assistance, it is estimated that a CubeSat may take over 150 years to de-orbit from an 800 km altitude.","One conventional device uses a balloon to assist a CubeSat to re-enter the atmosphere. However, the device requires the satellite to maintain a functioning power system and flight computer. The balloon can be released on command from ground control, and a sub-system on the CubeSat fills the balloon to maintain pressure. Furthermore, the lower earth orbit (LEO) environment contains relatively high levels of atomic oxygen (AO) and solar ultraviolet (UV) which can erode or otherwise degrade certain organic polymers that a conventional balloon device may be made from. Even aluminum-coated polymers can suffer erosion or degradation at microscopic cracks created during manufacturing, storage, and deployment with a conventional balloon device. Though a conventional balloon device may survive the relatively harsh space environment for the long duration currently required by the FCC to de-orbit a CubeSat, such a device would occupy a relatively large portion of the useful volume of the satellite.","Embodiments of the invention can provide some or all of the above needs.

Further technical effects can result, since the drag device can be deployed in the absence of power, communications, or control.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","106","108","104","102","110","102","112","104","114","114","116"]},"Other system embodiments in accordance with the invention can include fewer or greater numbers of components and may incorporate some or all of the functionality described with respect to the system components shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","200","102"]},"At least one panel  of the satellite  can include a releasable door, similar to  in , for covering a compartment, similar to , housing a drag chute or chute body.

Other suitable durable materials can be used for a drag chute or chute body depending on the desired longevity and\/or expected exposure to ultraviolet radiation or other strength and durability requirements for these components.","As shown in , a collapsible member, such as , and associated drag chute  or chute body can be collapsed, compressed, or otherwise folded into a relatively compact shape and fit within a compartment or housing, such as . In one example, a collapsible member and associated drag chute or chute body can be collapsed, compressed, or otherwise folded similar to an automobile sunshade. That is, a collapsible member and associated sunshade can be twisted into multiple overlapping loops, such as about eight or nine overlapping loops, and placed within a compartment or housing . The compartment or housing  with the compact, compressed, or otherwise collapsed collapsible member and associated drag chute or chute body can then be mounted to a single wall or panel of a satellite, such as the satellite  in .","The compartment or housing  can include a releasable door , which may be released by an electrical signal or otherwise may be released by a self-deploying mechanism or technique. One embodiment of a self-deploying mechanism or technique is described and shown below with respect to . When in a closed orientation, the releasable door  can maintain the collapsed or compressed collapsible member and drag chute or chute body within the compartment or housing  until ready for deployment. When in an open orientation, the releasable door  can facilitate deployment or expansion of the collapsed collapsible member and drag chute or chute body to a deployed or expanded orientation from the compartment or housing . In any instance, when the releasable door, similar to  in , is released or otherwise opened, the collapsed or compressed collapsible member can spring outward from the compartment or housing  forcing itself away from the satellite to which the compartment or housing is mounted , and thereby causing the drag chute or chute body to attain a deployed or expanded orientation similar to the chute shown in FIGS.  and -.","In one aspect of an embodiment, a compartment is adapted to maintain the drag chute or chute body and the at least one collapsible member in respective compressed configurations with respect to the vehicle prior to release of the drag chute or chute body with respect to the vehicle.","As shown in , at least one tether  can connect between the drag chute  or chute body and the satellite . In the embodiments of , a tether can be mounted to the drag chute or chute body, and the compartment or housing . In one embodiment, a tether can be made from nitinol, and in certain embodiments, can generate an electrodynamic force on the satellite or vehicle to which it is mounted to. In such embodiments, an electrodynamic force could be useful at relatively high altitudes to slowing down the vehicle or otherwise decreasing the altitude of the vehicle. For example, while certain embodiments of drag chute or drag body may not dominate in generating drag on a vehicle de-orbiting at relatively high altitudes, a electrodynamic force generated by the tether could slow down the vehicle or otherwise decrease the altitude of the vehicle, wherein the embodiments of the drag chute or drag body could then be suitable for generating sufficient drag on the vehicle to de-orbit the vehicle.","In one aspect of an embodiment, at least one tether can connect a drag chute or chute body to the vehicle, wherein the drag chute or chute body is maintained at a predefined distance from the vehicle after the at least one tether is deployed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","702","704","700","702","702","702","702","702","704","702","702"]},"In one embodiment, at least one device adapted to release the drag chute or chute body from the vehicle can include, but is not limited to, an active-type device, a passive-type device, or an electrically activated switch.","In one embodiment, a fail safe type mechanism or methodology can be employed for releasing a drag device from a vehicle. For example, a drag device can be equipped with both an active-type device and a passive-type device. The active-type device can be adapted to release a drag chute or chute body, wherein the drag chute or chute body and the at least one collapsible member are deployed in expanded configurations with respect to the vehicle when the active-type device is activated. Examples of active-type devices can be electrically controlled devices, which may be activated from a remote ground station or from a nearby orbiting vehicle or other satellite. The passive-type device can be adapted to release a drag chute or chute body, wherein the drag chute or chute body and the at least one collapsible member are deployed in expanded configurations with respect to the vehicle when the active-type device is not activated or fails to activate. Examples of passive-type devices can be a film adapted to degrade or erode over time with exposure to ultraviolet radiation or atomic oxygen, a film adapted to degrade or erode over time due to sublimation or an electro-chemical reaction, a latch adapted to degrade or erode over time due to sublimation or an electro-chemical reaction, or a latch adapted to degrade or erode over time with exposure to ultraviolet radiation or atomic oxygen.","In the manner described by the embodiments of , a drag device in accordance with embodiments of the invention can provide a mechanically-deployed, parachute-like drag device without some or all of the system complexity and material requirements imposed by conventional balloon devices. For example, a drag device according to certain embodiments of the invention does not include a sealed volume, and does not obtain its drag shape or profile by way of inflation, therefore pressurant and delivery systems can be minimized or otherwise eliminated, thereby reducing system and component complexity and volume while increasing expected reliability. Furthermore, by not having to be a gas tight system, a drag chute according to certain embodiments of the invention can have greater material flexibility needed to go from a collapsed, stored shape to a deployed orientation. This material flexibility can permit the use of composite constructions, for example, woven-type materials rather than relying solely upon the use of a bulk material film or sheet for a drag chute. In addition, a drag device according to certain embodiments of the invention which does not rely on a gas tight system to maintain its shape during or after deployment can tolerate more severe micrometeorite damage or otherwise may be more durable than conventional balloon devices before its drag function may become affected, thereby permitting use at relatively higher orbits. Further, use of a fiberglass material for certain embodiments of drag chutes can make the drag device optically reflective, thereby making the device and satellite relatively easier to track optically as well as visually. Moreover, the fiberglass material used for certain embodiments of drag chutes may not be eroded or degraded by atomic oxygen or ultraviolet radiation, and therefore such drag chutes can survive the relatively harsh LEO environment to which they may be subjected to during the de-orbit of the associated satellite.","One will recognize the applicability of embodiments of the invention to various drag devices, drag chutes, chute bodies, satellites, tethers, compartments, releasable doors, latches, films, and combinations thereof known in the art. One skilled in the art may recognize the applicability of embodiments of the invention to other environments, contexts, and applications.
