{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to the field of maintaining the privacy of location information.","Computer devices, and especially mobile computer devices such as laptop computers, mobiles telephones, Personal Digital Assistants and so on, may be provided with location software that allows third parties to know the geographical location of the device (and by association, the user of the device).","Taking the example of a mobile device such as a mobile telephone, a location application is run at the mobile device. The location application obtains location information from, for example, a navigation satellite system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). Other types of location information may be used. For example, the identity of the network cell in which the mobile device is located can provide crude location information to the location application, accurate to within, say, 1 kilometer. Alternatively, the identity of an Access Point (AP) to a Wireless Local Area Network (W-LAN) can also be used to provide crude location information to the location application.","Once the location application has obtained the location information, the location information is made available to third parties. This may be publicly available or restricted to a group of users known to the mobile device user. For example, Alice has a mobile device that has a location application installed on it. The location application uses GPS to find location information. When Alice's location application is turned on, the location application obtains GPS data and keeps an accurate record of Alice's geographical location. Bob is one of Alice's friends, and wishes to know where Alice is, so Bob uses his mobile device to communicate with Alice's mobile device, and the location application provides Alice's geographical information to Bob's device.","There are some circumstances in which Alice may not wish Bob to know where she is, although she wishes to maintain the appearance that her location application is reporting her location. For example, if Alice is a freelance worker, she may work for several different companies, who may be competitors. In this case, Alice may not wish third parties to know where she is, how long she is spending with her clients, and so on. However, she may still wish to use other functionality of the location application, for example a map function. It would be desirable to allow a user to run a location application in a \u201cprivacy mode\u201d; a mode in which the location application is active, but does not report the real geographical location of the device to third parties.","This invention addresses the problem of providing a privacy mode to users of location applications.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of controlling location information at a computer device such as a mobile telephone. Location information destined for a location application is intercepted and obtained. The location application is identified, and a rule is determined for applying to the location information on the basis of the identified location application. The rule (which may be, for example, to amend the location information) is applied to the location information to give amended location information, and the amended location information is then sent to the location application. In this way, control is exercised over what location information the location application receives. The location application need not be aware that the location information has been amended, and so the invention can hide a user's location from, for example, third parties accessing the location application.","There are several ways in which location information can be obtained. One is to intercept location information from an Application Programming Interface that is destined for the location application. However, location information may also be obtained by, for example, determining an identity of a mobile cell to which the computer device is connected, or an identity of an Access Point to a Wireless Local Area Network to which the computer device is connected. The determined identity can then be mapped to a geographical location.","Examples of rules that may be applied to the location information include any of replacing the location information with less specific location information, replacing the location information with location information specified by a user, replacing the location information with previous location information previously approved by the user, replacing the location information with no location information, and making no changes to the location information.","The rules may further comprise varying the amended location information with time prior to sending the location information to the location application. This variation may be based on historical location information, or randomly applied. In either case, it reduces the likelihood of detecting that the location information sent to the location application has been modified in some way.","In some cases, it will not be possible to identify the location application. In this case, a predetermined rule may be applied to the location information to give amended location information, prior to sending the amended location information to the location application.","The method optionally comprises alerting a user of the device that a location application has requested location information. This will allow the user to determine that someone is trying to find his location.","As an option, the method further comprises sending from the computer device to a remote node information relating to the location application, and receiving from the remote node further information relating to the identified location application. For example, if the location application is malware, the further information may be a malware warning or instructions for removing the malware. As an option, the method further comprises terminating the location application as a result of receiving information relating to the identified location application.","The invention may be used for any type of location information. Examples of such location information include Global Positioning System data, an identity of an Access Point (AP) to a Wireless Local Area Network, an identity of a network cell in which the computer device is located, and other types of satellite positioning information.","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer device for use in a communications network. The computer device comprises a location application. A privacy function is also provided that is arranged to intercept and obtain location information destined for the location application. A database is provided for storing a plurality of rules to apply to the location information. The database is provided with at least one rule entry for each identified location application. A processor is arranged to apply the rule to the location information to give amended location information prior to sending the amended location information to the location application.","As an option, the processor is arranged to handle Application Programming Interfaces, and the privacy function is arranged to obtain location information by intercepting location information from an Application Programming Interface destined for the location application. However, other methods of obtaining location information may be used, such as determining an identity of a mobile cell to which the computer device is connected, or an identity of an Access Point to a Wireless Local Area Network to which the computer device is connected. The determined identity can then be mapped to a geographical location.","The database optionally further comprises at least one rule to be applied to the intercepted location information in the event that an identified location application is not stored in the database.","The computer device optionally comprises a user input device allowing a user to enter data for one of populating the database and amending rules.","As a further option, the computer device is provided with a transmitter for sending to a remote node information for use in identifying the location application, and a receiver for receiving from the remote node further information relating to the location application.","The rule may optionally be any of replacing the location information with less specific location information, replacing the location information with location information specified by a user, replacing the location information with previous location information previously approved by the user, replacing the location information with no location information, and making no changes to the location information.","According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a node for use in a communication network. The node comprises a receiver for receiving information from a remote device, the information relating to a location application at the remote device that provides location information to third parties. A processor is also provided for comparing the received information with information stored at a database. A transmitter is provided for sending to the remote device further information relating to the location application.","The transmitter is optionally arranged to send to the remote device a request for additional information relating to the location application.","According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program comprising computer readable code which, when run on a computer device, causes the computer device to execute a method as described in the first aspect of the invention.","According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program comprising computer readable code which, when run on a computer device, causes the computer device to behave as a device as described in the second aspect of the invention.","According to a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program comprising computer readable code which, when run on a node, causes the node to behave as a node as described in the third aspect of the invention.","There is also provided a computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium or a computer readable memory and a computer program as described in any of the fourth, fifth and sixth aspects of the invention, wherein the computer program is stored on the computer readable storage medium\/memory.","Referring to  herein, a device  is provided. This may be any device that uses a location application. In this example, the device  is a mobile device such as a mobile telephone. The device  is provided with a communications device  and a processor  for handling messaging and performing other computing functions. A memory  is provided that stores an Operating System. The Operating System includes Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  that are essentially interface that define the ways in which an application requests services from libraries and other Operating System resources. A location application  is provided. In the embodiment shown in  this is shown as a separate function, although it may easily be implemented as software  stored in the memory or retrievable from a remote node via the communications device . The location application  uses APIs to access location services (which may be, for example, GPS, W-LAN Access Point, network cell and so on).","A location application  is an application such as Google Maps\u2122 that uses geographical location information to illustrate where the device is located. This may be in a graphical format or some other type of format. A location application  may be software installed by the user of the device, or may be a component of the Operating System of the device. Some location applications  allow third parties to access the location of the device. The geographical location may be accurate, for example if it is derived from Global Positioning System data. The location information is less accurate if it relies on, for example, an identity of a cell in a mobile network to which the device  is attached. As cell coverage may extend for several kilometers, the location information gives only an approximate location of the device .","The device is also provided with an input device  that allows a user to input data, for example, a keyboard, a mouse or a touch screen, and a display  that is arranged to show information to the user of the device.","In addition to the standard features described above, the device  is also provided with a privacy function . As with the location application , the privacy function  is illustrated as a separate function, although it may be implemented by the processor by executing privacy software  stored in the memory or retrieved from a remote node via the communications device .","The privacy function  allows the user of the device to control what the location information sent to the location application , and hence what information about the device's location is accessible to third parties.","The privacy function  hooks the APIs that deal with location information. In other words, it intercepts Operating System  calls relating to location information, and identifies that the location information is being sent to the location application . The location information may be altered according to predetermined or user defined parameters, before being sent to the location application . An example of the sort of API that would be hooked in this way is the Windows 7\u2122 location API. The privacy function  identifies that it is the location application  that is requesting location information","Referring to  herein, there are illustrated functions of the privacy function . The privacy function includes an input function  to receive location information  and a further function  to identify the application to which the location information is destined. A table of rules  is provided that maps rules for altering the location information depending on which application is requesting the location information. For example, if Application  is identified, then the rule might be that no modification is made to the location information before the location information is sent to the location application . In the case of Application , the rule may be that no location information is sent to the location application . A function  is provided for applying the rule to give amended location information . The privacy function  also includes an output function  to output the amended location information  from the privacy function  to the location application .","As the APIs that deal with location information have been hooked by the privacy function , the location application  has no way of knowing that the location information provided to it is not the original location information.","Note that another embodiment of the invention does not rely on hooking APIs using the privacy function, but merely intercepting data such as the identity of a mobile cell to which the device  is attached, and querying a database to determine the geographical location of the cell. A similar determination could be made using the identity of an Access Point to a W-LAN. In this case, any instances of the location application attempting to use the identity of a mobile cell or an access point can be intercepted and handled according to the table of rules .","Examples of rules for amending the location information include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n","Rules can be set by the user using the user input  and the display , or may be preconfigured in the rules table .","Rules need not only apply to the location information itself. Rules may also include other actions to take, such as automatically terminating the location application, alerting a remote server that the location application is running, and so on.","A further function of the privacy function is to alert the device  user when a location API has been hooked. In addition to letting the user know that an application is calling a user API, information can be obtained that identifies the application that requires the location information. When the user is alerted to the fact that a new application is attempting to obtain location information, the applicant has the option setting a rule, as described above, for location information being sent to the new application. This allows a user to configure any new application to his or her preferences, or to terminate the application. It also allows the user to become aware of any application that requests location information that is running on the device without the user's knowledge or consent.","In a further embodiment, the privacy function may vary the location information with time. Unless the user is sleeping, they are unlikely to remain in exactly the same location for significant periods of time. There are several ways that this can be done. For example, the location could be moved randomly, or it could use historical data to repeat the user's previous movements within an area. This reduces the possibility that the location application  can detect that the location information that it has received has been altered in some way.","Furthermore, when an application is first identified that requires location information, details of the application can be sent to a remote server. The remote server has access to a database of applications that require location information, and can send a response to the device to assist the device in dealing with the application. For example, if it is determined that the application is malware, then steps can be taken to remove the malware from the device.","If the server cannot identify the application, then information relating to the application may be stored in a database and further information collected from the device in order to attempt to identify the application.","Turning now to , a flow diagram is shown illustrating stages of the invention, with the following numbering corresponding to that of :","S. The privacy function  hooks location information from a location API.","S. An attempt is made to identify the location application.","S. On the basis of the identification, or lack of identification, a determination is made of a rule to apply to the location information.","S. The determined rule is applied to the location information to give amended location information.","S. The amended location information is sent to the location application.","S. In an embodiment of the invention, the user is alerted to the fact that a location application has requested location information. This may include an identity of the location application, and a query for the user to enter an action to take. This may involve certain amendments to the location information, or terminating the location application.\n\nS. In a further embodiment of the invention, information relating to the location application is sent to a remote server. This may be an identity of the location application, the type of location information being sought by the location application, the location in a file system of the location application or any other pertinent information.\n\nS. The remote server responds with further information. This may be, for example, an identity of the location application, or a suggested course of action to take, such as terminating the location application and removing it from the device memory.\n\nS. If necessary, the device takes further action on the basis of the remote server's response.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["20","21","22","1","23","24","25","23","1","25","24","20","20"]},"A program  may also be stored in the memory , with instructions executable by the processor  for carrying out the invention.","It will be appreciated by the person of skill in the art that various modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
