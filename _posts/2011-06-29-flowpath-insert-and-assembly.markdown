{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00019-02-C-3003 awarded by the United States Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and more particularly to flowpath structures for use in gas turbine engines.","Gas turbine engines typically include an exhaust case located at an aft (or rear) portion of the engine, through which hot fluid is exhausted from the engine. When a temperature delta results in a thermal fight, and\/or a complex aero configuration is required, prior art exhaust cases could be undesirably complicated in design and heavy, and could produce too much fluid leakage.","Therefore, it is desired to provide an improved flowpath structure for a gas turbine engine suitable for use in an exhaust case assembly.","A flowpath assembly for a gas turbine engine according to the present invention includes a plurality of flowpath insert ducts arranged in a cascade configuration. Each flowpath duct includes a radially inward wall, a radially outward wall, a first side wall, and a second side wall. A flowpath volume is defined between the inward, outward, first side and second side walls. The first side wall of a given one of the plurality of flowpath insert ducts is positioned adjacent to the second sidewall of an adjacent one of the plurality of flowpath insert ducts in the cascade configuration.","While the above-identified drawing figures set forth an embodiment of the invention, other embodiments are also contemplated, as noted in the discussion. In all cases, this disclosure presents the invention by way of representation and not limitation. It should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art, which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of the invention. The figures may not be drawn to scale.","In general, the present invention provides a flowpath assembly suitable for use in a gas turbine engine, such as in a gas turbine engine exhaust case assembly. A plurality of flowpath insert ducts are provided in a cascade configuration, with side walls of adjacent insert ducts located next to one another such that vane structures can be formed where side walls of adjacent flowpath insert ducts meet. A leading edge piece and\/or a trailing edge piece can be provided at each interface between adjacent insert ducts. A cold frame can be provided to provide radial support such that the flowpath insert ducts can \u201cfloat\u201d relative to the cold frame with the cold frame providing radial support to the engine. Each flowpath insert duct can be provided in multiple parts, such as in two halves that are attached together at respective flanges with suitable fasteners. In some embodiments, cartridge housings can be used to secure adjacent flowpath insert ducts together, using retention hooks and a translating retention plate. Additional features and benefits of the present invention will be appreciated in view of the description that follows and the accompanying figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","10"],"sub":"L"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["24","30","32","24","34","36","32","30","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","30","1","30","2","30","3","30","4","30","5","30","1","30","2","30","6","30","7","30","8","30","6","30","7","30","3","30","4","30","1","30","2","30","6","30","7","30","5","30","1","30","2","30","6","30","7","30","30","1","30","2","30","5","30","6","30","7","30","6","30","7","30","5","30","1","30","2","30","6","30","7","30","30","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["24","24","32","32","32","40","10","32"]},"Each flowpath insert duct  can be made of multiple sub-parts attached together, though in alternative embodiments the inserts  can be of a one-piece construction. In the illustrated embodiment, the flowpath insert ducts  are of a two-piece construction, with a first part A and a second part B that are attached together. A multi-part construction has numerous advantages, including increased ease of repair or replacement of damaged components without requiring repair or replacement of an entire insert duct . The flowpath insert ducts  can be made from suitable metallic or composite materials. For metallic materials, stamping, hydro- and bulge-forming and casting can be used to create the parts.","Each flowpath insert duct  includes side walls - and -, first and second inward wall portions - and -, first and second outer wall portions - and -. The inner and outer wall portions could be integrally formed along with one or both side walls - and - and a single piece, depending on the geometry desired. The side wall -, the first inward wall portion - and the first outward wall portion - are part of the first part A, and generally have a U-shaped configuration. Likewise, the side wall -, the second inward wall portion - and the second outward wall portion - are part of the second part B, and generally have a U-shaped configuration. The first and second parts A and B can further include substantially axially-extending flanges - and -, respectively, located at the inward and outward wall portions -, -, - and -. The flanges - and - can adjoin each other in a close-fitting relationship and accept suitable fasteners (e.g., rivets, bolts, etc.) to secure the parts A and B together with the first and second inward wall portions - and - adjoining each other to collectively define an inward wall and the first and second outward wall portions - and - adjoining each other to collectively define an outward wall. Suitable fluidic seals can be formed by abutment of the wall portions -, -, - and - at the resultant joints. A flowpath volume is defined by each insert duct , bounded by the side walls - and - and the inward and outward walls (including portions -, -, - and -). It should be noted that the shapes of portions of the insert ducts  are illustrated merely by way of example and not limitation. A variety of shapes are possible in further embodiments, as desired for particular applications, such as to provide desired fluidic flow through the flowpath volumes of the insert ducts . The parts A and B of each insert duct  can further include flanges - at the inward and outward walls at both forward and aft ends, to facilitate attachment of the flowpath insert duct  to the ducts  and  with suitable fasteners (see ).","Retention hooks  can be positioned to extend outward (i.e., circumferentially or tangentially relative to the centerline C) along exterior portions of each of the side walls - and -. As shown in , the retention hooks  on the side wall - are positioned in a row proximate an aft edge. The retention hooks  allow for engagement with corresponding structures to help secure the insert ducts , as explained further below.","A leading edge piece  can be positioned at a leading edge of an interface between adjacent flowpath insert ducts . The leading edge piece  can have an aerodynamic contour, such that adjacent side walls of adjacent flowpath insert ducts  can act as vanes to straighten or otherwise influence fluid flow through the exhaust case assembly .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 7A and 7B"],"b":["50","24","50","50","52","54","56","58","60","62","50","50","32","50","32","58","58","50","58","42","42","58","32","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIGS. 6A-7B","FIG. 7A"],"b":["24","24","50","58","52","60","58","52","54","54","38","32","56","52","64","56","56","64","64","62","64","62","64","54","52","62","54","38","32","38","54","56","54","38","54","38","52","32","56","38","54"]},"Any relative terms or terms of degree used herein, such as \u201csubstantially\u201d, \u201capproximately\u201d, \u201cessentially\u201d, \u201cgenerally\u201d and the like, should be interpreted in accordance with and subject to any applicable definitions or limits expressly stated herein.
