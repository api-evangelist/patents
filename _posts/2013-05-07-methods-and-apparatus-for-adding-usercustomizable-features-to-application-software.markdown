title: Methods and apparatus for adding user-customizable features to application software
abstract: An application's users are divided into two groups: administrative users and end-users. Each type of region, produced on an application's screen, is assigned a class. Each actual occurrence, of a region type, is called an instance. An end-user invokes a user-added feature by indicating a screen location and inputting a unique signal. The classes, of the screen-region instances present at the indicated location, determine whether one or more rules are activated. The rules are written by an administrative user. If activated, a rule produces a URL in accordance with an administrative-user-defined template. A value stored in the instances present, at the location indicated when the unique signal occurred, are accessed in a template by including the name of the value as a parameter. Each parameter is substituted by the text-equivalent of its current value. The URL produced can be used to provide the information desired by the end-user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["As provided for under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e), this patent claims benefit of the filing date of the following U.S. Provisional application, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety:","\u201cMethods and Apparatus for User-Customizable Application Software,\u201d Application No. 61\/676,119, filed 2012 Jul. 26 (y\/m\/d).","The present invention relates generally to the user-customization of application software, and more particularly to customization that includes customizable production of a Universal Resource Identifier (or URI).","Communication between application software and a resource, by the production of a Uniform Resource Locator (or URL), is known. (In the singular, application software can be referred to, with increasing levels of brevity, as an: \u201capplication program,\u201d \u201capplication,\u201d or \u201cApp\u201d.) For example, an App for reading emails (such as OUTLOOK from MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Redmond, Wash.) can detect the presence of a URL (or \u201clink\u201d), in an email message, and \u201cactivate\u201d that link. Once activated, a user can \u201cgo to\u201d the URL (i.e., open the page, at the URL, in a web browser), embedded in an email, simply by selecting the link (e.g., \u201cclicking\u201d the URL with a mouse).","A limitation of this type of activation is that it is \u201cstatic\u201d (i.e., the particular URL, embedded in an email, is fixed).","A REST (or a REpresentational State Transfer) approach to web services can allow customizable App-to-App communication via URIs. Web services, however, merely provide a more uniform basis for interchange between Apps (typically, business-oriented Apps). The behavior of the App itself is still determined by the coding of the App producer (e.g., MICROSOFT CORPORATION) and is thus \u201cfixed,\u201d from the perspective of an end-user.","It would be desirable to introduce techniques and methods by which to enable user-customization that includes user-customizable production of URLs and, more generally, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). (Uniform Resource Identifier is a term that covers both URLs and Uniform Resource Names). Such capability would provide a greater range of options by which each user can adapt an App's behavior to the user's particular operating environment and needs.","Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.","Please refer to Section 5 (\u201cGlossary of Selected Terms\u201d), included as the last section of the Detailed Description, for the definition of selected terms used below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["1 Use-Case Scenario\n        \n        ","2 First Embodiment","3 Implementation Strategies","4 Computing Environment","5 Glossary of Selected Terms"]}}}},"1.1 Gate Assignment Software","Large metropolitan area airports (e.g., Logan International Airport, Boston, Mass., U.S.A; IATA code \u201cBOS\u201d) frequently use some kind of App for assigning airplanes to gates.","An example main display, for an unspecified airport \u201cAP1,\u201d using an example gate-assignment App \u201cGAA1,\u201d is shown in . The display of  is loosely based upon the \u201cARIS Gate Manager\u201d product of Ascent Technology, Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.; U.S.A.). However, the display of  is merely for purposes of example, and the techniques of the present invention can be applied to any gate-assignment App with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). More generally, the techniques of the present invention can be applied to any App with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The two main axes of  (such pair of axes labeled ) serve the following functions:\n\n","The gate-assignment chart of  presents a timeline, of how a particular gate is utilized by different airplanes during the day. Vertical line  (also called the \u201cnow line\u201d) indicates the current time at which the chart is being viewed. As can be seen, the current time is approximately 3:05 pm. A period of time during which an airplane remains at a gate is represented by a \u201clozenge\u201d shape. The points at the left and right ends of a lozenge provide, respectively, an airplane's arrival and departure times at a gate. For example,  includes a lozenge , that indicates the following data:\n\n","The gate-assignment chart of  also includes lozenge shapes  and . Some of the data indicated, by each of these shapes, is as follows. Lozenge :\n\n","Using a gate-assignment system like GAA1, a ground-control manager can assign airplanes to gates by creating and moving such lozenge shapes. The graphical nature of the display assists the manager in avoiding conflicts (i.e., two or more planes utilizing a same gate at a same time), since it is immediately obvious whether lozenges within a row overlap. Of course, in addition to avoiding overlap, many other types of rules may need programming into a gate-assignment system. For example, the lozenges can be required to provide sufficient transition time, between one plane's departure and another's arrival. In addition to the types of information discussed above, a lozenge shape typically also includes information about the type (e.g., manufacturer and model number) of an airplane since certain types of planes can only be accommodated at certain types of gates.","1.2 Additional Features Desired","Assume gate-assignment App GAA1 (that can be, as discussed above, any suitable gate-assignment software) has been supplied to airport AP1 by a software company \u201cSC1\u201d (that can be any suitable software supplier). Assume AP1 would like to add a collection of features (let's call the feature collection \u201cFC1\u201d) to GAA1 and that FC1 is unique to the particular needs of this airport. For purposes of example, we will assume an FC1 that includes the following features:\n\n","For each of the above-listed features, it can be appreciated that a convenient user interface would follow a similar pattern:\n\n","While it can be expected that GAA1 will already use mouse clicks for such operations as selecting and dragging lozenge shapes, we will assume that such mouse clicks are never used in combination with the \u201cControl-Shift\u201d (or C-S) key combination. In this case, each feature of FC1 could be activated by a mouse click, when combined with the C-S key combination. This type of mouse click can also be referred to herein as \u201cC-S+mouse-click.\u201d Example types of locations (or regions of a user's screen), for a C-S+mouse click on the gate-assignment chart of , along with the kind of data that might be desired in response, are as follows:\n\n","To further explain the feature-disambiguating pop-up menu, consider the following example. Suppose a C-S+mouse-click occurs at left end  of lozenge shape . This mouse click could be meant to invoke any of the three above-listed features of FC1. In this situation, a pop-up menu can appear, giving the ground-control manager the option of obtaining one of the following three windows: live camera data, current flight status, or local weather.","Without the techniques of the present invention, it can be expected that AP1 would need to obtain, from SC1, customized changes to the source code of GAA1. In many situations, such customer-customized changes are not available, or, even if available, can be too costly for AP1.","Source code changes to GAA1 are not needed if, in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, GAA1 is provided with a facility for extensibility.","Such extensibility enables the following approach:\n\n","The main interface, by which administrative users provide the new features, can be a database where certain kinds of rules can be stored (also referred to herein as a \u201cRules Database\u201d). Administrative users are provided with access to this Rules Database. By simply writing new rules (that follow a specified format) the administrative users are able to add new features.","In addition to access to a Rules Database, the administrative users need the following types of documentation from SC1:\n\n","For each feature of collection FC1, an example screen-region class is depicted in one of .  depicts a screen-region class called \u201cWHOLE_CHART,\u201d an example instance of which is indicated by outline .  shows a screen-region class called \u201cGATE_ROW,\u201d example instances of which, for Gates C1 and C5, are indicated by, respectively, outlines  and .  shows a screen-region class called \u201cFLIGHT_LEG,\u201d example instances of which, for lozenge shape , are indicated by, respectively, outlines  and  (to better emphasize the flight leg regions, lozenge shape  is shown in lighter outline).
