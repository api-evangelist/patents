In particular, high accuracy is necessary for determining miniscule accelerations.","Conventional techniques for measuring acceleration experience limitations in response at high frequency as well as magnitude for small scale changes. An accelerometer measures temporal change of velocity in an inertial reference. Generally, accelerometers have practical limitations in how quickly they respond to changes in acceleration, and thus cannot respond to changes above a certain frequency of change.","Conventional accelerometers yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, an accelerometer instrument is provided for measuring acceleration. The instrument includes a laser, a Mach-Zender interferometer (MZI) with a mirror of known mass attached to a mechanical spring, a detector\/camera, and an analyzer. The laser emits a coherent light beam of photons. The MZI includes first and second beam-splitters along with first and second mirrors. The first mirror has an established mass m and connects to the spring for vibrating substantially perpendicular to its reflection plane. The mechanical spring has an established spring constant k.","In various exemplary embodiments, the MZI has an established weak value Nassociated with the photons in the MZI and based on a known offset \u03b5 for the two beam-splitters. The camera images the beam beyond the second beam-splitter and provides a pointer position measurement shift \u03b4q of the photon intensity profile. The analyzer determines the acceleration \u03b1 based on",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"a","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":"k","msub":{"mi":["mN","w"]}}},{"mi":"q","mo":"."}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"\u03b4","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}},"br":{},"sub":"w "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["N","w"]},"mo":"\u2248","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u025b"}},"mo":"."}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"a","mo":"\u2248","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u025b","k"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"q","mo":"."}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"\u03b4","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}},"In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced.
