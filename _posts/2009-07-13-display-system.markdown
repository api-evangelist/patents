{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention relates to a display system that is updated remotely using wireless communication and in particular, but not exclusively, to such systems comprising low power bistable or multi-stable displays, sometimes referred to as electronic paper. The display system may be used at the point of sale of items in a retail outlet or for similar applications where the information is displayed for long periods to one or many display units powered by batteries. It is an aim of the current invention to provide means by which the power usage is minimised, and the battery life is kept as long as is possible.","It is known to provide point of sale displays however these are generally rather complex with large displays of a commercial advertising nature, have high power needs and often require mains electricity supply. Even less grand displays and battery operated display systems presently available still draw large electrical power, hence, if not mains powered, require frequent battery changes. Moreover, the means for updating such displays is complex, burdensome and\/or can require a user individually to address a display unit for example locally to update display information on the unit.","It is also known that electronic product information can be displayed using a multitude of self-contained display modules or Electronic Shelf Labels (ESLs), such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,888,709 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,313,569. Herein, each ESL is provided with power from a battery, a means of communicating with a central processor (such as infared) and means by which the correct product information may be associated with the correct label. It has been recognised that a key issue associated with the ESL is the power consumption required to maintain the image. Means of re-charging the battery during periods of use have been proposed (such as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,548,282). Power is also kept low by using bistable displays (such as in US 2001\/0020935 A1 and US 2003\/0156090 A1), wherein the principal advantage enabled by the bistable display is to remove the need for expensive display driver software on each device, and allowing the wireless transmission of addressing information directly to the display. That is, the micro-controller and driving software are kept in a single control unit, and not included in the multitude of display units to save cost.","Common to these display systems is the limited information that can be displayed by each display unit or ESL. For example, the information is often limited to numeric information (such as price, and\/or quantity) in combination with information pertaining to icons (such as \u201cSale\u201d, \u201cspecial offer\u201d etc). With such display systems there is a balance between the amount of information that can be displayed and the power required to update and maintain the information.","The present invention seeks to provide improvements in displays and display systems particularly in the retail environment; beneficially to provide low power consuming shelf displays requiring infrequent battery changes such as several years apart, which can provide useful consumer information such as product data including price, price deals, manufacturer, product specification, product name, brand information, stock levels, weight, expiry, product bar code, and the like, and which can be updated remotely from a central system in an efficient and low power consuming manner. Uniquely, the current invention allows much higher bandwidth of information to be displayed than has previously been possible, whilst maintaining the most efficient use of power, and hence long duration of battery life, to be achieved.","An aspect of the invention provides a display system for displaying information at a point of product display in a retail outlet comprising a communicator and a remote display module, the communicator in use transmitting display information to the remote display module and the display module being adapted in a low power mode to display information and in a higher power mode periodically, in a predetermined manner, to communicate with the communicator thereby to obtain updated display information, the display module and the display module being adapted to switch between first and second modes of operation between communications to enable low overall consumption of power by the display module.","Yet another aspect of the invention provides a display system for use in space planning applications.","Other aspects and features of the invention will be apparent from the appended claims and the rest of the specification.","Referring to  there is shown an overview of the display system  according to the invention. At the heart of the display system  is a communicator  which comprises a controller  (sometimes referred to as the RF subsystem), a communications module  which transfers display information to one or more display modules . Beneficially, the communicator  can be centrally located within a premises such as a retail outlet and comprise one or more communication modules  to enable communication with one or more display modules  positioned throughout the premises. Display system  further comprises a communications database  in communication with both the controller  and a display network management module . Display network management module  enables a user to control the communicator  and also to receive information from a product image database  and a product rules engine . In fact the display network management module  might be in the form of a computer software package installed in computer , such as a standard office computer system comprising microprocessor and various memory storage means such as RAM and a hard drive and peripheral devices for interfacing with the user such as a keyboard display and mouse for example having various applications installed to enable functionality of the display network management module  product rules engine  and so on. The product rules engine  comprises an image renderer function , image templates  and a template designer module . Product rules engine  is also in communication with a system rules engine  enabling communication of business rules via business rules database . The system rules engine  is in communication with one or more databases such as retailer databases related to product information for example and also to an external network  such as the Internet and hence the World Wide Web.","Referring to  there is shown a schematic block diagram of communicator  (RF subsystem) comprising controller  having a communications driver  for driving the communications module(s) , wherein communications module  comprises a microcontroller  such as a microprocessor, an RF transceiver  for communicating with the display modules , a crystal  and a memory . One or more communications modules  might be provided in a display system  according to the invention and accordingly controller  is adapted to enable communication via communication driver  with each of the one or more communication modules .","All individual items can additionally comprise local interface connections or input and output ports thereby to enable a user to directly communicate with each individual item (such as controller , communication module , or display module ) using a local display keyboard and mouse for example. Specific reference to such user interface for individual items is not necessarily referred to directly in relation to the following descriptions of components of the system .","Communications Database ","The communications database  is shared between the communicator  and the display network management module . A shared queue of commands and status information is used for passing messages between the communicator  and the display network management module .","Communicator Service","The communicator service consists of software executing on controller  to manage the delivery of commands and data to the appropriate display modules  via a communications protocol such as an RF protocol. The communicator service monitors the communications database  shared queue for new commands that have been added from the display network management module . When a command is detected the communicator service retrieves it from the communications database  and issues a corresponding command to the communications driver  for delivery to a display module .","The communicator service ensures that the communications protocol is used as effectively as possible and issues commands to multiple display modules  to fill timeslots as discussed later. By analysing the queued commands the communicator service is able to ensure that if there is data available then each timeslot is filled to optimise data throughput.","When acknowledgements are received from a display module , the corresponding command in the database queue is updated with status information. The communicator service uses sessions for display module communications, allowing multiple commands and their data to be transmitted to a display module  in a single session.","Communications Driver ","The communications driver  consists of software to interface between the communicator service application and the communicator hardware . When commands are delivered by the communicator service they are passed down to the communications module  for scheduling and transmission to the appropriate display module . The communications driver  is responsible for managing the hardware interface between the communicator  and the computer or controller . It provides notification of when the communicator  hardware is added or removed from the system and manages the system resources necessary to ensure communication can take place.","Communications Module ","The communications module  consists of a microcontroller , memory , an accurate crystal  and an RF transceiver . It receives commands and data from the communications driver  and processes these to output them over the RF transceiver  using the communications (RF) protocol. It manages the multiple sessions between the communicator service and the display modules , sending data to display modules  in their appropriate timeslot and processing the received acknowledgements. Communications module  is also responsible for ensuring that synchronisation signals , or SYNC frames are periodically transmitted within a precise timing window making it possible for all display modules  to remain in synchronisation.","A synchronisation signal  or SYNC frame consists of multiple packets of data or sync packets . Each packet contains an offset from the centre of the sync period to enable a display module to re-adjust its clock and take care of any drift that may have occurred since the last SYNC frame was received. The SYNC frame also contains a timeslot identifier and may have a number, say up to two, display module  addresses to indicate what display modules  need to receive their next command.","Data and commands are transmitted during each timeslot to the appropriate display module . Commands may take multiple timeslots to complete. The communicator  manages the content for each timeslot based on the commands and data that have been issued by the communicator service.","Display Module ","The display module  comprises low-power multidisplay , such as bistable LCD available from ZBD Displays Limited of Malvern, UK, and as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,249,332 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,456,348. The display  preferably is able to display a matrix array in a multitude of sizes, typically with 320\u00d7240, 400\u00d7160 or 224\u00d790 pixels, in which the pixels form a graphic image with between 60 and 200 dpi. Typically, this means that the display has dimensions in the order of 25 to 80 mm in height and 70 to 100 mm in width with an ability to display images in a 100 dpi resolution. Key to the invention is that the image is maintained on the display without any power, wherein power is only used to update the image being displayed. Consequently the battery life for such a display can be in the order of many years. Other bistable displays may be used, including electro-phoretic ink, bistable cholesteric, bistable twisted nematic, ferroelectric liquid crystal and\/or electro-chromic displays. Common to all of the displays that are suited to the use is that they must retain the image for long periods without any applied power; the image should be retained despite shock to the unit (such as mechanical shock from knocking or pressing the display, or thermal shock associated with sudden changes in the environment).","The display  is connected to an electronic circuit comprising a microcontroller , memory , an RF transceiver  such as a half duplex transceiver, a temperature sensor  and a voltage conversion module . The display module  further comprise a power supply  comprising two forms of power for different modes of operation of the display module . Power supply  comprises a solar cell, battery or batteries  such as a lithium manganese dioxide primary cell to enable full operation of the display module  such as enabling communication with the communications module , and to enable a lower power (sleep) mode of operation sufficient to enable the module to synchronise, with the aid of RC oscillator , switching between lower power (eg virtually display only) and higher power modes of operation. In the higher power mode the display module  receives commands and data via the RF transceiver , carries out the actions specified in the commands and responds with an acknowledgement when the action is complete.","The RF transceiver  is used to receive commands and data. Normally the transceiver  is in a low power standby state. It is periodically powered up into receive mode for a very short period. During this period a packet of synchronisation data or SYNC packet  is normally received and the microcontroller uses the data within the SYNC packet  to recalibrate the internal system wakeup clock using microcontroller  to ensure it remains in synchronisation with the main communicator . If the SYNC packet  also contains the network address of the display module  it will remain powered to receive the following command(s) and data packets. Upon completion of a command(s), a command acknowledgement is transmitted containing the command status information. If the SYNC packet  does not contain the network address of the display module  it will immediately return to the low power state until the next SYNC packet  is expected When a command and any associated data have been received, and acknowledgement(s) transmitted, the microcontroller  then place the RF transceiver  in a low power standby mode until the next SYNC packet  is expected and process the command(s).","A display update consists of a command to download an image into memory , followed by a command to update the LCD display . Display updates require differing voltages and timings based on the temperature of the LCD display . During a display  update the microcontroller  obtains a temperature reading from the temperature sensor , generates the appropriate display update voltages using the voltage conversion module  and applies a pre-determined waveform to the LCD display  to perform the update. Before the update the microcontroller  powers off the temperature sensor . After the update the voltage conversion module  is powered off and then the microcontroller  enters a very low power standby state. In standby mode the microcontroller  is placed in a very low power state to conserve battery power. During RF communications the microcontroller  and the RF transceiver  are powered. During a display update microcontroller , temperature sensor , voltage conversion module  and display  are powered.","Communications (RF) Protocol","Referring to  there is a shown schematically a signal  transmitted by a communications module  to a plurality of display modules , wherein the signal  comprises a series of discrete, time separated elements ; each element  comprising a synchronisation or wake up component  and a data or payload component , and being associated with a specific timeslot . Here four timeslots  are used, each having a series of labelled signal elements  associated with its group display modules  conveniently to facilitate the low power but high bandwidth communications protocol. The communications protocol utilises a periodic series  of synchronisation pulses  transmitted by a communications module  to enable time division multiplexing of the data to be sent to the target display modules .","The wake up or synchronisation component  contains information regarding which display modules  the communications module  wants to communicate with in that timeslot  as well as a measure of exactly where in the timeslot the display module  has woken up. This is shown schematically in  wherein it can be seen that series  of sync packets  might comprise a total of 15 packets  grouped symmetrically about a central or primary data packet labelled 0. In order to be synchronised with the relevant timeslot  for a display module , the display module  should enter the higher power mode and turn on RF transceiver  appropriately to receive the primary data packet labelled 0. As shown in , the transceiver is switched on for a duration slightly greater than one data packet (that is up to about 4 milliseconds and accordingly receives all of the sync packet  labelled \u22123 (that is 3 sync packets  away from the primary sync packet labelled 0). Accordingly, microcontroller  is able to recalibrate the clock in display module  in order subsequently more accurately to switch from lower power to higher power modes of operation at the correct time. Beneficially therefore the clock arrangement on an individual display module  can be of relatively low tolerance whereas the primary clock mechanism comprising for example crystal  within the communications module , should be of much tighter tolerance and susceptible to low drift itself. In this manner, the cost of an individual display unit may be kept to a minimum, whilst ensuring that the power used is also minimised (since substantial errors in the synchronisation that may result from using low tolerance clock may cause substantial and un-necessary use of battery power). In  switching operations for a display module  are shown wherein the first drift D is compensated from \u22123 to 0 whereas in the second the drift D is compensated from +2 to 0.","During the period between the sync pulse components  the display modules  are in a deep sleep, or low power, mode running off a low-power RC oscillator . This feature helps extends battery life considerably.","A series  of data packets  are broadcast after each sync pulse components  with the maximum combined time of each signal element , or sync pulse\/data packet burst, being no more than a predetermined period such as one second. Moreover, Listen Before Talk (LBT) is implemented between timeslots  (or signal elements ) to reduce the effect of duty cycle restrictions as shown in . Data packets are acknowledged in groups to increase the protocol efficiency. All packets have a unique ID and are repeated if they fail to get through e.g. due to interference.","Display modules  are also placed into distinct timeslots  based on their address, allowing the polling period to be further extended. This is to ensure an even distribution of displays in a store or retail outlet.","The transmission protocol during the data transfer phase utilises a sliding window protocol using selective repeat. Both the sender and receiver maintain a window of acceptable sequence numbers, acknowledging only those packets that are received without error. The protocol allows communication to a maximum number and preferably two display modules  during a single timeslot .","Communication with display modules  is performed in sessions. Each session can contain any number of commands and their associated data. Sessions can span across multiple transmission elements  for the relevant timeslots. A typical image update command and data may take two to four elements  to complete.","The communication protocol utilises a periodic series of synchronisation pulses transmitted by a communications module  to enable time division multiplexing of the data to be sent to the target displays.","Frequency Allocation","In Europe the centre frequency 869.85 MHz is used as the initial control channel. Data channels are located in the frequency ranges 868.0-868.6 MHz and 868.7-869.2 MHz.","In USA the centre frequency 927.5 MHz is used as the initial control channel. Data channels are located in the frequency range 902-928 MHz.","In other territories suitable frequencies can be allocated to comply with legislation.","Display Timeslot","Each series of display modules  is allocated a polling timeslot  according to an aspect of the display modules address, and preferably the LSB of its address. The exact number of timeslots can be governed by the display configuration transmitted during the initial set-up procedure and a default setting can be 8 timeslots. The number of timeslots should preferably be a power of 2. The grouping of the displays in timeslots can adhere to the following rule: Timeslot=Display Address & (n\u22121) (where n is the number of timeslots available). Here 4 timeslots are used as shown in .","Standard Polling","An individual display module  is adapted to associate with a communications module  that has a matching Network-ID. Once the display is associated with the communications module  it will wake up every appropriate polling period and attempt to find a sync packet . If a sync packet  is not found, it will go back to sleep and wake-up at the next scheduled timeslot . This procedure occurs a programmable number of times, such as ten, and if a valid sync packet  has not been found the display module  attempts to re-synchronise.","The period between sync pulse component  is preferably greater than 1.1 second+10 ms (see ). Preferably this setting is configurable during the initial label configuration. The sync pulse component  actually consists of a series  of back-to-back sync packets  broadcast for the sync pulse period as shown in . The sync pulse packet  contains three primary sets of information, namely:","a field  measuring the time to the centre of the sync pulse period, to allow the display to compensate for the drift of its oscillator,","a list  of the, and preferably only two, addresses for display modules  that the communications module  wishes to communicate with during the timeslot, and","a \u2018timeslot-ID\u2019  stating which timeslot that the sync pulse component  is targeted at, as this enables a faster re-synchronisation time for display modules .","The length of the wake-up period  varies depending on where in the packet structure the display module  wakes-up. As a maximum the display module  stays awake for two packets , and as a minimum 1 packet. If a valid or complete packet  has been processed the RF transceiver  is powered down immediately to conserve power, and preferably so are all electrical components other than those essential in order to enable synchronised switching back on of the display module  to receive data from communicator  at a predetermined future time.","Preferably the system  is configured to operate a LBT (listen-before-talk) feature to deal with any RF interference on the same radio channel. If the transmitter (communications module ) detects interference on the channel that does not disappear within a pre-determined time the communications module  skips that timeslot. This is to ensure that the remaining display modules  stay in sync with the synchronisation component .","The LBT period is defined as: t=t+twhere, tis fixed at say 5 ms, and tvaries between 0-5 ms in a pseudo-random manner with steps of say 0.5 ms. This is set to \u20180\u2019 if the fixed period passes with no interference on the channel. This is shown schematically in .","Data Transfer","The transmission protocol utilises a modified sliding window protocol using selective repeat. According to a standard sliding window protocol, directional data transmission is enabled between two units wherein the transmitter of data fundamentally defines a window size for a finite number of packets of data, all of which packets of data are transmitted to the other, recipient unit. The transmitter does not then send further data packets until acknowledgment of receipt of the first data packet in the series is satisfactorily acknowledged by the recipient unit. Depending on the number of data packets acknowledged by the recipient unit, further data packets are sent in series by the transmitter moving on aggregate a number of transmitted packets up to but not exceeding the defined window size as being transmitted to the recipient unit and not acknowledged or received by the recipient unit. Hence the window of data packets being transmitted slides progressively as individual packets are acknowledged by the recipient unit. However, here a variation is described wherein both the sender and receiver maintain a window of acceptable sequence numbers. The maximum window size is set and each data packet is uniquely identified with a 5-bit (16 unique packets) ID so that the receiver can unambiguously tell the difference between a repeated packet and a new transmission. Only eight unacknowledged packets can be outstanding at any instance. The transmission window extends 8 packets from the oldest unacknowledged packet ID (i.e. the most outstanding packet). The receiver therefore maintains a receive buffer of 8 packets.","The Acknowledgement packet consists of a 16-bit length bitmap that corresponds to the locations in the display receive buffer. A \u20181\u2019 implies that a packet was successfully loaded into that location whilst a \u20180\u2019 implies that no data was received for that slot.","There is provision for transmitting data to up to a predefined number, here two display modules  in each timeslot . Assuming a single display module  address match the following process takes place:","1) Display module  wakes up according to its polling schedule , locates a sync packet  and finds an address match (in field ).","2) Display module  sleeps until sync packet  period expires, and then wakes up ready to process data in payload component .","3) Data is transmitted to the target display module  in bursts of up to a set number, here 8 packets . If this is the first data packet in a session the appropriate command bit is set to reset the packet counts. Each data packet  preferably contains the following information: Network ID, Software Address, Packet ID, Command Information, Payload","4) If 8 packets are received, or the display module  receives the last packet in a burst, it immediately transmits an ACK packet. The final packet in the timeslot  has a command bit set indicating that fact. An ACK will also be sent if the display module  detects more than 3 ms to 5 ms of clear channel as this implies that the sender has stopped transmitting. (This occurs if the transmitter hits the upper limit of its window).","5) The acknowledgement packet contains a list of packets that need to be re-transmitted. This is detailed in the packet structure.","6) The communications module  repeats the failed packets, and fills the remaining packet slots with any more data that remains to be transmitted until it hits the upper limit of its transmission window.","7) This process repeats until either all the data has been sent (end of session bit set), or the time slot  expires.","8) If the time slot expires before all the data has been sent the communications module  will inform the microcontroller  to queue the remaining data for transmission in a following timeslot. This will recommence from the last packet ID that was acknowledged. The communications module  tracks the last packet ID for all open communication sessions.","The communications module  sets the \u2018start of session\u2019 bit at the beginning of a data transmission exchange. (i.e one call of SendPacket( )). This resets the packet IDs at both ends of the link.","The communications module  sets the \u2018end of session\u2019 bit in the command packet when it has no more data to be sent to the display in the current data session. At this point the communications module  keeps the data channel open to the display until it receives a packet with the \u2018session-end\u2019 bit also set. The sending of this bit will also cause the packet-ids to be reset at both ends of the link.","Even if there is no more data to be transmitted from the communications module  to a specific display module , if a return \u2018end of session\u2019 packet has not been received the communications module  will wake that display module  up during the next timeslot. This is to handle the case where there is still valid return data but the timeslot has expired.","Return data packets from the display should be transmitted in the acknowledgement packet period.","Preferably there should never be more than 4.5 ms of dead-space between packets. This is to ensure that another transmitter competing on the channel cannot start data transfer.","If packets are not being removed from the display receive buffer by the application firmware the display will send a (NYET) acknowledgment packet. This will force the communications module  to retry the packets until the display is a condition where it can acknowledge the data. There will be a programmable retry count before the Communicator  flags an error. The communications module  listens after it has finished transmitting every burst of data packets. If it does not sense a carrier within a predetermined period of the burst ending it assumes that the previous packets were lost and retransmits the payload. This again prevents the channel being occupied, and is an important part of the system flow control.","Under adverse channel conditions the protocol falls back to acknowledging every packet received. However, if the channel quality is good 8 data packets  will be sent each burst. This is to optimise the throughput on channels with a low BER (bit error rate) as shown in .","The display modules receive buffer only has to have as many locations as the size of the window. This reduces the memory overhead of the protocol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIGS. 7","FIGS. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["8","9","8","9","80","82","74","70","16","56","18","96","80","18","72","86","84","86","98","100","16","100","100","3","18"]},"To increase the utilisation of the data channel, the communications module  can queue two displays up for data transmission in a timeslot.  shows this process. The display that is second in the list wakes up periodically to check to see if data packets are still being sent for the primary display.","When the communications module  has finished transmitting packets to the primary display module  and the display module  response has been received data is immediately sent to the second display module  in the list. This is to prevent another system grabbing the channel. These packets  are repeated, with 4.75 ms gap between bursts.","The secondary display module  wakes-up at some point during one of these bursts, see line  in , send an acknowledgement, and then commence a standard data transmission. It can identify the end of a data burst by either scanning the control bits of that packet or detecting the short period where there is no data being transmitted. Data is stored to local buffer  as shown in ","Return Data Packets","Return data packets  are \u2018piggy-backed\u2019 onto returned acknowledgements.  assumes variable length data packets. In this case the first three data bytes are the acknowledgment and the following (optional) four data bytes the payload.","If there is data queued up in the display transmission buffer it is sent back during the next acknowledgment packet. This data packet is then acknowledged by the communications module . There is no sliding window protocol for this return path. Out of order packets will generate a \u2018BAD\u2019 and terminate the current communication session.","If an acknowledgement is not sent from the communications module  to the display the data is resent during the next display to communications module  acknowledgment period.","Initial Synchronisation and Re-Synchronisation procedure","If a display module  is not in sync with the communications module  it is required to re-synchronise with the polling interval of the transmitter (communications module ). The requirement to resynchronise happens through one of four ways: communications module  is no longer transmitting sync packets, communications module  is no longer transmitting sync packets on the relevant frequency, the polling period of the display module  is out of tolerance (i.e. beyond the period of the sync pulse  to receive a valid data packet ), and or after the initial set-up when the display module  is attempting to locate a valid communications module .","The display module  initially attempts to scan the first frequency in the list. The scan consists of waking up and carrying out a carrier detect or CD scan on that frequency channel. If there is no carrier the display module  goes back to sleep for a period of time just shorter than the sync packet burst length. If the display module  detects a carrier signal it then stays awake for 2 sync packets  and attempts to process the data. If it fails it assumes that it has woken up during a data packet, so goes back to sleep for just shorter than the sync packet burst length.","If a valid sync packet  is processed, then the display module  knows which timeslot that sync packet  is associated with and the time offset in the sync packet burst. This enables it to sleep until the next polling period, at which time the display module  enters its normal operation regime.","If the display module  fails to locate a valid sync packet  on the primary frequency after a programmable number of complete cycles, say more than 8 it attempts to locate the synchronisation pulses on the alternative frequencies that were programmed during the initial set-up.","This is carried out in a similar way to scanning on one frequency. However the display stays awake for a slightly longer period as it carries out a CD on all the frequencies in the list each time it wakes up.","If the display module  fails to synchronise with a communications module  at this point it will go to sleep for an extended period of time such as 15 seconds before attempting to locate a communications module  again. This extends battery life and provides for the case were the unit has been put into storage.","Group Addressing","There are two aspects of group addressing, firstly allocating displays to a group, and secondly transmitting data to that group.","Allocating Displays","There are two methods for allocating a display to a specific group:\n\n","Transmitting Data to a Group","When the communications module  wishes to communicate with a group of displays it transmits a series of special synchronisation packets. These have the Address 1 field set in a predetermined manner and Address 2 field set to the group that the communications module  wishes to communicate with. At this point data is streamed to all the displays in the associated group, albeit without ACK packets being returned. The transmitted packet ID is preferably incremented with each packet transmitted as it is up to the display module  to determine if it has received corrupt data.","If Display Address 1 was set to 0xFFFF, and Display Address 2 to 0x0001 the next data packets would be destined for labels in group 1 only. It is important to note that this is different to the timeslot grouping (based on the LSB of the display address). It may be necessary to repeat the process several times for different timeslots to ensure that all the displays are updated. A Group Address eg 0x0000 can be reserved and used as a broadcast address to all displays.","Preferably a SYNC packet is generated having a data structure similar to that described earlier containing information identifying the length of the data packets to be transferred, the number of synchronised packets in the SYNC packet burst and\/or the number of remaining SYNC packets as well as address information regarding the group of displays being addressed for example through the first display address and second display address. Preferably information is also provided regarding the time slot identification that the SYNC burst is aimed at. Preferably a data packet is transferred between the base station and display comprising relevant address information and sequencing information regarding the relevant data packet within a given data packet burst. For example a data packet might comprise 480 bits including a command element, a \u201cpackets remaining\u201d element and the actual data (which might for example be in the order of 472 bits). The command byte might comprise a command bit, start session, and start time slot, and end session, and a packet ID. Preferably a data packet is generated by the display back to the base station comprising an acknowledgment packet again comprising relevant information regarding addresses, time slots and so on as well as a data packet which itself can comprise a command byte and\/or returned data. In particular, the display is adapted to acknowledge successfully received data and request further data which might have been corrupted, in a manner such as described earlier.","In the event that an unrecoverable link error has occurred display  preferably times out and goes to sleep which information is passed back to the communications module .","Reprogramming Displays","At least every 15 s, at a convenient point, the display sets a predetermined address, such as its H\/W address, a predetermined value such as to 0x00 and scans the control frequency utilising a predetermined protocol. This is likely to occur between sync pulse components  while the display is not communicating with the communications module . This is to enable easy re-programming of the display.","Multiple Communications Modules ","Multiple communications modules  are handled with this system  through allocating the additional transmitters in the store to different frequencies.","Displays will associated with any valid communications module  that they find with a matching network ID on any of the frequencies that were downloaded during the initial configuration step.","It is up to the PC application software to attempt to communicate with the displays utilising the different communications modules  in turn.

The database  contains information on what display modules  are associated to products, display module statistical information, product images, command and status queues and audit log tables.","Application Programming Interface (API)","The API consists of software that provides the main interface between third party applications and the communications system. A comprehensive library of commands is available within the API to enable a third party application, such as the image rendering module  to associate images to products and to push image updates to display modules . The API also provides functions for managing the creation and deletion of products, the association of display modules  to products and the retrieval of status and statistical information.","During a system  setup phase the API is used to create products and display modules within the database . After these have been created the API is then used to associate a display module  (or multiple display modules) to a product. Once this association has been performed the API ensures that whenever a product update call is made, the appropriate display modules associated to the product are sent an image update.","After a system  has been setup the API is called whenever the image rendering module  has new images for products. On receipt of an image update call the API validates the size and format of the image before placing the display module updates onto the communicator service queue for transmission to the display modules  associated with the product. The API waits for a response from the communicator service and return this to the calling application. The API also handles update retries if a failure is detected.","Graphical User Interface (GUI)","The GUI consists of a software application that provides a means for a user to setup and configure the API and database .","The GUI provides a means for creating and deleting products and display modules, associating display modules to products and for displaying usage statistics and audit information in a graphical format.","Product Rules Engine ","The product rules engine  consists of a software application that manages the product updates and presents a user interface to show update statistics and status information.","When the system rules engine  determines that a new image is required for a product it schedules the product rules engine  to run.

The row voltage was 30V, column voltage 5V and the DC-DC converter efficiency assumed to be 85% for these calculations. The effective load of the display unit is then 33 k\u03a9. The image update time for a 1-bit display was taken as the worst case (1.578 seconds per image) and the RF receive time was 6.373 s.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0191","num":"0202"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},"Clearly, driving the display is a major contributor to the power: merely updating the image 50 times per day shows. This indicates how important it is to use a bistable display. If the display mode requires constant power, then even for the lowest power type of monostable or emissive type displays currently available, the battery lifetime would be measured in days at best.","Typically for the retail application, the display will be updated between 2 and 5 times each day at most. For 5 updates per day, the theoretical lifetime of the battery is about 9 years if the polling off duration is about 20 seconds. Reducing the polling off period to about 8 seconds reduces the battery life by only 5% to about 8.5 years. Increasing the regularity of the polling period to once every 2 seconds begins to have a noticeable effect on the battery life, causing a significant 40% drop in lifetime. This is plotted in .","In practice battery lifetime will never attain the theoretical values found here, since shelf life of the battery is limited. For example, typical battery used for these calculations is found to have a 7 year shelf life. Hence, there is little point in optimising the polling off duration to extend battery life beyond this. For less than 6 image updates per day on average, therefore, the polling off duration is optimum between 4 and 8 seconds, preferably about 8 seconds.","In the retail application, there is a trade-off between the number of units that can be updated by a single communication device and the polling-off period. If a retailer is required to change say 1,000 labels, then this will probably be done over night. Typically, the retailer would need all of the labels to be updated in an 8 hour period. The time taken to update all of the labels will be dictated by the duration of the polling-off period. If 8 seconds, then 1,000 labels can be updated in series within 2.2 hours, which is satisfactory, whilst ensuring that the power usage is minimised.","Other applications may have a different use rate. For example, if the application includes the option to display pre-stored images loaded into the flash memory, and an interface for the viewer to toggle between these images, then a display may be updated 50 to 100 times per day. In these instances, there is no advantage to having a longer polling time (since power is independent of polling-off duration\u2014see ). The key for such applications is to minimise the power required to update the image and\/or to maximise the energy available from the battery. For example, reducing the time taken to update the display, the display loading (capacitance and track resistance) and the voltages used are all effective measures for reducing the display energy consumption.","The optimum SYNC or polling off period has also been calculated for a smaller display. Assuming that Vlcd=15V, Vd=3V and the effective load is only 15 k\u03a9 to represent, say, a 2\u2033 diagonal 120\u00d7160 display device. The display update time is then taken to be 0.6 s and the RF receive time is taken for \u00bc of the image content is 1.59 s. With the RF system of the current invention we then get the following relationship between battery life and polling off duration as shown in .","Obviously, due to the much smaller loading of the display and RF during the write period, a battery of this size (1.7 Ah total) will last considerably longer. The polling duration could readily be set to 2 seconds and a 5 to 7 year battery life still obtained for 5 updates per day. Alternatively, it is clear from this calculation that the same display may now be updated up to 15 times per day on average (with an 8 second SYNC period) whilst retaining the 5 to 7 year battery life.","There are other important design considerations to take into account when considering this smaller display device: namely cost and size. Usually, both of these considerations will be reduced. For example, 3 button-batteries could be used to supply the 1.7 Ah power to the 4\u2033 QVGA, whereas only 2 batteries could be fit behind the 2\u2033 diagonal smaller display. Thus, the energy available for the smaller display is close to 1.0 Ah in total. This means that the analysis of  tends towards that of . In this instance, the optimum SYNC period (polling-off duration) is again between 4 and 16 seconds, preferably close to 8 seconds.","In summary, the optimum polling-off duration (SYNC period) is related to the size and image content of the display, the number of updates required on average and the total energy available from the battery (accounting for its shelf life and effect of temperature and current drain). The optimum polling off duration is between 2 and 16 seconds: below 2 seconds the RF SYNC takes too much power, confining the display to minimal usage at best; above 16 seconds, the time taken to update a large number of displays becomes excessive for little extra benefit (due to the shelf life of the battery and relatively high magnitude of power then associated with the display update). In practice, 8 seconds is considered preferable.","Group Update","One aspect of the system is the use of group update to update several or all of the units simultaneously and in parallel. This is done using pre-stored images uploaded to each unit (display module ) during the course of the day and stored in flash but not displayed until after a group update request is received by the unit.","The procedure for the group update could be as shown in the flow diagram in  which is self-explanatory. It has been found in practice that some labels will not have a successful update on first attempt, because they have interference from within the environment, or are situated at a greater distance from the transmitter than the majority of the labels. To help maximise the number of labels that are updated, then the group update command is repeated say three times to minimise this loss.","In practice the system is found to give a 97% success rate for labels situated up to 100 m from the transmitter when operating in a typical supermarket. If the 3% loss is caused by random events (e.g. interference from customers) then repeating the group update would ensure a 100.(1\u22120.03)% labels only are not updated correctly: that is 3 in a 100,000 displays.","In practice it is found that the loss is not random, and is more likely to happen for some labels than others. In this instance, the success rate of the second and third group updates is likely to be reduced. In such instances the displays will be updated serially in a conventional fashion following the group update. However, this can take some time. One aspect of the current invention minimises that time by choosing the sequence of the serial updates following a group update to begin with those units that are most frequently difficult to update and hence most likely to have failed the group update sequence. The software controlling the communicator system will have obtained information concerning which labels most frequently fail the serial update, due, for example, to the local environment of the individual units or the distance of certain units from the transmitter.","Other Functionality","In the retail sector the display system  can be adapted to provide one or more of the following functionality, especially using a computer adapted to drive a communicator to relay display data to a plurality of display modules positioned adjacent products in a retail outlet, the computer preferably having a data input from external data sources for example regarding product stock levels in a retail outlet, and being adapted to perform at least one of;","create display module images that relate data from one product to another product thereby enabling cross-selling of products;","perform product price promotion using rules to reduce the standard price of a product by a specific amount and causing use of an alternate image template for display by a display module to promote the reduction;","the computer operates rules established to monitor a retailer's inventory database and is adapted to indicate relevant stock levels to customers eg \u201cOnly XXX left in stock\u201d; \u201cIN STOCK\u201d etc., and or make price changes to be displayed to customers based on the level of stock held at a store and or the rate of change of stock level, and or cross refer customers to alternate products if out of stock, and or display of sell-out notice e.g. swap to white text on black background with \u201cSOLD OUT\u201d;","interrogate competitor pricing, such as via the internet, and preferably automatically to adjust the information displayed adjacent a store product, more preferably in real time, to display those competitor prices for example to highlight that the best price can be achieved in store;","automatically update pricing information according to the time remaining to a \u201csell-by\u201d date for the product adjacent a display module;","display by a display module a special offer such as \u201cBuy-one-get-one-free\u201d;","display by a display module detailed product information such as one or more of ingredients of an adjacent product, information about country of origin, free-trade, fat content, review comments (e.g. for wine), healthiness traffic lights, sell-by, use-by and best-by dates;","temperature monitoring using a temperature sensor associated with the display module, to enable the display module to assure customers of maximum temperature of freezer or chiller unit over a given period such as the previous days, preferably the display module incorporates a temperature sensor and is adapted to communicate the temperature information back to the communicator thereby enabling a warning of faulty temperature zones;","display by a display module of the date, hence enabling a reminder of the date for a user when comparing with the associated product \u201csell by date\u201d;","display by a display module of the time\u2014preferably hours and minutes can be updated with every SYNC pulse and stored (not displayed since display does not wake up).

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the inclusion of a speaker to a display unit is not limited to the shelf stacking embodiment but is applicable to all embodiments of the display system  and its variants mentioned in this specification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0245"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 27"],"b":["10","300","18","54","310","312","314","316","318","320","322"]},"In the example shown, the display is divided into three sections , ,  though depending on the number of products on a shelf, size of the display , position of the display unit  the number of sections may vary. In the preferred embodiment the display  shows three items, the item to which the display relates, in the middle section  and the item stacked to the left of it  and the item to the right of it .","The peripheral sections ,  are for the shelf-stackers reference in the example of the display unit  showing a single item in the primary image.","In this example each section , ,  contains information regarding the product to be stocked  e.g. a fizzy drink, the brand , quantity of product to be stocked  and optional information such as the style  the product should be stacked in e.g. a pyramid, individually etc. If the shelf is only stacking a single product the peripheral sections ,  are not required and greater detail may be displayed regarding the product to be stacked may be displayed. In a further embodiment, the peripheral sections ,  only contain information regarding the product  and\/or brand  stacked for a stacker's reference, thereby requiring less space on the display and allowing more information to be displayed on the central section . In further embodiments the display shows the stacking information for the products on the shelves above and\/or below the display unit . The information displayed in the secondary image is fully controllable from the template designer  and template  used.","To avoid confusion the central section , or the section with the information regarding the stacking information for the product is highlighted. This may involve the use of bold text, a different colour, larger text etc.","As a display unit  is typically small, 80 mm in height and 70 mm width, a text based approach to displaying the planogram is preferred. In further embodiments an image based planogram may also be used, displaying the products in a graphical format that is normally associated with a planogram.","In a further embodiment the display system  further comprises a series of RF transceivers  and tags  (), preferably RFD) tags on the stock. Each display unit  has a RF transceiver  which can be further enabled to detect all RFID tags  within a pre-determined range e.g. 2 metres. The RFID tags are placed on individual items of stock allowing the display unit  to detect the signals from items of stock which are within the range of the unit. The microcontroller  within the display unit  would be enabled to compare the detected RFID tags  detected, which in a preferred embodiment would transmit information an identifier allowing the determination of the product it is attached to, to the information that is being displayed on the display unit. Therefore, a measure of the levels of stock and what type of stock within the set range can easily be made. When the display unit  is next awoken, it transmits to the computer  back the number of products that are actually on the shelf, and the computer  would compare the number of stock left to the system rules  to determine whether replenishment is needed. The determination if a stock level may also be made at the microcontroller  which would send a message to the computer  to flag up a low level of stock.","Furthermore, to save power, the SYNC pulse includes an AWAKE SENSOR AND SCAN command. The AWAKE SENSOR AND SCAN command powers the RFID transceiver , detects all products with an RFID tag  with the predetermined range, determines what products are within range via the identifying signal of the RFID tag , transmits the information to the computer  and sends the RF transceiver  back to sleep mode. To further save power the timing of the AWAKE SENSOR AND SCAN command is time dependent. For instance, during peak shopping hours the AWAKE SENSOR AND SCAN command would be initiated regularly, for example every 10 minutes, and during times of low customer numbers where stocks are likely to remain approximately constant, every couple of hours.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the use of sensors is not limited to RFID tags and RF transceivers . The use of RFID tags  allows for an easy integration to the existing infrastructure where the RF transceiver  is already present in the display unit . Weight sensors to measure the current weight on stock on a shelf may also be used, where the amount of stock left would be proportional to the weight detected. A light sensor to detect the height of the stock on a shelf may also be used, which would give an indication of the level of stock. In the preferred embodiment the sensor is able to provide information regarding the type of stock. The information regarding the type of stock allows for the stock level of multiple items to be monitored in a single AWAKE SENSOR AND SCAN command.","Further in the retail sector, use of a display system can be made in a restaurant, for example to display information related to an order such as on a manually transportable, wireless display module, the customer being able to present the display module with number of the order and the items purchased included on a table selected by the customer thereby to inform the waiter of the location for the relevant order.","Further functionality can be provided such as in the following sectors:","Use of a display system in a medical environment, for example to enable one or more of hospital beds to be reserved; medical details of incumbent to be displayed; location known and required location displayed; time, place and medic name for forthcoming operation to be displayed; medicine frequency and doping levels displayed; identification numbers (e.g. cot to baby), surgical instruments, and or drug stocks to be displayed.","Use of a display system in a military environment, for example to enable command and control information to be sent to local command and preferably the local command can send (encoded) instructions, maps etc to personnel within a 200 m radius.","Use of a display system in a warehouse, for example to display location, stock level, local instructions (e.g. orders, addresses etc) throughout warehouse of items in the warehouse.","Finally, it is noted that the present system uses multiple timeslots for the individual ESL units (display modules ) to greatly reduce the power consumption. For example, see , where 4 time slots are used.","The RF protocol optimises current consumption and bandwidth by using a combination of SYNC packets and Time Division Multiplexing (Timeslots). The communicator transmits a number of SYNC packets every timeslot (1.1 seconds). Each display is assigned to a timeslot based on its RF address. This scheme allows virtually 100% of the available bandwidth to be used but each display only has to wake up for its allocated timeslot. The number of timeslots may be any multiple of 2. Increasing the number of timeslots decreases the power consumption of the display, but results in a longer response time.","At the beginning of each Timeslot, a block containing an odd number of SYNC packets is sent. Each SYNC packet contains an offset from the middle SYNC packet (e.g. t=\u22122, t=\u22121, t=0, t=1, t=2 etc.), allowing the display to re-synchronise to the middle SYNC packet (t=0), by adjusting it's clock based on the packet offset of the first SYNC packet received. This makes the protocol resilient to clock drift by enabling the use of a less accurate and correspondingly lower cost crystal oscillator. Keeping the displays synchronised with the Communicator this way normally requires a low tolerance 32 KHz clock crystal, but it can also function from an internal RC oscillator within the microcontroller, providing further cost savings.","The inventors have found that there are significant power savings if each display module is woken approximately once every 8 seconds. However, in a practical environment a given module may fail to receive the synchronization signal for several SYNC pulses, due to RF interference in a busy supermarket (for example). Take our current system, wherein multiple SYNC packets are transmitted in each SYNC pulse.","If a total of 5 SYNC packets are used, the display's clock is allowed to drift by up to 3 SYNC packets (t=0, t=1, t=2) before losing synchronisation with the communicator  i.e. the clock can drift by up to 11.25 ms between each wakeup period. Each unit has a crystal oscillator that is specified to an accuracy of 20 parts per million: This means that the oscillator may drift by up to 0.16 ms between each wakeup period, allowing the display module  to loose a maximum of 70 SYNC pulses, or 616 seconds (70* Wakeup period) before having to conduct a re-synchronisation scan.","If a single SYNC packet were transmitted, then the drift would need to be accurate to within 3 ms. Thus, the liquid crystal module would require a resynchronisation scan after only 18 SYNC pulses, which is only 158 seconds.","If the unit (display module ) has not received a SYNC pulse after a certain time (for example 50 to 100 time slots) the display module  conducts a re-scan to find the SYNC pulse. Rather than a short 3 ms burst in the high power mode, this process takes a full time slot which is typically is in the high power mode. That is, it is 333 times more power is consumed if the SYNC pulse is lost through RF interference. Such interference may come from electrical interference from surrounding objects, to changes in the display module's local environment (such as metallic objects, trolleys, and other local changes during the course of the working day in a supermarket). To counteract this issue, a series of SYNC pulses are emitted, including pulses both preceding and trailing the anticipated average time. This greatly increases the accuracy with which the units receive the SYNC pulse, and ensures that the power is kept to a minimum.","The retail environment is one where thousands of liquid crystal modules will be addressed from a single communicator. Not only are low cost and ultra-low power important, but so is reliability. The aspect of the invention using multiple SYNC pulse packet helps ensure ultra-low power consumption, whilst ensuring that re-sychronisation scans are rare, and the system is reliable.","The present invention also implements two additional processes to optimise the means by which display modules  can be brought back into synchronisation with the communicator :\n\n","Preferable forms of the invention include:","A display system wherein the display module comprises a touch screen and or switch to enable a user to scroll through detailed information, such as product specification, manual and so on, on a display, preferably wherein the display module comprises a principal display image for display to a user by way of default and a secondary image through which the user is able to review upon selection of the scroll option on the display module, more preferably wherein the principal image is written first to the display and a secondary image written at leisure through day, and or still more preferably wherein automatic return to the principal image is effected after a fixed time, such as 4-10 seconds.","A display system further comprising a memory store to store a plurality of images that may be displayed. Preferably where a first image stored is a product information images and wherein a second image is space planner image, and or comprising a stock taking mode, wherein during selected periods, such as shop closed hours, the display is switched to a stock mode and a space planner image local to the display module are displayed instead of product information.","Use of a display system in a medical environment, for example to enable one or more of hospital beds to be reserved; medical details of incumbent to be displayed; location known and required location displayed; time, place and medic name for forthcoming operation to be displayed; medicine frequency and doping levels displayed; identification numbers (e.g. cot to baby), surgical instruments, and or drug stocks to be displayed.","Use of a display system in a military environment, for example to enable command and control information to be sent to local command and preferably the local command can send (encoded) instructions, maps etc to personnel within a 200 m radius.","Use of a display system in a warehouse, for example to display location, stock level, local instructions (e.g. orders, addresses etc) throughout warehouse of items in the warehouse.","Use of a display system in a restaurant, for example to display the number of a restaurant is displayed on a manually transportable, wireless display module, the customer being able to present the display module with number of the order and the items purchased included on a table selected by the customer chooses to instruct the waiter of the location for the relevant order.","A display module for displaying information at a point of product display in a retail outlet, being adapted to communicate with a remote communicator which in use transmits display information to the display module, and","to operate in a first, low power mode to display information and in a second, higher power mode periodically, in a predetermined manner, to communicate with the communicator thereby to obtain updated display information, the display module being further adapted to switch between first and second modes of operation between communications to enable low overall consumption of power by the display module.","A multiple display module for use in a system  comprising display communications module () and two or more display units (\u2032) physically connected thereto, wherein the display communications module is adapted wirelessly to receive display data for the one or more display units.","A method of transferring data between a transmitter (communicator ) and a receiver (display module ) comprising the steps of defining a window size for a finite number of packets of data, transmitting the finite number of data packets, and transmitting at least a further packet of data up to the defined window size upon receipt by the transmitter of acknowledgement of receipt by the receiver of at least one of the finite number of packets of data, wherein the receiver acknowledges receipt of data packets in groups of two or more packets and the transmitter transmits further data up to the window size comprising unacknowledged data packets as well as newly transmitted data packets.","It is preferably wherein the duration the display module () stays in the higher power mode is variable depending on the content of the synchronisation component () and more preferably only sufficient to ensure receipt of essential information prior to switching back to the lower power mode.","Preferably in a display system wherein the synchronisation component () comprises a series of synchronisation packets () each data packet in the series comprising data related to the relative transmission of the data packet with respect to a primary data packet with the synchronisation component (), the primary data packet is a central data packet in the series of data packets and more preferably wherein the series comprises three or more, and preferably seven, data packets on each side of the primary data packet, and the display module () is adapted to resynchronise switching between low power and higher power modes based on the relative position of a synchronisation data packet () received by the display module ().
