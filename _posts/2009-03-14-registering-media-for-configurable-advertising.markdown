{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["According to current models of advertising, breaks to show advertisements may be defined according to a schedule. As a result, the broadcasting of video programs, such as television broadcasting may be designed to accommodate the advertising schedule. When the time for an advertising break arrives, the television program is interrupted. At the end of the advertising break, the television program may resume, or another television program may start.","One drawback with this model is that the producer of the program cannot control the occurrence, or timing, of the advertising breaks. This may lead to incongruous, inappropriate, or ineffective advertisements being displayed to viewers. Advertising breaks according to a fixed schedule can be disruptive to the natural flow of a television program. As a result, the viewer experience when watching a program may be degraded, and the effectiveness of the advertisements may decrease.","Similar issues arise when advertising within Internet-based video. Videos that are distributed within an IP-based system typically have advertising breaks hardwired into specific time slots, which may also degrade the viewer experience, and the effectiveness of advertising.","Described herein are implementations of various technologies for registering media for configurable advertising. The media may include audio, video, or other multimedia presentations that is distributed over the Internet. A publisher of the media may register the media with a video advertising platform (VAP). The VAP may receive ad policies and a registration request from the publisher.","The ad policies may specify information such as how much and what types of advertising are to be shown within the media. The possible ad policies may be extensive, and can be configured by the publisher. Ad policies may be assigned to specific media, or to more general categories.","The registration request may include media metadata, such as a title, a video length, actors, or any information the publisher wants to provide that describes the media.","The VAP may generate a media manifest that maps the applicable ad policies to the registered media. The media manifest may describe a specific advertising schedule for the registered media. The media manifest may also specify an ad delivery server that provides the specific advertisements.","Upon registering, the VAP may expose web service application programming interfaces (APIs) to the publisher. The publisher may use the web service APIs to update the media metadata and the ad policies. Updates from the publisher trigger a re-generation of the media manifest with new, or updated, policies.","The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all of the noted disadvantages. Further, the summary section is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description section. The summary section is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In general, one or more implementations of various technologies described herein are directed towards registering media for configurable advertising. The various implementations will be described in more detail in the following paragraphs.","Implementations of various technologies described herein may be operational with numerous general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the various technologies described herein include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The various technologies described herein may be implemented in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The various technologies described herein may also be implemented in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network, e.g., by hardwired links, wireless links, or combinations thereof. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","147","112","100","110","130","140","120"]},"The network  may be any network or collection of networks that facilitates communication between the client , the publisher , and the VAP , as described herein. In one implementation, the network  is the Internet.","The client  may be a computing system on which the media player  is executed. The media player  may be software that plays back multimedia files, such as a media . The media  may be an audio file, a video file, streaming versions of the same, or the like.","In one implementation, the media player  may only play back video, such as television shows, movies, and on-line video segments. In such an implementation, the media player  may be known as a video player. In another implementation, the media player  may play back both audio and video files, such as the Windows\u00ae Media Player\u00ae.","A user may operate the media player  to request the media  from the publisher  for playback on the client . The publisher  may be a computing system that provides access to the media . The publisher  may be operated by a media distribution company, such as television networks, Internet portals, and the like.","In one implementation, the media  may be provided to the publisher  by a content owner (not shown) that produces the media . For example, the content owner may specialize in producing video media, and send a video to the publisher  for distribution to the user. The content owner may be a movie production studio, a television production company, or the like.","The publisher  may provide access to the video for the user via a content delivery network (CDN). The CDN (not shown) may be a system of computers networked together across the Internet that cooperate transparently to deliver content, i.e., media , to users. The CDN is typically used for the purpose of delivering the media  with high performance, scalability, and cost efficiency. Some examples of CDNs include Amazon\u00ae Cloudfront\u00ae, Limelight Networks\u00ae, and BitGravity\u00ae.","The media  may be used to generate revenue through advertising. The VAP  may facilitate advertising with the playback by the media player . In one implementation, the VAP  may provide a manifest  to the media player .","The manifest  may specify how and when the advertisements  are shown with the playback of the media . For example, the manifest  may specify that the advertisements  are shown during a break at the 15 minute mark of the playback. In one implementation, the manifest  may be in an XML format.","The VAP  may include a manifest service , a registration service , and an ad delivery service . The manifest service  may receive a request for the manifest  from the media player . In response, the manifest service  may determine the manifest  for the media  and the media player . The manifest service  may then send the manifest  to the media player .","The manifest  may also specify one or more uniform resource locators (URLs) from which the media player  obtains the advertisements . In one implementation, the URL may specify the ad delivery service , or a third party ad delivery service (not shown).","The manifest  may be generated based on preferences provided to the registration service  by the publisher . In one implementation, the publisher may register the media  for advertising with the VAP . In such an implementation, the registration service  may receive a registration request from the publisher .","The registration request may include media metadata. The media metadata may describe the media  itself. Media metadata may include a title, participants (such as actors, writers, and directors), a time length, a release date and the like.","Additionally, the registration service  may receive ad policies from the publisher . The ad policies may describe rules for presenting the advertisement  to the user. The policies may be defined by the publisher at several levels of hierarchy. For example, policies may be defined for the publisher, for a particular piece of media, a class of media (such as television, movies), and a type of the media player  that performs the playback.","Ad policies may include an ad-program ratio (e.g., a ratio between the time length of the advertisement  and the video); an ad duration; an ad replay policy (e.g., how frequently the advertisement  can be played); a number of ad positions available during the playback; a maximum number of ads per ad position; a \u201cclick to continue\u201d option (e.g., whether user is allowed to click an input device on the client  to continue the playback without completion of the advertisement ); and an ad skip threshold (e.g., a number of advertisements the user is allowed to skip during playback, or a duration of the advertisement  that is shown before the user is allowed to skip the remainder of the advertisement ).","The number of ad positions available during the playback may specify how many opportunities for advertising the publisher  allots in the media. For example, the publisher  may allot  ad positions within a video. Each ad position may specify a time during playback of the video when the media player  may show the advertisements .","However, all available ad positions may not be used during the playback. Other ad policies may affect the number of ad positions used. For example, a low ad-program ratio, for example, may limit the number of ad positions that the media player  may use for advertising.","Ad policies may also include an ad type. The ad type may describe a format for advertising during the playback. For example, ad types may include linear, non-linear, pre-roll, and post-roll advertisements. In one implementation, ad policies may include the enablement of specified ad types.","The linear type advertisement may indicate that the advertisement  may be shown while the playback is paused, and the playback is resumed when the advertisement  completes. The non-linear type advertisement may indicate that the advertisement  is shown during the playback, typically in a format like a graphic overlay or rolling text.","The pre-roll type advertisement may indicate that the advertisement  is shown prior to starting the playback. Similarly, the post-roll type advertisement may indicate that the advertisement  is shown after finishing the playback.","In one implementation, the registration service  may store the registration request, ad policies, media metadata, and advertising metadata in the registration database . Additionally, the registration service  may create the manifest  for the registered media based on the ad policies, media metadata, and advertising metadata.","It should be understood that the ad policies, ad types, media metadata, and advertising metadata described above are merely for illustration, and not intended to be limiting. Implementations of the various techniques described herein may include other ad policies, ad types, media metadata, and advertising metadata.","In implementations of the various techniques described herein, the VAP  may be a single server, or multiple distributed servers interoperating across the network . Further, the components of VAP  (manifest service , registration service , and ad delivery service ) may be implemented on these distributed devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","144","200","200"]},"At step , the registration service  may receive the ad policies from the publisher . In addition to the description of ad policies described above, the ad policies may be dynamically configurable by the publisher  to customize advertising schemes.","For example, the ad policies may be defined in an extensible format, such as XML. Advantageously, by using XML to define the ad policies, the publisher  may create new types of ad policies in order to create highly customized advertising schemes.","For example, the publisher  may define an ad policy based on a type of client . The type of client  may include a variety of viewer devices, such as set-top boxes, mobile phones, personal computers, gaming system, and the like.","In such a case, that ad policy for the click-to-continue option may be varied based on the client type. For example, one ad policy may specify that the \u201cclick to continue\u201d option is not available for ads sent to a television set. Another ad policy may specify that the \u201cclick to continue\u201d option is available for ads sent to a personal computer.","At step , the registration service  may receive the registration request. As stated previously, the registration request may contain metadata about the media . In one implementation, the registration request may also include advertising metadata, such as the number of available ad positions in the media .","Further, the media metadata may be used to assign an ad policy to one or more media. For example, the media metadata may include a producer, a title, and an age-based rating. A particular ad policy may be defined for all media from the same producer, all media with the same title, or all media rated for viewers 13 years of age and older.","In one implementation, the registration request may also include reporting preferences for the media . Reporting may show how successful the ad policies are for the media , and provide information that can help improve advertising through updates to the ad policies, etc. For example, reporting may show how often the user uses the click-to-continue option, or how often the user buys a product in response to the advertisement .","At step , the registration service  may validate the request. The validation may apply standard edits to the metadata in the request to ensure the registration request is valid. For example, the registration service  may edit for spelling, punctuation, etc.","In one implementation, the registration service  may compare ad policies to verify that ad policies do not conflict. For example, if one ad policy states that the click to continue option is not available for television, but another ad policy states that the click to continue option is available for television, the registration request may be rejected as invalid.","At step , the media manifest  may be generated. The media manifest  may be generated by determining all of the applicable ad policies for the media . Each applicable ad policy may then be translated into a specific advertising scheme for the media.","For example, the ad policies may specify that the media  include a pre-roll advertisement, and that the program-ad ratio is 10%. If the media is 30 minutes long, the media manifest  may specify that 3 minutes (10% of 30 minutes) of advertising be shown before the playback.","At step , an application programming interface (API) may be provided for the publisher to view, and update the registration and ad policies. The APIs may enable the publisher to update or create new ad policies, media metadata, and advertising metadata. In one implementation, the API may be a web service API.","If the publisher sends updates for a particular media, the method  may be repeated to generate a new media manifest . The new media manifest  may be provided for all future requests for playback of the media .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["140","140","321","322","323","322","321","140"]},"The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","The system memory  may include a read only memory (ROM)  and a random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help transfer information between elements within the VAP , such as during start-up, may be stored in the ROM .","The VAP  may further include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from and writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from and writing to a removable optical disk , such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , the magnetic disk drive , and the optical disk drive  may be connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media may provide nonvolatile storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the VAP .","Although the VAP  is described herein as having a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk  and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the VAP  may also include other types of computer-readable media that may be accessed by a computer. For example, such computer-readable media may include computer storage media and communication media.","Computer storage media may include volatile and non-volatile, and removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media may further include RAM, ROM, erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory or other solid state memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD), or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the VAP .","Communication media may embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and may include any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d may mean a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above may also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","A number of modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , the manifest service , the registration service , the ad delivery service , and a database system . The operating system  may be any suitable operating system that may control the operation of a networked personal or server computer, such as Windows\u00ae Vista, Mac OS\u00ae X, Unix-variants (e.g., Linux\u00ae and BSD\u00ae), and the like.","The registration service  may receive registration requests from the publisher , and generate manifests for delivery by the manifest service . The registration service  may also provide an interface to the publisher  that the publisher may use to view, and update, a registration. The ad delivery service  may receive advertisement requests from the media player , and send the advertisement  in response.","A user may enter commands and information into the VAP  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices may be connected to the CPU  through a serial port interface  coupled to system bus , but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device may also be connected to system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , the VAP  may further include other peripheral output devices, such as speakers and printers.","Further, the VAP  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node. Although the remote computer  is illustrated as having only a memory storage device , the remote computer  may include many or all of the elements described above relative to the VAP . The logical connections may be any connection that is commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet, such as local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) .","When using a LAN networking environment, the VAP  may be connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the VAP  may include a modem , wireless router or other means for establishing communication over a wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the VAP , or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","It should be understood that the various technologies described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware, software or a combination of both. Thus, various technologies, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various technologies. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device may include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device.","One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various technologies described herein may use an application programming interface (API), reusable controls, and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) may be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above. Rather, the specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
