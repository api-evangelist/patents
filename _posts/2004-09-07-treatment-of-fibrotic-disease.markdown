More specifically, the invention relates to the use of INSP035 for the treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic diseases, in particular scleroderma. Combinations of INSP035 with an interferon, a TNF antagonist or a further anti-fibrotic agent such as OPG and SARP-1 are also within the present invention.","Fibrosis is a condition characterized by a deposition of extracellular matrix components in the internal organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, liver, skin and joints.","Lung fibrosis is one of the predominant fibrotic diseases. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the alveolar walls with progressive fibrosis, of unknown etiology. IPF, or cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, causes 50 to 60% of cases of idiopathic interstitial lung disease (for reviews on IPF, see Khalil N and O'Connor 2004 and Selman et al. 2004).","Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), a specific histopathologic pattern of interstitial pneumonia, is the classic pattern found on lung biopsy in IPF. At low magnification, the tissue appears heterogeneous, with alternating areas of normal lung, interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and honeycombing. Interstitial inflammation consists of an alveolar septal infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes associated with hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes. The fibrotic zones are composed mainly of dense acellular collagen, although scattered foci of proliferating fibroblasts (fibroblastic foci), which are the sites of early and active disease, may also be seen, usually in an intra-alveolar location. Areas of honeycombing are composed of cystic fibrotic airspaces, frequently lined with bronchiolar epithelium and filled with mucus. Neutrophils may pool in the mucus. Smooth muscle hyperplasia often occurs in areas of fibrosis and honeycombing. The subpleural and paraseptal distribution, patchy character, and temporal heterogeneity are the most helpful features in identifying UIP.","An identical pattern of interstitial inflammation and fibrosis occurs in collagen vascular disorders (e.g., RA, SLE, progressive systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, diabetes mellitus), pneumoconioses (e.g., asbestosis), radiation injury, and certain drug-induced lung diseases (e.g., by nitrofurantoin).","The clinical course of IPF is progressive; median survival is 4 to 6 yr after diagnosis. Prednisone is the usual treatment in case of IPF. Response to treatment is variable, but patients with earlier disease, at a more cellular stage before scarring predominates, appear more likely to improve with corticosteroid or cytotoxic therapy. Supportive and palliative treatment includes Oin high concentrations to relieve hypoxemia and, if bacterial infection occurs, antibiotics. Lung transplantation has been successful in patients with end-stage lung disease. Fibrosis of the liver relates to an accumulation in the liver of connective tissue resulting from an imbalance between production and degradation of the extracellular matrix and accentuated by the collapse and condensation of preexisting fibers (for reviews see Afdhal NH and Nunes D. 2004. Kershenobich and Weissbrod. 2003. Pinzani and Rombouts 2004).","Liver fibrosis is a common response to hepatocellular necrosis or injury, which may be induced by a wide variety of agents, e.g., any process disturbing hepatic homeostasis (especially inflammation, toxic injury, or altered hepatic blood flow) and infections of the liver (viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic). Numerous storage disorders resulting from inborn errors of metabolism are often associated with fibrosis, including lipid abnormalities (Gaucher's disease); glycogen storage diseases (especially types III,. IV, VI, IX, and X); \u03b1-antitrypsin deficiency; storage of exogenous substances, as seen in iron-overload syndromes (hemochromatosis) and copper storage diseases (Wilson's disease); accumulation of toxic metabolites (as in tyrosinemia, fructosemia, and galactosemia); and peroxisomal disorders (Zellweger syndrome). Numerous chemicals and drugs cause fibrosis, especially alcohol, methotrexate, isoniazid, oxyphenisatin, methyidopa, chlorpromazine, tolbutamide, and amiodarone. Disturbances of hepatic circulation (eg, chronic heart failure, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, portal vein thrombosis) and chronic obstruction to bile flow can lead to fibrosis. Lastly, congenital hepatic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive malformation.","The normal liver is made up of hepatocytes and sinusoids distributed within an extracellular matrix composed of collagen (predominantly types I, III, and IV) and noncollagen proteins, including glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, laminin) and several proteoglycans (e.g., heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronate). Fibroblasts, normally found only in the portal tracts, can produce collagen, large glycoproteins, and proteoglycans.","Other liver cells (particularly hepatocytes and fat-storing Kupffer, and endothelial cells) also can produce extracellular matrix components. Fat-storing cells, located beneath the sinusoidal endothellum in the space of Disse, are precursors of fibroblasts, capable of proliferating and producing an excess of extracellular matrix. The development of fibrosis from active deposition of collagen is a consequence of liver cell injury, particularly necrosis, and inflammatory cells. The precise factors released from these cells is not known, but one or more cytokines or products of lipid peroxidation are likely. Kupffer cells and activated macrophages produce inflammatory cytokines. New fibroblasts form around necrotic liver cells; increased collagen synthesis leads to scarring. Fibrosis may derive from active fibrogenesis and from impaired degradation of normal or altered collagen. Fat-storing cells, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells are important in the clearance of type I collagen, several proteoglycans, and denatured collagens. Changes in these cells' activities may modify the extent of fibrosis. For the histopathologist, fibrous tissue may become more apparent from passive collapse and condensation of preexisting fibers.","Thus, increased synthesis or reduced degradation of collagen results in active deposition of excessive connective tissue, which affects hepatic function: (1) Pericellular fibrosis impairs cellular nutrition and results in hepatocellular atrophy. (2) Within the space of Disse, fibrous tissue accumulates around the sinusoids and obstructs the free. passage of substances from the blood to the hepatocytes. (3) Fibrosis around hepatic venules and the portal tracts disturbs hepatic blood flow. Venous resistance across the liver Increases from portal vein branches to sinusoids and finally to hepatic veins. All three routes can be involved.","The fibrous bands that link portal tracts with central veins also promote anastomotic channels: Arterial blood, bypassing the normal hepatocytes, is shunted to efferent hepatic veins, which further impairs hepatic function and can accentuate hepatocellular necrosis. The extent to which these processes are present determines the magnitude of hepatic dysfunction: e.g., in congenital hepatic fibrosis, large fibrous bands involve predominantly the portal regions but usually spare the hepatic parenchyma. Congenital hepatic fibrosis thus presents as portal hypertension with preserved hepatocellular function.","Scleroderma is a disease of the connective tissue characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, leading to organ failure and death (Black et al., 1998; Clements and Furst, 1996; for reviews see Varga J. 2004. Chung and Utz, 2004. Rhew and Barr, 2004). Scleroderma has a spectrum of manifestations and a variety of therapeutic Implications. It comprises localized scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, sleroderma-like disorders, and Sine scleroderma (Smith, 2000). Whilst localized scleroderma is a rare dermatologic disease associated with fibrosis and manifestations limited to skin, systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disease with variable risk for internal organ involvement and variation in the extent of skin disease. Systemic sclerosis can be diffuse or limited. Limited systemic sclerosis is also called CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, telangiectasiae). Scleroderma-like disorders are believed to be related to industrial environment exposure. In Sine disease, there is internal organ involvement without skin changes.","The major manifestations of scleroderma and in particular of systemic sclerosis are inappropriate excessive collagen synthesis and deposition, endothelial dysfunction, spasm, collapse and obliteration by fibrosis.","Scleroderma is a rare disease with a stable incidence of approximately 19 cases per 1 million persons. The cause of scleroderma is unknown. However, the genetic predisposition is important. Abnormalities involve autoimmunity and alteration of endothelial cell and fibroblast function. Indeed, systemic sclerosis is probably the most severe of the autoimmune diseases with a reported 50% mortality within 5 years of diagnosis (Silman, 1991).","In terms of diagnosis, an important clinical parameter is skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints. Raynaud's phenomenon is a frequent, almost universal component of scleroderma. It is diagnosed by color changes of the skin upon cold exposure. Ischemia and skin thickening are symptoms of Raynaud's disease.","Several underlying biological processes are implicated in the initiation, severity and progression of the disease and include vascular dysfunction, endothelial cell activation and damage, leukocyte accumulation, auto-antibody production and crucially, an uncontrolled fibrotic response which may lead to death (Clements and Furst, 1996). Fibroblasts have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Primary fibroblasts obtained from patients with scleroderma exhibit many of the characteristic properties of the disease seen in vivo, notably increased extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition, notably of collagen and fibronectin, and altered growth factor and cytokine production such as of TGF\u03b2 and CTGF (Strehlow and Korn, 1998 and LeRoy, 1974).","There is no curative treatment of scleroderma. Innovative but high-risk therapy proposed autologous stem cell transplantation (Martini et a\/., 1999). In particular, there are currently no treatments for scleroderma targeting the fibrotic process (Wigley and Boling, 2000).","Identification of the genes associated with disease risk and scleroderma progression may lead to the development of effective strategies for intervention at various stages of the disease.","The secreted protein INSP035 was classified in WO03\/054012 into the four-\u03b1-helix bundle cytokines subset, which is subdivided into short-chain and long-chain cytokines, as their helices comprise approximately 15 or 25 residues, respectively. Crystal structures have been determined for the long-chain four-\u03b1-helix bundle cytokines LIF, IL-6, CNTF, GH, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and leptin. Although exhibiting only a low degree of homology in their primary structures, they show a high homology in their tertiary structures and in their functional receptor epitopes. INSP035 was identified as a member of the long chain cytokine family, and more particularly, as a leptin. Sequences similar to INSP035 and its variants have been disclosed in the literature (SEQ ID NOs: 31196 and SEQ ID NO: 42492 in WO01\/75067; SEQ ID NO: 13 in WO02\/074961; SwissProt Acc. No. Q9BTA0). However, the experimental data provided so far do not show any involvement of these sequences in fibrotic diseases.","Osteoprotegerin (OPG) was first identified in 1997 as a novel soluble cytokine secreted by fibroblasts (Simonet et al., 1997). OPG is a member of the TNF receptor family (Morinaga et al., 1998, Yasuda et al., 1998), comprising four cysteine-rich TNFR like domains in its N-terminal portion (Simonet et al., 1997). OPG has been shown to have a role in the development of bone, and mice lacking the OPG gene had an osteoporotic phenotype and gross skeletal abnormalities (Min et al., 2000).","Osteoprotegerin, which is produced by osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells, lacks a transmembrane domain and acts as a secreted decoy receptor which has no direct signaling capacity. OPG acts by binding to its natural ligand osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL), which is also known as RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand). The binding between OPG and OPGL binding prevents OPGL from activating its cognate receptor RANK, which is the osteoclast receptor vital for osteoclast differentiation, activation and survival. Ablation of OPGL or RANK also produces profound osteopetrosis, indicating the important physiological role of these proteins in regulating bone resorption. The secretion of OPG and OPGL from osteoblasts and stromal cells is regulated by numerous hormones and cytokines, often in a reciprocal manner. Hence, OPG might represent an effective therapeutic option for diseases associated with excessive osteoclast activity (Kostenuik and Shalhoub, 2001). In vitro, OPG was also shown to bind to another TNF family member, namely TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand\/Apo2 ligand (TRAIL\/Apo2L) with high affinity, comparable to that of binding by TRAIL-receptor(R)2 (Emery J. et al. 1998. Walczak H. et al. 1997). In addition, in a study on multiple myeloma, Shipman and Croucher showed that TRAIL\/Apo2L induced apoptosis in myeloma cells, and this could be prevented with the addition of recombinant OPG (rOPG). (Shipman CM and Croucher, 2003). TRAIL induces apoptosis by cross-linking of the two TRAIL receptors that contain a death domain, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 are receptors that do not transmit an apoptotic signal.","In WO03\/084560, administration of osteoprotegerin resulted in a significant amelioration of the disease in an established animal model of lung fibrosis. Lung fibrosis is one of the manifestations of scleroderma. It was therefore suggested to use osteoprotegerin for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic diseases, in particular of scleroderma. In addition, Hasel et al, in determining the expression of TRAIL and its receptors in normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis, showed that changes in the TRAIL receptor expression were most pronounced in areas of inflammatory infiltration and active fibrosis, and that fibroblast-like cells (FLC) expressed TRAIL in areas of active fibrosis (Hasel C. et al. 2003). Taimr et al. propose that TRAIL-R2 antagonists may be useful in reducing fibrosis by inducing stellate cell apopotosis on the ground that TRAIL-R2 is not expressed by hepatocytes (Taimr P. et al. 2003). This is based on the observation that apoptosis represents an important mechanism to reduce numbers of activated stellate cells during the resolution phase of hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, Yurovsky showed that both alpha2(I) collagen mRNA level and total soluble collagen secretion by normal human lung fibroblasts were increased upon TRAIL stimulation at low concentrations, whereas high concentrations of TRAIL was found to induce apoptotic death of these cells. He suggested also that TRAIL enhances extracellular matrix synthesis by triggering TGF\u03b2 production that acts in an autocrine manner (Yurovsky V V., 2003.).","The invention is based on the finding that INSP035 is a potent inhibitor of TRAIL in an in vitro assay designed to select anti-apoptotic molecules in fibroblasts with osteoprotegerin (OPG) as control. Hence, like OPG, INSP035 is able to counteract the apoptotic effect of soluble human recombinant TRAIL on fibroblasts, thereby consistently reducing fibroblasts' apoptosis.","It is therefore a first object of the invention to use INSP035 for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic diseases, in particular of scleroderma. It is a second object of the invention to use a cell expressing INSP035, or an expression vector comprising the coding sequence of INSP035, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prevention of a fibrotic disease, in particular systemic sclerosis. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising INSP035 and further anti-fibrotic drugs, such as halofuginone, OPG, or SARP-1, and methods of treatment comprising administering INSP035 to the human body are also within the scope of the present invention.","The invention is based on the finding that INSP035 is a potent inhibitor of TRAIL in an in vitro assay designed to select anti-apoptotic molecules in fibroblasts with osteoprotegerin (OPG) as control. Hence, like OPG, INSP035 Is able to counteract the apoptotic effect of soluble human recombinant TRAIL on fibroblasts, thereby consistently reducing fibroblasts' apoptosis (see ). In the same assay, the leptin protein did not affect TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, showing no effect at all (see ).","WO03\/084560 showed that administration of osteoprotegerin resulted in a significant amelioration of fibrosis in an established animal model of lung fibrosis (see also Hasel et al. and Taim et al. in section \u201cBackground of the invention\u201d). On the basis that OPG and INSP035 share common functionalities and on the findings that TRAIL stimulate collagen production (Yurovsky V V. 2003), INSP035 is suggested to be useful in the treatment of fibrosis. Although we do not want to be bound by theories, an hypothesis on the mechanism of action of INSP035 is proposed on the basis of our results in which INSP035, as a TRAIL inhibitor, might lower the amount of TGF\u03b2 present in the cells, which in turn would reduce collagen synthesis known to be deleterious in the pathogenesis of fibrosis.","Therefore, the invention relates to the use of a polypeptide for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prevention of a fibrotic disease, wherein said polypeptide is selected from the group consisting of:\n\n","The invention further relates to the use of a nucleic acid molecule for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prevention of a fibrotic disease, wherein said nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide as set forth in any of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 10 or SEQ ID NO: 11 and comprising a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of:\n\n","It will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art that in accordance with the present invention, a substance which stimulates release or potentiates the activity of endogenous INSP035 can equally be used for treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic disease, in particular of scleroderma. Said substance may be INSP035 itself, or any fragment of INSP035 able to inhibit TRAIL.","The full length cDNA of human INSP035 (INSP035 Long Form) has been cloned and is depicted as SEQ ID NO: 1 of the attached sequence listing. The corresponding amino acid sequence is given as SEQ ID NO: 2 of the attached sequence listing. The cDNA of human INSP035 starting at the second methionine (INSP035 Medium Form) from INSP035 Long Form has been cloned and is depicted as SEQ ID NO: 4 of the attached sequence listing.

Fibrosis may involve any organ of the human body, such as e.g. the skin, lung, pancreas, liver or kidney. Therefore, the invention also relates to treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic diseases such as liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, Dupuytren's contracture, keloid and other scarring\/wound healing abnormalities, postoperative adhesions and reactive fibrosis, as well as chronic heart failure, in particular after myocardial infarction. Further diseases or disorders treatable with INSP035 comprise wound-healing diseases, in particular wound healing in the lung, comprising chronic inflammation of the lung and ultimately fibrosis or scarring of lung surfaces. Disorders involving inflammation of the lung comprise e.g. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, fibroproliferative ARDS, as well as pulmonary manifestations or systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Krein et al., 2001).","Fibrosis generally involves generation or proliferation of connective tissue, which replaces functional specialized tissue of a given organ. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fibrotic disease is a connective tissue disease.","In a preferred embodiment, the connective tissue disease is scleroderma.","The term \u201cscleroderma\u201d as used herein relates to a disease also called systemic sclerosis or systemic scleroderma. These terms are used synonymously within the present patent application. Systemic sclerosis is a chronic disease of unknown cause, characterized by diffuse fibrosis; degenerative changes; and vascular abnormalities in the skin, articular structures, and internal organs (especially the esophagus, gastrointestinal tract, lung, heart, and kidney, for example). It may be localized, or mixed, systemic, limited or diffuse.","The term \u201cscleroderma\u201d preferably relates to localized, systemic, limited and diffuse scleroderma as well as overlap syndromes.","Localized scleroderma primarily affects the skin, but may also affect the underlying muscles and bones. However, it generally does not affect internal organs. Localized scieroderma is relatively mild, and may be related to systemic scleroderma in terms of similar superficial symptoms, such as the appearance of skin biopsy under the microscope.","Systemic scleroderma comprises several types of symptoms or groups of symptoms, such as CREST, limited and diffuse. It may also be referred to as progressive systemic sclerosis, or familial progressive systemic sclerosis. Systemic scleroderma may e.g. affect the skin, blood vessels, and\/or internal organs. When it affects the skin, it can cause the skin to harden, most commonly on the hands and\/or face. When it affects the blood vessels, it can cause Raynaud's disease. The most serious forms of systemic sclerosis affect the internal organs, and may cause disability or even death. Among others, systemic sclerosis comprises: scleroderma lung disease, scleroderma renal crisis, cardiac manifestations, muscular weakness including fatigue or limited CREST, gastrointestinal dysmotility and spasm, and abnormalities in the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system. With regard to the nervous system abnormalities, carpal tunnel syndrome followed by trigeminal neuralgia are the most common.","Limited Scleroderma may e.g. be limited to the hands, although the face and neck may also be involved.","Diffuse Scleroderma comprises skin tightening and also occurs above the wrists (or elbows). There are several subcategories of diffuse systemic sclerosis, such as \u201cscleroderma sine scleroderma\u201d where there is internal organ fibrosis, but no skin tightening; and familial progressive systemic sclerosis, a rare form occurring in families.","Overlap syndromes are referred to if a scleroderma patient also has other autoimmune disease (such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), as e.g. in diffuse scleroderma in overlap with lupus. Scleroderma symptoms can also be a part of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), or Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD).","The term \u201cINSP035\u201d as used herein, relates to a protein comprising all, or a portion of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, or SEQ ID NO: 11 (all human) of the enclosed sequence listing, as well as to salts, isoforms, muteins, active fractions, functional derivatives and circularly permutated derivatives thereof. INSP035 from species other than human, such as mouse or rat, may be used in accordance with the present invention, as long as there is a sufficient identity between the proteins as to allow the protein to exhibit its biological activity, and without eliciting a substantial immune response in a human being.","The term \u201cINSP035\u201d, as used herein, further relates to any fragment, portion, domain or sub-domain of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, or SEQ ID NO: 11 showing the desired activity in scleroderma or other fibrotic diseases. Protein fragments, isoforms, differentially glycosylated or sialylated forms or one or more domains of the protein may be used according to the invention, as long as they exhibit any beneficial effect on fibrotic disease, preferably an effect which is at least comparable of the full length protein. The beneficial effect can be measured in one of the in vitro or in vivo tests described in the examples below, or in any other assay adequate to demonstrate an effect in fibrotic diseases, in particular of scleroderma.","In accordance with the present invention, INSP035 can be a naturally occurring, i.e. native protein, or a recombinant protein. Recombinant production may be carried out in eukaryotic cells, such as yeast cells or mammalian cells, preferably in CHO cells, HEK cells (human embryonic kidney cells) or in human fibroblast cells or cell lines. It may further be produced in prokaryotic cells such as ","Preferably, INSP035 is glycosylated at one or more sites. It may also be unglycosylated, depending on the given needs and the source of production or isolation of the protein.","The term \u201csalts\u201d herein refers to both salts of carboxyl groups and to acid addition 20 salts of amino groups of INSP035 molecule or analogs thereof. Salts of a carboxyl group may be formed by means known in the art and include inorganic salts, for example, sodium, calcium, ammonium, ferric or zinc salts, and the like, and salts with organic bases as those formed, for example, with amines, such as triethanolamine, arginine or lysine, piperidine, procaine and the like. Acid addition salts include, for example, salts with mineral acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, and salts with organic acids, such as, for example, acetic acid or oxalic acid. Of course, any such salts must retain the biological activity of INSP035 relevant to the present invention, i.e., exert a beneficial effect on fibrotic diseases, in particular scleroderma.","Isoforms or splice variants of INSP035 may also be used according to the 30 invention, as long as they are capable of inhibiting disease progression and\/or symptoms of that disease.","As used herein the term \u201cmuteins\u201d refers to analogs of INSP035, in which one or more of the amino acid residues of natural INSP035 are replaced by different amino acid residues, or are deleted, or one or more amino acid residues are added to the natural sequence of INSP035, having preferably at least the same activity as wild type INSP035 or even having a much more potent activity. The biological activity of INSP035 can e.g. be measured by assaying INSP035 in its capacity to inhibit TRAIL. Assays for assessing protein-protein interactions are well known by the person skilled in the art. Examples for such assays are ELISA type binding assays, immuno-precipitation assays, or measurement in any other suitable system such as the BIAcore system. These muteins are prepared by known synthesis and\/or by site-directed mutagenesis techniques, or any other known technique suitable therefor.","Any such mutein preferably has a sequence of amino acids sufficiently duplicative of that INSP035, such as to have at least a substantially similar activity of INSP035. The activity of an INSP035 mutant can further be tested in the assays explained in the example below (example 2) or in the examples described in WO03\/084560. Measuring the amount of collagen synthesis in fibroblasts treated with INSP035 may be a suitable test for assessing the activity of INSP035 muteins, for example.","Muteins in accordance with the present invention include proteins encoded by a nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, which hybridizes to DNA or RNA, which encodes INSP035, in accordance with the present invention, under stringent conditions. The term \u201cstringent conditions\u201d refers to hybridization and subsequent washing conditions, which those of ordinary skill in the art conventionally refer to as \u201cstringent\u201d. See Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, supra, Interscience, N.Y., \u00a7\u00a76.3 and 6.4 (1987, 1992), and Sambrook et al. (Sambrook, J. C., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).","Without limitation, examples of stringent conditions include washing conditions 12-20\u00b0 C. below the calculated Tm of the hybrid under study in, e.g., 2 \u00d7SSC and 0.5% SDS for 5 minutes, 2 \u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes; 0.1 \u00d7SSC and 0.5% SDS at 37\u00b0 C. for 30-60 minutes and then, a 0.1 \u00d7SSC and 0.5% SDS at 68\u00b0 C. for 30-60 minutes. Those of ordinary skill in this art understand that stringency conditions also depend on the length of the DNA sequences, oligonucleotide probes (such as 10-40 bases) or mixed oligonucleotide probes. If mixed probes are used, it is preferable to use tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC) instead of SSC. See Ausubel, supra.","Any such mutein preferably has a sequence of amino acids sufficiently duplicative of that of INSP035, such as to have substantially similar, or even better, biological activity as INSP035.","One easily measurable activity of INSP035 is its capability of reducing collagen synthesis. As long as the mutein has substantial collagen reducing activity, it can be considered to have substantially similar activity to INSP035. Thus, it can be determined whether any given mutein has at least substantially the same activity as INSP035 by means of routine experimentation comprising subjecting such a mutein.","In a preferred embodiment, any such mutein has at least 40% identity or homology with the sequence of INSP035. More preferably, it has at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or, most preferably, at least 90% identity or homology thereto.","Identity reflects a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, determined by comparing the sequences. In general, identity refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of the two polynucleotides or two polypeptide sequences, respectively, over the length of the sequences being compared.","For sequences where there is not an exact correspondence, a \u201c% identity\u201d may be determined. In general, the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. This may include inserting \u201cgaps\u201d in either one or both sequences, to enhance the degree of alignment. A % identity may be determined over the whole length of each of the sequences being compared (so-called global alignment), that is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length, or over shorter, defined lengths (so-called local alignment), that is more suitable for sequences of unequal length.","Methods for comparing the identity and homology of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance, programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, version 9.1 (Devereux J et al, 1984), for example the programs BESTFIT and GAP, may be used to determine the % identity between two polynucleotides and the % identity and the % homology between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the \u201clocal homology\u201d algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. Other programs for determining identity and\/or similarity between sequences are also known in the art, for instance the BLAST family of programs (Altschul S F et al, 1990, Altschul S F et al, 1997, accessible through the home page of the NCBI at See Worldwide Website.ncbi.nim.nlh.gov) and FASTA (Pearson W R, 1990; Pearson 1988).","Muteins of INSP035, which can be used in accordance with the present invention, or nucleic acids encoding them, include a finite set of substantially corresponding sequences as substitution peptides or polynucleotides which can be routinely obtained by one of ordinary skill in the art, without undue experimentation, based on the teachings and guidance presented herein.","Preferred changes for muteins in accordance with the present invention are what are known as \u201cconservative\u201d substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions of INSP035 polypeptides or proteins, may include synonymous amino acids within a group which have sufficiently similar physicochemical properties that substitution between members of the group will preserve the biological function of the molecule (Grantham, 1974). It is clear that insertions and deletions of amino acids may also be made in the above-defined sequences without altering their function, particularly if the insertions or deletions only involve a few amino acids, e.g., under thirty, and preferably under ten, and do not remove or displace amino acids which are critical to a functional conformation, e.g., cysteine residues. Proteins and muteins produced by such deletions and\/or insertions come within the purview of the present invention.","Preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table I.

Fusion proteins comprising all or a functional part of INSP035 fused to all or a functional part of a protein capable of improving the biological activities of the molecule, like half-life in the human body, for instance, are preferred according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment the fusion protein comprises an immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion. Fusion proteins comprising all or part of INSP035 fused to all or part of an immunoglobulin are highly preferred. They can be monomeric or multimeric, hetero- or homomultimeric. Advantageously, the fusion protein comprises the constant region of an immunoglobulin, in particular of the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin. Embodiments in which the immunoglobulin is of the IgG1 or IgG2 isotype are further preferred according to the invention. Preferably, the fusion is an Fc fusion.","INSP035 may thus be fused to another protein, polypeptide or the like, e.g., an immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof. The fusion may be direct, or via a short linker peptide which can be as short as 1 to 3 amino acid residues in length or longer, for example, 13 amino acid residues in length. Said linker may be a tripeptide of the sequence E-F-M (Glu-Phe-Met), for example, or a 13-amino acid linker sequence comprising Glu-Phe-Gly-Ala-Gly-Leu-Val-Leu-Gly-Gly-Gln-Phe-Met (SEQ ID NO:12) introduced between the INSP035 sequence and the immunoglobulin sequence.","\u201cFunctional derivatives\u201d as used herein cover derivatives of INSP035, and their muteins and fusion proteins, which may be prepared from the functional groups which occur as side chains on the residues or the N- or C-terminal groups, by means known in the art, and are included in the invention as long as they remain pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. they do not destroy the activity of the protein which is at least substantially similar to the activity of INSP035, and do not confer toxic properties on compositions containing it. Therefore, In a preferred embodiment the functional derivative comprises at least one moiety attached to one or more functional groups, which occur as one or more side chains on the amino acid residues.","In accordance with the present invention, polyethylene glycol (PEG) side-chains are highly preferred moieties. PEG side chains may mask antigenic sites and extend the residence of the substance they are attached to in body fluids. Other derivatives include aliphatic esters of the carboxyl groups, amides of the carboxyl groups by reaction with ammonia or with primary or secondary amines, N-acyl derivatives of free amino groups of the amino acid residues formed with acyl moieties (e.g. alkanoyl or carbocyclic aroyl groups) or O-acyl derivatives of free hydroxyl groups (for example that of seryl or threonyl residues) formed with acyl moieties.","\u201cActive fractions\u201d of INSP035 and its muteins and fusion proteins, cover any fragment or precursors of the polypeptide chain of the protein molecule alone or together with associated molecules or residues linked thereto, e.g., sugar or phosphate residues, or aggregates of the protein molecule or the sugar residues by themselves, provided said active fraction has at least a substantially similar activity to INSP035.","In accordance with the present invention, INSP035 may also be administered to the human body in form of a vector comprising said nucleic acid molecule. Therefore, the invention further relates to the use of a vector comprising said nucleic acid molecule for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prevention of scleroderma or another fibrotic disorder Preferably, the vector is an expression vector, comprising a promoter operably linked to all or part of the coding sequence of INSP035. In a further preferred embodiment, the vector is a gene therapy vector. Gene therapy vectors are known in the art, most of them are virally derived vectors, such as adenoviral or lentiviral vectors.","According to the invention, INSP035 may also be administered to the human body in form of a cell producing and\/or secreting INSP035. Therefore, the invention further relates to the use of a cell expressing INSP035 for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prevention of scleroderma or any other fibrotic disease, i.e. to cell therapy for the treatment and\/or prevention of scleroderma or other fibrotic diseases. The cell may be a naturally producing INSP035 and\/or a transfected cell that produces recombinant INSP035. Preferred are cells expressing and secreting high amounts of the protein, such as over-expressing cells carrying high copy numbers of an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule encoding INSP035.","As fibroblasts represent the machinery of fibrosis they are the most suitable cells for anti-fibrotic and scleroderma therapy. Therefore, preferably, INSP035 expressing fibroblasts are used in accordance with the present invention.","The invention further relates to a cell comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule encoding all or part of INSP035 for the preparation of a medicament for treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic disease, in particular of scleroderma.

Thus, the invention makes use of a technology known as endogenous gene activation (EGA) for the production of the desired protein.","It was also shown here that INSP035 doesn't induce endogenous OPG expression, indicating that INSP035 is not acting through OPG (). This suggests that the use of the combination of INSP035 and OPG might act in an additive or synergistic manner In the treatment of fibrosis. In the same way, several other treatments can be combined with INSP035 to obtain an additive or synergistic effect in accordance with the present invention Therefore, preferably, the medicament of the invention further comprises:\n\n","SARP-1 is a protein shown to have a beneficial effect in fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma (WO02\/46225). Fragments, isoforms, active fractions, fusion proteins or functional derivatives of SARP-1, as described in WO02\/46225, may also be used in combination with INSP035, in accordance with the present invention.","All treatments are intended for simultaneous, sequential or separate use.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the above substances, together with INSP035, are within the scope of the present invention.","Although there is presently no cure for scleroderma, several agents or treatments are presently being used to treat scleroderma symptoms. Such anti-scleroderma agents, which may be used as combination therapy according to the invention, are summarized e.g. in Leighton (2001) or Wigley and Sule (2001), which are fully incorporated by reference herein.","Interferons are predominantly known for inhibitory effects on viral replication and cellular proliferation. Interferon-\u03b3, for example, plays an important role in promoting immune and inflammatory responses. Interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2, an interferon type I), is said to play an anti-inflammatory role.","In yet a further embodiment of the invention, INSP035 is used in combination with a TNF antagonist. TNF antagonists exert their activity in several ways. First, antagonists can bind to or sequester the TNF molecule itself with sufficient affinity and specificity to partially or substantially neutralise the TNF epitope or epitopes responsible for TNF receptor binding (hereinafter termed \u201csequestering antagonists\u201d). A sequestering antagonist may be, for example, an antibody directed against TNF.","Alternatively, TNF antagonists can inhibit the TNF signalling pathway activated by the cell surface receptor after TNF binding (hereinafter termed \u201csignalling antagonists\u201d). TNF antagonists are easily identified and evaluated by routine screening of candidates for their effect on the activity of native TNF on susceptible cell lines in vitro, for example human B cells, in which TNF causes proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. The assay contains TNF formulation at varying dilutions of candidate antagonist, e.g. from 0,1 to 100 times the molar amount of TNF used in the assay, and controls with no TNF or only antagonist (Tucci et al., 1992).","Sequestering antagonists are the preferred TNF antagonists to be used according to the present invention. Amongst sequestering antagonists, those polypeptides that bind TNF with high affinity and possess low immunogenicity are preferred. Soluble TNF receptor molecules and neutralising antibodies to TNF are particularly preferred. For example, soluble forms of TNF-RI (p55) and TNF-RII (p75) are useful in the present invention. Truncated forms of these receptors, comprising the extracellular domains of the receptors or functional portions thereof, are more particularly preferred antagonists according to the present invention. Truncated soluble TNF type-I and type-II receptors are described in EP914431, for example.","Truncated forms of the TNF receptors are soluble and have been detected in urine and serum as about 30 kDa or 40 kDa TNF inhibitory binding proteins, which are called TBPI and TBPII, respectively (Engelmann et al., 1990). The simultaneous, sequential, or separate use of INSP035 with the TNF antagonist and\/or an Interferon is preferred, according to the invention.","According to the invention, TBPI and TBPII are preferred TNF antagonists to be used in combination with an INSP035. Derivatives, fragments, regions and biologically active portions of the receptor molecules functionally resemble the receptor molecules that can also be used in the present invention. Such biologically active equivalent or derivative of the receptor molecule refers to the portion of the polypeptide, or of the sequence encoding the receptor molecule, that is of sufficient size and able to bind TNF with such an affinity that the interaction with the membrane-bound TNF receptor is inhibited or blocked.","In a further preferred embodiment, human soluble TNF-RI (TBPI) is the TNF antagonist to be used according to the invention. The natural and recombinant soluble TNF receptor molecules and methods of their production have been described in the European Patents EP 308 378, EP 398 327 and EP 433 900.","Whilst it may be beneficial to block TNF-\u03b1 in early stages of the disease, it has been discussed that in later stages, TNF itself may exert a beneficial effect on scleroderma (Abraham et al., 2000). Therefore, the invention further relates to a combination of INSP035 and TNF for treatment or prevention of scleroderma, in particular in advanced stages of disease. TNF-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b2 may be used in accordance with the invention.","The Invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising INSP035, optionally together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients, for the treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic disease, in particular scleroderma. The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise any of the above-identified further components, and in particular an interferon, a TBP or a COX inhibitor.","The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention may also comprise a vector comprising a nudeic acid molecule according to the invention, or a cell expressing INSP035.","The active ingredients of the pharmaceutical, i.e. polypeptides, nucleic acids or cells according to the invention, or combinations thereof, as well as the combinations of substances mentioned above, may be administered to an individual in a variety of ways. The routes of administration include intradermal, transdermal (e.g. in slow release formulations), intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, oral, epidural, topical, and intranasal routes. Any other therapeutically efficacious route of administration can be used, for example absorption through epithelial or endothelial tissues or by gene therapy wherein a DNA molecule encoding the active agent is administered to the patient (e.g. via a vector), which causes the active agent to be expressed and secreted in vivo. In addition, the protein(s) according to the invention can be administered together with other components of biologically active agents such as pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants, excipients, carriers, diluents and vehicles.","The definition of \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d is meant to encompass any carrier, which does not interfere with effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient and that is not toxic to the host to which it is administered. For example, for parenteral administration, the active protein(s) may be formulated in a unit dosage form for injection in vehicles such as saline, dextrose solution, serum albumin and Ringer's solution.","For parenteral (e.g. intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular) administration, the active protein(s) can be formulated as a solution, suspension, emulsion or lyophilised powder in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle (e.g. water, saline, dextrose solution) and additives that maintain isotonicity (e.g. mannitol) or chemical stability (e.g. preservatives and buffers). The formulation is sterilized by commonly used techniques.","The bioavailability of the active protein(s) according to the invention can also be ameliorated by using conjugation procedures which increase the half-life of the molecule in the human body, for example linking the molecule to polyethylenglycol, as described in the PCT Patent Application WO 92\/13095.","The therapeutically effective amount of the active protein(s) will be a function of many variables, including the type of receptor, the affinity of the substance according to the invention to its receptor, any residual cytotoxic activity exhibited thereby, the route of administration, the clinical condition of the patient.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is such that when administered, the substance according to the invention results in a beneficial effect on disease development or progression in vivo. The dosage administered, as single or multiple doses, to an individual will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including the pharmacokinetic properties of INSP035, the route of administration, patient conditions and characteristics (sex, age, body weight, health, size), extent of symptoms, concurrent treatments, frequency of treatment and the effect desired. Adjustment and manipulation of established dosage ranges are well within the ability of those skilled in the art.","The dose of the polypeptide according to the invention required will vary from about 0,0001 to 100 mg\/kg or about 0.01 to 10 mg\/kg or about 0.1 to 5 mg\/kg or about 1 3 mg\/kg, although as noted above this will be subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The medicament of the invention may be administered daily, every other day, or three times per week.","The daily doses are usually given in divided doses or in sustained release form effective to obtain the desired results. Second or subsequent administrations can be performed at a dosage, which is the same, less than or greater than the initial or previous dose administered to the individual. A second or subsequent administration can be administered during or prior to onset of the disease.","The invention further relates to a method for treating and\/or preventing fibrotic diseases, in particular scleroderma, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a substance according to the invention, optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Alternatively, or additionally, a cell producing INSP035 or a nucleic acid molecule of the invention, optionally comprised in an expression vector, may be administered according to the invention.","The expression vector may be administered systemically. Preferably the expression vector is administered by intramuscular injection. A further preferred route of administration is inhalation, in particular if lung fibrosis is involved in the disease. Topical administration of an expression vector comprising INSP035 sequences, or of an INSP035 polypeptide according to the invention, is a further preferred route of administration, in particular if there is an involvement of the skin.","The invention further relates to a method for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing an effective amount of INSP035 with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and to a method of treatment and\/or prevention of arthritis comprising administering to a host in need thereof an effective inhibiting amount of INSP035.","All references cited herein, including journal articles or abstracts, published or unpublished patent applications, issued patents or any other references, are entirely incorporated by reference herein, including all data, tables, figures and text presented in the cited references.

Secondly, the assay buffer was used to reconstitute the substrate mix. Then, 50 \u03bcl of reconstituted substrate mix was added to each well of the supernatant. The plate was thereafter covered and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, protected from light. 50 \u03bcl of stop solution was then added to each well and the absorbance recorded at 490 nm.","2.6 OPG Enzyme Immunoassay","To check whether INSP035 stimulates endogenous OPG production or not, L929 cells were cultured in 96-well plates with various amounts of INSP035 variants (as described for the cytotoxicity assay). 50 \u03bcl of the conditioned media were taken for the OPG production assay. The OPG ELISA kit (BIOMEDICA, Cat. No. BI-20402) was used to measure OPG production at 24 hours and 48 hours after INSP035 treatment.","2.7 Conclusion","INSP035 and its variants are potent inhibitors of TRAIL in an in vitro assay designed to select anti-apoptotic molecules in fibroblasts with osteoprotegerin (OPG) as control (see ; similar curves were obtained with the other variants). Hence, like OPG, INSP035 is able to counteract the apoptotic effect of soluble human recombinant TRAIL on fibroblasts, thereby consistently reducing fibroblasts' apoptosis. In the same assay, leptin did not affect TRAIL-mediated apoptosis ().","Results of the OPG enzyme immunoassay suggest that INSP035, acting through a different pathway than OPG, is likely to act in an additive or synergistic manner with OPG in the treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic disease.","Based on the above findings and on the fact that TRAIL stimulates collagen production, it is suggested that INSP035 might prove useful in the treatment and\/or prevention of fibrotic disease.","A Gateway\u2122 cloning system compatible plasmid, pENTR-INSP035-6HIS was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis, in order to insert a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (5\u2032 AAGGAGATG) upstream of the initiating codon of the INSP035 cDNA. The resultant mutated plasmid was then subjected to a recombination reaction with the expression vector pDEST14 to create pDEST14-SD-INSP035-6HIS.","3.

relative to GAPDH expression of 0.5, TaqMan expression results show that INSP035 is highly expressed in fetal liver, cervix, pancreas, adrenal gland, human lupus spleen, ulcerative colitis mixed small intestine, and particularly in lung. Strong expression in lung and liver supports the involvement of INSP035 in lung and liver fibrosis.","Administration of a single intra-tracheal injection bleomycin to C57BL\/6 mice results in the rapid induction of pulmonary fibrosis within 14 days, which is characterized by increased collagen deposition within the lung interstitium (Hattori et al., 2000. Zuo et al. 2002. Phillips et al 2004). In order to determine if INSP035 administration could have any protective effect against the development of fibrosis or indeed reduce the severity of the disease, effect of daily injection of INSP035 can be tested in bleomycin treated mice.","In order to complete the experiment, mice are divided into four groups. Bleomycin is administered by a single intra-tracheal instillation to 3 groups of 10 mice. For comparison a 4group of mice is included in the study which comprises completely untreated, age and sex matched individuals (na\u00efve mice). INSP035 is administered by subcutaneous injection starting the day after bleomycin treatment. One group receives a high bleomycin dose (5 mg\/kg), the second group receives a lower bleomycin dose (0.5 mg\/kg) and control mice receive saline s.c. daily.","Animals treated with bleomycin should fall sick with rapid loss of body mass leading to death.","All surviving mice are sacrificed 12 days after the bleomycin treatment. Histological analysis of lungs reveals the effect of INSP035 treated animals. Reduced hydroxyproline content should be observed in INSP035 treated mice (hydroxyproline content is a measure of collagen deposition). It can be concluded that INSP035 treatment effectively leads to reduced collagen deposition in the lungs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
