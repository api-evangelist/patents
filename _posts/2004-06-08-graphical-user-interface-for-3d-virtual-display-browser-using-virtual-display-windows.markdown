The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent & Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. Copyright \u00a92004 Purple Interactive Ltd.","The present invention generally relates to data processing. The invention relates more specifically to information display.","The approaches described in this section could be pursued, but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Modern display or presentation devices typically include computer apparatus such as networked, desktop, laptop, handheld or tablet personal computers (PCs), personal digital assistants (PDAs), interactive television terminals, gaming apparatus and cell phones. Each item of apparatus usually has a single display, and this may be in the form of a traditional computer, television or cell phone display screen or may take the form of projection equipment, virtual reality goggles, projection spectacles, holographic projections, electronic paper or cerebral implants.","There is a desire amongst viewers accessing a large volume of material content to be able to browse and navigate the full set of content in order to find a subset or single unit of content which is relevant or interesting to the viewer. Currently such browsing and navigation is typically conducted by means of descriptive text typed into search engine software and thereby matched to text contained in the material content itself or to text which a content provider has used to label the content. Browsing and navigation is also sometimes aided by third-party content categorizers who provide directories and sub-directories of content labels and descriptions.","However, these techniques for browsing and navigating large volumes of material content for display inevitably rely upon the individual viewer's skills in language and logic, as well as that of the content providers. With directory searching, the viewer must guess and replicate the logic followed by the third-party content categorizers, who must categorize and describe material content accurately and in a way which will readily be found by the intended viewers. With text entry searching, viewers need a good verbal memory to think of appropriate search terms, an extensive vocabulary, and skills in using Boolean logic in order to enter the most effective text, and content providers must accurately guess which keywords will be entered by viewers searching for their material content.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Embodiments are described herein according to the following outline:\n\n","The invention is a method of organizing and displaying a large volume of material content in a manner that can be easily browsed and accurately navigated by a viewer without relying upon the viewer's, nor the content providers', skills in language or logic.","The material content may be information in any form, for example: data, numbers, text, still images such as photographs and graphics, moving images, virtual control panels and sound. It may be retrieved from a local computer disk or removable storage media or any form of network such as a local area network, a wireless network, a cell phone network, a wide area network, an internet, extranet or the Internet. The invention may, for example, be used for displaying material content on a computer screen and navigating through the type of material content typically found on the Internet.","According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for organizing and presenting material content on a display to a viewer, the method comprising: mapping a plurality of display windows within a virtual three-dimensional space so that each display window is allocated a specific and predetermined position in the space, rendering each display window in three-dimensional perspective according to its position and angle relative to a viewer's virtual position in the virtual space, cross-referencing the position of each display window to a storage location of the material content that is designated to be rendered in that particular display window at a particular time based on at least one predetermined condition, allocating at least part of the three-dimensional virtual space to display windows whose content is not chosen or determined by the viewer, selecting, retrieving and preparing material content for possible subsequent display, according to a predetermined algorithm, selecting and rendering prepared material content within its cross-referenced display window, according to a predetermined algorithm, and providing a means of virtual navigation that changes the viewer's position in the space in such a manner as to simulate movement through a plurality of predefined channels in the virtual space.","A browser adapted to perform this method is also provided, as is apparatus programmed to operate the browser.","According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for organizing and presenting material content on a display to a viewer, the apparatus comprising: a display, means for mapping a plurality of display windows within a three-dimensional virtual space so that each display window is allocated a specific and predetermined position, means for rendering each display in three-dimensional perspective according to its position and angle relative to the viewer's position in the virtual space, means for cross referencing the position of each display window to the network address or storage location of the material content that is designated to be rendered in that particular display window at a particular time based on at least one predetermined condition, means for selecting, retrieving and preparing material content for possible subsequent display according to a predetermined algorithm, means for selecting and rendering prepared material content within its cross-referenced display window according to a predetermined algorithm, and means for navigation controlled by the viewer that changes the viewer's position in such a manner as to simulate movement through a plurality of predefined channels in the virtual space.","According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a virtual space manager comprising a content configurator that includes the interface for the creation, maintenance and updating of the configuration which incorporates a plurality of cross references of content material to render in display windows.","According to a fourth aspect of the invention the method of the first aspect may be adapted as a business method for example when used to supply in exchange for financial payment the right to specify the network address or storage location of material content that is to be rendered in a particular display window at a specified location at a particular time, and optionally enabling and recording the transfer of rights in exchange for financial payment, and\/or providing an auction system inviting financial bids to the current holder of rights and awarding the rights to the highest bidder provided predetermined conditions are met, and\/or providing advertising opportunities in the three-dimensional virtual space in exchange for financial payments.","In addition, a viewer's navigation into a restricted area of the three-dimensional virtual space is allowed for a particular period of time in exchange for financial payment. Added value services may also be provided in exchange for financial payments, e.g. avatar companions, guides to navigation, the ability to navigate simultaneously and interactively with one or more other actual viewers, e-commerce support, and financial services including foreign exchange, credit and budget planning.","The method of the invention may be used to enable any one or more of Internet browsing, virtual stores, virtual supermarkets, virtual shopping malls, virtual retail catalogues, knowledge management, virtual exhibitions, medical records management, virtual hospital patient management, virtual galleries, virtual museums, entertainment choices, tourist guides, TV guides, news digests, travel\/hospitality option guides, virtual trade fairs and photo libraries.","According to a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided a browser for retrieving pages of material content over a computer network, comprising means for selecting material content for display according to a predetermined algorithm, means for cross-referencing the position of each display window to a storage location of selected material content based on at least one predetermined condition, means for allocating at least part of the three-dimensional virtual space to display windows whose content is not chosen or determined by the viewer, and means for retrieving and rendering selected material content within its cross-referenced display window according to a predetermined algorithm.","According to a sixth aspect of the invention there is provided a business method comprising offering to download a browser (according to the fifth aspect) to a plurality of potential viewers and offering the display windows in the virtual space for rent to potential rights owners in the form of business and commercial enterprises.","The present invention has advantages because it does not rely upon language and logic in browsing and navigating large volumes of content. Instead of relying upon language and logic, the invention makes it possible to indicate the relevance of content to a viewer by applying a rule of spatial proximity. Specifically, if content A is relevant to the viewer, and content B is similarly relevant, then A and B can be positioned near to one another, so that the viewer of content A is likely also to see content B with a minimum of navigation.","In order to apply the rule of spatial proximity to material content in displays, the present invention may utilize and uniquely combine three methods:","(1) The creation of a three-dimensional virtual space containing many display windows in fixed, specified positions,","(2) The realistic topographical navigation of this world by viewers, which prevents them jumping instantly from one display window to any other, but instead forces them to travel smoothly along surface channels that expose the viewer to other display windows along the way, and","(3) The operation of a self-organizing allocation process in which content providers compete for the most beneficial display window positions for their content.","Corresponding to these three methods are three forms of prior art which make clear the novelty of the present invention:","(1) The creation of a virtual three-dimensional world of display in fixed, specified positions.","A browser that also configures display windows in three dimensions is described in International Patent Application Publication Number WO 01\/82295. This describes a browser that arranges HTML pages on the back, top, bottom, left and right inside faces of a cube, with the viewer positioned just inside the nearest (sixth) face. Each of the five navigable inside faces can open into a further cube. The aim is to enable the viewer simultaneously to see several pages selected by the viewer. This could be especially useful where the content on the five pages is being compared or contrasted.","The present invention differs from this disclosure in several respects: in particular because the display windows in the present invention have fixed, specified positions in the space rather than being subject to manipulation by the viewer, and the content on display is predetermined by cross-references rather than by the viewer.","(2) The realistic topographical navigation forcing the viewer to travel smoothly along the surface and thus be exposed to display windows on the way.","Another method for searching and presenting information in a geography-based configuration which also provides realistic navigation is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Number US 2002\/0059207 A1. This method converts multiple aerial photos of an actual city into a three-dimensional stereoscopic aerial view, and allows the viewer to move across this view, simulating a \u2018sight-seeing flight\u2019, and to request information pertaining to his or her location. This is done by linking the latitude and longitude of the viewer's position with \u2018landmark databases\u2019 compiled using conventional Internet searches based on keywords or other verbal expressions. Multiple viewers can interact and be tracked.","The present invention differs from this disclosure in several respects: the content being presented in the present invention is organized by predetermined cross references rather than by reference to their physical property locations, and material content is directly displayed in windows forming part of the landscape being viewed rather than indirectly displayed as separate page data.","(3) A self-organizing allocation process in which content providers compete for the most beneficial display window positions for their content.","Another method comprising a self-organizing allocation process for the display of large volumes of material content is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,308,202. This method invites each primary content provider on the Internet to select one or more of thousands of verbal categories to describe their content and then allows other secondary content providers, for example advertisers, to supply relevant additional information to anyone viewing the primary categorized content. By allowing both primary and secondary content providers to determine the categories they believe are most relevant to their content, the allocation of secondary information to interested viewers is optimized. The present invention differs from this disclosure in several respects, particularly since material content in the present invention is displayed in predetermined cross-referenced display windows. In embodiments of the present invention: content providers select relative positions in a virtual space to describe their content rather than use verbal categories; the exposure of viewers to relevant secondary content is achieved by virtue of the required realistic method of navigation, rather than it being imposed as a separate unrequested display of content; and due to the competitive nature of the self-organizing process, the \u2018description\u2019 (i.e. the position in the virtual space) assigned to any particular material content reflects not just its meaning but also the value ascribed to that content by its provider.","The present invention benefits both content providers and content viewers:","Content providers using embodiments of the invention have control over where and how their content is seen in the context of all content, rather than granting that control to third-party content categorizers or the rule-makers of search engine software. Content providers using embodiments of the invention also need not rely on verbal descriptions (e.g. domain names, meta-text, directory entries, or descriptive advertisements) to attract interested viewers, but instead can attract relevant viewers to their content by means of its contextual position and the quality of its visual treatment. Because the self-organizing is competitive, the prominence of displayed content is commensurate with the importance of the communication to the content provider.","Viewers using embodiments of the invention can rely upon the naturalistic, non-verbal experience of perceiving the relatedness of two entities by their spatial proximity, rather than relying upon terms or names they happen to recall, or entering topics into search engines in accordance with Boolean logic. Viewers can also more rapidly decide the relevance of content by relying on quick visual impressions rather than reading lists of arbitrary text excerpts. Lastly, viewers using embodiments of the invention can experience the serendipity of discovering new, hitherto-unknown content, or content that its provider considers to be of interest to them, rather than being limited to content that the viewer has had to search for and therefore must already know about.","The present invention enables the designation and fixing of the association of material content with other material content in a three-dimensional space containing display windows that are each rendered in three-dimensional perspective. In one embodiment of the present invention, the configuration of these display windows, each containing material content, is analogous to shop windows on a city street.","To populate this system with content, content providers may be invited to specify their material content to appear in a particular window which by virtual spatial proximity associates their material content with what they consider to be related material content in surrounding and nearby display windows. In this way, associated content, presented in display windows, will self-organize into virtual neighborhoods of related content that the user can browse as one would the shop windows along streets of a city. Having located a display window with content of interest to the user, the user may without verbal or logical discernment easily find other content in nearby windows that its providers have decided would also be of interest to the user.","In still another aspect, an embodiment provides a graphical user interface comprising a main pane, a web (or content) button area, an input area, a mini map area, and a 3B button area is disclosed. The main pane selectively displays either (a) three-dimensional perspective view of a virtual three-dimensional space that comprises a plurality of virtual display windows, wherein each of the virtual display windows is allocated a specific position in the space and is associated with a network location identifier of a content provider, or (b) a web page or interactive content view of network content associated with the network location identifier, or (c) a map view comprising a map of the virtual three-dimensional space. Various map display, path generation, and navigation functions are provided. The graphical user interface provides a flexible and intuitive way to navigate a complex three-dimensional virtual world in which web pages or interactive content are mapped to virtual display windows of virtual buildings in a virtual city.","2.1 Overview of User Interface and Browsing Methods","In  a display , which may be a screen of a computer, is shown, on which is depicted an image of a virtual street  seen in three-dimensional perspective from the middle of the street . Buildings  are located on each side of the street , and each has one or more virtual display windows  facing the street . The buildings and the street decrease in size, appearing to recede, as they get further from the nominal position of the viewer. The angle of recession is chosen so that the perspective appears natural but so that content displayed in the display windows on the sides of the buildings is clear. The relative width w and height h of each display window  is chosen to match the content to be displayed, but in the embodiment using Internet pages is chosen to match that of the normal visible HTML page area in a traditional Internet browser, i.e., the standard screen size minus the space used by scrollbars and tool bars. This gives the viewer the impression that he is standing in a street having shops with shop windows on each side. Each virtual display window  shows a page of content retrieved from an Internet HTML page. These may be the home pages of commercial concerns or pages specially generated for display in this format.","The actual number of visible display windows will be chosen so that the overall view looks realistic and so that a reasonable number of the windows are clearly visible. The number can be variable in dependence upon the performance of the computer or adjustable by the viewer to enhance performance or to enhance the detail of rendering of content in the windows. For example, it may be appropriate to display two blocks of the street at a time and three windows on each side in each block but to replace the more distant windows with a low-resolution rendering or even a small icon.","The viewer's viewpoint can be moved up or down the street  and as it is moved, the display changes to bring other windows  into view and to change the relative sizes of the displayed buildings . The changes must be accomplished realistically and smoothly. The viewer can also turn left or right to face a particular window to inspect more carefully the content displayed there. If the content comprises Internet HTML pages then at that point the HTML page displayed in that window can be opened by the viewer to fill a separate Internet browser of more traditional two-dimensional appearance. Optionally the viewer can then interact with the chosen HTML page in the traditional manner, for example by using mouse clicks on a part of it to access another page of information or to make a choice such as initiating a purchase from a shopping system represented on the page.","The street  is part of a larger virtual space such as an urban landscape in the form of a town or city set out in a grid-like city block layout although the layout of the landscape need not necessarily be in the form of a uniform perpendicular grid: \u201ccurved roads\u201d and \u201ctraffic circles\u201d may be incorporated and narrow \u201cpaths\u201d may lead off from wider \u201cstreets\u201d. \u201cHilly\u201d surfaces and \u201cravines\u201d or other geographic representations may be included. The virtual space may be limited or infinite or limited in some directions and may be on more than one plane. The display windows will typically have straight edges as shown in , but may be made more eye-catching with decorated frames.","The viewer can navigate through the landscape by making appropriate key strokes on the keyboard, by mouse movements or by using a joystick, track pad, trackball, touch screen, remote control or virtual reality gloves or a steering wheel, in manners known to persons skilled in the art. Several navigation speeds are envisaged which would generally be under the control of the viewer. For example the viewer may \u201cmove\u201d at walking speed through the \u201cstreets\u201d or may choose to move at the equivalent speed of a taxi, within the same plane as the display windows. The viewer may also opt to move at an even higher speed in a different plane to the display windows, for example in a manner analogous to a subway system or a helicopter. However it is intended that limits would be applied to the viewer's \u201cmovement\u201d through the landscape to avoid the possibility of the viewer instantly jumping to a specified display window location in the landscape because such a movement would undermine the organizational principle that enables the viewer to find relevant content: namely, content providers locating their content in virtual spatial proximity to associated content.","Each display window  may be sold or rented to a commercial concern or other organization and has a fixed position in the landscape, in a similar manner to the fixed addresses of shops or businesses in a real town or city. In this way the viewer becomes familiar with the positions of his or her favored windows and can easily search and select relevant \u201cneighborhoods\u201d of material content.","The display is organized by a controlling browser program operating locally, e.g. on the viewer's computer terminal. The browser program controls the display of the virtual landscape, navigation of the viewer's position through the landscape, and the retrieval, preparation and rendering of content displayed in each window. In an internal or external cross-referencing file, the URL of the Internet HTML page of each relevant commercial concern owning or renting a display window is associated in the program with the specific display window the concern has reserved. Periodically, bitmap screenshots of a set of HTML pages relevant to the windows in the local vicinity of the viewer in the landscape (e.g. those associated with all of the display windows in the blocks and streets adjacent to or around the corner from the viewer) are cached in local memory. In one implementation, this uses an adapted HTML page-rendering engine which can import live HTML pages in a way in which their contents are reproduced dynamically. Thus a set of live HTML pages is continuously saved in memory at the viewer' terminal. The number of HTML pages thus saved will depend upon the available memory and the processing power of the terminal as well as the number of windows displayed on the screen at any one time, but might typically be 9.","When a window first becomes visible in the viewer's screen, the corresponding cached HTML page is copied by the program from the internal memory and rendered in the window. The page is not rendered dynamically until the viewer turns toward it (and \u201cclicks\u201d on it or remains in that position for a set period of time), at which stage the dynamically cached page may be displayed in a two dimensional, conventional-style browser display box. Totally live dynamic rendering of all visible HTML pages in-situ on a street would be possible with sufficient processing power.","As the viewer \u201cmoves\u201d along the street, distant windows come into view and close-by ones pass out of sight \u201cbehind\u201d the viewer. Thus the program carefully selects the set of HTML pages to cache and store in memory to ensure a smooth and fast appearance of rendered display windows as the viewer \u201cmoves\u201d, by ensuring that HTML pages corresponding to approaching windows are downloaded into memory in time. A certain amount of predictive programming must be built-in to anticipate the next likely \u201cmovements\u201d of the viewer, for example on the basis of previous navigation patterns.","It is envisaged that facilities will be provided on an administration Internet site to allow the registration of the rights of content providers to own or rent particular display windows, to manage transactions (e.g. taxes and fees), and to allow a display window owner or tenant to upload directly their network address or storage location and maintain their display window. The rights holder may test the appearance of their display window and view statistics or contour maps indicating the number and frequency of visits to their window and\/or simulations of corresponding virtual \u201cproperty values\u201d.","There may be a number of different neighborhoods or districts in the virtual city, each with its own distinctive layout and look and feel, just as in a real city. For example, there may be an area in which HTML pages of interest to young people predominate, or an area which specializes in public sector content. In one embodiment, a particular area of the \u201ccity\u201d is designated as the viewer's \u201chometown\u201d area and is populated, for example, with the viewer's own favorites or bookmarked HTML pages, or with pages found from a conventional search.","Different sections of the virtual city could be designated \u201cgated\u201d areas which would be accessible only to users with a special subscriber pass: given either by virtue of payment made by the viewer in advance or for example on condition that the viewer has proven that they have a sufficient credit rating for financial transactions within the \u201cgated\u201d area or are a member of a club.","The layout of the \u201ccity\u201d is detailed in a standard format XML file in the form of plot data, which in the example given is for a three window by three window city block grid layout, although other layouts are possible. The XML file may be contained in the control program loaded on the viewer's computer (the client) or may be retrievable from a remote server via a standard HTTP connection in which case there will be security to protect the integrity of the file.","Any of the pages may incorporate sounds but it is most practical to suppress sounds from pages other than those closest to the viewer. For example sound on the pages in the windows directly to the left and the right of the viewer's nominal position could each be set at a volume of 50% in the left and the right stereo channels respectively. If a viewer turns to face a page then that page plays at 100% volume. When a page is more than half way out of view the volume is lowered to 25%, and the volume of the next page is increased to 25%.","As already mentioned, navigation may be performed by keyboard strokes, mouse movements or a joystick. Traditionally the arrow keys on a keyboard are used for movement e.g. in one implementation when the \u201cup\u201d key is depressed the viewpoint moves forward at a predetermined pace, and releasing the \u201cup\u201d key stops the viewpoint at the next full window, i.e. at the point when the nearest vertical edges of the windows abut the left and right vertical edges of the display area. Pressing the \u201cdown\u201d key moves the viewer back (while facing forward) and the \u201cleft\u201d key makes the viewer turn to face the window to the left. Likewise the \u201cright\u201d key is used for a right turn. At intersections of \u201cstreets\u201d the \u201cright\u201d key turns the user right onto the perpendicular \u201cstreet\u201d and the \u201cleft\u201d key turns the user left onto that \u201cstreet\u201d.","More advanced forms of navigation can be incorporated, for example using a variety of keys, mouse-movement controls and right-click shortcuts and these are well known, particularly in the field of video game programming and usage.","In one embodiment there is an experience simulating transport by underground train built into the virtual city. Several display windows throughout the virtual city are rendered to appear as underground train stations and the viewer can \u201center\u201d a station by turning to face the relevant display window, using an appropriate navigation technique. A diagrammatic map of all \u201cunderground train stations\u201d is then displayed to the viewer \u201cin\u201d the station and he can then select a destination station by \u201cclicking\u201d on the appropriate part of the map to travel to a different part of the \u201ccity\u201d. A typical long distance \u201cjourney\u201d might take 10 to 15 seconds and during this simulated journey the control program activates the display to the viewer of a series of advertisements which would typically be paid for by the owners of the display windows near the destination station. This would be analogous to advertising hoardings at real underground train stations and on real underground trains. At the destination station in a different part of the virtual town, the viewer would \u201cexit\u201d the station through another window rendered as a train station and emerge into a street rendered with the HTML pages chosen by owners of display windows in that part of the \u201ccity\u201d.","The virtual city is typically entered only via designated gateways or portals to facilitate the viewer's familiarity with and navigation through the landscape. There is a single major \u201cdefault\u201d gateway, and a series of secondary gateways which can be selected from a map or menu or randomly offered to a viewer. The underground train stations would comprise some of the secondary gateways. Gateways could be depicted in striking or memorable designs to aid navigation.","The selection of which gateway is used to enter the virtual city can be made by a viewer each time the program is launched but if no selection is made then the entry gateway will default to the main gateway.","A bird's-eye view topological map of the whole virtual city or the neighborhood or district in which the viewer is located at any one time is displayed, either adjacent to or behind the main viewing window. The path taken by the viewer may be highlighted on this map, either for the current session alone or for the current and at least one previous session. A zoom option would also be provided, leading to the display of larger, more detailed maps. Such a map may have certain \u201clandmark\u201d display windows marked, these possibly being determined by the owners having paid a fee to appear on the large scale maps. When navigating the main window in the usual way, the viewer may also be allowed to rise up above the virtual space to get an overview of his current location and environs in the virtual city.","Locations visited by a viewer could be \u201cbookmarked\u201d or \u201csearched for\u201d in the traditional manner. However, the viewer is unable to jump directly to a bookmarked or search result location but must instead travel along the streets to reach it, in one embodiment guided by the most efficient route being highlighted on the map or automatically led there through the streets. In this way the viewer will find his or her way around the virtual landscape and will learn the positions of particular Internet sites. In addition, this inability to jump means that the viewer must pass many display windows and the owners or tenants of those windows will have the advantage of more viewers seeing their content.","An avatar may represent the viewer and\/or a shopping companion; for example an amusing pet or an attractive imaginary friend may be depicted on the screen. Such a companion could move just in front of the notional position of the viewer and might point out new window displays, changes, promotions, sales or windows which are considered likely to interest the viewer on the basis of past navigational behavior. Several viewers can \u201cwindow-shop\u201d together if they are logged on simultaneously. In this embodiment there is a system for assigning navigation control to one of the group. A means of communicating between the viewers, such as a text or voice chat line for conversation, or an on-screen messaging facility, may also be incorporated and the technology for such features is well known.","Viewers could also be given a visual representation of the number of other viewers in their current vicinity: for example a translucent silhouette of one person representing one thousand, or one million, other viewers. This would serve to indicate the relative popularity of neighborhoods, streets and windows and would also assist window owners or tenants to determine the effect of a change in their display or to assess the advantage of paying more \u201crent\u201d or a higher \u201cpurchase price\u201d for a display window in a busier, more popular part of the city.","The virtual buildings could have several stories, allowing different levels of windows, analogous to different stories of a shopping mall in real life. To the elevations of these virtual buildings where a display is not practicable could be affixed advertisements or virtual signs relating to the display windows immediately below them, providing a means of attracting viewers to navigate their way towards the advertiser's display window.","Streets and neighborhoods may be assigned names to assist in navigation for the viewer and to facilitate the sale or rental of prime locations. Landmarks may also be incorporated to assist the viewer in navigation. For example statues, architecturally interesting buildings such as distinctively decorated or designed buildings, fountains and parks may be used to identify specific areas of the landscape.","Adjacent windows could be merged to create larger windows and several different virtual cities could be created and linked by a rapid transport system in a similar way to the underground railway described above.","In a more advanced embodiment viewers will pass \u201cthrough\u201d the windows and the screen will then display a virtual rendering of the \u201cinside\u201d of an associated establishment. Thus, for example, the display window of a supermarket can be a gateway into the virtual supermarket itself and on \u201centering\u201d the window the viewer would see the virtual \u201cstreets\u201d become virtual aisles of the supermarket. Instead of displaying HTML pages of internet sites in the windows lining the aisles, HTML pages of sets of product images are displayed and a \u201cclick\u201d on an individual product initiates a dialog box to display product details as supplied by the retailer: for example, ingredients or other details or the sizes, prices or colors available. A transparent interface with the retailer's own existing shopping cart may be provided in the control program.","The virtual town may be replaced by other virtual three-dimensional spaces in addition to the above example of a virtual department store, supermarket or retail catalogue establishment. A virtual shopping mall would be populated with display windows representing a variety of shop fronts or a virtual museum with exhibition cases or exhibits. Other applications are envisaged such as virtual tours of representations of actual cities, virtual trade fairs, virtual photo libraries, entertainment choices (e.g. videogame selection), TV program selection, or business or academic libraries. It would also be possible to use this method to access technical data or medical records.","Viewers are requested to register their details and their navigation behavior could be collected for sale to display window owners or tenants.","Display window owners or tenants can utilize the top portion of the window for a display sign or banner of their name label or brand for the convenience of the viewers.","Many further advertising \u201csigns\u201d and \u201choardings\u201d could be incorporated such as to resemble hanging signs and sandwich signs outside a shop window, as well as display advertisements on the floor of the street outside a window or directing viewers to a particular window.","From a technical point of view, the browser software preferably comprises two sections. A first section, running at high priority, controls the display of the virtual three-dimensional environment (e.g., the virtual city) and the navigation of the viewer around that environment. A second section, running at lower priority, updates the content for display windows.","Steps taken by one embodiment of such a browser will now be described with reference to the flow diagram of  for operation of the software when installed on a network with the viewer using a client computer terminal connected via HTTP to a remote server computer.","In step A, the browser is first initiated and may run several brief benchmarking tests to determine the optimal settings that will ensure a smooth and responsive display. This benchmarking is determined by assessing the resources available, i.e. the computing speed, graphics card, and memory capabilities of the client computer.","In step B, the browser then retrieves the layout of the virtual space or world to be displayed (e.g. the virtual city) from the remote server computer or a file saved locally.","In step C, the retrieved layout is used by the software to map the virtual city for internal use by the viewer's computer (the client) and the browser generates a simulated three-dimensional environment depicting display windows closest to the nominal position of the viewer, for example at the default gateway. The perspective is adjusted to ensure that items closer to the nominal position of the viewer are larger. Each display window  has a relative width and height to match (or have similar proportions to) that of the visible HTML page area in a traditional Internet browser. This would typically be the standard screen size minus the space used by scroll bars and toolbars. The size of the display windows, resolution of the graphical textures in the display windows and number of rendering threads depends upon the benchmark conditions established in the initialization process. For illustration purposes, blocks of three display windows length and width are considered as shown in , but any configuration would be possible. The browser then assigns addresses, typically URL addresses for HTML pages, to each window according to the retrieved layout.","In step D, cached HTML pages stored as textures in the client computer memory are used to populate the display windows in memory.","In step E, the browser displays the three-dimensional environment on the display.","In step F, the viewer can move around in the area of the street or corridor  between the display windows  and the viewer can interact with individual display windows . The browser also enables the viewer to interact with an underground railway station and in that case displays a map of available underground railway destinations from which the viewer can make a selection.","In step G, the browser has several threads running simultaneously, each processing material content and updating the texture used for the respective display windows. These threads comprise the following procedures:\n\n","Log files may be used for recording the frequency with which viewers pass-by, draw close to, or interact with any display window, and thus data can potentially be provided in summary to commercial owners and tenants either free or for consideration. Such data can be displayed as a contour map indicating traffic densities across the virtual space.","The technical approach described here involves the textures used for the display windows being rendered by the client program. In an alternative technical approach, a centralized cluster of servers could create the textures, and these could be downloaded by the client program.","It will be seen that the display and navigation methods of the present invention can be used in business methods to raise revenues.","For example, the virtual space may be used in an analogous way to any property space and new properties can be sold or leased, ground rents and service charges imposed, property tax applied to transfers of window rights, an administration charge made for sales, and procedures adapted to re-possess voided leases. In addition, advertising space, markings and signage can be leased, virtual moving advertising carriers included (e.g. vans or floating items), avatar shopping guides provided, and coupons could be distributed to viewers passing a particular window. Advertising agencies can act as virtual property agents for clients and virtual outdoor media owners can act as display window aggregators. Multiple interlinked three-dimensional \u201cworlds,\u201d each containing one or more \u201ccities,\u201d can be represented, and technology companies could each host separate such \u201cworlds.\u201d","In addition, road tolls, gateway tolls, admission fees and transport charges could be built into any model.","By analogy with e-commerce business methods, a sales tax could be imposed on viewers transacting with content providers. An auction system could be used to enable display window rights owners to buy or sell their rights to others. The presentation, display and navigation method has many possible applications. Apart from the HTML browsing and virtual shopping embodiments described in detail above, virtual entertainment guides, tourist guides, trade fairs and travel\/hospitality guides could be created. The method also finds application in displaying the contents of libraries, photo libraries, scientific data, and medical records and it could play a role in virtual government.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0128"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"In another embodiment, a virtual city comprises one or more virtual multi-storey buildings.

For example, as step , city server  hosts an HTML document that contains links for downloading copies of virtual space browser . At step , the exclusive right to display an advertisement or other content in a particular virtual space window for a specified time period is offered. For example, city server  may provide one or more HTML documents that specify display window locations in a virtual city and provide an offer to lease a display right for such locations for a specified fee or rent amount.","At step , an account is created for a content provider. Step  assumes that a content provider, such as an advertiser or an owner or operator of a Web site, has viewed the offers of step , selected a particular virtual space that the content provider wishes to lease, and indicated interest in leasing, for example, by selecting a link that notifies the city server  of such interest.","At step , an offer of payment is received from a content provider. For example, as part of providing a notification of interest in leasing a particular virtual space, content provider A may offer a particular fee or agree to pay a fee or rental amount that is advertised by the city server in connection with the selected space.","At step , the city server and content provider negotiate the duration of a virtual window display lease, payment amount, and other terms of a lease transaction as necessary. Step  may be performed through human interaction or through manual or automated exchange of electronic messages.","At step , a payment is processed. For example, city server  receives an HTML document representing payment information from the content provider A. After step , a city server virtual window lease transaction is complete.","At step , network location data is received from the content provider, and at step  the network location data is stored in a content database. In one embodiment, content provider A provides, to city server , a URL or other identifier for a Web page, image, file, or other information. In response, city server  stores the URL or other identifier in content database  in association with an identifier of the particular virtual window display location that has been leased by content provider A. Thereafter, the URL is delivered as part of data definition  when requested by computer C. As a result, when a user of computer C browses a virtual city represented by the data definition  using browser , the browser displays the content identified in the URL by content provider A when the user is viewing the virtual window that has been leased by the content provider. Further, this approach offers the benefit that the city server  does not host content, which may require significant mass storage. Instead, the content is hosted by the content provider A and merely referenced in the data definition  and in databases of the city server .","In one embodiment, a content provider may make changes to the URL by interacting with interfaces . For example, interfaces  may include a tenant access interface with which a tenant may specify an account name and password. Upon verification of the password, the tenant gains access to account information including HTML documents that display the URL or other network location identifier. Other information might include the display name of the display window and any category that the window might belong to. The tenant can enter updates to such information and submit an updated page to the city server.","Illustrating the foregoing process in more detail,  is a flow diagram of a process of browsing a virtual city. At step , a three-dimensional virtual space browser is executed by a client. For example, computer C executes browser . In step , a client selects a city for viewing. In one embodiment, computer C connects to universe server  and receives a list of virtual cities that are then-currently managed by the universe server. The list may be delivered in an HTML document, and all information exchanged as part of the process of  may comprise HTML documents or XML documents or a continuous streaming format. A user of computer C then selects a particular virtual city, for example, by selecting a hyperlink or a user interface widget.","In step , the client contacts the Front End Server associated with the city server of the selected city. For example, selecting a particular city may result in the universe server redirecting the browser of the computer C to a particular city server . In step , the client receives a data definition of a virtual city. For example, when browser  of computer C contacts the Front End Server associated with the city server , the browser requests and the Front End Server for that city delivers a copy of data definition .","At step , the client authenticates the data definition. For example, browser  uses cryptographic techniques to validate a digital signature of city server  that has been applied to data definition . Using such authentication, the browser  can verify that the data definition  is genuine. As a result, malicious parties cannot substitute unauthorized content in a virtual city or otherwise manipulate the appearance or content of a virtual city.","Assuming authentication is successful, at step , the client renders and displays the virtual city, and in step  the user navigates within the virtual city to view information content displayed in one or more virtual display windows. In one embodiment, the three-dimensional virtual space browser  executed at computer C renders and displays a view of a virtual city based on parsing and interpreting the data definition .

Thus, the content of a particular virtual display window  appears the same as a corresponding Web site associated with a content provider that is the then-current tenant for the virtual display window. Further, a user may interact with a virtual display window as if the window is a Web page. For example, a user can navigate to a particular virtual display window , view and select hyperlinks . In an alternative embodiment the interaction might be partial, so that clicking anywhere on a particular display window may result in a user navigating to another web page, no matter where the click was positioned within the window. In yet another embodiment, the result of the interaction may cause the target Web site to open in a conventional two-dimensional web browser which forms another \u201cview\u201d within the virtual space browser. i.e. The content within the virtual space itself does not change as a result of the interaction, but the user switches to an alternate two-dimensional view of the web page.

Virtual buildings  are depicted in virtual three-dimensional form and are delineated by virtual streets .","Thus, unlike prior approaches, in the approach herein the virtual environment displays information content in the virtual display windows of virtual buildings. In contrast, in prior approaches a virtual environment has provided merely decorative textures that serve as a background for a game or other use of the virtual environment. In the present approach the information of the windows has inherent utility.","In step , a test is performed to determine if the user has navigated to a pay-per-view window. Step  is performed optionally in an embodiment that provides for regions of a virtual city that are protected by virtual gates and can be navigated only if the user satisfies particular criteria. Such criteria may include, for example, payment of a fee, the user having particular attributes such as a particular age, gender, security credential, etc. If the user selects a gate that provides entrance to a gated area, browser  generates and displays a pop-up window that prompts the user to enter a UserId and Password. If the user does not have a password, then the user is required to register and obtain a password, and the registration may involve making a payment. If the UserId and Password are found in the system database, then the user is permitted to navigate into the gated area.","In one embodiment, a three-dimensional virtual space browser maintains an internal log of all actions performed by a particular user at a client computer. In this embodiment, at step  the client sends accumulated statistical information to the Front End Server associated with the city server. Step  may be performed periodically by pushing such information, or a copy of the browser log, to a city server . Alternatively, the browser  may implement an API that can be called by the city server  to request the log or statistical information on demand.","Such statistical information or activity log information may be used to support a market for transfers or transactions in virtual property consisting of the virtual display windows described herein. For example, statistical or activity log information indicates which virtual display windows are visited by a particular user. When such information is aggregated for all users, it indicates the amount of navigation traffic that is received for each virtual display window. A city server may use such traffic information to determine prices for tenant leases of the right to display content in a particular region, block, building or window. For example, a high volume of traffic at a particular virtual display window means that visitors to that display window are also likely to navigate to adjacent virtual display windows that are within the user's field of view. As a result, a high volume of traffic at a particular virtual display window means that adjacent windows also are more valuable.","Separately from the statistical log, the browser may keep a history of the locations visited and the virtual spaces visited by the user, so that the user may retrace some of the movements made in the browser. This retracing may optionally be executed in the form of a tour. The browser may also have one or more predefined tours for each virtual space which may be specified in the data definition, thereby allowing the user to quickly become familiar with the virtual space which they are viewing. Furthermore the user may decide to mark some of the virtual spaces and locations visited in MyPlaces which is a list of the user's preferred virtual spaces and locations.","In step , the client requests an updated city based on a local time value. In one embodiment, the data definition is periodically updated by the city server in response to changes in tenancy for virtual display windows, or to reflect the addition or deletion of windows or buildings from the virtual city. In this embodiment, the data definition is received by the client at repeated intervals that occur periodically during a browsing session. For example, browser  may implement a polling timer such that the browser requests an updated version of data definition  upon expiration of the polling timer. An example duration of the polling timer is 10 minutes, but any other appropriate interval may be used.","If the browser  is navigating a user city, special processing may be applied different from the processing described above that is used for commercial cities. For example, processing a user city typically will not involve collecting complete statistics at the browser and communicating them to the city server, as described herein with respect to step  of . In processing a user city, rather than following the process of step , browser  may provide the city server only with a value indicating a number of requests for the user city data definition or XML. This value may simply be extracted from the log of connections made.","In an embodiment of user city processing, the data definition  may be hosted at any server. The data definition  may be unencrypted and not signed. Instead, browser  may verify the authenticity of the data definition  simply by recognizing a template identifier within the data definition.","In one variation of this approach, the universe server maintains a blacklist of user cities that contain offensive or otherwise unacceptable content, based on a URL of a host server that serves the data definition of the user city. In this approach, as part of step , , or , browser  determines whether a selected user city appears in a blacklist maintained by the universe server. If so, appropriate responsive action is taken, such as displaying a specified page that contains a warning message, displaying a warning message in a message field of the browser user interface, etc.","2.4 Renewals, Auctions and Transfers of Virtual Property",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0175"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["526","502"]},"In step , a content accounts database is queried to identify one or more display agreements that are due to expire in a specified future time period.

The toolbar  comprises a web button or interactive content button area , input interface area , Menu, map interface area  including a map selector  and mini map , taxi movement selector , route selector , status box , and 3B button area . A three-dimensional view  of a virtual three-dimensional space is displayed in main pane , and such a view is referred to herein as a \u201c3B view.\u201d A user may navigate in the virtual three-dimensional space by selecting keyboard keys; in response, the browser re-displays main pane  to show a different part of the virtual three-dimensional space. In one embodiment, the following key functions are defined: Up arrow\u2014move forward while held down, stop when key released; Down arrow\u2014move backwards while held down, stop when key released; Left arrow\u2014turn left while key held down, stop when key released; Right arrow\u2014turn right while key held down, stop when key released; Less than arrow\u2014shuffle left while key held down, stop when key released; Greater than arrow\u2014shuffle right while key held down, stop when key released; Space bar\u2014move up to the window in the centre of the view, so that the viewer can see the full page, with a hint of any locations to the left and right ; Z key\u2014shuffle left; X key\u2014shuffle right. In alternate embodiments, any other suitable combination of keys and functions may be used and a mouse or other alternate navigation apparatus may be used.","In one embodiment, the browser can display several different forms of views and maps of a virtual three-dimensional space, such as a virtual city, and a user may select among the various views and maps using elements of the screen display. For example, web button area  comprises one or more hyperlinks which, when selected by a user, causes the browser to display a view of a web page or other networked interactive content in main pane , as best seen in screen display  of , and such a view is referred to herein as a \u201cweb view.\u201d In another embodiment, the web button area could contain text only or an icon or symbol rather than a small image of a web page. Alternatively by clicking on web button area  the three-dimensional space browser activates an inbuilt or external conventional web browser and passes the browser the appropriate hyperlink or web address to display in another application window. The web page in the web view corresponds to either the last web page that was loaded by a conventional two-dimensional browser that operates on the same client as the three-dimensional virtual space browser, or a default web page, or a page that is linked to a display window in the virtual three-dimensional space on which the user has clicked or viewed face on. If the main pane  is already displaying the web view, as in , then selecting the web button area  causes no action. Screen display  may be generated by integrating a conventional Web browser, such as Mozilla, into a three-dimensional virtual space browser  using an appropriate change in user interface appearance or \u201cskin.\u201d Alternatively the Web browser could be external to the three-dimensional space browser. In an alternative embodiment, instead of web content, the content could be other networked interactive content, for example accessible by a mobile phone, television set top box or games console. In yet another embodiment, the web view is integrated in to the three-dimensional perspective view so that users may interact with a web page or other interactive content directly within the three-dimensional perspective view.","Further, a mini map  is provided in the screen display to assist the viewer in identifying the viewer's then-current position either within a small area (or district) of the virtual three-dimensional space, or the viewer's then-current position within the entire city. Input interface area  comprises an input box  that may receive a user-entered network location identifier for a virtual city or a search term. In one embodiment, input interface area  may also include status box . The status box displays messages, alerts or other information generated by the browser. 3B button area  displays an image and tab which, when selected by a user, cause the browser to display the 3B view in the main pane . If the main pane is already displaying the 3B view, as in , then selecting the 3B button area causes no action and the contents of the 3B button area may be different.","Referring again to , when the three-dimensional virtual space browser is displaying the web view or map view, the 3B button area  displays a small three-dimensional perspective view  of the virtual world. In one embodiment, the small view  is displayed in 3D perspective with a view down a channel of the virtual world, and not as a thumbnail of the last image displayed within the 3B view. In one approach, a default 3B view of the then-current city is defined as a bitmap image for display in the small view . For example, the default image may be the first 3D perspective view that a viewer sees down a street with a horizon, on exit of an airport associated with the virtual city. In a second approach, a proper 3D view is captured just before a user selects the web view. Alternative embodiments might purely have a text and\/or icon in the 3B button area.","Referring again to , map interface area  comprises a City scale button, and a District scale button. In an embodiment, selecting either the City scale button, or District scale button causes the mini map  to display a different scale of map. In an embodiment, clicking on the mini map  causes the browser to display a macro map in main pane , as best seen in . In an alternative embodiment the macro map may be displayed in another pane or another application window. In one embodiment, the mini map  of map interface area  comprises graphical elements identifying positions of a viewer, a path that the viewer can take through the virtual city to a selected destination, a destination of the viewer within the virtual city, and one or more gateways that may exist within the virtual city. It is also possible that it may display paths that have been previously followed by the viewer. Further, in one embodiment, the mini map  is a selectable area which, when selected, causes the browser to display the map view in main pane .","In another embodiment, a Map identifier in map interface area  is a selectable area which, when selected, causes the browser to display a map view in main pane .  shows a screen display with an example mini map at a District scale and a Macro Map  at a District scale, and  shows a screen display with an example mini map at a City scale and Macro Map  at City scale. In this context, City scale refers to a scale showing an entire virtual three-dimensional space or virtual city within the main pane , and District scale refers to a scale showing only a region, portion, or district of a virtual three-dimensional space or virtual city within the main pane  in enlarged form. If the browser is already displaying the map view, then selecting the Map identifier causes no action. In alternative embodiments, the precise sizing or positioning of the mini map could be varied and the mini map could be rotating rather than static as shown in , and with a directional indicator which is useful for a rotating map. In yet another embodiment the scale of the mini map and macro map could be less or more than the two scales (city and district) indicated in the Furthermore,  shows the mini map and macro map in the same scale. An alternative embodiment would be that the mini map is at a different scale to the macro map.","In one embodiment, a Macro Map  at City scale is displayed without street names and without indications of building heights or shadows. The map shows all gateways, but no other landmarks or advertisers. The map shows the user's position, and allows the user to mouse over buildings to see and select destinations in same way as in a District scale map view.","In one embodiment, selecting the City link in the map interface area  causes the browser to re-display the mini map  in a city scale. For example,  shows mini map displayed in city scale. Thus, selecting the City link does not change main pane  in  from web view or 3B view to the map view; in an embodiment, only when the browser is operating within the map view, selecting the City link changes the scale of the macro map in the main pane . If the browser is operating within the map view, then selecting the City link causes the browser to re-display both the mini map  and the macro map in the main pane  in the city scale. In an alternative embodiment, selecting any map related scale link could force the map view to be launched.","In another embodiment, selecting a District option using map selector  causes the browser to change a scale of the mini map  to a district scale. If the browser is then-currently display a map view, then selecting the District option using map selector  causes the browser to re-display the map view at a district scale, as best seen in . In an alternative embodiment the map interface scale links could relate to the mini map alone and the scale links to the right of the macro map could relate to the macro map alone. In another alternative embodiment, instead of having city and district scale links there could be generic increase and decrease scale links, similar to a zoom.","In the map view, where the map only displays a subsection, such as a district, of the virtual three-dimensional space, a mechanism is provided in the map to view adjacent sections or districts in the map. In one embodiment this is in the form of providing clickable arrows at the edge of a district map. Additionally keyboard shortcuts may be provided, such as pressing the \u201cup arrow\u201d key to move to the Northerly district, \u201cleft arrow\u201d key for the district to the West, \u201cright arrow\u201d key for the district to the East, and \u201cdown arrow\u201d key for the district to the South.","Referring again to , the taxi movement selector  comprises, in one embodiment, a Go link and a Stop link. Selecting the Go link causes the browser to change to 3B view and to rapidly move a virtual position of the user on a path that has been previously highlighted in the map view, representing a virtual taxi journey on the indicated path. The path is also highlighted on the virtual road in the virtual three-dimensional space. If no destination is highlighted in the map view of the main pane , then the browser displays an error message in the status bar . For example, the browser displays the message: \u201cChoose a destination on the map\u201d. Selecting the Stop button, which is allowed only within the 3B view, causes the browser to stop the virtual taxi journey at the then-current location. This enables a user to stop and view material content of virtual display windows at the then-current location. The taxi route remains highlighted in the mini map . In an embodiment, a key of a client computer keyboard may be selected to provide the same function as the Stop button, thereby providing a keyboard shortcut for the Stop function.","In various embodiments, taxi destinations are selected from the Map view. Once a destination has been selected, the user can start a taxi journey from the Map view or 3B view. A taxi journey can be stopped and resumed at any point during the journey. In one embodiment, specifying a destination is performed in the Map View, by moving a cursor over a destination building and selecting a destination display window as it is highlighted. Alternatively, a user can select the destination display window name as it is highlighted in the pop-up list. In response, a route of the journey is displayed in the Map View. Further, a destination district map can be viewed by clicking on the button to the right of the map.","The browser then displays a \u201cTake a taxi? Start\u201d button. Selecting the button starts the virtual taxi journey. The \u201cTake a taxi? Start\u201d button which appears near the selected destination, disappears after a short time interval. Alternatively, a user may select a Start label in the Taxi option on the toolbar to the right of the mini map. The display of the main pane switches to the 3B View and the taxi journey is performed. Stopping a journey may be performed using the keyboard by selecting the space bar button while in the taxi.

An input box  in input area  may receive a network location of a conventional web page and may comprise a Go button  which, when selected by a user, causes the browser to load and display the specified page  in two-dimensional conventional web page format in main pane .","Aspects of embodiments of the Map View are now described with reference to , , . As shown in , graphical lines or shadows  may be provided to separate the web button area  and 3B button area  and indicate that such areas are in the background when a Map View is displayed. In one embodiment, the Map View includes user interface elements that enable a user to search for virtual windows, districts, or locations within a virtual environment. For example, a user may wish to search for a 3B Location or City. An example of a 3B Location within a virtual city is \u201c Fourth Street\u201d or \u201cJoe Bloggs\u201d. An example of a virtual city might be \u201cTheCity\u201d. A user may also wish to search for a location category or a landmark.","In one embodiment, when the browser is displaying the 3B View or Map View, additional search fields are provided as part of the input area . For example, input area  may include a data entry dialog box labeled \u201cEnter the name of a 3B Destination,\u201d and a \u201cFind\u201d button which, when selected by a user, causes the browser to find a path from the user's then-current virtual location to the specified 3B Location.","With this embodiment, users may potentially enter a URL or a word in the \u201c3B Location\u201d field. If a URL is entered, then in response, the browser searches the city to determine whether a web page with the same or very similar URL is then-currently associated with a virtual display window. If so, then the browser highlights destination(s) within the city on the macro map. If only one virtual display window is associated with the specified URL, then the browser additionally displays a graphical path from the user's then-current virtual location to the matching virtual display window. If several virtual display windows are associated with the URL, then all the windows are highlighted, and the status bar  displays a message such as \u201cSelect your destination.\u201d If the specified URL doesn't exist in the current virtual city, then the status box displays a messages such as \u201cNo locations found\u201d. If the specified URL is not a valid URL, then the status bar  displays an error message of the type used in a conventional web browser.","If a user enters one or more keywords in the \u201c3B Location\u201d field, then in response, the browser searches for the specified keywords within all URLs that are associated with virtual display windows within the city. The search may also encompass Display Name values for the virtual display windows, Display description values for the virtual display windows, category name values, and street address values. If no matching virtual display windows are found, then the status bar  displays an error message. If one match is found, then a path is displayed in the map from the user's current virtual location to the matching location. If multiple matching locations are found, then all are highlighted in the Map View, and the status bar  displays a message such as \u201cSelect your destination\u201d. Additionally or alternatively, the status bar  may display the keywords that were searched.","As shown in , input area  may include a Landmark\/Category drop-down menu . In an embodiment, selecting drop-down menu  causes the browser to display a list of landmarks, a divider, and a list of categories. Landmarks are points of interest in a virtual city.

If a particular district  adjoins a boundary of a virtual city, then a label may be displayed to indicate the location of the boundary. Street labels may be provided, for example, in a District scale view of a macro map.","In one embodiment, virtual buildings  that are relatively tall may be depicted in screen display  using shadows; however, shadows are not required. In an embodiment, each building has a shadow of a particular color and oriented in a consistent particular direction and the length of the shadow generally indicates the height of the building. Alternatively, a stepped shadow display approach is used in which, for example, virtual buildings having 2-5 storeys are displayed with a small shadow, and virtual buildings having more than 5 storeys are displayed with a larger shadow. If the virtual city includes virtual buildings  that have perimeter shapes arranged as different polygons, then the shadow is based on the ground-floor perimeter polygon shape. In an embodiment, shadows are only indicated on Macro Map district view.","In one embodiment, a virtual position of a user or viewer is indicated on the map by a dot with a V-shape to indicate viewing direction. The viewer's position is static in the macro-maps, and in the mini map while the user is in Map View. In an embodiment, in the mini maps, the virtual position of the user is always shown at the centre, and the V moves around indicating the direction one is traveling; in this embodiment, the map does not rotate. If the V is facing up then the direction is North, for example. While the browser is displaying the 3B View, the mini map scrolls and an indicator of the position of the user moves based on the user's movement. While in the Map View, the mini map and user's position are static. In the City scale macro-map view, the virtual user position is shown in an actual position within the city rather than always at the center, because all the city is in view. Other arrangements may be provided in other embodiments such as allowing the mini map to rotate around a statically positioned V.","Screen display  further may comprise a Landmark\/Category drop-down menu  which, when selected, provides a \u201cLandmarks\u201d heading followed by a list of landmarks defined in the virtual city and a \u201cCategory\u201d heading followed by a list of categories defined in the virtual city.

In an embodiment, not all labels are displayed to prevent displaying a cluttered map. In an embodiment, such street labels are configured as a top layer of the Map View, such that displays of paths or other elements of the Map View do not cover the street labels.","In one embodiment, selecting a direction arrow  causes the browser to re-display the Macro Map View at District scale but showing an adjacent district as indicated by the direction arrow. In an embodiment the Mini map  is not updated or re-displayed in a corresponding manner because the user is always at the center of the mini map. In an embodiment, instead of selecting arrow  the keyboard may be used by selecting the up arrow and corresponding down, left and right arrows as appropriate.","In one embodiment, each virtual display window location  is displayed as a segment of a building . In operation, in one embodiment, when a user moves a cursor over a particular building , a pop-up menu  is displayed containing virtual window display names  for each of the virtual display window locations  in the associated city block. The locations  may be colored and the colors of the locations may correspond to virtual display window names  in the menu . In one embodiment, when a user moves a cursor location  through the pop-up menu , the associated window location  also turns black. If a gateway is present in the associated city block, the name of the gateway may be displayed in the menu  in a different color. A virtual window display name  or gateway in the menu  is selected by releasing a mouse button over the menu, and causes the browser to highlight the corresponding location in both the Macro Map View and the Mini map .","In an embodiment, Map View elements may be highlighted in a plurality of colors. For example, in the embodiment of , four colors are used, and a color key  is provided in Map View . In one embodiment, a route color and destination color are provided, and each color is different. Alternatively, the route color and destination color are the same. The destination color is used to highlight locations representing results of location searches. Other indicators may represent locations of subway stations, airport shuttles, etc. Colors may also indicate paid advertising locations. The Current view indicates the V shape which shows the viewers current location and viewing direction within the city.","In another embodiment, Map View  includes a Zoom menu . Functions in Zoom menu  may include a \u201c+destination district\u201d function that changes the map to the view of the destination district, and a \u201c+current district\u201d function that changes the map to the view of the current district where the viewer is located, or performs no action if the user is already in that position. In an embodiment, the \u201c+current district\u201d function performs the same action as selecting the \u201cDistrict\u201d link associated with the Mini Map . The Zoom menu  may also include a \u201c\u2212city\u201d function that changes the map to the City scale. The \u201c\u2212city\u201d function thus performs the same action as selecting the \u201cCity\u201d link associated with the Mini Map .","Referring again to , in one embodiment, a Map View at City scale comprises a virtual city map  that comprises no street names, no building shadows, but shows all gateways and no other landmarks or advertisers. The eye icon  indicates a user's then-current virtual position. In the embodiment of FIG. SA, a user may position a mouse cursor over a particular building , and in response, a pop-up menu  is displayed. In an embodiment, pop-up menu  includes display names of associated virtual display windows of the particular building associated with the menu. Virtual display window labels are omitted, but as a cursor position in the menu  changes, an associated virtual display window of the particular building is highlighted.","If a user moves from a City scale Map View to a District scale Map View while there is a path highlighted, then the browser displays the district that contains the user's then-current virtual position. Such a district is considered within a default District scale Map View.","In an embodiment, a Scale menu  is displayed in association with virtual city map . The Scale menu  may comprise links or buttons for changing a scale of the map or districts within the map. For example, links or buttons may comprise zoom-in links or buttons for displaying a destination district or current district at District scale and a zoom-out button for re-displaying the map at City scale.","As seen in , selecting a virtual display window name in pop-up menu  causes the browser to display a path  from the user's current position  to a destination . The path is also highlighted in the Mini map as indicated by path  in . If the user subsequently selects the 3B View, the path  remains highlighted in the Mini map  of that view. In an embodiment, when a user selects the destination , as by double-clicking on that window, the browser commences the stroll process described above, in which the display changes to the 3B View, and a virtual traversal from the current user position to the destination window is displayed.","Further, in one embodiment, when a path  is highlighted in the Map View, the taxi movement selector  becomes active and is highlighted, and the user can select the virtual taxi function described above. The taxi movement selector  is displayed may be displayed as grayed-out or unavailable when no destination has been selected. If the user selects the taxi function and subsequently selects the stop link of the taxi function, then the destination  is saved, and the path  may continue to be highlighted on the Mini map If the user then selects the Map View, the destination  is highlighted, and the path  is displayed. In another embodiment, the destination virtual display window  and the path  cease to be highlighted when the user arrives at the destination.","The map views described herein may be implemented as a plurality of graphical layers, in which higher layers obscure lower layers during display operations. For example, in one embodiment, the following layer priority is observed, from lowest layer to highest. A base layer provides an outline of the complete map and the building outlines. A route highlight layer is next in order, followed by street labels, user position indicators, and pop-up menus.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0238","num":"0252"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 17"],"b":["1702","1710","1702","1702"]},"A user can rapidly navigate to a subway station by using the Go menu of menu  and selecting the nearest subway station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0240","num":"0254"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1100","1102","1104","1102","1100","1106","1102","1104","1106","1104","1100","1108","1102","1104","1110","1102"]},"Computer system  may be coupled via bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. Computer system  may comprise a display processor A and display memory B coupled to bus  for the purpose of storing image information and driving display . For example, a display processor and display memory may be provided as part of a graphics card in the computer system . An input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus  for communicating information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor  and for controlling cursor movement on display . This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.","The invention is related to the use of computer system  for implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory  from another machine-readable medium, such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory  causes processor  to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing data that causes a machine to operation in a specific fashion. In an embodiment implemented using computer system , various machine-readable media are involved, for example, in providing instructions to processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.","Common forms of machine-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of machine-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system  can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus . Bus  carries the data to main memory , from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory  may optionally be stored on storage device  either before or after execution by processor .","Computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  that is connected to a local network . For example, communication interface  may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.","Network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) . ISP  in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d . Local network  and Internet  both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.","Computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link  and communication interface . In the Internet example, a server  might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet , ISP , local network  and communication interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, and\/or stored in storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to numerous specific details that may vary from implementation to implementation.
