title: Utilizing social relationship information to discover a relevant active meeting
abstract: An active meeting can be identified that occurs in a collaborative environment that is an electronic meeting system. The meeting can be associated with a meeting identifier, a ranking value, and/or a plurality of participants. Relationship information of the participants with regard to a specified entity can be determined. Relationship information can include a social network relationship, presence information, and/or collaboration metadata. A ranking value, which is a numerical or alphanumeric value, for the meeting can be programmatically established based on the relationship information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of Web conferencing and more particularly to utilizing social relationship information to discover a relevant active meeting.","In many instances, an employee of an organization can be unaware of an ongoing online meeting (e.g., Web conference), referred to herein as an active meeting. In some instances, it is a result of an ad hoc meeting and in other instances, the employee can be inadvertently omitted from receiving a meeting invite; can have forgotten the meeting; or, can be unaware of the meeting room for whatever reason.","One aspect of the disclosure can include an apparatus, a system, an interface, and a method for utilizing social relationship information to discover a relevant active meeting. A meeting within a collaborative environment can be identified. In one embodiment, the meeting can be an active meeting which can be unassociated with an electronic calendar event. The meeting can be associated with a meeting identifier, a ranking value, and one or more participants. The collaborative environment can be an electronic meeting system. The relationship information of the participants to a specified entity can be determined. The relationship information can be a social network relationship, presence information, and collaboration metadata. A ranking value for the meeting based on the relationship information can be programmatically established. The ranking value can be a numerical value and\/or an alphanumeric value.","Another aspect of the disclosure can include an apparatus, a method, an interface, and a system for utilizing social relationship information to discover a relevant active meeting. The disclosure can include a data store able to store an active list. The active list can include a meeting identifier and a ranking value associated with an active meeting. A meeting engine can be able to determine the active meeting associated with a collaborative environment. The active meeting is an online meeting not linked with a calendar event. The collaborative environment can be an electronic meeting system.","In many instances, barriers can exist which can prevent the rapid discovery of a relevant online meeting room. To discover a relevant online meeting, an employee must either enter an ID for the meeting, examine a list of current active meetings, or search for a meeting by title\/owner name. Since an employee can be unaware of appropriate details for the meeting, discovery can be quite difficult.","Further, many limitations exist when an employee is explicitly invited to join a meeting. Due to the limitations of traditional searching mechanisms, an employee often times must perform trial and error searches to find a relevant online meeting. For example, an employee can attempt different searches (e.g., by room, by owner, by moderator, etc.) to narrow down the list of online meetings to find the most appropriate meeting room. Consequently, a more effective solution for discovering relevant online meetings is needed. These problems were evaluated, analyzed, and investigated during the course of developing the solutions of the disclosure.","The present disclosure is a solution for utilizing social relationship information to discover a relevant active meeting. In the solution, a user can utilize a search functionality to automatically identify one or more appropriate active online meetings. A meeting server can be automatically searched to discovery a relevant meeting based on social relationships. Social relationship information associated with meeting participants can be determined to establish a participant ranking. The participant ranking can be utilized to generate a meeting ranking which can permit organization of relevant meetings. In one instance, an active list can be generated and conveyed to a user interface. In the instance, the active list can include, meeting title, meeting participants, meeting duration, and the like. In one embodiment, an automated search can be performed periodically to determine relevant meetings.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.
