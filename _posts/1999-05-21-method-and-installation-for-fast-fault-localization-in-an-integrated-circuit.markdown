These are mainly manufacturing or design faults. Thus, a large proportion (approximately 15%) of the circuits obtained from the initial series of manufacturing by foundry (successive depositing operations using masks) is not functional, and has faults. This proportion increases with the complexity and high degree of integration of the integrated circuits, which are known as LSI or VLSI, and with the miniaturisation of the circuits. The development of the industrial production of an integrated circuit therefore makes it necessary to produce beforehand some prototype batches, which are tested in order to verify their actual electrical characteristics. Certain faults can be revealed by these tests, or subsequently during use of the integrated circuits, throughout their service life.","This applies both to mass-produced commercial integrated circuits and to specific integrated circuits (ASIC).","When an integrated circuit tested is found to be defective, it is then important, in a second step, to be able locate very accurately within the chip of the integrated circuit the fault which has given rise to the functional defectiveness. In fact, this location makes it possible to determine the actual cause of the defectiveness, and thus to take the appropriate corrective measures.","Thus, it must be possible to carry out the location of the faults in the integrated circuits from the stages of design (debugging), manufacturing (for validation), quality control (for production), up to that of analysis of the faults in the finished integrated circuits by the final user.","It must be possible to carry out as quickly as possible the operations which are necessary for location of the faults. In fact, it is known that the periods of time for design and manufacture of the printed circuits represent one of the most important strategic factors in the development of high-technology industries, both for the manufacturers of integrated circuits and for their clients, such as the space industry.","Thus, taking into account the competition which exists in this field, the success of a space project, such as launching a satellite, is closely associated with the performance, cost, reliability and quality of the components used, including the integrated logic circuits, which determine the technical and economic advantage and feasibility of the project.","Printed circuits with a high level of integration (LSI or VLSI) can be produced according to different technologies, i.e. MOS circuits (including the CMOS circuits which are used in space systems, taking into account their very low electrical consumption); bipolar circuits; BICMOS circuits; etc).","These circuits are increasingly complex, and have ever increasing density of integration (which doubles virtually every 18 months, according to the law established by Gordon Moore). The integrated circuits can now thus incorporate several hundred terminals, and several million logic gates consisting of transistors. Consequently, location of faults is increasingly difficult and lengthy.","Many techniques have been developed for the location of faults.","During manufacture, there is access to design data bases (CAD), and to simulation systems. Different methods for location have been proposed, based on a comparison with a fault dictionary or simulation data.","However, since these data are not available under all circumstances, methods have been proposed which are based on the comparison of images, in relation to a fault-free reference circuit, which is designated throughout the text as the \u201cstandard circuit\u201d. In order to acquire these images, several technologies have been envisaged.","Optical microscopy has resolution which cannot be better than 1\u03bc, and is no longer compatible with the surface area, the number of levels of interconnections, and the power distribution planes of the chips in modern circuits. In addition, the faults are located by visual inspection.","Many techniques use imagery by means of electron-microscopy scanning. The methods use liquid crystals, which make it possible to display the hot spots and the holes in the oxides. The emissive faults (grid oxide break-through, damaged pn junctions; saturated MOS transistors, etc) can be located by light-emission microscopy. Other methods make it possible to compare the potentials at different points of the circuit, i.e. micro-point test, opto-electronic devices, laser potential induced measurement, scanning-sensor microscopy, fluorescent microthermographic imagery, etc.","These methods are mostly cumbersome and lengthy to implement. Several of them are still reserved for laboratory use, and are not yet available on an industrial scale.","It has also already been proposed in 1984 (\u201cDynamic fault imaging of VLSI random logic devices\u201d T. C. MAY et al, IEEE, International Reliability Physics Symposium, pp 95\u2013108, 1984), to locate faults of the short-circuit type by means of microscopic images by contrast of potential.","The first method proposed, known as dynamic fault imaging (DFI) consisted of comparing the images of the defective circuit and of the reference circuit in a stroboscopic manner. The search strategy, known as backtracing, consisted of searching for the defective gate by going back in time over the sequence of test vectors, starting from the functional appearance of the fault at an output terminal of the circuit. This method is limited by the time of acquisition of each image, of approximately 20 minutes.","It has been proposed to acquire these images in real time, in order to reduce this duration of acquisition to a few seconds (\u201cE-beam static fault imaging with a CAD interface and its application to marginal fault diagnosis\u201d, N. KUJI et al, IEICE Transactions on Electronics v E77-C, mo. 4, pp 552\u2013559, 1994). The problem with this method, which is known as static fault imaging (SFI) is that it makes it necessary to have available the drawing of the design data base masks (layout), which is not always possible. In addition, the circuits must be depassivated, in order to eliminate the problem of the effect of discharge, which makes the contrast disappear.","Optimisations of these methods, DFI or SFI, have been proposed, i.e. the method which is known as TSFI: \u201cEfficient dynamic fault imaging by fully utilising CAD data in CAD-linked electron beam test systems\u201d, K. NAKAMAE et al., IEICE Transactions on Electronics, v E77-C, no. 4, pp 546, 551, 1994; and the method which is known as CGFI: \u201cLSI fast fault localisation by continuously gated fault imaging method\u201d, T. T. NAKAMURA et al, NEC Research & Development, v 35, no. 3, pp 269\u2013277, 1994.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,703,492 also describes a method in which it is attempted to eliminate the problem of the large number of images to be produced, and to record without storing the images, but by displaying in real time, alternately or simultaneously, an image of an area of the entire surface of the chip of the defective circuit and of the non-defective standard circuit, such that these images are superimposed and compared in real time, by visual examination by a human operator, without being stored.","The publications \u201cFailure analysis by dynamic voltage contrast development of a semi-automatic system\u201d, N. GERAUD-LINIA et al, ISTFA 1987, Los Angeles, pp 67\u201373; \u201cStudy of integrated circuits by contrast of potential: analysis of the charge phenomena induced in the passivation layer\u201d, doctoral thesis at PAUL SABATIER UNIVERSITY, by Philippe PERDU, no. 1740, pp 37\u201350, 1994, describe a semi-automatic method which consists of observing the defective circuit and a standard circuit in a static manner and in a dynamic manner, from a sequence of test vectors selected such that the defective circuit exhibits a fault at the output, after the final test vector has been applied. In practice, this sequence corresponds to that which made it possible to detect the fault during a prior test step.","As stated in this last document, location of the fault in the case of sequential logic circuits poses a problem, and is very lengthy and difficult. The same applies to all the circuits which do not use combinational logic alone. In fact, it is necessary to record sets of images for each vector in the sequence of test vectors applied to the input terminals of the circuit, both for the defective circuit and for the standard circuit. A comparison must then be made by superimposition of the images which have not been produced using the same circuit, or under the same experimental conditions.","As stated in this last document, processing of the images always requires human intervention, in order, according to the quality and nature of each image, to select the processing which will be applied to the image, and to carry out the locating by visual inspection of the images superimposed.","A semi-automatic method of execution known as image fault analysis (IFA) has also been developed, for application of the CGFI method to systems for testing by means of electron beams, known as IDS, which are marketed by the company SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGIES (FRANCE). The IFA method can be \u201cautomatic\u201d (all of the images of the vectors are acquired), or it can be combined with searching which is recurrent (backtracing), or is by dichotomy.","All these methods pose two main problems, which limit the performance and the practical applications, i.e. they are too lengthy, and\/or they are impossible to put into practice, taking into account faults of alignment of the circuits.","Thus, when using these methods, it is necessary to process, then superimpose, for many vectors, all the images of the defective circuit and of the standard circuit, which is an extremely lengthy process. For example, with a 100 mmchip in 1\u03bc technology, and a number of grid compartments of 100 and 1000 vectors, the IFA method requires 1,000,000 images in automatic, 600 images with a recurrent search, and 100 images with a search by simple dichotomy.","In addition, when the occurrence of the fault is detected by examining the electrical functionality of the output terminals according to the input signals (recurrent search), it is necessary to examine and compare respectively the images of the preceding vectors in the sequence, in order to reach the images in which the defective logic gate of the circuit, which gave rise to the functional fault at the output, is displayed. In addition to the fact that this retrospective examination is lengthy, it is never certain that the images examined are those which make it possible to display the defective logic gate which gave rise to the functional fault.","Thus, the information which is obtained in these prior methods must almost always be combined with information obtained from software simulation methods, with the aim of recreating the fault by means of successive hypotheses and\/or using the design drawings of the layout circuit.","Consequently, location of a fault in these conditions requires in practice a very lengthy period of time, which, for each circuit, is one or more days, and can be as much as several weeks for the most complex integrated circuits.","In addition, at least some of these prior methods, in particular those which consist of acquiring and comparing the images directly in real time without any processing (U.S. Pat. No. 5,703,492), are impossible to implement in practice. In fact, the comparison of images of two different circuits presupposes that it is possible to align perfectly the two circuits compared, and thus disregards the real conditions of observation of the two circuits, which cannot be identical in practice. A simple difference of thickness of glue between the two chips, or differences of deformation of the two circuits during acquisition of the images, is sufficient to prevent any relevant comparison of the images.","Furthermore, the prior methods do not permit the location of slight faults which do not take the form of a fault of electrical functionality at the output terminals. A significant proportion of the deferred defects of the circuits, when they are being used, is derived from slight faults of this type.","An integrated circuit comprises a chip, input terminals and output terminals, which are connected to one another by electrically conductive tracks and logic gates formed within the chip of the integrated circuit, which is generally in the form of a wafer defining a main plane of the chip, the tracks extending in the thickness of the chip or on the surface, globally parallel to the main plane, the input and output terminals being connected to the tracks at the periphery of the chip, and at least two electrical energy supply terminals with direct voltage (VDD-VSS), at least one supply terminal of which is connected to a high potential VDD, and at least one supply terminal of which is connected to a low potential VSS.","Throughout the text, \u201cfault of the short-circuit type\u201d designates any fault in the chip which creates, or can subsequently create, excess consumption of electric supply current of the circuit. This can consist of sticking or pseudo sticking of a logic gate, a leakage of current in a logic gate, bridging between tracks, etc. According to the manufacturers of integrated circuits, it is known that more than 80% of the faults in integrated circuits are faults of the short-circuit type in the chip. This expression does not incorporate the faults outside the chip itself, or those which affect only the currents of the input and\/or output terminals of the circuit.","The \u201cequipotential input line\u201d of a logic gate designates the entire network of conductive tracks which have the same electrical potential, and extend between this logic gate, and one or a plurality of input terminals; or between this logic gate, and, if it exists, at least one other logic gate, from which it receives the signal(s) obtained from the\/one of the input terminal(s). Similarly, the \u201cequipotential output line\u201d of a logic gate designates the entire network of conductive tracks which have the same electrical potential, and extend between this logic gate, and one or a plurality of output terminals; or between this logic gate, and, if it exists, at least one other logic gate, to which it supplies a signal destined for the\/one of the output terminal(s).","The invention is thus aimed at eliminating the aforementioned disadvantages, and at proposing a method which makes it possible to locate a fault of the short-circuit type in a defective logic gate of a defective integrated circuit, which is much faster than in the past, and which in particular can be carried out within a period of far less than a day, including in the case of complex integrated circuits, this duration being in general less than 1 h.","The object of the invention is also to permit location of a fault by comparison of images of at least one circuit, i.e. of the defective circuit and\/or of a standard circuit.","The object of the invention is in particular to limit considerably the number of comparisons of images to be produced, in order to isolate the defective logic gate.","The object of the invention is also to automate as far as possible this comparison of images, and the method for location, by reducing human intervention to a minimum. The object of the invention is in particular to permit analysis of images for location of the defective logic gate, which can be executed systematically by means of a computer system.","The object of the invention is also to make it possible to form an image which represents only the defective logic gate, and\/or the equipotential input line, and\/or the equipotential output line of the defective logic gate.","The object of the invention is also to permit fast location of a defective logic gate by imagery itself, in the case of the sequential circuits, by permitting fast production of at least one image which represents the defective logic gate in the defective state.","The object of the invention is to permit location of a fault, including when the defective circuit has the same electronic functionalities as a standard circuit, i.e. when the fault cannot be detected on the output terminals of the defective circuit.","The object of the invention is in particular to permit location of defective logic gates which do not detract from the electronic functionality of the circuit, the signals received at the output terminals being considered as correct.","The object of the invention is also to permit location of a fault of a defective integrated circuit, which has previously undergone a test step, which has led to disclosure of the defectiveness of the circuit.","The object of the invention is also to propose an installation for implementation of the method according to the invention.","The invention also relates to a method for location of a fault of the short-circuit type in a logic gate, known as the defective logic gate, of an integrated circuit, known as the defective integrated circuit, wherein:\n\n","In the invention, the sequence of vectors used is a specific sequence, which is more complex than in the prior art. In fact, this sequence, which is formed from signal vectors with the format known as NRZ (without return to the initial state during application of a command), comprises a larger number of vectors than the sequences of test vectors which are conventionally in the format RTZ or RTO (return to zero). Despite this, the inventors have determined that, far from slowing down location of the fault, this more complex sequence, which requires prior processing, on the contrary makes it possible to improve the performance in terms of speed and reliability. In fact, this sequence can then be applied in step by step mode, and makes it possible to identify with certainty the first modification of logic state of the circuit (i.e. the first vector), by exciting the defective gate, simply by measurement of the current IDDQ, and then to produce the vector images which correspond exactly to this excitation of the defective gate, without any possible error, including in the case of a sequential logic circuit and a slight non-functional fault.","It should be noted that, within the context of the simple defectiveness tests carried out prior to any fault analysis or location, a known test method consists of measurement of the electrical consumption current at rest IDDQ of the integrated circuit, whereas test vectors are applied to the input terminals of the circuit, according to a sequence which is carried out continuously. If the value measured exceeds a pre-determined threshold value, the circuit is considered to be defective. Otherwise, it is considered as nominal. The sequence of test vectors is determined such as to be as fast as possible (minimum number of vectors), whilst providing test cover for the optimal current IDDQ (with examination of all the cases of electronic functions). With these test methods, it is not possible to record current measurements IDDQ for each test vector, and no imagery is produced. In addition, each test vector is in the format of the tracks of the input terminals (RTZ, RTO, etc), and the values of the input signals can vary during the same test vector. Consequently, the solutions designed for test methods of this type could not be applied a priori to fault location. This is therefore all the more true in the case of fault location by imagery with contrast of potential, in which electrical potentials are detected rather than electric currents.","On the other hand, in the invention, the sequence of location vectors is designed to be executed step by step, and in order to permit measurement of the consumption current IDDQ, without changing the electrical state of the circuit during this measurement. As a result, the function of the value of the current IDDQ is not to detect the existence of a fault, but, with the sequence of location vectors, to reproduce the first and each electrical change which produces the fault, and to record each corresponding abnormal location vector. It is then possible to acquire and record the images which correspond to an abnormal location vector of this type, which speeds up considerably the location of the defective gate.","Advantageously and according to the invention, the following steps are executed chronologically:\n\n","Advantageously and according to the invention, each location vector is formed by binary signals with the format NRZ, which maintain the same logic state (0 or 1), until a subsequent location vector is applied to the input terminals, or, if the final location vector is involved, until completion of the measurement(s) and production of image(s) carried out for this location vector. Advantageously and according to the invention, the sequence of location vectors is created from a sequence of vectors, known as test vectors, which is previously formed and recorded, and is designed to make it possible to determine the existence only of a defective gate in the defective circuit, by measurement of the value of the electrical consumption current at rest IDDQ of the defective circuit, and each test vector for which the binary signal of at least one input terminal is liable to change its logic state, is broken down into a plurality of location vectors, the logic state of the binary signals of which does not change. In other words, there is conversion of the sequence of test vectors which has made it possible to detect the existence of a fault, into a sequence of location vectors with the format NRZ.","Advantageously and according to the invention, the sequence of location vectors is created such that two consecutive location vectors are distinguished from one another by the value of a single binary signal applied to a single input terminal. This last variant has in particular the advantage of speeding up further the selection of the equipotential line(s) corresponding to the defective gate.","Advantageously and according to the invention, before the value of the consumption current at rest IDDQ is measured, the value of the currents which are circulating in the input and output terminals of the circuit are measured, in order to ensure that the fault is actually located on the chip.","Advantageously and according to the invention, in order to measure the value of the electrical consumption current at rest IDDQ of the defective circuit, at least one supply terminal, and in particular the said supply terminal which is connected to a low potential VSS, of the defective circuit, is applied to the input of an amplifier circuit which is fitted as a current\/voltage converter. Advantageously, the said supply terminal connected to a low potential VSS is used, and the amplifier circuit fitted is a current\/voltage converter, and is designed to create a virtual memory, which is adjustable according to the constraints imposed by the supply of the integrated circuit on which the value of the current IDDQ is measured.","In addition, advantageously and according to the invention, it is determined whether the value measured IDDQ(j) is normal or abnormal, by comparing it with a known nominal electrical consumption current at rest IDDQnom of the defective circuit. This variant is possible when the nominal value of its consumption current at rest IDDQ is already known.","In another variant, advantageously and according to the invention, it is determined whether the value measured IDDQ(j) is normal or abnormal, by calculating the standardised difference:\n\n()\u2212()]\/maximum[(),\n\nin which:\n\n","Advantageously and according to the invention, after a first comparison has been made, in which at least one defective area of the surface of the chip has been selected, at least one further comparison is made, only from vector images which correspond to the said defective area. Advantageously and according to the invention, for an abnormal location vector, a comparison is made of two sets of images of the defective circuit and\/or of a standard circuit, at least one of the two sets of images being a set of vector images which is obtained with the said abnormal location vector, such as to select a defective area in which the defective logic gate can be located, and a further comparison is subsequently made only with the sets of vector images which represent the said defective area.","Advantageously and according to the invention, during a first comparison of the step of location of the fault, the abnormal vector image used is at least one vector image of a set of vector images, obtained with the first abnormal location vector appearing first in the sequence of location vectors. In fact, it is then known that all the preceding location vectors are normal, which facilitates further the search strategy.","In the case in particular of a defective gate which produces an electrical function fault at one output terminal at least of the circuit, the following procedure can be adopted.","Advantageously and according to the invention, the electrical functionality of the defective circuit is tested, and, if the defective circuit is found to be non-functional as far as one output terminal at least is concerned, as the reference image, use is made of a vector image, known as the fault reference image, obtained with the defective circuit for a location vector, known as the normal location vector, for which the value measured of the consumption current at rest IDDQ of the defective circuit, is normal. Advantageously and according to the invention, the fault reference image used is a vector image which is obtained with the defective circuit, in the same sequence of location vectors, with a location vector which precedes the abnormal location vector. These location vectors used are recorded in the list of vectors selected in the sequence in order to permit the location.","Advantageously and according to the invention, for a comparison, the abnormal vector image used is a vector image, known as the fault abnormal vector image, of the defective circuit, and, in order to compare the fault abnormal vector image and the fault reference image, an image is formed, known as the simple fault input image, representing the equipotential lines of the defective circuit which have the same form and the same location, and states of potential which differ between the fault abnormal vector image and the fault reference image, such as to be representative of the equipotential input line of the defective logic gate.","Advantageously and according to the invention, a plurality of simple fault input images is formed from a single fault abnormal vector image, which is compared with a plurality of fault reference images, and an image is formed, known as the intersection fault input image, representing the equipotential lines which are common (same form, location and state of potential) amongst the different simple fault input images. It should be noted that only the defective circuit is used to locate the input equipotential.","In addition, the invention makes it possible to locate the output equipotential. Thus, advantageously and according to the invention, during the step of location of the defective gate, at least one comparison is made between two images of a standard circuit formed from an abnormal vector image, known as the standard abnormal vector image, obtained by applying an abnormal location vector to this standard circuit, and from a reference image, known as the standard reference image, obtained by applying a normal location vector to the standard circuit. Advantageously and according to the invention, on the basis of the standard abnormal vector image and the standard reference image, an image is formed, known as the simple standard input\/output image, representing the equipotential lines of the standard circuit which have the same form and the same location, and states of potential which differ between the standard abnormal vector image and the standard reference image, such as to be representative of the equipotential input line and the equipotential output line of the defective logic gate of the defective circuit. Advantageously and according to the invention, a plurality of simple standard input\/output images is formed from a single standard abnormal vector image, which is compared with a plurality of standard reference images, and an image is formed, known as the intersection standard input\/output image, representing the equipotential lines which are common amongst the different simple standard input\/output images. Advantageously and according to the invention, during a further comparison, an image is formed, known as the output image, representing the equipotential lines which appear on a simple fault input image or on an intersection fault input image, or on a simple standard input\/output image, or on an intersection standard input\/output image, with the exclusion of the equipotential lines which are common amongst these images, this output image representing the equipotential output line of the defective logic gate, and its propagation in the defective circuit. In order to locate the defective logic gate, advantageously and according to the invention, there is division of an intersection or simple fault input image and an output image representing the same portion of surface of the chip, in adjacent rectangular windows which have the same pre-determined fixed dimensions, which are smaller than those of these images, for each window it is examined whether each of the two images does or does not have at least one equipotential line, and the window(s) having at least one equipotential line in each of these two images is\/are selected and recorded.","In the case of a defective logic gate which does not produce a functional fault at an output terminal, the following procedure can be adopted.","Advantageously and according to the invention, the electrical functionality of the defective circuit is tested, and, if the defective circuit is found to be functional for all the output terminals, a comparison is made between at least one first abnormal vector image obtained with a first abnormal location vector, and at least one second abnormal vector image obtained with the same circuit, and with a second abnormal location vector which is distinct from the first abnormal location vector, the first and second abnormal location vectors belonging to the same sequence of location vectors. Advantageously and according to the invention, an image is formed, known as the fault output image, representing the equipotential line(s) which is\/are common to the different abnormal vector images, comprising the equipotential output line of the defective logic gate. Advantageously and according to the invention, in a further comparison, an image is formed, known as the intermediate output image, representing the equipotential lines which appear in common on the fault output image and on at least one normal vector image obtained with a normal location vector, with the exclusion of the equipotential lines which are common to this fault output image and this normal vector image, the said intermediate output image comprising the equipotential output line of the defective logic gate. Advantageously and according to the invention, in a further comparison, an image is formed, known as the output image, which represents the equipotential lines common to the fault output image and to the intermediate output image, the said output image representing the equipotential output line of the defective logic gate.","In addition, advantageously and according to the invention, the test images are produced by electronic scanning microscopy with contrast of potential, by detection of the secondary electrons. Any other method which provides contrasted images which are representative of the levels of potential can be used as a variant. Advantageously and according to the invention, the vector images are recorded in monochrome pixelised form, and each comparison is made between images in pixelised form, numerically, pixel by pixel.","In addition, advantageously and according to the invention, before using an image in an image comparison step, this image is previously integrated onto a plurality of identical exposures which correspond to this image, and median filtering is carried out by allocating to each pixel the median value of the series of pixels comprising this pixel and the pixels which surround it, such as to eliminate the peaks caused by the noise.","In addition, advantageously and according to the invention, in order to form an image representing the equipotential lines which have the same form and the same location, and states of potential which differ between two initial images, a difference in the two initial images is produced pixel by pixel, according to the formula:\n\n=()\/2(2)\n\nin which PA is the value of the contrast level of the pixel of the first input image; PB is the value of the contrast level of the pixel of the second input image; E is the maximum value of the contrast level of the images; PC is the value of the contrast level of the pixel of the image formed; and INT is the whole part function. Conventionally, E is 255, the images comprising 256 contrast levels from 0 to 255.\n","In addition, advantageously and according to the invention, in order to form an image representing the common equipotential lines which are common (same form, location and state of potential) to two initial images, there are carried out:\n\n","Similarly, advantageously and according to the invention, in order to form an image which represents the equipotential lines of one or the other of two initial images, with the exclusion of the equipotential lines which are common to these two initial images, there are carried out:\n\n","More generally, advantageously and according to the invention, when it is wished to compare two images, one of which is representative of the defective circuit, whereas the other is representative of a standard circuit, prior processing is carried out of images comprising an adaptive thresholding step, pixel by pixel, at three contrast levels, i.e. white, black and grey.","The invention extends to an installation for implementing a method according to the invention.","The invention thus relates to an installation for location of a fault of the short-circuit type, in a logic gate, known as the defective logic gate, of an integrated circuit, known as the defective integrated circuit, comprising a chip for the input terminals and output terminals, which are connected to one another by electrically conductive tracks and logic gates formed within the chip of the integrated circuit, which is generally in the form of a wafer defining a main plane of the chip, the tracks extending in the thickness of the chip or on the surface, globally parallel to the main plane, the input and output terminals being connected to the tracks at the periphery of the chip, and at least two electrical energy supply terminals with direct voltage (VDD-VSS), at least one supply terminal of which is connected to a high potential VDD, and at least one supply terminal of which is connected to a low potential VSS, the said installation comprising:\n\n","Advantageously and according to the invention, the means for measurement of the value of the electrical consumption current at rest IDDQ of the circuit comprise an amplifier circuit which is fitted as a current\/voltage converter. Advantageously and according to the invention, the amplifier circuit fitted as a current\/voltage converter is designed to create a virtual memory, which is adjustable according to the constraints imposed by the supply of the circuit.","The invention thus makes it possible to reduce considerably the time necessary for location of a defective gate, by working only on the images which are useful, and in conditions which make it possible to facilitate the operations of comparison. It makes it possible to locate a defective gate which does not produce any functional fault, and to work on integrated circuits which are depassivated, or have not yet been passivated.","In fact, the invention makes it possible to locate the defective gate when there is available:\n\n","The invention makes it possible not only to locate the defective gate, but, owing to the certainty of this location, also to identify it by means of the production mask drawings (layout), if these drawings are available. It is then possible to characterise the fault physically, and to understand its origin with great reliability and very high accuracy. The method according to the invention can be automated, and executed mostly by computer, thus reducing human intervention to whatever is strictly necessary.","The invention also relates to a method and an installation, which are characterised in combination by all or some of the characteristics described previously or hereinafter.","The installation represented in  comprises an imagery system  which uses electronic microscopy with contrast of potential, by detection of secondary electrons. A system of this type is in itself known, and is for example an IDS 5000 HX system, marketed by the company SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGIES (FRANCE), provided with an IFA (Image Fault Analysis) board, in order to implement the technique known as CGFI, and with the API (Application Programming Interface) interface programming system IDSCMD, the assembly making it possible to control the microscope and to programme the acquisition of the images required of the surface of an integrated circuit with contrast of potential. The general characteristics of this system are well known, knowledge of them is implicit, and only the characteristics which concern the invention are described.","The images which are supplied by this imagery system  are monochrome pixelised images with contrast of potential, with a scale E of contrast levels, in general 256 contrast levels numbered from 0 to 255. The imagery system  comprises an integrated circuit support , which is provided with means for regulation of its transverse position X\u2013Y relative to an electron beam  emitted by means for emission, in order to irradiate the surface of the integrated circuit, the images of which are to be produced.","The secondary electrons re-emitted are captured by a detector , which supplies the signal to a computer processing and calculation unit , which is provided with mass storage  which can permit recording of the images, and the various conventional peripherals of a computer work station (keyboard, mouse, etc), including a display screen .","The support  is designed to make it possible to place the integrated circuit in a chamber under vacuum, in which the electron beam  is emitted, whereas the input and output pins of the integrated circuit are connected electrically on the exterior of the chamber by a bundle of cables , to an integrated circuit test control system .","The test control system  is also in itself known, and is for example an HP 82000 system equipped with HP 82000 software, and with the TABULAR LINK extension marketed by the company HEWLETT PACKARD (FRANCE). The general characteristics of this system are well known, knowledge of them is implicit, and only the characteristics which concern the invention are described. This system comprises a computer processing and calculation station  and an electrical control unit, known as the LSI tester , which forms and controls the various signals to be applied to an integrated circuit to be analysed. The station  and the LSI tester  are connected to one another in a known manner by a GPIB control bus .","The station  comprises a microprocessor motherboard , an associated read\/write memory and mass storage, and the various associated conventional peripherals (keyboard, mouse etc), including a display screen .","The station  of the test control system  is also connected to the unit  of the imagery system , by a computer network of the ETHERNET type, formed by a network board  which is associated with the unit, a network board  of the station , and a network cable , which connects the network boards , .","The LSI tester  comprises a connection board , from which there extend the various control and supply tracks of the integrated circuit, and which is connected by the bundle of cables  to the integrated circuit, which is placed in the imagery system .","In addition, the LSI tester  is connected to the IFA board  of the imagery system  by a cable , which connects a track IDSSYNC of the output board , a cable  transmitting a triggering signal TRIGGER OUT of the control system , and a cable  transmitting a clock signal EXTCLOCK of the control system , to the imagery system .","The LSI tester  also receives a board  for measurement of the electrical consumption current at rest IDDQ of the integrated circuit placed on the support . In the , this board  is shown on the exterior of the LSI tester , but it should be understood that this board  can be integrated in this LSI tester .","The output board  of the LSI tester  also comprises terminals VDD, VDD, VDD, VDD for supply to the integrated circuit at a high potential VDD, and at least one terminal VSS for supply to the integrated circuit at a low potential VSS. Contrary to the normal connection, the supply terminal VSS of the connection board  is not connected directly to the ground  of the LSI tester , but is connected to the positive input of an operational amplifier  of the board  for measurement of the current IDDQ. The ground of the LSI tester , which is earthed, is connected to the other negative input of the operational amplifier . The operational amplifier  is for example an AD795, and is selected in order to accept a very low input current.","The measurement board IDDQ  comprises a circuit which is designed to create a virtual memory for the integrated circuit at the terminal VSS, the value of which can be adjusted according to the constraints imposed for the supply to the integrated circuit. This circuit is also designed to form a current\/voltage converter, such that the signal supplied by the board  to the LSI tester  is a voltage signal which is compatible with this LSI tester .","In fact, an LSI tester  of this type is normally designed to receive voltage signals, and is not designed to measure currents. Between its negative terminal and its output, the operational amplifier  comprises a parallel resistor R and a parallel capacitor C. The resistor R makes it possible to adjust the current sensitivity of the measurement board , which is for example 0.1 \u03bcA for R=10 k\u03a9, and 10 nA for R=100 k\u03a9. The voltage sensitivity is 1 mV. The output of the operational amplifier  is connected to the positive input of a second operational amplifier , identical to the preceding one, which forms a second tracking stage, its negative input being connected to its output.","The output of this second operational amplifier  forms the output  of the measurement board , which is connected to one of the free tracks of the connection board  of the LSI tester , such that the measurement signal of the current IDDQ is supplied by the LSI tester  to the station , by means of the bus .","The measurement board  thus makes it possible to measure the current which is consumed by the integrated circuit, and is circulating between the supply terminal VSS of the integrated circuit and the ground  of the LSI tester .

As soon as a change of logic state (LE or TE) for at least one signal is found for this test vector, a split is created for the vector corresponding to this time. In other words, in step , the test vector is split into as many location vectors as there are changes of logic state made by this test vector, in relation to the logic state of the signals in the preceding test vector. Steps ,  and  are repeated, so as to split all the test vectors into a sequence, which is stored in step , of location vectors, for which all the signals are in the NRZ format (without variation over a period of time, for each vector, of their value, which corresponds to their logic state). This therefore provides a sequence of location vectors as represented in ","It should be noted that a sequence of location vectors of this type can also be created directly, for example by taking NRZ signals, rather than from a sequence of test vectors.","The advantage of starting with a sequence of test vectors which is transformed, is that there is certainty of reproducing the fault in the integrated circuit, the existence of which has previously been detected.","After this step  of conversion of the vectors has been carried out, in step  (), the sequence of location vectors is applied in step-by-step mode to the input terminals of the integrated circuit . For each location vector, the value of the current IDDQ of the defective integrated circuit  is measured. In this step , there is detection of the abnormal location vectors for which the value of the current IDDQ is abnormal, according to a method of comparison in relation to a pre-determined threshold value. If a nominal value IDDQnom of the current IDDQ of the defective circuit is known, this value is used as a threshold value, and it is considered that the value measured is abnormal when it exceeds this nominal value IDDQnom ().","In another variant, it is determined whether the value measured IDDQ(j) is normal or abnormal, by calculating the standardised difference\n\n()\u2212()]\/maximum[(),\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0160"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"In step , there is placed a standard integrated circuit, which is free from a defective gate and from any fault, and is identical to the defective circuit to be analysed on the support .

In step , the value of the electrical consumption current at rest IDDQ of the standard circuit is measured for the location vector j=1, then, in step , it is tested whether the value of the variable j is the final value or not.

In the subsequent step , the imagery system  is addressed, via the network , , , with the number of vectors in the location sequences, the list of abnormal location vectors, and the frequency of functioning of the integrated circuit. On the basis of these values, the imagery system  acquires the images necessary for the step of location of the defective gate.","The imagery system  and its IFA board, makes it possible to acquire images according to the method known as CGFI. Whilst a location vector is applied to the input terminals of the defective circuit or of a standard circuit placed on the support , the system  makes it possible to produce and record a set of images, known as vector images, which represent equipotential lines formed by the tracks of the logic gates of the said circuit, each equipotential line corresponding to one of the differentiated states of potential on the vector images. The different, rectangular vector images of a single set of images are designed to cover and represent the entire surface of the chip, or an entire portion of this surface, on which it is being attempted to locate the defective logic gate.","The signal IDSSYNC which is addressed by the tester LSI  to the system  makes it possible to synchronise the acquisition of the images in relation to the development of the location vectors applied by the tester LSI  to the integrated circuit.","Unlike in the prior art, the imagery system  is not programmed to acquire all the images of the surface of the chip for all the location vectors, but to acquire only particular sets of images which correspond to particular location vectors, which are pre-defined, as described hereinafter. On the basis of these particular vector images, the imagery system  is programmed to execute a step of location of the defective gate, in which it makes at least one comparison between at least one vector image, known as the abnormal vector image, which was acquired when an abnormal location vector was being applied to the integrated circuit, and another pre-recorded image, known as the reference image, which is selected such that this comparison makes it possible to select an area, known as the area of defectiveness, on the surface of the chip, on which there may be located an equipotential input line of the defective logic gate, and\/or an equipotential output line of the defective logic gate, and\/or the defective logic gate itself.","The imagery system  is programmed by means of application programming interface (API) commands IDSCMD, which constitute a programming system which makes it possible to write command scripts in order to acquire the required images on the areas of the surface of the pre-selected chip.","The APIs used for configuration of the test command system  (HP82000) and of the imagery system  (IDS 5000 HX) for the purpose of synchronous acquisition of the images (in particular with determination of the duration of application of the vector, known as HOLD, and the duration of acquisition of the images), can be as follows:\n\n","The API which permits activation of the IFA board for acquisition of an image is as follows:\n\n","The API which is used in order to control the displacement of the electron beam, and acquisition of a set of images, can be as follows:\n\n","The APIs used for handling the images can be as follows:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0200"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"In step , the imagery system  calculates the maintenance time for each location vector (HOLD) necessary in order to acquire the images corresponding to this vector.

It is calculated in particular according to the frequency of functioning of the circuit, which the imagery system  has previously received from the control system .","In step , the imagery system  calculates the total duration of acquisition of the different images (taking into account in particular the number of images to be acquired for each set of images, and the number of location vectors concerned). This duration is used in order to keep the imagery system  active during a period which is sufficiently long to acquire all the images required.","In step , the imagery system  selects the first location vector for which a set of images must be produced. In step , it then prepares acquisition of a first image vector of the set of images, by displacing the electron beam opposite the corresponding area of the surface of the chip of the circuit  placed on the support .","In step , the imagery system  sends a signal via the network , ,  to the control system , such that the latter controls the tester, and places the synchronisation signal IDSSYNC throughout the duration of the vector to be acquired.","In step , the imagery system  acquires n times the corresponding image, whereas the location vector is applied to the integrated circuit . For example, n=16 is selected, such that each image is acquired 16 times in succession.","In step , the imagery system  carries out integration of the n identical images, by allocating to each pixel the average value obtained on the n images for this pixel. Median filtering is then carried out by allocating to each pixel the median value of all the pixels formed by this pixel and the pixels which surround it, such as to eliminate peaks caused by the noise, and to supply a single monochrome, pixelised, averaged image of the portion of surface of the chip.","The integration of the images makes it possible to reduce the ergodic and stationary noise. The median filtering makes it possible to eliminate the noise peaks, without affecting the dynamics or the contrast of the images. These operations are carried out numerically, pixel by pixel.","In this step , the image thus obtained is recorded.","In the subsequent step , it is examined whether it is necessary to acquire other images in the set of images for the same location vector. If this is the case, there is a return to step , in order to displace the electron beam opposite the portion of surface of the chip which corresponds to acquisition of another image, then steps ,  and  are carried out, making it possible to acquire and store the corresponding image. All the images have the same rectangular, generally square format.","If this is not the case, in step , it is subsequently examined whether another set of images must be produced for another location vector. If this is the case, there is return to step , in which the imagery system sends a request to the control system , in order to apply another location vector. For this location vector, there is then execution of all the steps  to , making it possible to acquire the different vector images of the set of images. If this is not the case, i.e. if there is no further location vector for which the images must be acquired, the image acquisition process is interrupted, and the step of location of the defective gate is carried out, on the basis of the different images acquired and recorded.","In each comparison step, there is comparison of two images of a single portion of the surface of the chip, known as initial images, and another image is formed, known as the result image, on the basis of automatic processing carried out by the imagery system  on the two initial images.","Several types of processing can be applied to the initial images, in order to form a result image. In a first type of processing, known as difference processing, a result image is formed, representing the equipotential lines which have the same forms, and states of potential which are different, and in particular opposite, between the two initial images. For this purpose, a difference in the two initial images is produced, pixel by pixel, according to the formula:\n\n=()\/2(2)\n\n","This difference processing is applied to two initial images acquired on the same circuit, i.e. either on the defective circuit or on a standard circuit. This difference processing reveals the differences between two distinct electrical states corresponding to two distinct location vectors, divides the image noise into two, reduces the effect of the topography, and, by masking the states which are common to the two initial images (the pixels of similar contrast levels of the initial images appear grey in the image formed), decreases the quantity of information to be processed subsequently.","In a second type of processing, a result image is formed, representing the equipotential lines which are common to the two initial images. This processing, which is known as extended AND+ intersection, consists of forming the result image, by allocating the following contrast levels to each of its pixels:\n\n","In a third type of processing, the result image represents the equipotential lines of one or the other of the two initial images, with the exclusion of the equipotential lines which are common to these two initial images. This processing is known as extended exclusive OR, i.e. XOR+. In order to carry out this processing, each pixel of the result image is formed by allocating to it the following contrast level:\n\n","In addition, advantageously and according to the invention, adaptive thresholding processing is carried out at three contrast levels, i.e. white, black and grey, of the initial images. An adaptive thresholding step of this type is advantageously provided prior to a comparison by extended intersection and\/or by extended exclusive OR, such as to prevent any error of allocation of the contrast levels during these processing operations. On the other hand, the difference processing can be carried out on initial images which have not previously undergone adaptive thresholding.","The step of adaptive thresholding of an image is carried out as described hereinafter.","The image is a pixelised image (of the BITMAP type), comprising b columns of pixels and c lines of pixels. In this image, it is attempted to distinguish at the most three contrast levels, corresponding to the normal logic states of potentials, i.e. black (0), grey (INT(E\/2)) and white (E).","In the image formed by the imagery system , it is not possible to distinguish the three contrast levels, white, black and grey correctly, since their real contrast levels which may correspond to these values normally overlap. Thus, the maximum value which normally corresponds to the black may be greater than the minimum value of the real contrast level which normally corresponds to the grey, and the maximum value of the real contrast level which normally corresponds to the grey may be greater than the minimum value of the real contrast level which normally corresponds to the white.","On the initial images, rectangles are defined with a length d and a width e, starting with the lower left edge of the image, as represented in . If each of these rectangles is designated as Rik, in which i represents the number of the rectangles in lines, and k represents the number of the rectangles in columns, the first rectangle is the rectangle R, situated in the lower left-hand corner of the image. The following rectangle is the rectangle R, which can be seen to overlap the rectangle R over half its width. Similarly, the rectangle R, which is above the rectangle R, overlaps the latter over half its height. Thus, and according to the invention, the different rectangles overlap one another along half their height and half their width.","In each rectangle, it is determined whether there is one contrast level, two contrast levels, or three contrast levels, and there is allocation to each pixel of the objects identified in the rectangle, of only one of the different contrast levels, black, grey and white. For this purpose, the histogram of the contrast levels of each rectangle is used (). The histogram is the curve, which on the x-axis represents the contrast levels from 0 to E=255, and on the y-axis represents the numbers of pixels for each contrast level. This histogram has a minimum contrast level NGmin, a maximum contrast level NGmax, an average contrast level NGmoy, and a standard deviation ETNG of the contrast levels.","The number of contrast levels of the rectangle is first of all determined. Firstly, a minimum size for each object is determined, corresponding to a rectangle with fxg pixels, in which f\u2266g; f\u2267e\/10; and g\u2267d\/10. On the basis of the knowledge of the size of the tracks of the integrated circuit, these conditions make it possible to determine the appropriate values d and e.","It is also known that, in the complete image of a portion of surface of a chip of an integrated circuit, the grey which corresponds to the background of the image is in the majority. It is determined that the three contrast levels are present in a rectangle if the histogram of the rectangle has at least three distinct main peaks (maximum points), and if at least one of the following two conditions applies:\n\n","If the aforementioned two conditions do not exist, it is determined that there are two contrast levels in the rectangle, when the following different conditions exist:\n\n","The threshold values S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 are pre-determined experimentally from known images of a well-known integrated circuit of the same type.","If none of the preceding conditions exists, it is considered that there is only a single contrast level in the rectangle.","On the basis of the histogram of the rectangle Rik, an example of which is represented in  (after integration and median filtering have taken place), the different peaks are separated by vertical lines, on the basis of the minimum levels. The surface area of each of the peaks is then calculated, and is classified by order of size, and there is selection of the three largest peaks, which are used in order to delimit the three contrast levels. As can be seen in , the largest peak is the central peak P, the second largest peak is the peak P, which is situated immediately to the right of the peak P, the third largest peak is the peak P, which is situated immediately to the left of the peak P, and the peaks P and P are smaller. The lines of separation of the peaks P ad P, and P and P, are therefore frontiers between the contrast levels black N, grey G and white B, as represented in . It should be noted that all of this processing is carried out automatically by calculation, on the basis of the histogram of the rectangle Rik.","If the rectangle contains the three contrast levels, there is allocation to each pixel of the contrast level black, white or grey, corresponding to the above-described splitting of the histogram. Preferably, the contrast level black corresponds to the value 0, with the contrast level white corresponding to the value E (for example 255), and the contrast level grey corresponds to the value INT(E\/2) (for example 127). It should be noted that other values could be selected, i.e. a low value (which is or is not equivalent to 0), a high value (which is or is not equivalent to E), and a median value, such as to define three distinct balanced contrast levels.","If the rectangle Rik contains one or two contrast levels, the objects of common contrast levels of the adjacent rectangles are used to allocate the correct contrast levels to the pixels of this rectangle. In fact, the rectangles overlap, and each pixel of the median part of the image belongs to several different rectangles (up to four rectangles if the frontiers are excluded, and up to nine rectangles if the frontiers are included). If a rectangle has one or two contrast levels, the other rectangles which constitute this pixel are examined, in order to determine its contrast level.","If no rectangle in the image contains the three contrast levels, the latter are allocated as follows: if there is only one contrast level, grey is selected; if there are two contrast levels, the one which is encountered most frequently (number of pixels) is allocated to grey, and the other is black if the value of the pixels is lower, or white if the value of the pixels is higher. If necessary, human intervention can be accepted in order to allocate the contrast levels in rare complex cases, in which it is not possible to allocate these contrast levels by fully automatic step-by-step calculation.","After these contrast levels have been allocated, median filtering is carried out, to make it possible to eliminate the noise. There is then re-assembly of the different rectangles, in which each pixel has received one of the three contrast levels, in order to re-constitute the image.","On completion of this step of adaptive thresholding, the image obtained comprises only three contrast levels, i.e. black (0), grey (127) and white (255).","In addition, after each processing step of the extended intersection type AND+ or extended exclusive OR type, XOR+, or of adaptive thresholding, a step is carried out, known as the reduction step, in which there is carried out median filtering, then erosion and expansion of the black or white pixels. This processing, consisting of erosion or expansion of pixels, which makes it possible to eliminate non-significant projecting or recessed pixels, is in itself known. With processing of this type, an isolated pixel is eliminated, a pixel which projects in relation to a block with the same contrast level is eliminated, and a pixel which is recessed in a block of different contrast levels is restored to the contrast level of the block. The groups of pixels are thus re-formed into polygonal blocks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0246"},"figref":["FIGS. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["a","b","c ","a"],"b":["10","10","70","71","70","71","70","71"]},"In order to form the fault reference image, use is made of the normal location vector, which is for example any vector which precedes the first abnormal location vector in the sequence of location vectors. In fact, it is known that all the location vectors which precede the first abnormal location vector, are normal. It should be noted in this respect that in almost all cases, the defective circuit contains only a single defective logic gate.","In addition, a plurality of simple fault input images is formed, such as the image , on the basis of a single fault abnormal vector image , which is compared with a plurality of fault reference images, such as the image . In , there is thus represented a second simple fault input image \u2032, which is obtained by difference, from the simple fault input image  and another fault reference image. All the simple fault input images have in common the equipotential input line  of the defective logic gate of the circuit. In fact, it is certain that between an abnormal vector image and a normal vector image, the equipotential input line of the defective gate has changed its state of potential, and thus its contrast level. On the other hand, when the fault corresponds to a short circuit, the output of the defective logic gate is not modified.","It should be noted that the fault abnormal vector image  and fault reference image  are images obtained from electronic microscopy, which have undergone processing consisting of integration and median filtering only.

This intersection fault input image  represents the equipotential input line  of the defective logic gate, and, in general, only this equipotential line. In fact, it is sufficient to select a sufficient number of simple fault input images , \u2032, etc, in order to obtain this single equipotential line  on the image . In order to form the intersection fault input image , an extended AND+ intersection is produced between the different simple fault input images , \u2032, etc, as previously described.","In addition, in order to find the fault equipotential output line, at least one comparison is made between two images of a standard circuit, as represented in .

As the reference image, an image known as the standard reference image  is used, which is obtained by applying a normal location vector to the standard circuit. The difference between these two images is determined, in order to obtain the image , on which it is known that the input  and output  equipotential lines of the defective gate are represented. This image, known as the simple standard input\/output image , represents the equipotential lines of the standard circuit which have the same form and the same location, and states of potential which differ between the standard abnormal vector image  and the standard reference image .","As in the previous case, a plurality of simple standard input\/output images , \u2032, etc, is formed from the same standard abnormal vector image , which is compared, by difference, with a plurality of standard reference images such as the standard reference image . Then, by comparing in pairs and in cascade the different simple standard input\/output images , \u2032, another image known as the intersection standard input\/output image  is produced, representing the equipotential lines which are common amongst the different simple standard input\/output images , \u2032, i.e. the equipotential input line  and the equipotential output line  of the defective logic gate. In order to form this intersection standard input\/output image , the extended AND+ intersection is produced of the different simple standard input\/output images , \u2032, as previously stated.","As represented in , it is possible to make a further comparison, in which an image is formed, known as the output image , representing only the equipotential output line of the defective logic gate, and its propagation in the defective circuit. For this purpose, an EXTENDED EXCLUSIVE OR, XOR+, is produced from the intersection fault input images  and the intersection input\/output image .","It should be noted that, in order to form the intersection input\/output image, adaptive and reduction thresholding processing is previously carried out on the simple input\/output images , \u2032. Also, before carrying out the extended exclusive OR of the intersection fault input images  and intersection input\/output images , reduction processing of these images is carried out. As a result of the different processing operations which have been carried out previously, it is then possible, without risk of error, to compare the two images , , even though they have not been produced with the same integrated circuit. On the other hand, it should be noted that the complex images which are obtained from the imagery are compared with one another (by difference) only when they are obtained from a single circuit, i.e. either the defective circuit or a standard circuit.","The output image  is also subjected to reduction processing.","The invention thus makes it possible, simply and in a fully automated manner, to form images , , which are representative of the input line  only, and of the output line  only, of the defective logic gate. On the basis of these images , , it is possible to locate accurately the defective logic gate, in an automatic manner.","It is known that the distance between the output and the input of the defective logic gate is short, and that it is from the output of the defective logic gate that it is advantageous to run equipotential lines. In fact, the defectiveness of a logic gate is in general the result of a physical fault located on the equipotential output line.","The images ,  are split into rectangles, as previously described for the adaptive thresholding processing, with the exception of the fact that the different rectangles do not overlap one another, but are juxtaposed edge by edge.","The angles are sought in which the output image  and the intersection fault input image  both comprise at least one object, the normal contrast level of which is either white or black (presence of white or black pixels).","For this purpose, an extended exclusive OR, XOR+, is produced between the rectangle of the intersection fault input image , and an entirely grey rectangle with the same dimensions, then the image obtained of the rectangle is subjected to reduction processing. If this image is not entirely grey, i.e. if it contains black and\/or white pixels, the same processing is carried out on the basis of the same output image rectangle , by producing the extended exclusive OR, XOR+, of the rectangle of the output image, with an entirely grey rectangle with the same dimensions. The image obtained is subjected to reduction processing. If this image is not entirely grey either, a further extended exclusive OR, XOR+, is produced, from amongst the images previously obtained, in order to obtain a final image. The final image is subjected to reduction processing. This final image represents an area in which the fault corresponding to the defective logic gate is located.","If, by carrying out this processing, a plurality of dissociated areas of the image is obtained, in which the fault of the defective logic gate may be located, it is possible to repeat the process by using a smaller dimension for the rectangles. If, on the other hand, no area is found in which the fault may be located, the process is repeated with a rectangle which has larger dimensions, of length and\/or width. It is possible to begin with rectangles with the same dimensions (d and e) and those used for adaptive thresholding processing, as previously described. Finally, with this process, it is possible to obtain a single precise area, in which the defective logic gate is located.","Once again, it should be noted that all of these operations can be carried out entirely by computer programming, by numerical calculation and processing of information. The only elements of intervention by the user consist of determining the different values of statistical threshold used for the adaptive thresholding, according to the type of integrated circuit examined. These values are determined experimentally. For example, for CMOS integrated circuits with 0.7\u03bc to 1.5\u03bc technology, with two levels of metal and a polished level, and with the above-described imagery system , the following threshold values are used: S1=100, S2=1.3, S3=160, S4=47, S5=130, S6=20. In order to determine these threshold values, it is possible to use known images of integrated circuits, the levels of potential of which are known, of which the levels of minimum, maximum and average contrast and the standard deviation are calculated.","It should also be noted that this adaptive thresholding operation which can be automated then makes it possible to make comparisons of images numerically, using logic operators of the AND+ and XOR+ type (and not using operators of the arithmetic type), thus making these operations much faster and simpler.","It should also be noted that use of splitting of the images into rectangles which do or do not overlap in the different processing operations (rectangles which overlap for the adaptive thresholding, rectangles which are adjacent for the search for the defective gate) makes it possible to accelerate the speed of processing considerably, since it is not necessary to carry out a calculation for each pixel. Each rectangle can conventionally have a dimension of 10 to 100 pixels in width and in height, and thus incorporate between 100 and 10000 pixels.","In addition, according to the invention, after having made a first step of comparison, in which one or a plurality of defective areas of the surface of the chip have been selected, it is not necessary to make further comparisons on all the images of the sets of images. In fact, it is possible to make further comparisons simply on the basis of vector images which correspond to the said defective area(s) thus pre-selected. For example, the AND+ operation carried out on simple fault input images , \u2032 can be executed only on images which have given a result on completion of the differentiation of the initial images , . In fact, it should be remembered that for its representation, the surface of the chip of the circuit requires a set of several images, and conventionally  adjacent images. The first comparisons must be made on the 512 images which correspond to the location vectors selected, but the further comparisons are made only on some of the images in the set of images, which correspond to the area of defectiveness previously selected.","Advantageously, in the first comparison of the step of location of the fault, a vector image is used which is obtained with the first abnormal location vector, which appears first in the sequence of location vectors. Thus, it is highly probable that the area of defectiveness selected will have limited dimensions.","Consequently, the method according to the invention is very quickly convergent, and it has been found in practice that the defective logic gates can be located from a small number of initial images. In general, two steps of differentiation of images of the defective circuit , , and two steps of differentiation of images of the standard circuit ,  are sufficient. It is therefore necessary to a acquire and compare only two sets of images of the defective circuit, then two sets of images of the standard circuit corresponding to the areas of defectiveness selected with the defective circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0200","num":"0269"},"figref":"FIGS. 11","i":["a ","b "],"b":"11"},"In the step represented in , a comparison is made between at least two abnormal vector images , , obtained with two distinct abnormal location vectors which belong to the same sequence of location vectors. An image is formed, known as the fault output image , representing the equipotential lines which are common to the abnormal vector images , , and comprising the equipotential output line  of the defective logic gate. For this purpose, an extended AND+ intersection is produced between the images  and , in order to obtain the fault output image . Previously, the images  and  will have been subjected to adaptive thresholding and reduction processing. Also, the image  undergoes further reduction processing.","This operation can be repeated with abnormal vector images other than  and , the extended AND+ intersection of them can be produced, then the extended intersection can be produced of the different fault output images thus obtained, in order, ultimately, to obtain the most accurate fault output image  possible, according to the number of abnormal location vectors in the sequence.","In the further step represented in , use is made of the fault output image , which is compared by the extended exclusive OR function, XOR+, with a normal vector image  obtained with a normal location vector on the same circuit. The resulting image  consists of the combination of these two images , , from which there have been extracted equipotential lines which are common to these two images. There is thus elimination in particular of the equipotential input lines which are not those of the defective logic gate. This extended exclusive OR operation, XOR+, can be repeated, using a plurality of normal vector images , and then carrying out the extended AND+ intersection between the different images thus obtained. It should be noted that the normal vector images  have previously been subjected to adaptive and reduction thresholding processing.","The image  thus obtained is then compared once again with the fault output image , by an extended AND+ intersection, such as to form an image, known as the output image , which represents the equipotential output line  of the defective logic gate.","As previously, before each comparison by extended AND+ intersection, or extended exclusive OR, XOR+, is made, the images are subjected to reduction processing. Similarly, the output image  is subjected further to reduction processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0275"},"figref":["FIGS. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["a ","b ","a","a","a"],"b":["12","88","89","90","93","88"]},"As represented in , in order to locate the equipotential output line  of the defective logic gate, the extended AND+ intersection is produced of the normal vector images  and abnormal vector images .
