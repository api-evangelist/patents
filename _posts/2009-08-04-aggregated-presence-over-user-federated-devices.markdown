{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure is generally related to computer networks and, more particularly, is related to communicating statuses of networking devices and users.","To update presence information across multiple messaging platforms, such as telephony and instant messaging, often a client user individually updates his or her presence status on the individual messaging platforms. For example, the client user may set an \u201cOut of Office\u201d presence state on an email messaging platform and an offline network status on an instant messaging platform. Therefore, users that wish to provide presence updates spend a great deal of time manually configuring each messaging platform device or service separately.","One embodiment of a system for aggregating and distributing presence information comprises a hosted presence aggregator server. The hosted presence aggregator server receives an update of presence information from a user device and relays the presence information update to another user device, wherein the user devices are part of a federation of user devices controlled by a single user which relay updates in presence status of the single user to one another via the hosted presence aggregator server.","One embodiment of a method for aggregating and distributing presence information comprises receiving an update of presence information from a user device and relaying the presence information update to another user device, wherein the user devices are part of a federation of user devices controlled by a single user which relay updates in presence status of the single user to one another.","One embodiment of a computer readable medium has computer instructions for aggregating and distributing presence information, where the computer instructions when executed by one or more computers cause the one or more computers to receive an update of presence information from a user device and relay the presence information update to another user device, wherein the user devices are part of a federation of user devices controlled by a single user which relay updates in presence status of the single user to one another.","Other systems, methods, articles, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present disclosure, and be protected by the accompanying claims.","Embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods to connect non-interoperable messaging platforms to update primary presence status for platform users which may include updates across multiple messaging devices and\/or services (e.g., cellular phone voicemail, office voicemail, enterprise email, instant messaging, web based email). Embodiments of the present disclosure may provide systems and methods of interoperability to update key presence information across multiple types of messaging platforms, including telephony, email, instant messaging, etc.","Embodiments of the present disclosure, among others, provide an ability to interconnect non-contiguous messaging, internet protocol (IP), and telephony platforms to provide automated presence updates that affect a single user. This includes information on how to reach a user that is away from his or her messaging or user device (e.g. email, mobile cellular telephone, IP-based office telephone). This is interoperable with known industry standards for recording and setting presence information. This includes multiple protocol stacks across different types of devices, such as but not limited to session initiation protocol (SIP), session initiation protocol for instant messaging and presence leveraging extensions (SIMPLE), voice extensible markup language (VXML), telephony application programming interface (TAPI), JABBER\u00ae, and extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP).","Referring now to , a system diagram of one embodiment of an aggregated presence system  is shown. Via this system, a user does not have to update presence information on multiple messaging platforms P, P, P with separate presence configuration to provide information regarding his or her current presence status, where the presence status generally indicates or conveys an ability and willingness of the user to communicate. Specifically, a user may not need to individually alter a user's Office and Home voicemail box primary greeting, email platform \u201cOut Of The Office\u201d information, and instant messaging client presence information. Rather, a hosted presence aggregator  allows presence updates to be relayed to mutually non-connected entities securely using a web browser  or an aggregated presence (AP) agent  installed at an end messaging or user device A, B, C. The hosted presence aggregator  supports both voice and text presence information and audio recordings from a single location.","Using the AP agent application  on a user's messaging device, the user can federate the messaging device to a central point or site (e.g., hosted presence aggregator site). The central hosted presence aggregator site may then push down presence updates and policies to federated devices A, B, C of the user . Each of the devices in the user's federation will be updated with presence information provided to the central point or site. For example, the user may make a presence update once to the hosted presence aggregator  which will then relay the update to the user's phone A and computer B at the same or nearly the same time. In one embodiment, the AP agent application  on the user's cell phone may poll the hosted presence aggregator  for new updates and the hosted presence aggregator  may communicate the requested presence updates to the AP agent application  so that they may be made on a federated device A, B, C. Similarly, the user's phone may not feature memory and processing capabilities and may utilize processing capabilities of a server so that the AP agent  resides on the server and sets the presence updates relayed from the hosted presence aggregator . In one embodiment, the presence update may constitute an outgoing message for a voicemail box of the user that is provided to the hosted presence aggregator  and relayed to participating federated devices  capable of utilizing the update. In accordance with the presence disclosure, federated messaging devices  which communicate with the hosted presence aggregator are not intended to be limited to devices having a same provider, vendor, or carrier. Therefore, messaging devices may be federated for a user which are not normally connectable but may connect to a central point and receive presence updates so that the devices may be managed.","The hosted presence aggregator  component of one embodiment of the disclosure can be implemented in software (e.g., firmware), hardware, or a combination thereof. In one mode, the hosted presence aggregator component  is implemented in software, as an executable program, and is executed by a special or general purpose digital computer, such as a personal computer (PC; IBM-compatible, Apple-compatible, or otherwise), workstation, minicomputer, or mainframe computer. An example of a general purpose computer that can implement the hosted presence aggregator component is shown in . In , the hosted presence aggregator component is denoted by reference numeral .","Generally, in terms of hardware architecture, as shown in , the computer  includes a processor , memory , and one or more input and\/or output (I\/O) devices  (or peripherals) that are communicatively coupled via a local interface . The local interface  can be, for example but not limited to, one or more buses or other wired or wireless connections, as is known in the art. The local interface  may have additional elements, which are omitted for simplicity, such as controllers, buffers (caches), drivers, repeaters, and receivers, to enable communications. Further, the local interface may include address, control, and\/or data connections to enable appropriate communications among the aforementioned components.","The processor  is a hardware device for executing software, particularly that stored in memory . The processor  can be any custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU), an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the computer , a semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or chip set), a macroprocessor, or generally any device for executing software instructions.","The memory  can include any one or combination of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, etc.)) and nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, etc.). Moreover, the memory  may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media. Note that the memory  can have a distributed architecture, where various components are situated remote from one another, but can be accessed by the processor .","The software in memory  may include one or more separate programs, each of which comprises an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. In the example of , the software in the memory  includes the hosted presence aggregator component in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure and a suitable operating system (O\/S) . The operating system  controls the execution of other computer programs, such as the hosted presence aggregator component , and provides scheduling, input-output control, file and data management, memory management, and communication control and related services.","The hosted presence aggregator component  is a source program, executable program (object code), script, or any other entity comprising a set of instructions to be performed. When a source program, then the program needs to be translated via a compiler, assembler, interpreter, or the like, which may or may not be included within the memory , so as to operate properly in connection with the O\/S . Furthermore, the hosted presence aggregator component  can be written as (a) an object oriented programming language, which has classes of data and methods, or (b) a procedure programming language, which has routines, subroutines, and\/or functions.","The I\/O devices  may include input devices, for example but not limited to, a keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, etc. Furthermore, the I\/O devices  may also include output devices, for example but not limited to, a printer, display, etc. Finally, the I\/O devices  may further include devices that communicate both inputs and outputs, for instance but not limited to, a modulator\/demodulator (modem; for accessing another device, system, or network), a radio frequency (RF) or other transceiver, a telephonic interface, a bridge, a router, etc.","The software in the memory  may further include a basic input output system (BIOS) (omitted for simplicity). The BIOS is a set of software routines that initialize and test hardware at startup, start the O\/S , and support the transfer of data among the hardware devices. The BIOS is stored in ROM so that the BIOS can be executed when the computer  is activated.","When the computer  is in operation, the processor  is configured to execute software stored within the memory , to communicate data to and from the memory , and to generally control operations of the computer  pursuant to the software. The hosted presence aggregator component  and the O\/S , in whole or in part, but typically the latter, are read by the processor , perhaps buffered within the processor , and then executed.","When the hosted presence aggregator component  is implemented in software, as is shown in , it should be noted that the hosted presence aggregator component  can be stored on any computer readable medium for use by or in connection with any computer related system or method. In the context of this document, a computer readable medium is an electronic, magnetic, optical, or other physical device or means that can contain or store a computer program for use by or in connection with a computer related system or method. The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or medium. More specific examples (a nonexhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection (electronic) having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM) (electronic), a read-only memory (ROM) (electronic), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM, EEPROM, or Flash memory) (electronic), an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM) (optical).","In an alternative embodiment, where the hosted presence aggregator component  is implemented in hardware, the hosted presence aggregator component can implemented with any or a combination of the following technologies, which are each well known in the art: a discrete logic circuit(s) having logic gates for implementing logic functions upon data signals, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) having appropriate combinational logic gates, a programmable gate array(s) (PGA), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), etc.","Similarly, the AP agent component of one embodiment of the disclosure can be implemented in software (e.g., firmware), hardware, or a combination thereof. In one mode, the AP agent component is implemented in software, as an executable program, and is executed by a special or general purpose digital computer, such as a personal computer (PC; IBM-compatible, Apple-compatible, or otherwise), workstation, minicomputer, or mainframe computer. An example of a general purpose computer  that can implement the AP agent component is shown in . In , the AP agent component is denoted by reference numeral . The rest of the components shown in the figure are similar to the components just described for .","Messaging platform provided services may include cellular phone voicemail, office voicemail, enterprise email, instant messaging, and Web based email. As stated above, a user does not have to update presence information on multiple platforms with separate presence configuration to provide information regarding their current status. A user can access the hosted presence aggregator service using web communications or communications from an AP agent  installed on an end messaging device. Accordingly, a web browser  may be used by the user to access a web service provided by the hosted presence aggregator service. Therefore, the hosted presence aggregator  is hosted on a web server, in one embodiment.","When accessing the hosted presence aggregator service using a web browser , a user-interface web page is displayed on the computing device hosting the web browser . Via the user-interface, a user can update his or her presence information. After receiving the presence information update for the user, the hosted presence aggregator service establishes updates to all user-owned or user-controlled information services. With aid of a web user interface, the hosted presence aggregator manages and publishes different presence data schemas, including text status, GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates, and audio, image, and video data.","As an example, in one embodiment, a user may update his or her presence information using a web browser. In this example, the web browser may display a web page provided by the hosted presence aggregator service. The web page may include a user interface for selecting or inputting a presence status for the user and relaying this presence status to the hosted presence aggregator service. After receiving the updated presence status for the user, the hosted presence aggregator  may then provide the updated presence status to other devices and services owned or controlled by the user, so that these devices and services may update their presence information for the user. Accordingly, a federation of presence enabled devices and services  for a single user may be established.","Further, in one embodiment, the user may update his or her presence status using a user interface provided on a user messaging device, such as the user's mobile phone or IM (instant messaging) client device. In accordance with the present disclosure, the user messaging device may also host an AP agent  which detects the change in or updating of presence status and relays the new presence information to the hosted presence aggregator .","Referring now to , one embodiment of a user interface  for indicating a user's presence state for a messaging device  is shown. In this example, a user interface  to a messaging device  allows a user to select a presence state. After selection of the presence state, the AP agent  installed on the messaging device  relays the selected presence state to the hosted presence aggregator component .","Similarly, referring now to , one embodiment of a user interface for indicating a user's presence state for a web browser  is shown. In this example, a user interface  comprising a web page displayed on a computer  hosting the web browser  allows a user to select a presence state. Selection of the presence state is communicated to the hosted presence aggregator component  using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) communications.","After receiving the updated presence status for the user, the hosted presence aggregator  may then provide the updated presence status to other devices and services  owned or controlled by the user , so that these devices and services may update their presence information for the user.","In one embodiment, an update in presence information may be indicated by uploading an outgoing message announcement to the hosted presence aggregator , such as that used in voicemail systems to indicate that a user is away from his or her messaging service or device. After receiving the updated presence information, the outgoing message announcement may be relayed to the user's owned or controlled services that can utilize the updated information, such as the user's voicemail services.","In one embodiment, the devices and services receiving the updated presence information may poll the hosted presence aggregator service for new updates, if available. Otherwise, in some embodiments, the hosted presence aggregator  pushes new updates to the devices and services. Presence status can also be exported to Web 2.0 enabled social networking sites including MYSPACE\u00ae, TWITTER\u00ae, LINKEDIN\u00ae, and FACEBOOK\u00ae. To designate such sites, the user may specify them and corresponding usernames and passwords, if necessary, with the hosted presence aggregator service. The hosted presence aggregator service understands presence types utilized by different and individual presence devices\/services, including \u201caway for travel,\u201d \u201cout of office,\u201d etc. and may translate terms used by one device\/service into terms used by the hosted presence aggregator  and vice versa. In general, the hosted presence aggregator  is technology agnostic using connectors for presence protocols, including XML, SIP, SIMPLE, VXML, TAPI, XMPP, JABBER\u00ae, MICROSOFT EXCHANGE\u00ae, etc. and is interoperable with known industry standards for recording and setting presence information.","Once a user has federated his or her messaging devices (or other devices that utilize presence updates) and has established presence updates from a central point, the user can then establish act-on behavior for the federated devices in response to the user's presence information. The act-on behavior entails how a federated device is to act in response to certain presence information. Accordingly, once a user has established a federation and established a presence update, the act-on behavior determines what is actually done with the presence data to make it usable either than simply providing the presence data to someone or device. For example, if someone in the user's friends group calls one of one of the user's federated devices and the user's presence is that of being away or unavailable, as a non-limiting example, the federated device may have been provided a policy describing the desired act-on behavior for responding to a call from one of the user's friends while the user is \u201caway.\u201d This policy may state that GPS information on the user's location is to be provided to the friend. This GPS information may be obtained from a user's federated device itself. Alternatively, the GPS information may be relayed to the hosted presence aggregator  from a user or messenger device and then relayed to a federated device upon request by the device. Alternatively, a policy could state to provide a string of data (e.g., \u201cI'm on vacation\u201d), provide a hypertext map link that can be clicked and viewed, etc.","While the prior example describes an ability to use act-on policy data intelligently with GPS integration, in some embodiments, a hosted web-based platform may be extended to include XML metadata which will enable it to easily support new data types for act-on and notification behavior as a hosted web service. This is useful as communication evolves beyond telephone devices into network driven unified communications clients and other types of network connected devices. As an example, high priority calls could have presence act-on behavior for a manager that are routed into a receptionist IM alert; alternately it could be displayed as in-dash messaging from a Bluetooth-capable mobile phone or be presented as a video stream to their AT&T U-verse\u00ae television receiver at office and at home. Further, package shipping services may use hosted federated presence GPS information from a mobile phone to determine the current location to route a postal parcel in the event that a user is traveling on business or on vacation such that the user can request a reroute of a package in transit and then chose to share the presence data with the postal carrier if the shipping company's tracking web site is presence enabled. Other types of devices not specifically mentioned in this disclosure could also be made presence aware that are associated directly to a user or user group presence updates. For example, video projector carts could send presence updates with information from their GPS tag so that they can be located for a presentation. Also, hospital crash carts could update presence information with their current floor, location, and in use status enabling more responsive emergency medical care. The foregoing are but illustrative examples and are not meant to be limiting.","As suggested above, in some embodiments, a hosted presence aggregator web platform  supplies act-on presence behavior to end user or messenger devices. For example, a user may specify a policy on how end user devices should act or behave for particular presence states or scenarios. Further, the user may establish groups of contacts such as a friends group, office group, all users group. Therefore, the user may establish a policy that specifies that when the user is \u201caway\u201d and receives attempted communications from another user that is not in his or her friends group that the end device that is receiving this communication should forward the communication to voicemail. Additional rules may be established such as automatically accepting a meeting request when the user is in a particular presence state. The policy rules may be relayed to each of the user's end devices  or rules may be specified to be for a particular device or device-type. For example, the user  may designate that when the user is \u201cpresent and available\u201d and receives attempted communications from another user on a \u201ctelephone\u201d device that the call should be forwarded to his or her office telephone. Accordingly, different user devices may be associated with specific behaviors based on the type of presence set or states of a user. This includes information on how to reach a user that is away from his or her primary messaging device (e.g., email, mobile cellular telephone, IP-based office telephone).","As shown in an example represented by , a user may configure a user-device to provide GPS coordinates to the hosted presence aggregator . In this example, a user interface  comprising a web page displayed on a computer  hosting the web browser  allows a user to designate a policy that is communicated to the hosted presence aggregator component  using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) communications. As depicted, the user may specify a policy that the user's current location (e.g., via GPS coordinates) should be provided or published to interested contacts in a \u201cfamily\u201d grouping when the user is \u201caway from the office\u201d so that these contacts may know the whereabouts of the user. Accordingly, the GPS coordinates may be provided by the hosted presence aggregator  to the user's end devices and then relayed to interested contacts that are attempting to contact the user via one of these end devices .","In one embodiment, a federation takes place using an AP agent application  that establishes a secure connection with a hosted presence aggregator . This secure connection is based on a certificate authenticating the device as part of an authorized federation. For example, in case of a cell phone or in the case of a computer (e.g., email or IM client), the AP agent application  is installed on the device and a certificate is generated or issued by the hosted presence aggregator service and sent to the device and installed.","The digital certificate acts as a digital credential that identifies a user device as being part of a valid federation. Accordingly, a digital certificate may be revoked from a device when the user or messaging device should no longer be part of a user's federation of devices, including messaging servers in one embodiment. For example, an employer may revoke a certificate of an employer's work phone being utilized by a user so that the user can not make presence changes for the work phone after the user's employment with the employer has terminated. In this case, the user's control or ownership of the work device has extinguished.","In one arrangement, among others, a chain of user and organization security certificates is supported as an \u201cintermediary\u201d group. This gives a user the authority to manage and publish presence updates on behalf of an organization or employer, fellow employee, or other user. The intermediary certificates can be revoked by the employer or other user to remove authorization to publish presence updates on their behalf. This is important if an employee leaves their employer, or loses physical access to the presence agent device (e.g., a mobile phone is stolen, home PC intrusion, etc.)","In one embodiment, a digital certificate utilizes public key cryptography by containing a public key of the user identified in the certificate. The certificate matches a public key to a particular user and that certificate's authenticity is guaranteed by the issuer.","Also, in some embodiments, the hosted presence aggregator platform securely authenticates and manages device state and synchronization using public key cryptography and PKI (public key infrastructure) certificate model for end to end encryption. In one embodiment, the hosted presence aggregator  encrypts communications intended for an end messaging device  of a user  with a public key of the end device, so that only a private key of the end device can decode the communications. Likewise, end devices may encrypt communications intended for the hosted presence aggregator  with a public key of the hosted presence aggregator  so that a private key (installed at the hosted presence aggregator) is needed to decode those communications.","Referring now to , one embodiment of a presence federation system is shown. In this system, a hosted presence aggregator service is hosted on server  which is communicatively coupled to database . Database  stores presence profiles, policies, statuses, and related information utilized by the hosted presence aggregator service. As previously discussed, a user  may update his or her presence using a web browser  which communicates with the hosted presence aggregator service. In this example, the user has posted his or her presence as being \u201cOut Of The Office\u201d . The web browser  communicates the presence update  (e.g., using wireless or wired network communications) to the hosted presence aggregator  at server . The hosted presence aggregator service at server  may then push or transmit the presence update  (e.g., using wireless or wired network communications) to the user's federated devices, including a telephone , a personal computer  (and installed messaging applications), and a personal digital assistant .","Referring now to , one embodiment of a presence federation system is shown where like components have similar numbers, as provided in . As previously discussed, a user  may update his or her presence using a personal messaging device, such as a personal digital assistant  installed with an AP agent application . In this example, the user has posted his or her presence as being \u201cOut Of The Office\u201d  on the messaging device  and the AP agent  detects the update and relays the presence information  to the hosted presence aggregator service  at server . The hosted presence aggregator service may then push or transmit the presence update  to the user's federated devices, including a telephone  and a personal computer  (and installed messaging applications).","In , one embodiment of a presence federation system is shown where like components have similar numbers, as provided in . As previously discussed, a user  may update his or her presence using a personal messaging device, such as a personal digital assistant  installed with an AP agent application . In this example, the user \u201cJoe\u201d  has posted his or her presence as being \u201cOut Of The Office\u201d  on the messaging device  and the AP agent  detects the presence update and relays the presence information  to the hosted presence aggregator service at server . The hosted presence aggregator service may then push or transmit the presence update  to the federated devices ,  of other users in accordance with Joe's policy on how he or she would like his or her presence information to be published. In this example, Joe's policy indicates that presence updates should be distributed to user \u201cChris\u201d and user \u201cBill\u201d and all of their federated devices , .","Referring now to , one embodiment of a presence federation system is shown where like components have similar numbers, as provided in .

In this example, the user has posted his or her presence as being \u201cI Am Out Of The Office\u201d by uploading a recorded audio message  to the hosted presence aggregator service at server  from the web browser . The hosted presence aggregator service may then push or transmit the uploaded recorded audio message  to the user's federated voicemail services, including an office voicemail system  and a home voicemail system .","Referring now to , one embodiment of a presence federation system is shown where like components have similar numbers, as provided in .

Further, in this example, the user also posts GPS location information  to the hosted presence aggregator service at server  for the user's current location, such as by a personal digital assistant  having a GPS receiver\/transmitter. The user may set up a policy that posted GPS coordinates should be distributed to other users' federated devices when the user is not available (e.g., Out Of The Office). In the example shown, the user's presence is indicated as being Out Of The Office and being at the City Park on another user's federated device (e.g., Chris' GPS-enabled phone ), as designated by the user's policy settings.

The hosted presence aggregator  publishes or transmits (block ) the updated presence information to a federation of user devices , , such as a telephone A, A, a computer B (and installed messaging applications), and a personal digital assistant B, in accordance with the user's policy on how presence updates should be distributed to other users and all of their federated devices , .","Referring now to , one embodiment of a hosted presence aggregator process is depicted. In one embodiment, this process is tied to a computer, as illustrated in . In block , an update of presence information is received from a personal messaging device, such as a personal computer  installed with a web browser application  in a form of a recorded audio message. In this example, the user has posted his or her presence as being \u201cI Am Out Of The Office\u201d by uploading a recorded audio message  to the hosted presence aggregator  from the web browser . The hosted presence aggregator  may then push or transmit the uploaded recorded audio message  to the user's federated voicemail services, including an office voicemail system  and a home voicemail system , as shown in block .","Referring now to , one embodiment of a hosted presence aggregator process is depicted. In one embodiment, this process is tied to a computer, as illustrated in . In block , an update of presence information (e.g., network presence state) from a user is received. The update in a form of a recorded audio message pertains to the user's presence and is made using a personal messaging device, such as a telephone , and corresponding messaging service, such as an office voicemail system  installed with an AP agent application . For example, the user may call into the voicemail service  and record an audio message, \u201cI Am Out Of The Office,\u201d to be used as an outgoing message by the voicemail system . The AP agent application  detects (block ) the newly generated recording for the user and relays or transmits (block ) the new recording to the hosted presence aggregator . The hosted presence aggregator  may then push or transmit () the uploaded recorded audio message to the user's federated voicemail service, including a home voicemail system .","In , one embodiment of a hosted presence aggregator process is depicted. In one embodiment, this process is tied to a computer, as illustrated in . In accordance with this process, a presence update from a personal messaging device, such as a personal computer  installed with a web browser application , is received (block ) at a host presence aggregator . For example, the user may post his or her presence as being \u201cOut Of The Office\u201d with the hosted presence aggregator  using the web browser . The hosted presence aggregator  may then push or transmit (block ) the presence update to other users' messaging or user devices, in accordance with the user's policies for distributing presence information along with supplemental presence information. For example, the user or user devices might have posted or transmitted (block ) supplemental presence information in the form of GPS location information to the hosted presence aggregator service for the user's current location, such as by a personal digital assistant  having a GPS card. The user may set up a policy that posted GPS coordinates should be distributed to other user's messaging devices when the user is not available (e.g., \u201cOut Of The Office\u201d). For example, the user's presence may be indicated as being \u201cOut Of The Office\u201d and being at the City Park location on another user's device, as designated by the user's policy settings. Therefore, the supplemental presence information (e.g., GPS location information) is also transmitted (block ) to other users' messaging or user devices.","Referring now to , one embodiment of a hosted presence aggregator process is depicted. In one embodiment, this process is tied to a computer, as illustrated in . A user  sets or updates (block ) a policy, such as a policy designating act-on behavior in response to presence states using a personal messaging device, such as a personal computer  installed with a web browser application . In this example, the user  has posted or transmitted (block ) a policy  to the hosted presence aggregator  using the web browser . The hosted presence aggregator  may then push or transmit (block ) the policy update to the user's other federated devices , ,  so that these devices may behave in accordance with the policy .","In accordance with the above-described embodiments, a device does not need to be SIP aware to publish presence status updates and\/or provide instant messaging functionality. Non-SIP connected devices (which include includes legacy public branch exchange telephone switches, email servers, hosted web-based e-mail platforms, web servers, carrier telephone switches, legacy office voicemail, carrier hosted voicemail platforms, non-IP cellular voicemail, cellular switching infrastructure, etc.) outside of a SIP, SIMPLE, or XMPP-aware environment now have a way to publish presence updates.","As a non-limiting example, a web server can communicate with user agents placed into each device to obtain and modify current presence information. This allows a single user to manage presence on multiple devices simultaneously. In the case of exchange carrier infrastructure (e.g., carrier telephone switches and cellular switching infrastructure) the carrier may maintain agent access for the user using a certificate. The user agent makes the device presence-aware, without the need of a SIP, SIMPLE, or XMPP environment. Further in this example, presence aggregation takes place in a hosted web environment versus a standalone unified communications environment where local SIP proxy servers only have presence information available from SIP or XMPP-capable local devices.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present disclosure are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the disclosure.
