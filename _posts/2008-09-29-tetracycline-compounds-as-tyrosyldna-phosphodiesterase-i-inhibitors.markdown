{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of PCT International Application PCT\/US2007\/007724, filed Mar. 27, 2007, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 60\/786,746, filed Mar. 27, 2006, both of which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","This invention was funded by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","Cancer, in all its manifestations, remains a devastating disorder. Although cancer is commonly considered to be a single disease, it actually comprises a family of diseases wherein normal cell differentiation is modified so that it becomes abnormal and uncontrolled. As a result, these malignant cells rapidly proliferate. Eventually, the cells spread or metastasize from their origin and colonize other organs, eventually killing their host. Due to the wide variety of cancers presently observed, numerous strategies have been developed to destroy cancer within the body.","Typically, cancer is treated by chemotherapy, in which highly toxic chemicals are given to the patient, or by radiotherapy, in which toxic doses of radiation are directed at the patient. Unfortunately, these \u201ccytotoxic\u201d treatments also kill extraordinary numbers of healthy cells, causing the patient to experience acute debilitating symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, hypersensitivity to light, hair loss, etc. The side effects of these cytotoxic compounds limits the frequency and dosage at which they can be administered. Such disabling side effects can be mitigated to some degree by using compounds that selectively target cycling cells, i.e., interfering with DNA replication or other growth processes in cells that are actively reproducing. Since cancer cells are characterized by their extraordinary ability to proliferate, such protocols preferentially kill a larger proportion of cancer cells in comparison to healthy cells, but cytotoxicity and ancillary sickness remains a problem.","Another strategy for controlling cancer involves the use of signal transduction pathways in malignant cells to \u201cturn off\u201d their uncontrolled proliferation, or alternatively, instruct such cells to undergo apoptosis. Such methods of treating cancer are promising but a substantial amount of research is needed in order to make these methods viable alternatives.","The treatment and\/or cure of cancer has been intensely investigated culminating in a wide range of therapies. Cancer has been typically treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, alone or in conjunction with various therapies employing drugs, biologic agents, antibodies, and radioactive immunoconjugates, among others. The common goal of cancer treatment has been, and continues to be, the elimination or amelioration of cancerous tumors and cells with minimal unpleasant or life-threatening side effects, due to toxicity to normal tissues and cells. However, despite efforts, these goals remain largely unmet.","Tetracycline and a number of its chemical relatives have been used as antibiotics. The parent compound, tetracycline, has the following general structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"26.59mm","wi":"52.75mm","file":"US08865686-20141021-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"16.34mm","wi":"42.59mm","file":"US08865686-20141021-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Tetracycline, as well as the 5-OH (terramycin) and 7-Cl (aureomycin) derivatives, exist in nature, and are all well known antibiotics. Semisynthetic derivatives such as 7-dimethylamino-tetracycline (minocycline) and 6\u03b1-deoxy-5-hydroxy-tetracycline (doxycycline) are also known antibiotics.","However, changes to the basic structure of the ring system, or replacement of substituents at positions 1-4 or 10-12, generally lead to synthetic tetracyclines with substantially less, or essentially no, antibacterial activity. For example, 4-de(dimethylamino)tetracycline is commonly considered to be a non-antibacterial tetracycline.","Tetracycline compounds affect protein synthesis and appear to have anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their anti-microbial properties which are useful for treatment of arthritis. The anti-inflammatory activity of tetracycline compounds make them useful for treating other inflammatory disorders, even in the absence of an infectious agent. Tetracycline compounds can inhibit enzymes associated with inflammatory diseases such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), collagenase, gelatinase and elastase. While it is widely thought that tetracycline compounds decrease enzyme activity by chelation, they may also decrease inflammation by decreasing production of proinflammatory or other compounds. Tetracycline compounds may be effective when used with other compounds in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.","More recently, it has been established that tetracyclines, which are rapidly absorbed and have a prolonged plasma half-life, exert biological effects independent of their antimicrobial activity (Golub et al. 1991, Golub et al. 1992, Uitto et al. 1994). Such effects include inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (abbreviated \u201cMMPs\u201d), including collagenases (MMP-1; MMP-8; MMP-13) and gelatinases (MMP-2; MMP-9), as well as prevention of pathologic tissue destruction (Golub et al. 1991).","In view of the above considerations, it is clear that there is a need to supplement existing methods of inhibiting cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. Current approaches rely on highly cytotoxic compounds that cause ancillary debilitating sickness in patients, or use methodology that is expensive, procedurally difficult, and unpredictable.","Accordingly, it is one of the purposes of this invention to overcome the above limitations in cancer treatment, by providing a compound and method for inhibiting the growth processes characteristic of cancer cells, including inhibiting invasiveness and metastasis, as well as inducing regression of primary tumors. In particular, it is desirable to identify anticancer compounds and methods that inhibit cancer growth specifically and with relatively high activity, i.e., being active at doses that are substantially free of harmful side effects. Additionally, it is a purpose of the invention to provide methods and compositions suitable for the development, identification, and\/or characterization of compounds that are capable of modulating the activity of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases (TDPs), particularly tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1). The present invention provides means to identify and characterize compounds that are suitable for inhibiting TDP activity in vivo and in vitro.","In certain aspects, the invention provides a method of inhibiting Tdp1 activity in a subject, the method comprising administering to the subject a tetracycline compound capable of modulating the activity of Tdp1. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of inhibiting Tdp1 activity, wherein the tetracycline compound is a compound of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"35.31mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08865686-20141021-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein,","Z is S(O), S(O), N(R), C(O), C(S), C(S)NR, C(NR), C(NR)NR, C(O)NR, C(O)O, (C(R)(R)), (C(R)(R))NR, (C(R)(R))O, (C(R)(R))S(O), NRC(O)NR, NRC(S)NR, NRC(O), NRC(O)O, NRC(NR)NR, NRC(S)O, NRS(O)NR, C(NR)O, S(O)NR, or absent;","each Rand Ris independently H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, hydroxylalkyl, \u2014C(O)R, \u2014C(S)R, \u2014C(NR)R, haloalkyl, \u2014S(O)R, \u2014S(O)R, \u2014P(O)RR, \u2014P(S)RR, or alkylcarbonylalkyl;

Some such growths are benign, but others are termed \u201cmalignant,\u201d leading to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or \u201ccancers\u201d are distinguished from benign growths in that, in addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, they invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover, malignant neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater loss of differentiation (greater \u201cdedifferentiation\u201d), and of their organization relative to one another and their surrounding tissues. This property is also called \u201canaplasia.\u201d","Neoplasms treatable by the present invention include all solid tumors, i.e., carcinomas and sarcomas, including Kaposi's sarcoma. Carcinomas include those malignant neoplasms derived from epithelial cells which tend to infiltrate (invade) the surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases. Adenocarcinomas are carcinomas derived from glandular tissue or in which the tumor cells form recognizable glandular structures. Sarcoma, including Kaposi's sarcoma broadly include tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance like embryonic connective tissue.","The invention is particularly illustrated herein in reference to treatment of certain types of experimentally defined cancers. In these illustrative treatments, standard state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo models have been used. These methods can be used to identify agents that can be expected to be efficacious in in vivo treatment regimens. However, it will be understood that the method of the invention is not limited to the treatment of these tumor types, but extends to any solid tumor derived from any organ system. Cancers whose invasiveness or metastasis is associated with MMP expression, particularly gelatinase expression, are especially susceptible to being inhibited or even induced to regress by means of the invention.","Thus, the treatable cancers include, for example, colon cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma, or lung cancer, and a variety of other cancers as well. The invention is especially useful in the inhibition of cancer growth in adenocarcinomas, including, for example, those of the prostate, breast, kidney, ovary, testes, and colon. The invention is further useful against melanomas, which derive from the melanocytic system in the skin and other organs.","A solid tumor can be malignant, e.g. tending to metastasize and being life threatening, or benign. Examples of solid tumors that can be treated according to a method of the present invention include sarcomas and carcinomas such as, but not limited to: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma.","Moreover, tumors comprising dysproliferative changes (such as metaplasias and dysplasias) are treated or prevented in epithelial tissues such as those in the cervix, esophagus, and lung. Thus, the present invention provides for treatment of conditions known or suspected of preceding progression to neoplasia or cancer, in particular, where non-neoplastic cell growth consisting of hyperplasia, metaplasia, or most particularly, dysplasia has occurred (for review of such abnormal growth conditions, see Robbins and Angell, 1976, Basic Pathology, 2d Ed., W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. 68-79). Hyperplasia is a form of controlled cell proliferation involving an increase in cell number in a tissue or organ, without significant alteration in structure or function. As but one example, endometrial hyperplasia often precedes endometrial cancer. Metaplasia is a form of controlled cell growth in which one type of adult or fully differentiated cell substitutes for another type of adult cell. Metaplasia can occur in epithelial or connective tissue cells. Atypical metaplasia involves a somewhat disorderly metaplastic epithelium. Dysplasia is frequently a forerunner of cancer, and is found mainly in the epithelia; it is the most disorderly form of non-neoplastic cell growth, involving a loss in individual cell uniformity and in the architectural orientation of cells. Dysplastic cells often have abnormally large, deeply stained nuclei, and exhibit pleomorphism. Dysplasia characteristically occurs where there exists chronic irritation or inflammation, and is often found in the cervix, respiratory passages, oral cavity, and gall bladder. For a review of such disorders, see Fishman et al., 1985, Medicine, 2d Ed., J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia.","Other examples of tumors that are benign and can be treated with a method of the present invention include arteriovenous (AV) malformations, particularly in intracranial sites and myoleomas. A method of the present invention may also be used to treat psoriasis, a dermatologic condition that is characterized by inflammation and vascular proliferation; benign prostatic hypertrophy, a condition associated with inflammation and possibly vascular proliferation; and cutaneous fungal infections. Treatment of other hyperprobiferative disorders is also contemplated.","In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting cancer growth, including processes of cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in biological systems. The method includes the use of a tetracycline compound as an inhibitor of cancer growth. Preferably, the method is employed to inhibit or reduce cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis, or tumor incidence in living animals, such as mammals.","The invention includes a method of inducing cytotoxicity (cell killing) in cancer cells or reducing the viability of cancer cells. For example, the invention can be used to induce cytotoxicity in cells of carcinomas of the prostate, breast, ovary, testis, lung, colon, or breast. The selective killing of the cancer cells can occur through apoptosis, necrosis, another mechanism, or a combination of mechanisms.","The killing of cancer cells can occur with less cytotoxicity to normal cells or tissues than is found with conventional cytotoxic therapeutics, preferably without substantial cytotoxicity to normal cells or tissues. For example, a tetracycline, e.g., CMT-3, can induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells while producing little or substantially no cytotoxicity in normal cells. Thus, unlike conventional cytotoxic anticancer therapeutics, which typically kill all growing cells, CMT-3 can produce differential cytotoxicity: tumor cells are selectively killed whereas normal cells are spared. Thus, in another embodiment, the invention is a method for inducing differential cytotoxicity in cancer cells relative to normal cells or tissue. This differential in cytotoxicity associated with the tetracycline compounds occurs as a result of apoptosis, necrosis, another mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms.","The tetracycline compounds exhibit their cancer treatment properties at concentrations that lead to fewer side effects than those of known chemotherapeutic agents, and in some cases are substantially free of side effects. The tetracycline compounds are useful for extended treatment protocols, where other compounds would exhibit undesirable side-effects. In addition, it is believed that the properties of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity are well balanced in these compounds, enhancing their utility both in vitro and especially in vivo, while other compounds lacking such balance are of substantially less utility. Specifically, the compounds have an appropriate degree of solubility in aqueous media to permit absorption and bioavailability in the body, while also having a degree of solubility in lipids to permit traversal of the cell membrane to a putative site of action. The compounds are maximally effective if they can be delivered to the site of the tumor and are able to enter the tumor cells.","In the treatment of certain localized cancers, the degree of hydrophilicity of the tetracycline compound can be of lesser importance. Such compounds as tetracyclinonitrile (CMT-2), which has low solubility in aqueous systems, can be used in direct or topical treatment of skin cancers, e.g., melanoma or basal cell carcinoma, or by implantation into the brain to topically treat brain cancer.","The tetracycline compounds are effective to inhibit the proliferation, invasiveness, or metastasis of cancer cells in vitro, as well as in vivo. These compounds possess an excellent balance of properties, in that they are shown to possess unusually strong activity in inhibiting the cancer growth, including proliferation, invasiveness, or metastasis of cancer cells. Another advantage is that it has an unexpectedly long serum half-life (approximately 28 hr). Therefore, certain tetracyclines may only require periodic administration, e.g., once or twice per week.","In another embodiment, the method of the invention is effective to inhibit the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinases, such as collagenases and gelatinases, associated with cancerous tumors in mammals. The gelatinolytic activity capable of inhibition may derive from gelatinase expression by the cancerous tumor or from normal, i.e., non-cancerous, tissue. In particular, the gelatinase activity may be derived from such normal tissues as epithelial tissue or stromal tissue. More preferably, the method can be used to inhibit excessive gelatinolytic activity associated with such tumors. This inhibition of observed gelatinolytic activity may be due to inhibition of MMP activity, down-regulation of MMP expression, or some other interference with the physiology associated with these gelatinases, such as inhibition of activation of the precursor form of the enzyme, pro-gelatinase (or pro-MMP).","The inhibition of cancer cells may result from inhibition of MMP activity, down-regulation of MMP expression, some other mechanism, or a combination of mechanisms. It is believed that all solid cancer types that express MMPs or that exhibit invasive or metastatic properties can be treated by the method of the invention. In some cases, the incidence or development of tumor foci can be inhibited or substantially prevented from occurring. Therefore, the method can be used as a prophylactic treatment, e.g., by administering the tetracycline compound to a mammal after detection of a gene product or metabolite associated with predisposition to a cancer but before any specific cancerous lesion is detected. Alternatively, the tetracycline compounds are useful for preventing cancer recurrence, for example, to treat residual cancer following surgical resection or radiation therapy.","The effect occurs over a wide range of concentrations, including at concentrations that are extraordinarily low. The amount of the tetracycline compound used according to the invention is an amount that is effectively inhibitory of cancer growth. An amount of a tetracycline compound is effectively inhibitory to cancer growth if it significantly reduces cellular proliferation or the potential of invasiveness or metastasis. Proliferation refers to the capacity of a tumor to increase its volume through cell division, typically measured as the \u201cdoubling rate.\u201d The inhibition of cellular proliferation by the present method means that the rate of growth is decreased. In some cases, the method can actually induce regression or diminution of tumor mass, if the rate of replenishment of the tumor cells through cell division is exceeded by the rate of cell death. Invasiveness refers to the potential of a tumor or tumor cells to invade other tissues, typically by breaking down the extracellular matrix of those tissues. Metastasis refers to the potential of a tumor or tumor cells to establish new tumor foci at sites distant from the primary site where the tumor began. Typically, metastasis proceeds by individual cells or groups of cells breaking off from the primary tumor and migrating, e.g., through the blood or lymph, to establish a new tumor focus in another tissue or organ. One locus common in tumor metastasis is in the lung, where the very fine vasculature of the lung tissue can often catch circulating tumor cells, permitting the establishment of a tumor focus therein. Some types of tumors metastasize to specific types of tissues.","The cancers treatable by means of the present invention occur in mammals. Mammals include, for example, humans, as well as pet animals such as dogs and cats, laboratory animals such as rats and mice, and farm animals such as horses and cows.","Human cancers are characterized by genomic instability, which leads to the accumulation of DNA lesions. Hence, tumor cells are highly dependent on normal repair for survival.","DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is ubiquitous and essential in higher eukaryotes. It relieves DNA torsional stress and relaxes DNA supercoiling by introducing DNA single-strand breaks. Top1 can be trapped by DNA lesions that accumulate in cancer cells. Top1 is also the target of the anticancer agent camptothecin and non-camptothecin inhibitors. Top1 inhibitors damage DNA by trapping covalent complexes between the Top1 catalytic tyrosine and the 3\u2032-end of the broken DNA. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) repairs Top1-DNA covalent complexes by hydrolyzing the tyrosyl-DNA bond.","Tdp1 inhibitors are therefore useful as anticancer agents both in monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer compounds (particularly DNA-targeted anticancer compounds) such as Top1 inhibitors. Tumor cells, whose repair pathways are commonly deficient, might be selectively sensitized to Top1 inhibitors compared to normal cells that contain redundant repair pathways. Moreover, Tdp1 inhibitors might also be effective by themselves as anticancer agents as oncogenic activation tends to increase free radical production and genomic instability (Cerutti Pa. (1985) 227 (4685):375-381; Kc S et al. . (2006) 29 593(1-2):64-79.; Vafa et al., 9(5):1031-1044 (2002)).","Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating cancer and other cell proliferative disorders by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a combination of a Tdp1 inhibitor of this invention together with a TopI inhibitor. A variety of TopI inhibitors have been reported, including camptothecin, irinotecan, topotecan, saintopin, and derivatives and analogs thereof. In another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions including a Tdp1 inhibitor of this invention together with a TopI inhibitor, optionally including a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or excipient.","In another aspect, the invention provides methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of parasitic disease. Tdp1 inhibitors may be valuable as anti-infectious agents since the gene is present in parasites, including , and spp. including , and . Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating or preventing a parasitic infection caused by a parasite expressing Tbp1, the method including the step of administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a Tdp1 inhibitor according to this invention. In another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions for treatment or preention of parasitic disease, including a Tdp1 inhibitor of this invention together pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or excipient.","Tetracycline compounds used to treat cancer and other Tdp1-related disorders include the following compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0269","num":"0268"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00023","num":"00023"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00023","he":"26.50mm","wi":"55.54mm","file":"US08865686-20141021-C00023.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0270","num":"0269"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00024","num":"00024"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00024","he":"135.30mm","wi":"68.66mm","file":"US08865686-20141021-C00024.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In one aspect, the invention provides a tetracycline compound of formula I or Ia:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0272","num":"0271"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00025","num":"00025"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00025","he":"79.76mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08865686-20141021-C00025.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein,","Z is S(O), S(O), N(R), C(O), C(S), C(S)NR, C(NR), C(NR)NR, C(O)NR, C(O)O, (C(R)(R)), (C(R)(R))NR, (C(R)(R))O, (C(R)(R))S(O), NRC(O)NR, NRC(S)NR, NRC(O), NRC(O)O, NRC(NR)NR, NRC(S)O, NRS(O)NR, C(NR)O, S(O)NR, or absent;","each Rand Ris independently H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, hydroxylalkyl, \u2014C(O)R, \u2014C(S)R, \u2014C(NR)R, haloalkyl, \u2014S(O)R, \u2014S(O)R, \u2014P(O)RR, \u2014P(S)RR, or alkylcarbonylalkyl; each of which may be optionally substituted;","R is H, alkyl, alkylcarbonyl, \u2014OR, \u2014SR, \u2014NRR, hydroxylalkyl, \u2014C(O)R, \u2014OC(O)R, \u2014SC(O)R, \u2014NRC(O)R, \u2014C(S)R, \u2014OC(S)R, \u2014SC(S)R, \u2014NRC(S)R, \u2014C(NR)R, \u2014OC(NR)R, \u2014SC(NR)R, \u2014NRC(NR)R, \u2014SOR, \u2014S(O)R, \u2014NRSOR, \u2014OS(O)R, \u2014OP(O)RR, \u2014P(O)RR, halo, haloalkyl, aminoalkyl, mercaptoalkyl, cyano, nitro, nitroso, azide, alkylcarbonylalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl, heteroaralkyl, or isothionitro; each of which may be optionally substituted;","each Ris independently, H, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, haloalkyl, \u2014OR, \u2014SR, \u2014NRR, hydroxylalkyl, alkylcarbonylalkyl, mercaptoalkyl, aminoalkyl, sulfonylalkyl, sulfonylaryl, or thioalkoxy; each of which may be optionally substituted; and wherein two or more Rgroups, when attached to a heteroatom, may together form a heterocyclic ring with said heteroatom, wherein the heterocyclic ring may be optionally substituted;","each Ris independently H, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, heterocycloalkyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl; each of which may be optionally substituted;","each m is independently 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8; and","each p is independently 0, 1, or 2.","In certain preferred aspects of the invention, a tetracycline compound of the above formula I or Ia is provided wherein R of formula I or Ia is not H when Z of formula I or Ia is absent.

In addition, where the compositions are coupled to molecular carriers, the rate of uptake can vary, depending on the level of receptor expression on the surface of the cells. For example, where there is a high level of receptor expression, the rate of binding and uptake is increased. Determining a useful range of waiting step duration is within the level of ordinary skill in the art and may be optimized.","The tetracycline compounds useful according to the method of the invention appear to exhibit their beneficial effect in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, within broad limits, administration of larger quantities of a tetracycline compound has been observed to inhibit cancer cell growth or invasiveness to a greater degree than does administration of a smaller amount. Moreover, efficacy has been observed at dosages below the level at which toxicity is seen in normal cells or at the organismal level. Accordingly, one of the advantages of the invention is that the debilitating side effects usually attendant upon conventional cytotoxic cancer treatments are reduced, and preferably avoided.","Available routes of administration include subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal, oral, intranasal, intrapulmonary (i.e., by aerosol), intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, intrathecally or transdermally, alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents.","Compositions for oral, intranasal, or topical administration can be supplied in solid, semi-solid or liquid forms, including tablets, capsules, powders, liquids, and suspensions.

For administration via the respiratory tract, a preferred composition is one that provides a solid, powder, or liquid aerosol when used with an appropriate aerosolizer device. Although not required, compositions are preferably supplied in unit dosage form suitable for administration of a precise amount. Also contemplated by this invention are slow-release or sustained release forms, whereby a relatively consistent level of the active compound are provided over an extended period.","Another method of administration is intravascular, for instance by direct injection into the blood vessel, or surrounding area. Further, it may be desirable to administer the compositions locally to the area in need of treatment; this can be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as silastic membranes, or fibers.","Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, preferred methods and materials are described above.

Tdp1 can repair DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) covalent complexes by hydrolyzing the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiester bond. The natural substrate of Tdp1 is large and complex, consisting of tyrosine or possibly a tyrosine-containing peptide moiety linked to a single strand of DNA via a 3\u2032 phosphodiester bond (Interthal, H.; Pouliot, J. J. 98, 21 (2001)). In the present study, in order to determine how the inhibitors may be binding with the active site of Tdp1 N domain, we report docking the inhibitors into a structural model of Tdp1 enzyme, based on a multiple crystal structures of Tdp1 substrate complex with resolution 2.0 {acute over (\u212b)} or better inhibitors to obtain information about their preferred conformations and their potential binding interactions with the Tdp1 and Top1 N-terminal domain.","Computational modeling was performed using Glide software (Schrodinger Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics workstation.

The compounds were optimized using the OPLS2003 force field, using a PRCG to convergence and a distance dependent dielectric constant of 1 for the electrostatic treatment. Minimization was done using conjugate gradient minimization. Maximum number of cycles was set to 1000, gradient criteria: 0.001. The complex was modeled in the N-terminal domain. The ligand compounds were docked by standard precision (SP) and with option: dock flexibly, which allow flips of 5 and 6 member rings. The best poses of compounds were finally selected based on the docking score, Emodel and the interactions made by the compounds with the active site of Tdp1.","The results are shown in . The docking analysis indicate that in the best poses of Compound (a) (without substrate): the amine group Hydrogen bonds to residue SER 608 (1NOP); hydrogen atom of imine group to His 493 (1RFF); nitrogen atom by C20 contacts with polar hydrogen atom of T 806 of oligonucleotide (1RHO) and in the best poses of Compound (a) (with substrate): oxygen atom of hydroxyl group by C10 and carbonyl group by C11 HBonds to GLY 260, oxygen atom of hydroxyl group by C12 to LYS 720 (1RFF); and the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group by C12a of NSC 118695 HBonds to PRO 461 (1RHO). In case of Compound (b) (without substrate) hydrogen atom of amine group HBonds to N3 of His 493 (1RHO); nitrogen atom of imine group contacts with T 806 (1RHO), while in crystal structure oxygen atom of VO4 bonds to T 806 of oligonucleotide. When the substrate is present in the active site the amine group contacts with N3 and C4 of His 263 (1NOP); substituent in position 3 contacts with TYR 723 (1RFF); hydrogen atom of amine group contacts to N3 of His 263 (1RHO). The binding model obtained for compound Compound (a) did not show some critical interactions with active sites of Tdp1 N domain. The docking scores correlated poorly with enzyme inhibitory activity, so other approaches were tried to quantify the docked poses. One main reason for the failure to get a good docking mode could be attributed to the size of the molecules and the number of rotatable bonds (13 for Compound (a) and only 4 for Compound (b)).","The results obtained in Examples 2 and 3 are used to refine a model for prediction of binding affinity of compounds against Tdp1 as follows. Virtual screening method of compounds obtained from, e.g., the NCI databases such as ChemNavigator based on the biological activity data of confirmed 34 compounds active in the low micromolar range. The obtained compounds will then be subjected to flexible docking as described above, and compounds are selected based on the docking score for the Energy of the Model. The results are compared with a training set of compounds found to bind to the active site of Tdp1.","Reagents.","Tween-20, KCl, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and PBS were procured from Sigma-Aldrich.

The Sigma-Aldrich LOPAClibrary of 1280 known bioactives was received as DMSO solutions at initial concentration of 10 mM and plated as described elsewhere (Inglese et al., 103:11473-11478 (2006); Yasgar et al., 13:78-89 (2008)).","AlphaScreen Substrate.","The biotinylated phosphotyrosine deoxyoligonucleotide (5\u2032 biotin-GATCTAAAAGACTT-pY) was synthesized, purified, and QC-tested by Midland Certified Reagent Company, Midland, Tex. Standard overnight 4\u00b0 C. FITC coupling was performed in-house. The FITC-labeled substrate was purified on Biospin-6 desalting columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) and its concentration was determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry.","Assay Development and Optimization.","Assay reaction mixtures and substrate\/beads titrations were initially performed at 20 \u03bcl final volume in 384-well plates. For the subsequent 1,536-well based experiments, Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD, Aurora Discovery, presently Beckman-Coulter) was used to dispense reagents into the assay plates, while a pintool was used to deliver DMSO solutions of the test inhibitors. Plates were read on Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer) equipped with AlphaScreen optical detection module. For testing the effect of enzyme reaction conditions on the ICvalues for select inhibitors, the respective compounds were prepared as 24-point twofold intra-plate dilution series and assayed as described.","qHTS Protocol and Data Analysis.","Three \u03bcl of reagents (buffer in columns 3 and 4 as negative control and 1.33 nM Tdp1 in columns 1, 2, 5-48) were dispensed into 1,536-well black solid bottom plate. Compounds (final concentrations in the range of 0.7 nM to 57 \u03bcM) were transferred via Kalypsys pintool equipped with 1,536-pin array. The plate was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then 1 \u03bcl of substrate (15 nM final concentration) was added to start the reaction. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, 1 \u03bcl of bead mix (15 \u03bcg\/mL final concentration) was added and the plate was further incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to signal measurement. Substrate and beads were prepared and kept in amber bottles to prevent photo-degradation. Library plates were screened starting from the lowest and proceeding to the highest concentration. Vehicle-only plates, with DMSO being pin-transferred to the entire column 5-48 compound area, were included at the beginning and the end of the screen in order to record any systematic shifts in assay signal. Screening data were corrected, normalized, and curve-fitted by using in-house developed algorithms.","Secondary Assays.","One nanomolar of 5\u2032-P-labeled substrate (N14Y; 5\u2032-GATCTAAAAGACTT-Tyrosine-3\u2032) was incubated with 0.1 nM recombinant Tdp1 in the absence or presence of inhibitor for 20 min at 25\u00b0 C. in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 40 \u03bcg\/ml BSA. Reactions were terminated by the addition of one volume of gel loading buffer (96% (v\/v) formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 1% (w\/v) xylene cyanol and 1% (w\/v) bromphenol blue). The samples were subsequently heated to 95\u00b0 C. for 5 min and subjected to 20% denaturing PAGE. When the Tdp1 mutant H493R (100 nM) was employed, the reactions were stopped with one volume of SDS loading dye and analyzed by 4-20% SDS-PAGE. All gels were dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen. Imaging and quantification were done using a Typhoon 8600 and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.).","Results","Assay Design.","To configure an assay for Tdp1, we utilized the ability of the AlphaScreen system to report on the integrity of the phosphotyrosine-based substrate, viewed here as a multi-site analyte. The AlphaScreen signal is a direct consequence of the close proximity of donor and acceptor beads, which is achieved by the formation of a ternary donor-analyte-acceptor recognition complex. To realize the AlphaScreen assay using the consensus DNA-pY substrate for Tdp1, 5\u2032GATCTAAAAGACTTpY, recognition elements for both bead types had to be introduced. To this end, we coupled a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to the amino group of tyrosine in a phosphotyrosine-containing single stranded DNA substrate bearing a biotin at its 5\u2032 end. Thus, intact substrate, when mixed with streptavidin-donor and anti-FITC antibody-acceptor beads, was expected to yield a high AlphaScreen signal, while the Tdp1-catalyzed substrate hydrolysis would result in a decreased signal. Conversely, if the Tdp1 catalysis was inhibited, an elevated signal would be observed for that sample.","Assay Set-Up and Optimization in 384-Well Plates.","In a 384-well plate, the addition of an equimolar mix of anti-FITC-acceptor and streptavidin-donor AlphaScreen beads to FITC-DNA substrate generated a strong signal while omission of substrate resulted in background readings. The concentration-response curve of the FITC-DNA substrate titrated against constant bead concentration exhibited a maximum around 15 nM followed by a signal decrease to background levels as the substrate concentration was further increased. The biphasic behavior is characteristic of such polyvalent interactions and in this case was due to the saturation of all available binding sites on the beads and the built-up of bipartite populations of beads saturated exclusively by substrate molecules at the expense of tripartite donor-substrate-acceptor assemblies. The maximum-signal concentration of 15 nM falls below the previously reported Km value of Tdp1 of 80\u00b120 nM, thus ensuring good assay sensitivity with respect to potential inhibitors.","When the same-sequence construct devoid of FITC was tested, a weak and considerably right-shifted signal evolution was noted. While this result points to some non-specific binding, the contribution of the latter to the total signal at the 15 nM point appears to be minimal. Moreover, the Tdp1-induced cleavage of the FITC-DNA substrate, when driven to completion, yielded background signal, thus indicating that the small signal increase observed here was likely due to the interaction between the acceptor bead and the tyrosine moiety. In the presence of increasing concentrations of Tdp1, the FITC-coupled tyrosine group was released, preventing anti-FITC acceptor bead positioning close to the donor bead and subsequently leading to an enzyme-dependent loss of signal. DMSO had no effect on the enzymatic reaction (data not shown). Neomycin and vanadate, two previously described weak Tdp1 inhibitors, both inhibited Tdp1 in this assay. The test method and reaction conditions of the original studies of neomycin and vanadate differ from those used in the present assay; nevertheless, the potencies of the two compounds as determined here were in agreement with these prior publications, with neomycin being a weak low-millimolar inhibitor and vanadate exhibiting its inhibition in the sub-millimolar range.","Assay Optimization in 1536-Well Format and Pilot Screens of the LOPACCollection.","The assay was further miniaturized to a final volume of 5 \u03bcl in 1,536-well format by direct volume reduction. The inclusion of Tween-20 in the assay buffer helped prevent enzyme absorption to the polystyrene wells and minimized the interfering effect of promiscuous inhibitors acting via colloidal aggregate formation. In order to verify assay integrity over the intended timeline for automated robotic screening, reagent stability over time was assessed by running the assay at multiple time points while storing the working reagents at 4\u00b0 C. Reagents remained stable for almost 2 days of storage, considerably beyond the overnight period needed for a robotic screen.","To further validate the present assay in a real 1536-well based HTS context, the LOPACLibrary of Pharmacologically Active Compounds was screened in qHTS mode as eight-point concentration series. The pilot screen performed robustly, yielding average Z\u2032 factor (Zhang et al., 4:67-73 (1999)) of 0.71.
