DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/112,716 (referred to as \u201cthe '716 application\u201d and incorporated herein by reference), filed on Apr. 22, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,229,957, titled \u201cCATEGORIZING OBJECTS, SUCH AS DOCUMENTS AND\/OR CLUSTERS, WITH RESPECT TO A TAXONOMY AND DATA STRUCTURES DERIVED FROM SUCH CATEGORIZATION,\u201d and listing David GEHRKING, Ching LAW and Andrew MAXWELL, as the inventors.","\u00a71.1 Field of the Invention","The present invention concerns organizing information. In particular, the present invention concerns categorizing terms, phrases, documents and\/or term co-occurrence clusters with respect to a taxonomy and using such categorized documents and\/or clusters.","\u00a71.2 Background Information","A \u201ctaxonomy\u201d is a structured, usually hierarchical, set of categories or classes (or the principles underlying the categorization or classification). Taxonomies are useful because they can be used to express relationships between various things (referred to simply as \u201cobjects\u201d). For example, taxonomies can be used to determine whether different objects \u201cbelong\u201d together or to determine how closely different objects are related.","Unfortunately, assigning objects to the appropriate category or categories of a taxonomy can be difficult. This is particularly true if different types of objects are to be assigned to the taxonomy. Also, this is particularly true if attributes of the objects, used for categorization, can change over time, or if many objects are being added and\/or removed from a universe of objects to be categorized. For example, Websites are continuously being added and removed from the World Wide Web. Further, the content of Websites often changes. Thus, categorizing Websites can be challenging.","In view of the foregoing, it would be useful to provide automated means for assigning objects (e.g., Websites), and possibly different types of objects, to appropriate categories of a taxonomy.","At least some embodiments consistent with the present invention may automatically categorize a Website. Such embodiments may do so by (a) accepting Website information, (b) determining a set of scored clusters (e.g., semantic, term co-occurrence, etc.) for the Website using the Website information, and (c) determining at least one category (e.g., a vertical category) of a predefined taxonomy using at least some of the set of clusters.","At least some embodiments consistent with the present invention may associate a semantic cluster (e.g., a term co-occurrence cluster) with one or more categories (e.g., vertical categories) of a predefined taxonomy. Such embodiments may do so by (a) accepting a semantic cluster, (b) identifying a set of a one or more scored concepts using the accepted cluster, (c) identifying a set of one or more categories using at least some of the one or more scored concepts, and (d) associating at least some of the one or more categories with the semantic cluster.","At least some embodiments consistent with the present invention may associate a property (e.g., a Website) with one or more categories (e.g., vertical categories) of a predefined taxonomy. Such embodiments may do so by (a) accepting information about the property, (b) identifying a set of a one or more scored semantic clusters (e.g., term co-occurrence clusters) using the accepted property information, (c) identifying a set of one or more categories (e.g., vertical categories) using at least some of the one or more scored semantic clusters, and (d) associating at least some of the one or more categories with the property.","The present invention may involve novel methods, apparatus, message formats for categorizing objects, such as words, phrases, documents, and\/or clusters for example, with respect to a taxonomy and data structures derived from such categorization. The following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements. Thus, the following description of embodiments consistent with the present invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the precise form disclosed. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles set forth below may be applied to other embodiments and applications. For example, although a series of acts may be described with reference to a flow diagram, the order of acts may differ in other implementations when the performance of one act is not dependent on the completion of another act. Further, non-dependent acts may be performed in parallel. No element, act or instruction used in the description should be construed as critical or essential to the present invention unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items. Where only one item is intended, the term \u201cone\u201d or similar language is used. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown and the inventors regard their invention as any patentable subject matter described.","In the following, definitions that may be used in the specification are provided in \u00a74.1. Then, exemplary embodiments consistent with the present invention are described in \u00a74.2. An example illustrating operations in an exemplary embodiment consistent with the present invention is provided in \u00a74.3. Finally, some conclusions regarding the present invention are set forth in \u00a74.4.","\u00a74.1 Definitions","A \u201cproperty\u201d is something on which ads can be presented. A property may include online content (e.g., a Website, an MP3 audio program, online games, etc.), offline content (e.g., a newspaper, a magazine, a theatrical production, a concert, a sports event, etc.), and\/or offline objects (e.g., a billboard, a stadium score board, and outfield wall, the side of truck trailer, etc.). Properties with content (e.g., magazines, newspapers, Websites, email messages, etc.) may be referred to as \u201cmedia properties.\u201d Although properties may themselves be offline, pertinent information about a property (e.g., attribute(s), topic(s), concept(s), category(ies), keyword(s), relevancy information, type(s) of ads supported, etc.) may be available online. For example, an outdoor jazz music festival may have entered the topics \u201cmusic\u201d and \u201cjazz\u201d, the location of the concerts, the time of the concerts, artists scheduled to appear at the festival, and types of available ad spots (e.g., spots in a printed program, spots on a stage, spots on seat backs, audio announcements of sponsors, etc.).","A \u201cdocument\u201d is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may be a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, etc. The files may be of any type, such as text, HTML, XML, audio, image, video, etc. Parts of a document to be rendered to an end user can be thought of as \u201ccontent\u201d of the document. A document may include \u201cstructured data\u201d containing both content (words, pictures, etc.) and some indication of the meaning of that content (for example, e-mail fields and associated data, HTML tags and associated data, etc.). Ad spots in the document may be defined by embedded information or instructions. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a Web page. Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and\/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript, etc.). In many cases, a document has a unique, addressable, storage location and can therefore be uniquely identified by this addressable location. A universal resource locator (URL) is a unique address used to access information on the Internet. Another example of a document is a Website including a number of related (e.g., linked) Web pages. Yet another example of a document is an advertisement.","A \u201cWeb document\u201d includes any document published on the Web. Examples of Web documents include, for example, a Website or a Web page.","\u201cDocument information\u201d may include any information included in the document, information derivable from information included in the document (referred to as \u201cdocument derived information\u201d), and\/or information related to the document (referred to as \u201cdocument related information\u201d), as well as extensions of such information (e.g., information derived from related information). An example of document derived information is a classification based on textual content of a document. Examples of document related information include document information from other documents with links to the instant document, as well as document information from other documents to which the instant document links.","\u201cVerticals\u201d are groups of related products, services, industries, content formats, audience demographics, and\/or topics that are likely to be found in, or for, Website content.","A \u201ccluster\u201d is a group of elements that tend to occur closely together. For example, a cluster may be a set of terms that tend to co-occur often (e.g., on Web pages, in search queries, in product catalogs, in articles (online or offline) in speech, in discussion or e-mail threads, etc.).","A \u201cconcept\u201d is a bearer of meaning (as opposed to an agent of meaning, such as a particular word in a particular language). Thus, for example, a single concept can be expressed by any number of languages, or in alternative ways in a given language. For example, the words STOP, HALT, ANSCHLAG, ARRESTO and PARADA all belong to the same concept. Concepts are abstract in that they omit the differences of the things in their extension, treating them as if they were identical. Concepts are universal in that they apply equally to everything in their extension.","A \u201ctaxonomy\u201d is a structured, usually hierarchical (but may be flat), set of categories or classes (or the principles underlying the categorization or classification). A \u201ccategory\u201d may correspond to a \u201cnode\u201d of the taxonomy.","A \u201cscore\u201d can be any numerical value assigned to an object. Thus, a score can include a number determined by a formula, which may be referred to as a \u201cformulaic score\u201d. A score can include a ranking of an object in an ordered set of objects, which may be referred to as an \u201cordinal score\u201d.","\u00a74.2 Exemplary Embodiments Consistent with the Present Invention",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","105","115","115","110","120","105","122","122"]},"Concept generation\/identification operations  may accept clusters  or  and generate cluster-concept information (e.g., an index) . Once such information  has been generated, the concept generation\/identification operations  can be used to identify one or more concepts  in response to input clusters  or . Filtering\/data reduction operations  may be used to generate a subset of \u201cbetter\u201d concepts .","Category generation\/identification operations  may accept concepts  or  and generate concept-category information (e.g., an index) . Once such information  has been generated, the category generation\/identification operations  can be used to identify one or more categories  in response to input concepts  or . These categories may be nodes of a taxonomy. Category filtering\/reduction operations  may be used to generate a subset of \u201cbetter\u201d categories .","There are many examples of terms in context . For example, terms in context may be words and\/or phrases included in a search query, and\/or of a search session including one or more search queries. As another example, terms in context may be words and\/or phrases found in a document (e.g., a Web page) or a collection or group of documents (e.g., a Website). As yet another example, terms in context may be words and\/or phrases in the creative of an advertisement.","Referring back to term co-occurrence based cluster generation\/identification operations , co-occurrence of terms in some context or contexts (e.g., search queries, search sessions, Web pages, Websites, articles, blogs, discussion threads, etc.) may be used to generate groups or clusters of words. Once these clusters are defined, a word-to-cluster index may be stored. Using such an index, given a word or words, one or more clusters which include the words can be identified. An example of operations used to generate and\/or identify such clusters is a probabilistic hierarchical inferential learner (referred to as \u201cPHIL\u201d), such as described in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/416,144 (referred to as \u201cthe '144 provisional\u201d and incorporated herein by reference), titled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Probabilistic Hierarchical Inferential Learner,\u201d filed on Oct. 3, 2002, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/676,571 (referred to as \u201cthe '571 application\u201d and incorporated herein by reference), titled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Characterizing Documents Based on Cluster Related Words,\u201d filed on Sep. 30, 2003 and listing Georges Harik and Noam Shazeer as inventors.","One exemplary embodiment of PHIL is a system of interrelated clusters of terms that tend to occur together in www.google.com search sessions. A term within such a cluster may be weighted by how statistically important it is to the cluster. Such clusters can have from a few terms, to thousands of terms. One embodiment of the PHIL model contains hundreds of thousands of clusters and covers all languages in proportion to their search frequency. Clusters may be assigned attributes, such as STOP (e.g., containing mostly words such as \u201cthe,\u201d \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d etc, that convey little meaning), PORN, NEGATIVE (containing words that often appear in negative, depressing, or sensitive articles such as \u201cbomb,\u201d \u201csuicide,\u201d etc.), and LOCATION, etc., to be used by applications (e.g., online ad serving systems). In another embodiment of PHIL, a model is maintained for each language which simplifies maintenance and updating.","A PHIL server can take a document (e.g., a Webpage) as an input and return clusters that \u201cmatch\u201d the content. It can also take an ad creative and\/or targeting keywords as input and return matching clusters. Thus, it can be used to match ads to the content of Webpages.","Referring back to concept generation\/identification operations  and the category generation\/identification operations , these operations can accept one or more clusters and identify one or more categories (e.g., nodes) of a taxonomy. When used in concert with term co-occurrence cluster identification operations , these operations  and  can accept one or more terms and identify one or more categories of a taxonomy.","An example of operations  and  used to generate and\/or identify categories is a semantic recognition engine, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,453,315 (incorporated herein by reference), titled \u201cMeaning-Based Information Organization and Retrieval\u201d and listing Adam Weissman and Gilad Isreal Elbaz as inventors; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,816,857 (incorporated herein by reference), titled \u201cMeaning-Based Advertising and Document Relevant Determination\u201d and listing Adam Weissman and Gilad Israel Elbaz as inventors;","An exemplary semantic recognition engine (referred to as \u201cCircadia\u201d below) can examine a document and categorize it into any taxonomy. Circadia includes a proprietary ontology of hundreds of thousands of interrelated concepts and corresponding terms. The concepts in the Circadia ontology are language-independent. Terms, which are language-specific, are related to these concepts. A Circadia server supports two major operations\u2014\u201csensing\u201d and \u201cseeking.\u201d The sensing operation accepts, as input, a document or a string of text and returns, as output, a weighted set of concepts (referred to as a \u201cgist\u201d) for the input. Thus, the sensing operation in Circadia is an example of concept identification operations . This gist can then be used as a seek request input. In response, the best categories and their respective semantic scores in the specified taxonomy are returned. Thus, the seeking operation in Circadia is an example of category identification operations  (and perhaps category filtering\/reduction operations ). Naturally, other taxonomies such as the Open Directory Project (\u201cODP\u201d) taxonomy, the Standard Industrial Classification (\u201cSIC\u201d) taxonomy, etc., may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["220","210","230","220","130","135","130","220","220","150","155","150","220","210","220","230"]},"As shown, in at least one embodiment consistent with the present invention, the information  may be a table including a plurality of entries .

The cluster may be a set of terms that tend to co-occur in documents.","Referring back to block , concepts may be filtered and\/or reduced by, for example, scoring them, applying the concept scores to one or more thresholds (absolute and\/or relative), taking only the top N scoring concepts, or any combination of the foregoing. Similarly, referring back to block , categories may be filtered and\/or reduced by, for example, scoring them, applying the category scores to one or more thresholds (absolute and\/or relative), taking only the top M scoring concepts, or any combination of the foregoing.","As indicated by the bracket, acts - may be combined into a single act of identifying one or more categories using the accepted cluster. However, Circadia is designed to categorize using a \u201csense\u201d operation followed by a \u201cseek\u201d operation. One advantage of first identifying concepts from clusters, and then identifying categories from the concepts, rather than just going directly from clusters to categories, is that if intermediate concepts (\u201cgists\u201d) are stored, they can be used directly to classify into any of a number of the available taxonomies without needing to repeat the sense operation. That is, once a concept has been determined, it is easy to get to terms, categories, other concepts, etc.","Referring back to block , a cluster may be associated with one or more categories by generating and storing an index which maps a cluster (identifier) to one or more categories (identifiers). Alternatively, or in addition, an inverted index, which maps a category (identifier) to one or more clusters (identifiers) may be generated and stored.","Referring back to block , a cluster may be refined to include only the top T (e.g., 50) terms (e.g., based on inter-cluster scoring, and\/or intra-cluster scoring). Here, intra-cluster scoring may increase as the number of times the term appears in the cluster increases and may decrease as the number of times the term appears in a document (e.g., Webpages, search queries, search sessions) collection increases. Thus, the intra-cluster score may be defined as, for example, count_in_cluster\/count_in_search_query_collection. In addition, the number (T) of top terms for each cluster may be determined based on an intra-cluster firing rather than the same fixed number of terms for each cluster. Cluster scorings used in the '571 application may also be used.","Referring back to blocks - of , in at least one exemplary embodiment consistent with the present invention, concepts can be determined from clusters using a Circadia server as follows.","Referring back to block  of , the first step in categorization using Circadia is to do a \u201csense\u201d operation, which returns a \u201cgist.\u201d The gist is the internal weighted set of concept matches from the Circadia ontology. Thus, a gist (e.g., based on the 50 terms) for each cluster is obtained.","Referring back to blocks  and  of , the second step involves doing a \u201cseek\u201d operation to request the top N (e.g., N=2) categories and corresponding semantic scores from a specified taxonomy, given a gist.","In at least one exemplary embodiment consistent with the present invention, the top two categories and their corresponding semantic scores are requested from the seek operation. In such an exemplary embodiment(s), these top two categories are referred to as the \u201cprimary\u201d category (for the top scoring one) and \u201csecondary\u201d category for each cluster. If Circadia doesn't determine any category for a cluster, the cluster receives primary and secondary categories of \u201cNONE\u201d. If Circadia only determines a primary category, but not a secondary category, the secondary category is set to \u201cNONE\u201d.","Referring back to block , at least one embodiment consistent with the present invention filters out categories with scores that are less than a threshold. The threshold may be a predetermined threshold. Further, the threshold may be set lower if there are more terms in the original cluster which, in effect, considers the number of terms in each cluster as a kind of measurement of statistical significance for the Circadia call. For example, if a cluster has more than M (e.g., 50) terms, then one can be more confident that using just the top 50 of them would provide a good representative sample, which allows the threshold to be relaxed. If, however, a cluster has fewer than M terms, it may be advisable to raise the threshold because the sample of terms is smaller and may include less meaningful terms of the cluster.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["600","600","320","600","600","610","620","630","640","650","660","670","680","600","690"]},"Referring back to block , the document may be a Webpage, content extracted from a Webpage, a portion of a Webpage (e.g., anchor text of a reference or link), a Website, a portion of a Website, creative text of an ad, etc.","Referring back to block , clusters may be filtered and\/or reduced by, for example, scoring them, applying the cluster scores to one or more thresholds (absolute and\/or relative), taking only the top N scoring clusters, or any combination of the foregoing.

Similarly, clusters with the LOCATION attribute may be assigned to a \u201c\/Local Services\/City & Regional Guides\/LOC (Locations)\u201d category, even if the automatically determined category is different. Such clusters may be manually generated, manually revised, and\/or manually reviewed.","\u00a74.2.3.3 Extracting Website-Cluster Mappings and Scores from the Content-Relevant AD Serving Logs","Referring back to term-cluster information (index)  of , a weighted set of clusters may be generated for Websites (e.g., Websites participating in a content-relevant ad serving network, such as AdSense from Google of Mountain View, Calif.) as follows.","A log record may be generated for each pageview for a Webpage displaying (e.g., AdSense) ads. The set of scored (PHIL) clusters for the Webpage may be recorded with that log record. For a given Webpage, there may be a plurality (e.g., between one and dozens) of clusters, and each cluster has an associated activation score. (See, e.g., the '571 application which describes \u201cactivation\u201d.) The activation score is a measurement of how conceptually significant the given cluster is to the document being analyzed. Lower valued activation scores indicate a lower conceptual significance and higher valued activation scores indicate a higher conceptual significance.","\u00a74.2.3.4 Determining the Set of Scored Clusters for Each Website","Clusters that do not have an activation score of at least a predetermined value (e.g., 1.0) for the Webpage (as discussed above) can be ignored. (Recall, e.g., operations  of .) The predetermined value may be set to a minimum threshold used by the ad serving system in serving ads. Certain special case clusters (e.g., those marked as STOP) may also be ignored.","Of the remaining clusters (referred to as \u201cqualifying clusters\u201d), the sum of activation scores of these clusters may be determined. Each qualifying cluster for the Webpage gets a \u201cscore.\u201d The cluster score may be defined as the product of (a) the qualifying cluster's activation score on the Webpage and (b) the number of pageviews that the Webpage received.","The following example illustrates how qualified clusters may be scored as just described above. Suppose that a given cluster cis activated on two Webpages within a Website. Assume that the cluster has an activation score of 10.0 on Webpage pand an activation score of 20.0 on Webpage p. During the course of a week, Webpage preceives 1000 pageviews and Webpage preceives 1500 pageviews. The sum of the cluster score and pageview products for a Website for the week is 100,000. The cluster would then receive the following overall score for the website:\n\nSCORE=((10.0 activation\/pageview*1000 pageviews)+(20.0 activation\/pageview*1500 pageviews))\/100,000 activation\n\n=(10,000+30,000)\/100,000\n\n=0.4\n\nThis effectively weights the total cluster scores for a Website by both pageviews and activation scores on individual Webpages of the Website. The set of cluster scores for a Website will sum to 1. One disadvantage of this approach is that higher traffic for a given Webpage does not necessarily mean that that Webpage is more representative, from a categorization standpoint, than a lower traffic Webpage. Thus, it may be desirable to temper the pageviews parameter and\/or give a higher weight to the cluster Webpage activation score. Naturally, activation scores may be weighted as a function of one or more factors which are reasonable in the context in which an embodiment consistent with the present invention is being used.\n","After a set of scored clusters for a Website is obtained, the number of clusters can be reduced by selecting only the top S (e.g., 25) highest-scoring clusters (all clusters for Websites that have fewer than S clusters). This set may be further reduced by keeping only the highest scoring clusters that make up the top Y % (e.g., 70%) of the identified set in terms of score.","The scores of the remaining clusters may be normalized so that they sum to 1.","\u00a74.2.3.5 Determining the \u201cBest\u201d Categories for Each Website","Referring back to operations  of , a reduced set of categories (e.g., primary and secondary categories) may be determined for each Website. The categories  serving as an input to this operation may be a pared down set of scored categorizes (associated with PHIL clusters\u2014referred to as \u201ccluster categories\u201d in the following) for a Website (already described above). Typically, in one exemplary embodiment consistent with the present invention, there will be a final set of about ten (10) cluster categories per Website. There is usually an overlap of cluster categories, but it is possible for each cluster to have completely different categories.","In one embodiment consistent with the present invention, the categories are part of a hierarchical taxonomy that includes up to Z (e.g., 5) levels per branch. In such an embodiment, besides deciding among different \u201cbranches\u201d of the taxonomy, the best level along a branch is also determined. For example, it might be clear that the category should be somewhere in the \u201c\/Automotive\u201d branch, but the question is which of \u201c\/Automotive\u201d, \u201c\/Automotive\/Auto Parts\u201d, \u201c\/Automotive\/Auto Parts\/Vehicle Tires\u201d, or \u201c\/Automotive\/Vehicle Maintenance\u201d is the best one. The score for each input cluster contributes to the significance of its corresponding primary and secondary cluster categories to the overall categorization of the website.","Regardless of how many cluster categories are competing with each other for a Website categorization, it is possible that none of them has enough conceptual significance (e.g., as measured by the sum of scores for that category) to merit being chosen. In other words, the possible categories could be too diluted among the Website for any single one to \u201cwin\u201d. In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, this minimum conceptual significance may be enforced as a requirement by setting a threshold value (e.g., stored as a floating point decimal). Assuming that the cluster scores for a given Website are normalized to sum to 1, in at least some embodiments, a minimum conceptual significance threshold value of 0.24, or about 0.24, may generate good results. This means that if the best candidate for the primary or secondary category has a summed score of less than 0.24, a category of \u201cNONE\u201d will be assigned. Note that this threshold value can be adjusted based on the method used to score clusters on a Website.","In at least some embodiments, it may be desirable to omit the secondary cluster categories to categorize Websites instead of using both the primary and secondary cluster categories to categorize Websites.","The following terminology is used in a description of the exemplary embodiment below. Given a hierarchical category path of the form \/level-\/level-\/ . . . \/level-m, where m is the number of the deepest level in the path, \u201csubsume-level-n\u201d refers to the subsumption of the path up to level-n if n<m, and no subsumption of the path if n>=m. For example, for a case where n<m, the subsume-level- of the category path \u201c\/Automotive\/Auto Parts\/Vehicle Tires\u201d is \u201c\/Automotive\/Auto Parts\/\u201d. As another example, for a case where n>=m, the subsume-level- of \u201c\/Automotive\/Auto Parts\/Vehicle Tires\u201d is just \u201c\/Automotive\/Auto Parts\/Vehicle Tires\u201d itself with no modification.","Note that the level-n category will include its own intra-category cluster score(s), as well as those of any subsumed, deeper layer, categories. The sum of these cluster scores is referred to as the \u201cself&subsumed category cluster score\u201d (or \u201cS&S category cluster score\u201d) for the level-n category.","Regardless of how many categories are competing with each other for a document (e.g., Website) categorization, it is possible that none of them has enough conceptual significance, measured by the S&S category cluster score, to merit being chosen. In other words, the clusters for a Website could be too diluted among the possible categories for any one category to be considered as the clearly the best category for the Website.","In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, a minimum conceptual significance requirement may be imposed through the setting of a threshold value. Naturally, it's easier to get categories that pass the threshold at higher subsume-levels because they correspond to more general categories. In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, the threshold value is chosen to maximize the overall quality across the various subsume-levels, but biased slightly toward the lower subsume-levels since categorization subsume-level scores will necessarily be lower at lower levels than at higher levels, even though such categories might be the most appropriate.","In one exemplary embodiment consistent with the present invention, a minimum conceptual significance threshold value of about 0.24 worked well, assuming that the cluster scores for a given website sum to 1 (as detailed above) and a five layer category taxonomy with on the order of 500 nodes is used. It is believed that a minimum conceptual significance threshold value from 0.20 to 0.30 should work well. This means that if the best candidate for the primary or secondary category at a given subsume-level has a summed score of less than the threshold, a category of \u201cNONE\u201d will be assigned. Note that determining an appropriate threshold value may depend on the method that was used to score clusters on the document being categorized.","Having introduced some terminology, an exemplary method for determining the \u201cbest\u201d categorizes for a document, in a manner consistent with the present invention, is now described. Let t be the minimum conceptual significance threshold value. Let d be the deepest level in the taxonomy. The \u201cbest\u201d primary category may be determined as follows. The best subsume-level- and its corresponding S&S category cluster score are determined. This is repeated for all levels up to level d. The greatest (deepest) value of p whose best subsume-level-p category has S&S category cluster score \u2267t is chosen. Alternatively, S&S category cluster scores could be analyzed from the deepest category level to the top (most general) category level. In this way, the method could stop after processing a level in which an S&S category score is \u2267t. Let v (the best primary category) be the best subsume-level-p category, or \u201cNONE\u201d if no category satisfies the threshold.","The \u201cbest\u201d secondary category may be defined as follows. If v, the best primary category, is \u201cNONE\u201d, the best secondary category will be \u201cNONE\u201d. If v is not \u201cNONE\u201d, the best subsume-level- and its corresponding subsume-level--score, where subsume-level- is not equal to v, are determined This is repeated constrained by the restriction of subsume-level-n not being equal to v, for all levels up to level d. The greatest (deepest) value of q whose best subsume-level-q category has an S&S category cluster score >=t is chosen. Let w (the best secondary category) be the best subsume-level-q category, or \u201cNONE\u201d if no category satisfies the threshold.","\u00a74.3 Examples of Operations in an Exemplary Embodiment Consistent with the Present Invention",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIGS. 18-23","FIG. 18","FIG. 13"],"b":["1800","1810","1820","1830"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 14"],"b":["1900","1910","1920","1930"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 21","FIGS. 8 and 12","FIG. 10"],"b":["2000","2010","2100","2110","2120","2010","2120","2122","2124"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 18","FIG. 23","FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"b":["2200","1800","2210","2300","2310","2320","2320","2322","2324"]},"As the foregoing examples illustrate, various indexes can be used, or used in combination (perhaps in different sequences) to obtain related objects of a second type from input objects of a first type.

Once these associations are made, some embodiments consistent with the present invention may be used to find \u201crelated\u201d objects, perhaps of different types, using the associations between objects and categories of a taxonomy. For example, embodiments consistent with the present invention may be used to permit Websites to be categorized into a hierarchical taxonomy of standardized industry vertical categories. Such a hierarchical taxonomy has many potential uses. Further, if different types of objects (e.g., advertisements, queries, Webpages, Websites, etc.) can be categorized, relationships (e.g., similarities) between these different types of objects can be determined and used (e.g., in determining advertisements relevant to a Webpage or Website for example, or vice-versa).","After categorizing clusters and Websites into this taxonomy, other dimensions (e.g., language, country, etc.) may be added (e.g., in the manner of online analytical processing (OLAP) databases and data warehousing star schemas). The category dimension may be defined by hierarchical levels, but some of the other dimensions, like language, could be flat. After deriving these various dimensions, metrics (e.g., pageviews, ad impressions, ad clicks, cost, etc.) may be aggregated into them."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"\u00a73.
