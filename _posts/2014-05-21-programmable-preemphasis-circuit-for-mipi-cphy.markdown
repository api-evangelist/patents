title: Programmable pre-emphasis circuit for MIPI C-PHY
abstract: System, methods and apparatus are described that improve signaling in a three-wire multiphase communication link. A method for data communications includes determining a transition in signaling state of three wires of a communication link between a pair of consecutive symbols transmitted on the communication link, and enhancing or attenuating energy of a signal prior to the transition in signaling state of the three wires when the transition in signaling state includes a change in signaling state of a wire on which the signal is transmitted. Each symbol may define a different signaling state of the three wires of the communication link. For each symbol transmitted, two of the three wires are differentially encoded and the third wire is in a neutral state. Different wires are differentially encoded during transmission of consecutive symbols.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to high-speed data communications interfaces, and more particularly, signaling in multi-wire, multi-phase data communication links.","2. Background","Manufacturers of mobile devices, such as cellular phones, may obtain components of the mobile devices from various sources, including different manufacturers. For example, an application processor in a cellular phone may be obtained from a first manufacturer, while the display for the cellular phone may be obtained from a second manufacturer. The application processor and a display or other device may be interconnected using a standards-based or proprietary physical interface. For example, a display may provide an interface that conforms to the Display System Interface (DSI) standard specified by the Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance (MIPI).","Higher frequency components of a high-speed signal traveling through a channel can be significantly attenuated due to channel bandwidth limitations and the degree of attenuation may correlate to the frequency of the signal. The losses of high frequency components can cause inter-symbol interference (ISI) and can increase jitter. A commonly-used compensation technique employs pre-emphasis at the transmitter, which may also be referred to as feed-forward equalization (FFE). FFE can be employed in single-ended and differential line drivers, but has limited effect on other types of drivers.","In one example, a three-wire interface (C-PHY) defined by MIPI uses a trio of conductors rather than differential pairs to transmit information between devices. Each of the three wires may be in one of three signaling states during transmission of a symbol over the C-PHY interface. Clock information is encoded in a sequence of symbols transmitted on the C-PHY link and a receiver generates a clock signal from transitions between consecutive symbols. In a C-PHY interface, the maximum speed of the communication link and the ability of a clock-data recovery (CDR) circuit to recover clock information may be limited by the maximum time variation related to transitions of signals transmitted on the different wires of the communication link.","Accordingly, there is an ongoing need to improve signaling capabilities of multi-wire interfaces.","Embodiments disclosed herein provide systems, methods and apparatus that enable improved communications on a multi-wire and\/or multiphase communications link. The communications link may be deployed in apparatus such as a mobile terminal having multiple Integrated Circuit (IC) devices.","In an aspect of the disclosure, a method for data communications includes determining a transition in signaling state of three wires of a communication link between a pair of consecutive symbols transmitted on the communication link, and enhancing or attenuating energy of a signal prior to the transition in signaling state of the three wires when the transition in signaling state includes a change in signaling state of a wire on which the signal is transmitted. Each symbol may define a different signaling state of the three wires of the communication link. During transmission of a first symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols, a first wire of the three wires and a second wire of the three wires may be at voltage levels that have different polarities from one another with respect to a reference voltage level. During transmission of a second symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols, the first wire and a third wire of the three wires may be at the voltage levels that have different polarities from one another.","In another aspect, the reference voltage level is defined by the third wire during transmission of the first symbol and the reference voltage level is defined by the second wire during transmission of the second symbol.","In another aspect, the energy of the signal is enhanced when the transition in signaling state of the three wires includes a polarity change of the signal. The energy of the signal may be attenuated when the transition in signaling state of the three wires does not include a polarity change of the signal.","In another aspect, enhancing or attenuating the energy of the signal includes pre-emphasizing the signal by initiating the transmission of the second symbol before the transmission of the first symbol is terminated.","In another aspect, the energy of the signal is enhanced when the change in signaling state of the wire on which the signal is transmitted results in a swing in a difference voltage measured between two of the three wires that exceeds the maximum voltage range of the signal.","In another aspect, the energy of the signal is enhanced or attenuated based on signaling state of all three wires after the transition. The energy of the signal may be enhanced or attenuated based on changes in relative signaling states of each pairing of wires in the three wires. The energy of the signal may be enhanced or attenuated based on changes in the signaling state of all three wires. Enhancing or attenuating energy of a signal may include enabling or disabling a set of driver circuits coupled to the wire on which the signal is transmitted.","In an aspect of the disclosure, an apparatus includes means for determining a transition in signaling state of three wires of a communication link between a pair of consecutive symbols transmitted on the communication link, and means for enhancing or attenuating energy of a signal prior to the transition in signaling state of the three wires when the transition in signaling state includes a change in signaling state of a wire on which the signal is transmitted. Each symbol may define a different signaling state of the three wires of the communication link. A first wire of the three wires and a second wire of the three wires may be at voltage levels that have different polarities from one another with respect to a reference voltage level during transmission of a first symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols. The first wire and a third wire of the three wires may be at the voltage levels that have different polarities from one another during transmission of a second symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols.","In an aspect of the disclosure, an apparatus, includes a processing circuit configured to determine a transition in signaling state of three wires of a communication link between a pair of consecutive symbols transmitted on the communication link, and to enhance or attenuate energy of a signal prior to the transition in signaling state of the three wires when the transition in signaling state includes a change in signaling state of a wire on which the signal is transmitted. Each symbol defines a different signaling state of the three wires of the communication link. During transmission of a first symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols, a first wire of the three wires and a second wire of the three wires may be at voltage levels that have different polarities from one another with respect to a reference voltage level. During transmission of a second symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols, the first wire and a third wire of the three wires may be at the voltage levels that have different polarities from one another.","In an aspect of the disclosure, a processor-readable storage medium has one or more instructions stored or maintained thereon. The instructions, when executed by at least one processing circuit, cause the at least one processing circuit to determine a transition in signaling state of three wires of a communication link between a pair of consecutive symbols transmitted on the communication link, and enhance or attenuate energy of a signal prior to the transition in signaling state of the three wires when the transition in signaling state includes a change in signaling state of a wire on which the signal is transmitted. Each symbol defines a different signaling state of the three wires of the communication link. During transmission of a first symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols, a first wire of the three wires and a second wire of the three wires are at voltage levels that have different polarities from one another with respect to a reference voltage level. During transmission of a second symbol in the pair of consecutive symbols, the first wire and a third wire of the three wires are at the voltage levels that have different polarities from one another.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects.

One or more channel  may be bidirectional, and may operate in half-duplex and\/or full-duplex modes. One or more channel  and  may be unidirectional. The communication link  may be asymmetrical, providing higher bandwidth in one direction. In one example described herein, a first communications channel  may be referred to as a forward link  while a second communications channel  may be referred to as a reverse link . The first IC device  may be designated as a host system or transmitter, while the second IC device  may be designated as a client system or receiver, even if both IC devices  and  are configured to transmit and receive on the communications link . In one example, the forward link  may operate at a higher data rate when communicating data from a first IC device  to a second IC device , while the reverse link  may operate at a lower data rate when communicating data from the second IC device  to the first IC device .","The IC devices  and  may each include a processor or other processing and\/or computing circuit or device , . In one example, the first IC device  may perform core functions of the apparatus , including maintaining wireless communications through a wireless transceiver  and an antenna , while the second IC device  may support a user interface that manages or operates a display controller , and may control operations of a camera or video input device using a camera controller .

Communication between each processor ,  and its corresponding storage media  and  and other modules and circuits may be facilitated by one or more internal bus  and  and\/or a channel ,  and\/or  of the communication link .","The reverse link  may be operated in the same manner as the forward link , and the forward link , and reverse link  may be capable of transmitting at comparable speeds or at different speeds, where speed may be expressed as data transfer rate and\/or clocking rates. The forward and reverse data rates may be substantially the same or differ by orders of magnitude, depending on the application.

The M wires may be configured to carry N-phase encoded data in a high-speed digital interface, such as a mobile display digital interface (MDDI). The M wires may facilitate N-phase polarity encoding on one or more of the channels ,  and . The physical layer drivers  and  may be configured or adapted to generate N-phase polarity encoded data for transmission on the communication link . The use of N-phase polarity encoding provides high speed data transfer and may consume half or less of the power of other interfaces because fewer drivers are active in N-phase polarity encoded data communication links .","The physical layer derivers  and\/or  (e.g., N-phase polarity encoding devices) can typically encode multiple bits per transition on the communication link . In one example, a combination of 3-phase encoding and polarity encoding may be used to support a wide video graphics array (WVGA) 80 frames per second LCD driver IC without a frame buffer, delivering pixel data at 810 Mbps for display refresh.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","220"]},"Signaling states defined for each of the 3 wires in a 3-wire, 3-phase polarity encoding scheme may include an undriven state, a positively driven state and a negatively driven state. The positively driven state and the negatively driven state may be obtained by providing a voltage differential between two of the signal wires , and\/or (also referred to as connectors and\/or conductors), and\/or by driving a current through two of the signal wires , and\/or connected in series such that the current flows in different directions in the two signal wires , and\/or . The undriven state may be realized by placing an output of a driver of a signal wire , or in a high-impedance mode. Alternatively, or additionally, an undriven state may be obtained on a signal wire , or by passively or actively causing an \u201cundriven\u201d signal wire , or to attain a voltage level that lies substantially halfway between positive and negative voltage levels provided on driven signal wires , and\/or . Typically, there is no significant current flow through an undriven signal wire , or . Signaling states defined for a 3-wire, 3-phase polarity encoding scheme may be denoted using the three voltage or current states (+1, \u22121, and 0).","A 3-wire, 3-phase polarity encoder may employ line drivers  to control the signaling state of connectors , and . The drivers  may be implemented as unit-level current-mode or voltage-mode drivers. In one example, each driver  may receive sets of two or more of signals , and that determine the output state of corresponding connectors , and . In one example, the sets of two signals , and may include a pull-up signal (PU signal) and a pull-down signal (PD signal) that, when high, activate pull-up and pull down circuits that drive the connectors , and toward a higher level or lower level voltage, respectively. In this example, when both the PU signal and the PD signal are low, the connectors , and may be terminated to a mid-level voltage.","For each transmitted symbol interval in an M-wire, N-phase polarity encoding scheme, at least one signal wire , or is in the midlevel\/undriven (0) voltage or current state, while the number of positively driven (+1 voltage or current state) signal wires , or is equal to the number of negatively driven (\u22121 voltage or current state) signal wires , or , such that the sum of current flowing to the receiver is always zero. For each symbol, the state of at least one signal wire , or is changed from the symbol transmitted in the preceding transmission interval.","In operation, a mapper  may receive and map 16 bit data  to 7 symbols . In the 3-wire example, each of the 7 symbols defines the states of the signal wires , and for one symbol interval. The 7 symbols  may be serialized using parallel-to-serial converters  that provide a timed sequence of states  for each wire , and . The sequence of states  is typically timed using a transmission clock. A 3-wire 3-phase encoder  receives the sequence of states  representing the sequence of 7 symbols  produced by the mapper  one symbol at a time and computes the state of each signal wire , and for each symbol interval. The 3-wire encoder  selects the states of the signal wires , and based on a current input symbol and the previous states of signal wires , and ","The use of M-wire, N-phase encoding permits a number of bits to be encoded in a plurality of symbols where the bits per symbol is not an integer. In the simple example of a 3-wire communications link, there are 3 available combinations of 2 wires, which may be driven simultaneously, and 2 possible combinations of polarity on the pair of wires that is driven, yielding 6 possible states. Since each transition occurs from a current state, 5 of the 6 states are available at every transition. The state of at least one wire is required to change at each transition. With 5 states, log(5)\u22452.32 bits may be encoded per symbol. Accordingly, a mapper may accept a 16-bit word and convert it to 7 symbols because 7 symbols carrying 2.32 bits per symbol can encode 16.24 bits. In other words, a combination of seven symbols that encode five states has 5(78,125) permutations. Accordingly, the 7 symbols may be used to encode the 2(65,536) permutations of 16 bits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","450","450","452","452","454","454","452","454","454","454","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310"],"sub":["1","2 ","3 ","1 ","2","2 ","3 ","3 ","1","1 ","3","3 ","2 ","2 ","1"],"i":["a","b ","c ","a","b ","c ","a","b ","c ","a","b ","c ","a","b ","c "]},"Information may be encoded in the direction of rotation at each phase transition , and the 3-phase signal may change direction for each signaling state. Direction of rotation may be determined by considering which wires , and\/or are in the \u20180\u2019 state before and after a phase transition, because the undriven wire , and\/or changes at every signaling state in a rotating three-phase signal, regardless of the direction of rotation.","The encoding scheme may also encode information in the polarity  of the two conductors , and\/or that are actively driven. At any time in a 3-wire implementation, exactly two of the conductors , , are driven with currents in opposite directions and\/or with a voltage differential. In a simple implementation, data may be encoded using two bit values , where one bit is encoded in the direction of phase transitions  and the second bit is encoded in the polarity  for the current state.","The timing chart  illustrates data encoding using both phase rotation direction and polarity. The curves ,  and  relate to signals carried on three wires , and , respectively for multiple phase states. Initially, the phase transitions  are in a clockwise direction and the most significant bit is set to binary \u20181,\u2019 until the rotation of phase transitions  switches at a time  to a counterclockwise direction, as represented by a binary \u20180\u2019 of the most significant bit. The least significant bit reflects the polarity  of the signal in each state.","According to certain aspects disclosed herein, one bit of data may be encoded in the rotation, or phase change in a 3-wire, 3-phase encoding system, and an additional bit may be encoded in the polarity of the two driven wires. Additional information may be encoded in each transition of a 3-wire, 3-phase encoding system by allowing transition to any of the possible states from a current state. Given 3 rotational phases and two polarities for each phase, 6 states are available in a 3-wire, 3-phase encoding system. Accordingly, 5 states are available from any current state. Accordingly, there may be log(5)\u22452.32 bits encoded per symbol (transition), which allows the mapper  to accept a 16-bit word and encode it in 7 symbols.","N-Phase data transfer may use more than three wires provided in a communication medium, such as a bus. The use of additional signal wires that can be driven simultaneously provides more combinations of states and polarities and allows more bits of data to be encoded at each transition between states. This can significantly improve throughput of the system, and reduce the power consumption over approaches that use multiple differential pairs to transmit data bits, while providing increased bandwidth.","In one example, an encoder may transmit symbols using 6 wires with 2 pairs of wires driven for each state. The 6 wires may be labeled A through F, such that in one state, wires A and F are driven positive, wires B and E negative, and C and D are undriven (or carry no current). For six wires, there may be:\n\n(6,4)=6!\/(6\u22124)!\u00b74!=15\n\npossible combinations of actively driven wires, with:\n\n(4,2)=4!\/(4\u22122)!\u00b72!=6\n\ndifferent combinations of polarity for each phase state.\n","The 15 different combinations of actively driven wires may include:","ABCD ABCE ABCF ABDE ABDF","ABEF ACDE ACDF ACEF ADEF","BCDE BCDF BCEF BDEF CDEF","Of the 4 wires driven, the possible combinations of two wires driven positive (and the other two must be negative). The combinations of polarity may include:","++\u2212\u2212 +\u2212\u2212+ +\u2212+\u2212 \u2212+\u2212+ \u2212++\u2212 \u2212\u2212++","Accordingly, the total number of different states may be calculated as 15\u00d76=90. To guarantee a transition between symbols, 89 states are available from any current state, and the number of bits that may be encoded in each symbol may be calculated as: log(89)\u22456.47 bits per symbol. In this example, a 32-bit word can be encoded by the mapper into 5 symbols, given that 5\u00d76.47=32.35 bits.","The general equation for the number of combinations of wires that can be driven for a bus of any size, as a function of the number of wires in the bus and number of wires simultaneously driven:\n\n()=!\/()!\u00b7!\n","The equation for the number of combinations of polarity for the wires being driven is:\n\n(\/2)=!\/((\/2)!)\n","The equivalent number of bits per symbol is:\n\nlog(()\u00b7(\/2)\u22121)\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","512","512","512","506","508","508","510"],"i":["a","b ","c"]},"The wire state decoder  may extract a sequence of symbols  from phase encoded signals received on the wires , and .

In the timing chart , transitions between some symbols may result in variable capture windows , , , , , and\/or (collectively symbol capture windows ) during which symbols may be reliably captured. The number of state changes detected and their relative timing can result in jitter on the clock signal .","Variability in the sizes of the symbol windows  and jitter may be caused in part by the electrical characteristics of the wires , and , as illustrated in the simple example  depicted in . The throughput of a C-PHY communications link may be affected by duration and variability in signal transition times. For example, variability in detection circuits may be caused by manufacturing process tolerances, variations and stability of voltage and current sources and operating temperature. Certain impediments to accomplishing higher data rates are attributable to channel bandwidth and its increased effect on higher frequency components of digital signals. For example, attenuation of the higher frequencies can affect signal rise and fall times. In conventional line drivers, pre-emphasis circuits may be provided whereby the pre-emphasis circuits operate to increase the detection of transitions at the receiver. Some pre-emphasis circuits may affect the timing of signals by initiating a transition early or terminating a transition late. Other pre-emphasis circuits may increase the current flow provided by the driver during transitions. However, these pre-emphasis techniques may not be applicable in C-PHY interfaces.","In particular, large variability in signal transition times can be attributed to the existence of multiple different voltage or current levels used in 3-phase signaling.
