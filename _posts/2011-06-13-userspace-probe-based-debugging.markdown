title: User-space probe based debugging
abstract: Methods and systems for user-space probe debugging are described. In one embodiment, a computing system receives a request from a user interface to debug a target application. In response to the request, the computing system runs the target application in a debug mode with an attached debugger. The debugger and the target application appear as a single application in a user-space of the computing system. The debugger has access to application memory of the target application. The computing system receives a command to perform a debug operation on the target application, such as setting a breakpoint, reading the application memory, or the like. The debugger performs the debug operation on the target application without communicating with a kernel of the computing system, and outputs debug information after performing the debug operation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate to debugging, and more specifically, to user-space probe based debugging.","Debugging is a methodical process of finding and reducing the number of bugs, or defects, in a computer program, thus making it behave as expected. Debugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates. The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language(s) used and the available tools, such as debuggers. Debuggers are software tools which enable the programmer to monitor the execution of a program, stop it, restart it, set breakpoints, and change values in memory. More specifically, the debugger is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs, sometimes called target programs. The term debugger can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging.","Conventional debuggers interact with the kernel in order to stop the application, restart the application, set breakpoints, and to access application memory. Some kernels include a kernel debugger, which resides in the kernel and operates in kernel-space, like a stub implementing low-level operations that interacts with a debugger, such as GNU Debugger (GDB) or DBX. The debugger may run on a separate machine than the kernel debugger, sending commands to the stub over a serial line or a network connection. For example, conventional debuggers, such as GDB and DBX, use kernel ptrace support to interact with the kernel to debug an application. Ptrace, which is short for process trace, is a system call found in various operating systems. By using ptrace, one process can control another, enabling the controller (i.e., the debugger) to inspect and manipulate the internal state of its target. Debuggers, such as GDB and DBX, use ptrace to obtain extensive control over the operation of its target, including manipulating its file descriptors, memory, and registers. Kernels include a ptrace kernel application programming interface (API) to allow the debugger to interact with the kernel.","Since conventional debuggers need to interact with the kernel to debug an application, these kernel-based debuggers have some limitations. For example, some embedded systems have the ptrace kernel API disabled due to very tight constraints imposed on the kernel, thus disallowing a debugger to interact with the kernel to debug an application in this environment. Also, since the ptrace kernel API has been around a long time, in some cases it is not well suited for the needs of modern debugging technologies.","Methods and systems for user-space probe debugging are described. In one embodiment, a computing system receives a request from a user interface to debug a target application. In response to the request, the computing system runs the target application in a debug mode with an attached debugger. The debugger is software code that has a shared library and is added to the target application's address space. The target application is run in the debug mode when the software code of the debugger is attached to the target application on start and is invoked before software code of the target application starts. The debugger and the target application appear as a single application in a user-space of the computing system. So the single application starts with running the debugger code first, giving the debugger full control over the target application. The debugger has access to application memory of the target application. The computing system receives a command to perform a debug operation on the target application, such as setting a breakpoint, reading the application memory, or the like. The debugger performs the debug operation on the target application without communicating with a kernel of the computing system, and outputs debug information after performing the debug operation. In one embodiment, the command is a set breakpoint command for which the debug application installs a user-space probe at a breakpoint in the target application. The user-space probe is configured to redirect an execution path of the target application from the breakpoint to the debugger when the breakpoint in the target application is reached. The debugger may generate a notification in response to the breakpoint being reached and may output an application state of the target application to a user interface. In one embodiment, the debugger communicates with the user interface using a remote serial protocol (RSP). Alternatively, other protocols may be used. The request to debug the target application and the command to perform debug operations may be received from a user via the user interface. Alternatively, the request to debug the target application and the command to perform debug operations may be received from other sources, such as another computer process. However, since the debugger is started when starting the application in the debug mode, the request to start the target application in the debug mode would not be received by the debugger from the user via the user interface using RSP. Rather, the user may send the request to start the target application in the debug mode using another interface as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure. Alternatively, the request to start the target application may be received from other sources, such as another application.","Embodiments of the present invention provide an improved system that allows user-space probe based debugging, instead of kernel based debugging. Operating systems usually segregate virtual memory into kernel space and user space. Kernel space is strictly reserved for running the kernel, kernel extensions, and most device drivers. User space is the memory area where all user mode applications run. Unlike conventional solutions that use ptrace kernel APIs or otherwise require access to the kernel-space, the embodiments described herein run a debugger in the user-space that uses user-space probes to set breakpoints and to access the application memory. A probe is application code that includes instructions placed in memory, each instruction being read and executed by the processing device. A breakpoint is a point in the application instructions where the debugger can stop at that point in order to examine the state of the application, such as the state of variables, state of registers, or the like. Setting a breakpoint using the user-space probe means that the instructions of the target application are replaced with the instructions of the user-space probe to redirect code flow (execution path) to the software code of the debugger. Once the user-space probe is executed, the debugger saves the machine state and runs its own software code, for example, to report the breakpoint to the user, receiving a new command to set another breakpoint, etc. Once the debugger is finished, the saved machine state is restored, and the replaced instruction of the target application is executed, and the code flow (execution path) is handed back to the target application where the code flow was diverted. The embodiments described herein may be used for debugging applications in embedded systems, where the ptrace kernel API is disabled. In other embodiments, the user-space probe debugging can be used in connection with, or in addition to, kernel-based debuggers. The embodiments described herein may be easier to use than the kernel-based debuggers, which are limited by the legacy ptrace kernel API. The embodiments described herein may be used in the Linux environment, as well as other environments, such as Unix-based environments, Windows environments, or the like, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. For example, the cygwin environment emulates the Linux environment, and thus, the embodiments could be used to run the user-space probe debugger in the Windows environment.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the embodiments of the present invention.","Some portions of the detailed description that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201creceiving,\u201d \u201cgenerating,\u201d \u201ccommunicating,\u201d \u201ccapturing,\u201d \u201cexecuting,\u201d \u201cdefining,\u201d \u201cspecifying,\u201d \u201ccreating,\u201d \u201crecreating,\u201d \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201cproviding,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d \u201cdisplaying,\u201d \u201cdetecting,\u201d \u201csending,\u201d \u201creceiving,\u201d or the like, refer to the actions and processes of a computing system, or similar electronic computing systems, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computing system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system memories or registers or other such information storage, trans-mission or display devices.","Embodiments of the present invention also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computing system specifically programmed by a computer program stored in the computing system. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer-readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","100","104","108","103","104","104","120","110","120","121","110","110","120","104","110","120","112","110","108","103"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, the user-space probe debugger  is depicted as software executed on the computing system . In another embodiment, the user-space probe debugger  may be a dedicated machine, or may one of various processes being performed by the computing system . The operations of the user-space probe debugger  are described in more detail below with respect to . The computing system  may include a local user interface , such as a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), for allowing a user, such as a system administrator, to request the debugging of the target application , as well as to request other debug operations as described herein.","The computing system  may include one or more data stores (not shown). The data stores can be one or more centralized data repositories that store application data, system data, configuration data, or the like. The data stores may be local or remote data stores and may be single or multiple data structures (databases, repositories, files, etc.) residing on one or more mass storage devices, such as magnetic or optical storage based disks, tapes or hard drives.","The remote computing system  may be one or more machines, including a desktop computer, laptop computer, server, cellular phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), etc. The remote computing system  may also be a server machine as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The remote computing system  interacts with the computing system  by exchanging messages via standard protocols, e.g., FTP and HTTP. In one embodiment, the remote computing system  communicates with the computing system  using RSP, as described herein. The remote computing system  include a remote user interface , such as a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), for allowing a user, such as a system administrator, to request the debugging of the target application, as well as requests other debug operations as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","210","222","210","210","222","210","222","210","210","222","210","222","204","204","222","222","210","222","210","222","222","210","222","210","210","210","210","210","110","112","222","210"]},"In the depicted embodiment, the user interface , which may be the remote user interface  of , is arranged via an RSP stub implementation. Thus, any interface that supports RSP may be used for interfacing with the user-space probe debugger . RSP is a protocol designed for remote debugging. For example, the user can run the debugger on a server B remotely from a remote location at server A, and communicate remotely with the debugger running on server B from server A. The communication between server A and server B is governed by RSP. If the user wants to setup a breakpoint on address 1234, server A side of the debugger creates an RSP message with \u201cSET BREAKPOINT AT ADDRESS 1234,\u201d and sends the message to the server B. The server B side of the debugger recognizes this RSP message and sets the breakpoint. RSP protocol specifies that server B should send the status of the operation. Thus, server B creates an RSP status message with \u201cBREAK SET CORRECTLY.\u201d Server A recognizes this message and informs the user that the breakpoint is set. In the depicted embodiment, the user-space probe debugger  is executed before the target application , and the user-space probe debugger  takes over the target application  when executed. The user-space probe debugger  suspends execution of the target application  until it is contacted by a user via the user interface  via the RSP protocol. The user then sets the breakpoint, by requesting, via RSP, that the user-space probe debugger  install a user-space probe  (described below) at a breakpoint  in the target application . The execution of the target application  is resumed, and when the breakpoint  is reached, the user-space probe debugger  suspends the target application , taking over execution of the target application  by redirecting the execution path to the user-space probe debugger  using the user-space probe . The user-space probe debugger  may contact the user via the user interface  via RSP about the breakpoint  being reached. The user may then analyze the application state at the breakpoint . This process can be repeated as needed by the user to debug the target application .","In the depicted embodiment, the user-space probe  redirects an execution path from the breakpoint  in the target application  to the user-space probe debugger . In one embodiment, the user-space probe  uses a user-space port of a kernel-space probe (kprobe). For example, the kprobes port used by gelf is called \u2018usprobe\u2019 and it implements the optimized kprobes (djprobes) for user-space usage. It should be noted that usprobe should not be confused with the IBM uprobes project. In short, kprobes allows the kernel to put a probe on nearly every memory space and have user defined callbacks called when the memory location of the kprobe is reached. The kprobes work by putting breakpoint instruction on the probe address, and handling the exception accordingly. Just recently the kprobes were enhanced with optimized probes, which allow probing the kernel without using the breakpoint instruction and exception handling. The optimized probes work simply by overwriting the probe memory by relative jump to the software code in the debugger. The software codes saves the application state, including the saved instructions, and after performing the debug operation, resumesresumes the normal execution of the target application with the saved state. The user-space probe  calls the user-space probe debugger  when the memory location of the breakpoint  is reached. Using the user-space probes, the user-space probe debugger  can suspend and resume execution of the target application  without communicating with the kernel to suspend and resume execution.","It should be noted that the embodiments of user-space probe based debugging allows a debugger to run without kernel-space support (e.g., kernal ptrace support) to interact with the kernel. In the embodiments described herein, the user-space probe debugger  does not communicate, or otherwise interact, with the kernel of the computing system for purposes of debugging. Since the target application  and the user-space probe debugger  appear as the single application , the kernel does not know the target application  is being debugged by the user-space probe debugger . It should also be noted that once the execution is within the user-space probe debugger , the user-space probe debugger  communicates with the user interface  via RSP described below. Alternatively, the user-space probe debugger  can communicate with the user interface using other protocols as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.","As described above, in one embodiment, the user-space probe debugger  communicates with the user interface  via RSP. RSP comes from the GNU Debugger project, called GDB. GDB is the standard debugger for the GNU software system. It is a portable debugger that runs on various operating systems and provides facilities for tracing and altering the execution of computer programs. The user can monitor and modify the values of programs' internal variables, and even call functions independently of the programs' normal behavior. GDB also offer a remote mode, often used when debugging embedded systems, in which the GDB operations are run on one machine (e.g., remote computing system ), and the application being debugged is run on another machine (e.g., computing system ). In this case, the GDB communicates with a remote \u201cstub\u201d which understands the GDB protocol via serial, TCP\/IP, or other transport protocols. The stub may implement the target-side of the communication protocol. In one embodiment, the user-space probe debugger  is the remote stub that communicates with a remote debugger (e.g., GDB) running on a remote machine. In this manner, the GDB can control the debugging user interface remotely using the user-space probe debugger . In another embodiment, the user-space probe debugger  is the debugger itself (e.g., includes the code for debugging the target application), and provides the user interface to the user on the remote machine or on a local machine as described herein. It should be noted that the user-side of the debugger could be on any type of machine, such as, for example, a machine running the Windows operating system, so long as the machine can communicate using the user interface described herein (e.g., can communicate via RSP).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","120","300","222","300","104","108","300"]},"Referring to , processing logic begins with determining if a debug request to debug a target application is received from a user via a user interface (block ).

The debugger has access to application memory of the target application. Next, at block , the processing logic waits to receive a command from the user via the user interface to perform a debug operation on the target application. When the processing logic receives the command at block , the processing logic performs the debug operation on the target application (block ). The processing logic performs the debug operation without communicating with a kernel of the computing system. After performing the debug operation at block , the processing logic outputs debug information to the user via the user interface (block ). The debugging information may include some or all of the contents of the application memory, the application state, or other information that may be used for debugging. Next, processing logic determines if the end of the target application is reached (block ). If not, the processing logic returns to decision block  to see if an additional command is received from the user via the user interface. Otherwise, the processing logic ends the method .","In one embodiment, the debug operation is a set breakpoint command, as described below with respect to .
